Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week, childhood game store Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy proceedings, and in its wake, our next retail savior will be KB Toys?

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Apparently, retail toy stores are still viable, so stay tuned for this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, March 18th, 2017 with episode number 723 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my pals, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Sup?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi, welcome back.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.500
Hi.

00:56.500 --> 01:05.500
And thank you, by the way. DarkSakura actually did the very brave task of setting foot in a Walmart to help me expand my collection I have growing over here.

01:05.500 --> 01:13.500
I say over here like it's a video show, but I have a growing collection over here of classic video games and drag queens.

01:13.500 --> 01:21.500
And I say that because I have stacked side by side some arcade minis. I guess there's this, I think that's what they're actually called, arcade minis.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.500
Arcade classics.

01:23.500 --> 01:30.500
Yeah, arcade classics. And they're like, I have Joust, Rampage, Centipede, Frogger. So you actually found these at a Walmart and texted me.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.500
Apparently you're missing quite a few because they are numbered.

01:32.500 --> 01:38.500
They are numbered, but some of them are not as good. Here's the thing, 1 and 2 were like a different screen and they're terrible.

01:38.500 --> 01:45.500
Number 5 is a redo of Pac-Man, which was number 1, I think, that uses the nicer screen. So I think that's the one I'm actually missing.

01:45.500 --> 01:49.500
I don't know that the Pac-Man has the nicer screen though. I think it's still not the LCD.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.500
Yeah.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.500
Because these are all LCD screens.

01:51.500 --> 01:56.500
Yeah. And then Asteroids is also missing, but Asteroids also has a crappy screen.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.500
It does.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.500
So these are just the good machines.

01:59.500 --> 02:05.500
And we started off that Dan had gone to a bunch of different Walmarts to look for them and I stopped by the one that just happens to be on the way home.

02:05.500 --> 02:09.500
And they had everything. So I got them before the show.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.500
Yeah.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.500
I came here, you wanted them, so I went back and got some.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.500
Thank you.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.500
You're welcome.

02:15.500 --> 02:23.500
But this time, we talked about that on the last show that I was here, and I was like, I wonder if that same one that no one goes to has it.

02:23.500 --> 02:31.500
So I said, hey, if I find them, do you want them? And you're like, yes. And we already had one of the ones, so I only bought the two that we were missing.

02:31.500 --> 02:35.500
And then I bought you the three that you didn't have. So.

02:35.500 --> 02:42.500
Yeah. So I may, if I can find them online or something for a reasonable price. I ain't paying scalpel prices.

02:42.500 --> 02:46.500
I may get the Pac-Man and the Asteroids just to be a completionist.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.500
If you just go to the Folsom one, they have them all sitting there. No one buys them there.

02:50.500 --> 02:55.500
The first two are crap. I actually know somebody who has the Pac-Man, the original number one.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.500
It looks like a Game & Watch game.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.500
Yeah.

02:58.500 --> 03:03.500
The screen's completely different. So they're not very good. But ever since they switched these color LCDs, they look really nice.

03:03.500 --> 03:14.500
Oh, and by the way, you might wonder why I said classic games and drag queens, because on top of the boxes for the classic games, I have the Funko for RuPaul, Alaska, Thunderfun, and Trixie Mattel.

03:14.500 --> 03:20.500
Which are so far the only drag queen Funkos that I know of until they inevitably release a Bianca Del Rio one, I'm sure.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.500
An Itakatia and a Bendelacrum.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.500
And I hope a Peppermint, because I just love Peppermint.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.500
And a Shangela. I love Shangela.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.500
Oh, no, wait till we get to the FUs of the week later this year.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.500
Yeah.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
All right, anyway, so welcome back to our soccer. We missed you last week.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.500
Thank you.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.500
And of course, you've already been hearing Techmaster Loki joining us, as he always does.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.500
Hello.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.500
Hi, how are you?

03:42.500 --> 03:43.500
I'm fine.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.500
Yeah, how's that?

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
I wish I hadn't eaten that pizza, though.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
Oh, well, yeah, you brought like a $5 pizza to the show, right?

03:47.500 --> 03:48.500
Yeah, you can taste the $5.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.500
Yeah, I was like, you get what you pay for.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.500
You get what you pay for.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.500
You get what you pay for.

03:52.500 --> 03:58.500
I needed something to eat, because if I got like, you know, one of my low calorie things, I haven't eaten much today at all.

03:58.500 --> 04:04.500
So I was like behind by like 1,500 calories. Yeah, I went through that 1,500 calories really fast.

04:04.500 --> 04:12.500
Anyway, I want to say hi to our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.500
vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

04:15.500 --> 04:19.500
And I do want to acknowledge, because there's a lot of people in chat complaining about the constant drops.

04:19.500 --> 04:25.500
Unfortunately, this was happening during the Bobby Blackwell show as well, so this is not something we can control on our end.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.500
This is something that's happening with our hosting end.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.500
And I don't know about you guys, I'm getting a little sick of this, and I know Bobby is too.

04:31.500 --> 04:36.500
And all I can say for right now is we do have a plan that we are going to be changing this up.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.500
We're not going to be sticking with this provider long term, because this has been going on.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.500
We've just been having these weird problems way too long.

04:43.500 --> 04:48.500
So I can't say anything else about that right now, but I just will say I'm acknowledging that frustration.

04:49.500 --> 04:55.500
We have to continue to push forward for the sake of the recording, because we have a lot of people that listen to this on the podcast feed.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.500
So it would sound really terrible if I kept stopping every five seconds.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
Oh, it's stream dropped. Oh, it's stream dropped.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.500
So we are going to push through.

05:01.500 --> 05:06.500
But I do genuinely feel bad, because I know you guys take time out of your schedule to be here on Sunday night.

05:06.500 --> 05:11.500
Although some of you multitask, you game, and you listen to the show, so I do really appreciate that.

05:11.500 --> 05:16.500
But yeah, we're not going to be here live for the next two weeks.

05:16.500 --> 05:22.500
So it really sucks that like our last week before we're on a two week break, this bullshit's going on.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.500
So it's really frustrating. Sorry guys.

05:24.500 --> 05:29.500
But yeah, as I've mentioned for a little while now, I will not be here next week.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.500
There's not going to be a live show or a podcast next week, because I'm going to be gone for too many days.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.500
I'm going to a wedding, so I will be gone for a little while.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
And I think you all know who it is at this point.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
So that is what's happening next week.

05:42.500 --> 05:49.500
And then in two weeks, because April 1st happens to be the same day as Easter, there's not going to be a live show that day,

05:49.500 --> 05:54.500
because my co-hosts both have family commitments that day, and that is no fun.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
Family?

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
Oh well.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
I'm doing drag queen stuff.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
Family.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.500
I'm going to see my sisters.

06:02.500 --> 06:07.500
To quote RuPaul, we as gay people, and that's the whole quilt bag, get to choose our families.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
You find your tribe.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.500
That's right.

06:09.500 --> 06:18.500
But no, for anyone who's in the area, I will be going to the Sisters in the Park for the Easter and the Hunky Jesus,

06:18.500 --> 06:21.500
and what's the other one, the Magnificent Mary or something.

06:21.500 --> 06:25.500
But yeah, it's not at Dolores Park this year though, but I'll be there.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
So come find me. I'll be the short one.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
Okay, cool.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
Because I'm short.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
So yeah, and that is no joke.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
With real boobs.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.500
But we are going to try.

06:32.500 --> 06:38.500
So the good news is, since that's just a day long thing, we are going to try to pre-record something in advance for that.

06:38.500 --> 06:43.500
So that way, at least the podcast won't go two weeks with no show, because I hate going that long without a show.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
You all know that.

06:44.500 --> 06:48.500
So anyway, I guess some people that are listening live are actually able to reconnect again.

06:48.500 --> 06:52.500
So because of the drops, they missed the whole apology of me going out of my way to say,

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
I'm sorry, the live stream keeps dropping.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.500
It's nothing we can do.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.500
It's our service provider, and we will be leaving that service provider this year.

07:00.500 --> 07:06.500
I can't say anything more at this point, but things and stuff.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
Alright, let's move on though.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.500
We're going to talk about our kickoff topic tonight.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
I'm going to throw it over to you, Loki.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
What's going on in our kickoff topic tonight?

07:15.500 --> 07:19.500
Okay, well we can talk about cross-play.

07:19.500 --> 07:25.500
And we're talking about not necessarily dressing up like the opposite gendered character.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
Although that's fun too.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.500
That's also fun.

07:27.500 --> 07:35.500
No, but we're talking about the whole drama with Sony and Microsoft playing nice so that you can be able to play games across platforms.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.500
Much like you can do with Nintendo and stuff like that and PC.

07:38.500 --> 07:46.500
So Microsoft, they're interested, of course, in getting Fortnite to play well with the PlayStation 4 as well.

07:46.500 --> 07:51.500
And of course, Epic Games, the company that makes it as well, is also interested in that.

07:51.500 --> 07:58.500
So basically, one of the fans of Fortnite tweeted, saying,

07:58.500 --> 08:04.500
I wanted to ask, can Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players play together in Fortnite?

08:04.500 --> 08:08.500
We really want cross-play system between Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

08:08.500 --> 08:13.500
And Phil Spencer of Microsoft replied saying, yeah, me too.

08:13.500 --> 08:17.500
And the Fortnite account said, yeah, we three.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.500
And Sony said nothing.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.500
Because they've been reluctant to do cross-play.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.500
As long as they've been in the lead, they don't have to.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.500
Or they feel they don't have to.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.500
Right.

08:29.500 --> 08:33.500
So basically, kind of stating what's already known,

08:33.500 --> 08:39.500
we've worked closely before with Nintendo to allow cross-play network on the Xbox One and the Switch.

08:39.500 --> 08:44.500
And offered to do the same for PlayStation 4 players, still holds.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.500
But right now, it's kind of in Sony's court.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.500
And let's be clear, cross-play is not a technical issue.

08:50.500 --> 08:56.500
Cross-play has existed between Sony and Microsoft and PC ever since Final Fantasy XI.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
It's literally flipping a Switch.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.500
In fact, it was enabled accidentally for it, wasn't it?

09:04.500 --> 09:08.500
You're right, it was enabled accidentally for something that was Switch.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.500
Was it Fortnite?

09:09.500 --> 09:10.500
It was Rocket League, wasn't it?

09:10.500 --> 09:11.500
Rocket League, okay.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.500
I think it was Rocket League had it accidentally for a little bit.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.500
So I think, don't quote me on that.

09:14.500 --> 09:18.500
But yeah, this is not a technical issue whatsoever.

09:18.500 --> 09:24.500
Because again, Final Fantasy XI, Microsoft was desperate to get Square Enix on their platform

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
when they were releasing the Xbox 360.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.500
So they took on Final Fantasy XI because Square wanted more subscribers, right?

09:30.500 --> 09:34.500
So Sony already had Final Fantasy XI up and running on the PlayStation 2,

09:34.500 --> 09:38.500
which had already been cross-played with the PC people, which was a big deal.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.500
In fact, probably more people were playing Final Fantasy XI on PC in the US,

09:41.500 --> 09:46.500
although Japan had a huge install base on the PS2 in Japan.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
And then the Xbox 360 came out.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
I don't think Final Fantasy XI ever really caught fire there,

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
but there were certainly people that were playing it there.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.500
Just like, there were people playing it on PS2 in the US,

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
but most people were kind of here or there.

09:56.500 --> 10:02.500
Obviously, that is no longer because they decided to close the PS2 and the 360 versions.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.500
Final Fantasy XI only exists on PC now.

10:05.500 --> 10:11.500
But anyway, so long story short, again, these games are able to be cross-played

10:11.500 --> 10:15.500
if they want to do it with minimal difficulty.

10:15.500 --> 10:19.500
I mean, I'm sure the programming has to be changed around to be able to talk to PlayStation.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.500
From what I hear, it's just, it's basically flipping a switch.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
Yeah, it's not hard. It's not hard.

10:23.500 --> 10:29.500
So, let me ask this. How important is it for people to be able to play together?

10:29.500 --> 10:37.500
Like, is there a good reason why maybe there shouldn't be cross-play in a game?

10:37.500 --> 10:41.500
I think it would just help with keeping the game's numbers up and everything,

10:41.500 --> 10:44.500
so you don't have the fragmentation between platforms.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.500
Especially with something like, say, you're playing Overwatch.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.500
It's like, okay, well, which system do I get it for?

10:50.500 --> 10:52.500
Because I have friends that are playing on Xbox.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.500
I have friends that are playing on PlayStation.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
I have friends that are playing on PC.

10:56.500 --> 11:01.500
I guess I buy it three times, but then your progression isn't really carried between them.

11:01.500 --> 11:05.500
So, it would just be nice to be able to have that simpler.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.500
But companies aren't necessarily interested.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.500
That's something I'm going through personally, too, with Overwatch,

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
because I do play a lot of Overwatch, and it does suck,

11:13.500 --> 11:17.500
because I have to have a PlayStation 4 version and a PC version

11:17.500 --> 11:20.500
so I can play with my friend groups on both systems.

11:20.500 --> 11:24.500
Now, there's still other people I know that play on Xbox One,

11:24.500 --> 11:28.500
and it's like I just really don't get to play with them until the free weekend.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.500
Usually when Overwatch does a free weekend, then I'll go to Xbox One for that weekend.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.500
I understand. They're thinking, well, if we give them ground on this,

11:35.500 --> 11:37.500
then people don't need to buy a PlayStation 4,

11:37.500 --> 11:41.500
because they can just buy an Xbox or whatever and play there.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.500
But my thing is, well, then, that same can be said for the Xbox One.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.500
Oh, I don't need to buy an Xbox One, because I can have a PlayStation 4 and do that.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.500
So it really comes down to what else is driving people to your platform.

11:52.500 --> 11:58.500
And if you feel like your platform isn't worthy enough to garner those sales,

11:58.500 --> 12:01.500
even though you're allowing this for certain games.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.500
I mean, it's not going to be a ton of games. It's just a few games.

12:04.500 --> 12:08.500
That seems a little petty, that you're just like, oh, well,

12:08.500 --> 12:11.500
we're not very confident in our platform, so we're going to hold this.

12:11.500 --> 12:16.500
Or the most transparent excuses I've heard are the ones about

12:16.500 --> 12:20.500
they can't control the users on the other people's platform type of thing.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
You remember that excuse?

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
You can't control the users on your own platform. What are you talking about?

12:23.500 --> 12:25.500
Yeah, that is the most transparent excuse.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
I think control and users are two words that don't go great together.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.500
Yeah, like none of the platforms, none of them,

12:32.500 --> 12:35.500
have been able to successfully control their user base.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.500
There are toxic people on all of those platforms.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.500
That excuse is bullshit, and we all see right through it, so drop it.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.500
What we need to do is we need to have Steven Spielberg come in

12:44.500 --> 12:48.500
and tell them to play nice, because that's how they got so many of the pop culture stuff.

12:48.500 --> 12:53.500
They got fucking Star Wars shit in there, playing with fucking Warner Brothers

12:53.500 --> 12:56.500
and Universal and all this shit together.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.500
Because everybody wants a piece of Steven Spielberg.

12:59.500 --> 13:05.500
Exactly. So Steven Spielberg has to say, hey, guys need to do some cross play here.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.500
And they'd be like, okay, fine.

13:07.500 --> 13:13.500
Maybe Steven Spielberg needs to offer to direct an Overwatch movie, but on one condition.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
Well, here's the thing with Overwatch. Here's the other thing.

13:15.500 --> 13:21.500
This is probably in the whole cross play disabling and the whole type of argument.

13:21.500 --> 13:26.500
This is one of the few like, okay, that might be a good reason to disable cross play.

13:26.500 --> 13:31.500
Is that with Overwatch, one of the reasons why Blizzard has said they do not have cross play

13:31.500 --> 13:37.500
between PC and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is because PC has keyboard and mouse,

13:37.500 --> 13:40.500
and the consoles have the controllers.

13:40.500 --> 13:45.500
Now, there's a part of me that thinks they ought to just allow keyboard and mouse support on the consoles.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
They could. It's just USB.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
They could, but they would not.

13:49.500 --> 13:54.500
But, well, Blizzard, I mean, I understand the keyboard and mouse are optional,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
and so they're going to cost more money and so forth.

13:56.500 --> 14:00.500
Blizzard really seems to think that keyboard and mouse is going to have a huge advantage

14:00.500 --> 14:03.500
over people playing on console.

14:03.500 --> 14:07.500
I bet some console people would beg to differ, but that is the line they're sticking to.

14:07.500 --> 14:12.500
Well, that's fine, and it's split up between controller and keyboard and mouse.

14:12.500 --> 14:16.500
Did you know some things are balanced differently because Blizzard believes so strongly in this?

14:16.500 --> 14:22.500
Like the turrets that Symmetra and Torbjorn use, they are actually weaker on a,

14:22.500 --> 14:30.500
I think on the PC they're weaker versus the consoles because the thought is you can aim better on the PCs

14:30.500 --> 14:33.500
because it's mouse and keyboard than you can on the consoles.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.500
So the auto aim assists too much.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.500
Maybe it's the other way around. I don't remember what it is, but I know they're balanced differently

14:39.500 --> 14:42.500
because they feel that the aiming is stronger on PC,

14:42.500 --> 14:48.500
and so they don't want the turrets and all that doing all the work for you, basically.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.500
Because, especially when the game first came out,

14:51.500 --> 14:55.500
Torbjorn felt really overpowered because his turret would murder everybody

14:55.500 --> 14:58.500
if you didn't know how to kill it, basically.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.500
So.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.500
Anyway.

15:03.500 --> 15:11.500
So, any other reasons you guys can think of why maybe a console or a game maker should

15:11.500 --> 15:15.500
consider keeping crossplay separate between the two platforms?

15:15.500 --> 15:17.500
No.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
Not really, not logically.

15:19.500 --> 15:23.500
I just think that they're just going to hold off on it until their system isn't doing as well.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
And that's unfortunate.

15:25.500 --> 15:29.500
And honestly though, after seeing how this generation has kind of played out with

15:29.500 --> 15:32.500
some of the backwards compatibility and mod support and stuff like that,

15:32.500 --> 15:35.500
yeah, if I had to do it again, I'd probably just pick up an Xbox One.

15:35.500 --> 15:40.500
Because it is disappointing to see that, oh, we're not willing to play ball with a ton of things.

15:40.500 --> 15:45.500
And I think what it is, is they were worried so much about that hack back then

15:45.500 --> 15:48.500
that they were just like, oh, we can't open ourselves up to anything.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.500
Whether it be potential for hacks through mods,

15:52.500 --> 15:56.500
or the potential for some sort of drama with

15:56.500 --> 16:00.500
people being unregulated on chat or something like that.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.500
I don't know what the case is, but they're making a lot of excuses and not doing anything.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.500
And also backwards compatibility. Come on, where the fuck is that shit?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
You know what's really fascinating to me?

16:09.500 --> 16:14.500
You know where I never hear of cross-platform multiplayer being an issue?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.500
Is in the cell phone universe.

16:16.500 --> 16:22.500
Can you imagine if iPhone and Android went to that type of battle

16:22.500 --> 16:26.500
where the separate platforms had to be on separate services or whatever?

16:26.500 --> 16:33.500
Can you imagine iPhone Ingress and Android Ingress being completely separate games and separate universes?

16:33.500 --> 16:35.500
That would be really interesting, actually.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.500
But can you imagine them being separate universes?

16:37.500 --> 16:41.500
Or Pokemon Go, to use a much bigger game that so many people have been playing.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.500
Can you imagine if those games were not...

16:43.500 --> 16:47.500
If you wanted to do a raid, you could only raid with other iPhone people.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
Or if you're Android, you could only raid with other...

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
Can you imagine?

16:50.500 --> 16:53.500
That's just one of those things. It's just not even an issue in the cell phone universe.

16:53.500 --> 16:57.500
That's how we'll split the teams. iPhone versus Android.

16:57.500 --> 17:02.500
But is that also because in the cell phone universe, usually those companies are the ones running the server.

17:02.500 --> 17:08.500
Whereas in the console world, you have PlayStation Network, you have Nintendo's network, you have Xbox Live.

17:08.500 --> 17:13.500
There is a type of infrastructure that the console manufacturers are running.

17:13.500 --> 17:18.500
Isn't it amazing that those servers are able to run those and not charge a thing for them?

17:18.500 --> 17:24.500
It's so weird. It's like a global server that millions of people use and it doesn't cost them...

17:24.500 --> 17:27.500
It doesn't cost the users money.

17:27.500 --> 17:34.500
It's so weird that that only exists on consoles and not the PC or mobile space.

17:34.500 --> 17:40.500
I'm telling you, the big move, the big put-it-out-on-the-table move is gonna be...

17:40.500 --> 17:44.500
And I've been saying this for years. I think Microsoft, one of these days, is gonna bend.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.500
They're gonna drop the fee for Xbox Live for multiplayer.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.500
And I think that's gonna be their big power move over Sony.

17:50.500 --> 17:55.500
In fact, you know what? I'm gonna be real bold. That's my E3 prediction this year.

17:55.500 --> 17:59.500
No, they're not. Because these companies are getting greedier every possible way.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
They're not gonna drop off money.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.500
Microsoft can afford to make a power play.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
They're gonna add another service.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.500
You know why? Because of a story that's coming up later in the show.

18:07.500 --> 18:08.500
That's gonna be the new Xbox Live.

18:08.500 --> 18:12.500
They're gonna add another service that they're gonna charge more money for on top of that.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.500
I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.500
I don't think I agree. I don't think I agree.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
I'm sticking with that. I think Microsoft...

18:18.500 --> 18:22.500
If they really want to make people's heads turn and start something in this war,

18:22.500 --> 18:24.500
Microsoft's gonna drop the fee for multiplayer.

18:24.500 --> 18:28.500
They can still keep Xbox Live for their discounts and their free games

18:28.500 --> 18:31.500
and all that other stuff that they do with Xbox Gold.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.500
But I think, as far as multiplayer goes,

18:33.500 --> 18:36.500
Microsoft would be doing something really stinking bold

18:36.500 --> 18:37.500
if they said,

18:37.500 --> 18:42.500
A, cross-play between Windows and Microsoft will never be an issue,

18:42.500 --> 18:43.500
and B, it's free.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.500
Can you imagine the fan reaction?

18:45.500 --> 18:48.500
Multiplayer is the way it should be. Free.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
It would be very positive.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.500
It would just be another feather in their cap, I guess.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.500
And more power to them.

18:56.500 --> 19:00.500
Because honestly, they seem to be listening to the fans more than Sony has.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.500
But Sony, I mean, Sony has that power position of

19:04.500 --> 19:08.500
they've got the exclusives, they've got the library, they've got...

19:08.500 --> 19:12.500
Yeah, but you know what? The more and more I look at some of their exclusives,

19:12.500 --> 19:16.500
I was all gung-ho about fucking some of their games that are coming out,

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
and it's just like,

19:17.500 --> 19:20.500
Ehh, they weren't that great when they came out.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
Even Shadow of the Colossus and stuff,

19:22.500 --> 19:24.500
I don't really necessarily need something like that.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.500
I don't play the Uncharted series, I can't give a shit about that.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.500
I think Sony just has to be cautious with that.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.500
I mean, right now we're seeing them be a little bold.

19:34.500 --> 19:38.500
And if they want to do some dick moves with things like Fortnite and stuff

19:38.500 --> 19:39.500
where they're kind of in control,

19:39.500 --> 19:43.500
that's business, sometimes it sucks for us, that's just the way it goes.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.500
You can't go to Burger King and order a McWhopper,

19:46.500 --> 19:47.500
or a Mc...

19:47.500 --> 19:48.500
Here's the thing.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.500
A Mc... whatever, Big Double.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.500
Can you tell how often I eat fast food?

19:51.500 --> 19:54.500
Console games and console rules are,

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
most games really anyway,

19:56.500 --> 20:00.500
are kind of unregulated for business practice.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.500
So when you have an unregulated company,

20:03.500 --> 20:07.500
they will do whatever they can do to make that bottom line.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.500
To make the dollar.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.500
Or the yen or whatever, the Krugerrand.

20:11.500 --> 20:19.500
But at the end, I mean, it is an unregulated ecosystem.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.500
They can charge whatever they want to.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.500
For what they charge, they've got certain regulations on it.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.500
But they can do whatever they want to within that ecosystem.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.500
If they want to make it cross-platform, they can do that.

20:31.500 --> 20:35.500
If they want to charge you X amount of dollars to use their service

20:36.500 --> 20:39.500
so that you can then play what would otherwise be a free multiplayer,

20:39.500 --> 20:41.500
right now, there's nothing to stop them.

20:41.500 --> 20:45.500
And consumers will keep paying them because they want to do this.

20:45.500 --> 20:49.500
Well, but that also, if Sony gets over-confident,

20:49.500 --> 20:50.500
that's going to do them in.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.500
And I'm just going to point to,

20:51.500 --> 20:56.500
if you want to see the biggest example of an industry being over...

20:56.500 --> 20:59.500
or a company being over-confident, not listening to their fans,

20:59.500 --> 21:02.500
and it ultimately backfired on them,

21:02.500 --> 21:05.500
go back to Microsoft's original unveiling of the Xbox One,

21:05.500 --> 21:07.500
where Microsoft basically said,

21:07.500 --> 21:11.500
we're going to change the way that you play video games at home.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.500
And the response of the user base was, the fuck you are.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
And that was that. Remember, guys?

21:18.500 --> 21:22.500
Remember how the disks were going to be only on your console?

21:22.500 --> 21:24.500
And actually, it's funny, now all these years later

21:24.500 --> 21:27.500
that we're hearing more about how that was really going to work,

21:27.500 --> 21:30.500
I think you hear more people interested in that.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.500
And as more and more people are going towards a completely digital library,

21:33.500 --> 21:38.500
I almost feel like maybe Microsoft was just two years too early

21:38.500 --> 21:39.500
in a lot of their ideas.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.500
I don't know, it's really difficult to say.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.500
But at that time, Microsoft wanted to take the wheel

21:44.500 --> 21:46.500
and flip it in another direction,

21:46.500 --> 21:49.500
and the consumers ultimately spoke up and said,

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
fuck a whole lot of you.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.500
What do you offer?

21:53.500 --> 21:57.500
And then Sony was able to come out at E3 and basically say,

21:57.500 --> 21:59.500
so, we've heard what you said.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.500
You don't want this, you don't want this.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.500
So guess what?

22:02.500 --> 22:05.500
Here's how you share a game with a friend.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.500
Hand the disk over.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.500
What? $499 is too much because you don't want to connect?

22:09.500 --> 22:10.500
Okay, $399.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.500
And the entire internet has a collective orgasm over Sony

22:14.500 --> 22:16.500
that Sony can even slip in.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.500
By the way, we're going to start charging for multiplayer.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.500
We didn't do that before.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.500
And nobody fucking batted an eye.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
Now here's the one catch.

22:25.500 --> 22:29.500
Had this been something for the NES or the GameCube even,

22:29.500 --> 22:32.500
you know, I'd say in the game consoles

22:32.500 --> 22:35.500
that were pre the advent of social media,

22:35.500 --> 22:39.500
and it was that they were always locked that way.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
No one would have had a problem with it

22:41.500 --> 22:43.500
because that's the way it's always been done.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
And people get, though, caught up.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
They don't see where, you know,

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
yeah, maybe it was something that would have been better

22:49.500 --> 22:51.500
for, you know, those companies,

22:51.500 --> 22:54.500
but any time any type of change is introduced, though,

22:54.500 --> 22:57.500
that is an obvious change like that

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
to the status quo that people are going to resist.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.500
You know, we have those people at work, right?

23:01.500 --> 23:04.500
And you've shown them how to do something a new, better way.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
But the old way works.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.500
The old way is inefficient.

23:09.500 --> 23:13.500
Remember what I do for a living, and yes, I know this very well.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.500
I know.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.500
But, like, you know,

23:16.500 --> 23:18.500
oh, we've already done it this way. It works.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.500
Yeah, and the old way will take you ten times as long

23:21.500 --> 23:24.500
and cut your efficiency, you know,

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
but people want to do it the old way.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
The same thing goes a lot with gamers.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.500
We have created an automation tool that will do the work for you,

23:31.500 --> 23:33.500
but this works.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.500
I don't want to use Excel. It's scary.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.500
That's what happens.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.500
Anyway, I want to go to a comment from chat

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
over at live.vognetwork.com.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.500
Kaijuto says, Sony won't get overconfident.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.500
They've been in the game business, the PlayStation 1.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.500
They know what they're doing.

23:49.500 --> 23:52.500
Kaijuto, my friend, you're forgetting something.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.500
It's been a long time since the PS1.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
I got three words for you.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.500
Giant enemy crabs.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.500
Sony's been there, too.

24:00.500 --> 24:01.500
How soon they forget.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.500
How soon we all forget.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.500
I think we've pointed this out before, too,

24:05.500 --> 24:09.500
is that there's been this interesting kind of ping-pong that's gone

24:09.500 --> 24:12.500
where, you know, the last generation with the 360 and the PS3,

24:12.500 --> 24:15.500
Microsoft really dominated that conversation

24:15.500 --> 24:17.500
because the PlayStation 3 was simply too expensive

24:17.500 --> 24:19.500
and it really kind of stumbled out the gate.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
You know, Sony, I think, eventually caught up

24:21.500 --> 24:23.500
when they started putting out more stuff like LittleBigPlanet

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
and they, you know, they made some moves to really get

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
where they needed to be with the PlayStation 3,

24:27.500 --> 24:29.500
which helped them with launching the PlayStation 4.

24:29.500 --> 24:33.500
So, I mean, to the comment's credit and to Sony's credit,

24:33.500 --> 24:38.500
they knew they were flopping and they corrected course really fast.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.500
And Microsoft, to be fair to them,

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
they've really, really worked hard to correct course

24:43.500 --> 24:45.500
ever since that original Xbox One unveil.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.500
You know, they flipped out the guy in charge.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.500
That was a big move right there.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.500
That was something Sony never really did.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.500
But anyway, let's see.

24:54.500 --> 24:58.500
Going to our chat over at live.vognet.com,

24:58.500 --> 25:01.500
Azet says, oh, fuck, I'm surrounded by those people

25:01.500 --> 25:03.500
talking about our conversation at work there.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.500
And Kaijuto says, what, Krabs?

25:06.500 --> 25:08.500
I have no idea what that is. Like, for real.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.500
You may have, you may have, I don't know, maybe you,

25:10.500 --> 25:14.500
I sometimes forget that like 2006 was like over 10 years ago.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.500
So, and some of our listeners are in their lower 20s.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.500
So they may actually forget this stuff.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.500
But yeah, when Microsoft or when Sony originally-

25:21.500 --> 25:25.500
Just go watch the 2006 E3 press conference.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.500
Nutshell. Game about feudal Japan with giant enemy Krabs.

25:28.500 --> 25:32.500
Yeah. And they went in this whole spiel about the historical accuracy

25:32.500 --> 25:34.500
and all of a sudden they're fighting a giant enemy Krab.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.500
It was just, and it wasn't, it wasn't just that,

25:37.500 --> 25:43.500
but like it, that kind of just put a whole thing on like how out of touch the message was.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.500
And you know what? Nintendo has had floppy threes too.

25:46.500 --> 25:51.500
So no company is immune from, you know, trying to-

25:51.500 --> 25:55.500
How about the Wii Vitality sensor? Anybody? Anybody?

25:55.500 --> 25:57.500
Vapor. Anybody? Yeah.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.500
Vapor. What about Wii Music?

25:59.500 --> 26:01.500
Yeah. Anybody? So, I mean-

26:01.500 --> 26:03.500
Oh, Wii Music I would have been happy for though.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.500
Well, Wii Music happened.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.500
No, but I meant like-

26:07.500 --> 26:09.500
I was going to say the fact that you may have not been aware.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.500
No. It actually did come out.

26:11.500 --> 26:15.500
No, I mean like the way that we thought it was gonna, you know?

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
Yeah. No, I got you. I got you.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.500
Cause Bobby does back you up in chat there.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.500
Wii Music came out and it sucked.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.500
Yeah. So there it is. Anyway.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.500
All right. I want to talk about one other thing before we get into our gaming weeks.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.500
It's not officially on the show roll, but I know people are talking about this.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.500
I saw a chat comment earlier talking about the new Tomb Raider movie.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.500
And I know the reviews are kind of-

26:35.500 --> 26:37.500
Well, I didn't see it. Loki didn't see it.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.500
But- I saw it last night.

26:39.500 --> 26:43.500
You saw it. So tell it. Give us in a nutshell your hot take on Tomb Raider the new movie.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.500
I think that the beginning had a little bit too much exposition.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.500
You know, with Lara's reasoning or whatever.

26:49.500 --> 26:52.500
The actress that played Lara was really good. I liked her a lot.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.500
She's an Oscar winning actress if I remember right.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.500
I guess.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.500
I think she is. She won for-

26:59.500 --> 27:01.500
The Danish Girl? Was it called?

27:01.500 --> 27:03.500
I don't remember. But anyway, it was a couple years ago.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.500
You know, she-

27:05.500 --> 27:11.500
She totally caught the essence of Lara Croft and the horrible, terrible, no good, very bad day.

27:11.500 --> 27:15.500
You know, that was the Tomb Raider game that this was based off of.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
Um, there were certain-

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
The action was pretty fun.

27:19.500 --> 27:23.500
There were certain scenes in it that I thought were, yeah, this belongs in a game and not in a movie.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.500
You know, like puzzle solving shit.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
I'm almost positive they probably-

27:27.500 --> 27:29.500
I haven't seen it, but in seeing some of the stills,

27:29.500 --> 27:33.500
it looks like they ripped a waterfall sequence like right out of the game.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.500
If I'm not mistaken.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
With the giant plane?

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
Yes, there was a plane. Yep, in the game there was like a plane.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.500
Yeah, so they probably ripped that.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.500
It was pretty- I don't think it was exactly the same, but-

27:43.500 --> 27:45.500
Well, sure.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.500
Yeah.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.500
But at least they tried to make that, I guess, as plausible as possible.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.500
But yeah, there was the boat scene.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
I mean, they pulled a bunch out of it.

27:53.500 --> 27:59.500
And the other thing that for me, given just that I've tried to study as much, you know-

27:59.500 --> 28:01.500
I love studying cultural mythology.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.500
And the fact that they took a-

28:03.500 --> 28:13.500
Someone who was supposedly a real empress in ancient Japan and made some bullshit story about her.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.500
That actually there was no myth at all.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.500
They just made it up.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.500
Like that.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.500
And that was the part that I couldn't suspend my disbelief over.

28:21.500 --> 28:25.500
So you were more like, they should have just made up a fake empress or something?

28:25.500 --> 28:27.500
The intellectual has no place in this movie.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.500
They could have just used the childlike empress.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
How do you feel about Pocahontas by Disney?

28:31.500 --> 28:33.500
You know, I've never seen Pocahontas.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.500
Really?

28:35.500 --> 28:37.500
And I don't want to see it because, again-

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
Because of this reason.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
She never married fucking John Smith.

28:41.500 --> 28:45.500
She married some other white guy who took her to Europe and she died of pneumonia.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.500
Hold up, hold up.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.500
Disney's gonna make Pocahontas live action too?

28:49.500 --> 28:50.500
Yes.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.500
Is nothing sacred anymore?

28:52.500 --> 28:54.500
Is Disney doing every single fucking 90s movie?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
They've run out of ideas.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
Jesus Christ.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
Little Mermaid, are they doing that too?

29:00.500 --> 29:02.500
No, but they have The Lion King and then they have Pocahontas.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.500
I know they're doing The Lion King, but here's the thing.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.500
Lion King has Beyonce.

29:06.500 --> 29:10.500
So like, how can it be bad?

29:10.500 --> 29:12.500
How can it be bad? Beyonce.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
Is she playing Nala?

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
Oh yeah.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.500
Cool, I'm down with that.

29:18.500 --> 29:32.500
In the end, it's not a movie for people who fucking know history or have any kind of experience in anthropology or know how on-site digs work either.

29:32.500 --> 29:36.500
There's just way too much that I really could not suspend my disbelief over.

29:36.500 --> 29:42.500
There was a really cool shot right at the end. There's nothing after the credits. That's not a spoiler.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.500
That's not a spoiler to say. Don't bother staying through the credits.

29:46.500 --> 29:54.500
You have a credit start, then it shows you the scene, and then Nick Frost is in it though.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.500
Oh, okay.

29:56.500 --> 30:04.500
You know who Nick Frost is. For those who don't, in Shaun of the Dead, he was the lazy friend.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.500
Yeah, the friend.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.500
The gorilla. The monkey.

30:08.500 --> 30:14.500
But anyway, the treat for me for that movie was seeing Nick Frost.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.500
I mean, seriously, because he's funny and I adore him.

30:16.500 --> 30:22.500
So at the end of the day, how many big boobies out of five since it is Tomb Raider after all?

30:22.500 --> 30:24.500
Well, they weren't pointy.

30:24.500 --> 30:32.500
Did you know, by the way, that some people are critical? This is just the internet. I don't know. Maybe I misread that it was the article from The Onion.

30:32.500 --> 30:40.500
So take this from A Great Assault. But there are some people critical that the actress did not have big enough breasts to play Lara Croft.

30:40.500 --> 30:54.500
And Dungeon Busters said it was a neat twist to the myth that they were pursuing, but while I like that angle to it, I still hated that they created a bullshit story to base the movie off of.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.500
The whole story was bullshit.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.500
So how many unrealistically big boobies out of five?

30:58.500 --> 31:00.500
I'd give it a two.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
Two boobies? Oh, perfect!

31:02.500 --> 31:06.500
A nice, perfectly formed pair of adequate boobs.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.500
Okay.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.500
Thank you, Dart. Thank you for playing along on my silly joke.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.500
You're welcome.

31:12.500 --> 31:16.500
That's okay, because Lara Croft is also in Ready Player One.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.500
You are not shutting up about that movie. Actually, when does that come out? That's like two weeks?

31:20.500 --> 31:22.500
Next week.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.500
It's a week from Thursday.

31:24.500 --> 31:30.500
Okay, so by the next OLR, we'll get to have your take on Ready Player One. Hopefully we've all seen it.

31:30.500 --> 31:34.500
Yes, I will have definitely seen it at least once.

31:34.500 --> 31:38.500
At least once, hopefully. And I hear that one's getting good reviews.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.500
Yes.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.500
That's rare.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.500
What if you see it and it's terra-bad?

31:44.500 --> 31:46.500
It's not. There's no way that it can be terra-bad.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.500
We'll see. Famous last words.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
To quote the Princess Bride, life is pain, Highness.

31:50.500 --> 31:54.500
They can just play that trailer, all the trailers, for just the whole two and a half hours.

31:54.500 --> 31:58.500
Anyone who tells you differently is selling something.

31:58.500 --> 32:04.500
Alright. Yeah, Tigerclaw points out it's got an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes.

32:04.500 --> 32:08.500
There's a lot of movies that get good ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and they're hot garbage.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.500
It's Spielberg.

32:10.500 --> 32:16.500
There's some Spielberg movies I don't like. It's a decent litmus test though, I will say that.

32:16.500 --> 32:22.500
For example, Lady Bird got like 99% and I love Lady Bird. You all know I love that movie.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.500
So there's a lot of movies on there that get really good reviews that I do like.

32:25.500 --> 32:31.500
But sometimes there's a bad movie that it's like, okay, but I like that movie because it was kind of bad.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.500
I like the books. Well, I like Xanadu.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.500
Like Adam Sandler movies from the early 90s, not the new stuff.

32:36.500 --> 32:40.500
But like, you know, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, critics hated those fucking movies.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.500
But like, they were funny. Exactly.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.500
I didn't think they were funny. I don't know.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
When I was a 12 year old boy, they were funny.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
But then again, I mean, like I said, I like Xanadu.

32:49.500 --> 32:54.500
Okay, yeah. And that movie is generally reviewed as terrible.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.500
But it now has a Broadway show. So who's the winner now?

32:57.500 --> 33:00.500
You know who else has a Broadway show? SpongeBob SquarePants.

33:00.500 --> 33:04.500
I keep seeing ads on Facebook.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.500
All right. Anyway.

33:07.500 --> 33:11.500
So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

33:11.500 --> 33:14.500
So what types of video games have you been playing this week?

33:14.500 --> 33:15.500
Dark Sakura.

33:15.500 --> 33:20.500
We've been going back to Breath of the Wild because we're playing it again on Switch.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.500
I actually didn't play any WoW this week.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
But we're just Pokemon Go a little bit.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.500
Actually, no, I wasn't even playing Pokemon Go.

33:26.500 --> 33:29.500
Because I like to start my week on Sunday and I missed a day.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.500
So I started my week over today.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.500
I'm still playing Ragnarok, the idol pouring.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
And I'm still playing Animal Crossing.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.500
Which they've now brought in more animals.

33:40.500 --> 33:43.500
And they had a fishing tourney going on.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.500
So that's pretty fun.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.500
Other than that, I've just been, because I've been so sick this week.

33:48.500 --> 33:52.500
And we also finished watching Jessica Jones, which was amazing.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.500
Oh, that's right. Season 2 just came out, right?

33:54.500 --> 33:58.500
Yeah. And finally finished it after people spoiled it for me.

33:58.500 --> 34:02.500
The same day that Drag Race was spoiled for me, too.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.500
So I had two in the same day. Ugh, people. Killing me.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.500
Right? I'm dead.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.500
All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?

34:10.500 --> 34:13.500
I didn't play a whole ton this week, but I did play some new stuff.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.500
So I did end up getting Burnout Paradise Remastered.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.500
So I played that for a bit.

34:18.500 --> 34:22.500
It was kind of fun because I hadn't actually played a lot of the DLC stuff.

34:22.500 --> 34:27.500
So I tried out some of the cars in there, and I went to the Paradise Island thing.

34:27.500 --> 34:30.500
Just quickly, I also picked that up. I haven't played it yet.

34:30.500 --> 34:34.500
I am going to play it for the first time as tonight's OLR post-show.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
It was pretty good.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.500
Or I should say the second time, because I did play it on 360, you know, years ago.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.500
I don't remember. I played it a while ago.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.500
And I'm still, like, the only thing I don't like about the game,

34:43.500 --> 34:46.500
is actually just a minor gripe, is the controls.

34:46.500 --> 34:49.500
Like, I don't remember how to do the...

34:49.500 --> 34:51.500
Where you crash and you go into that whole Crash Breaker mode,

34:51.500 --> 34:54.500
where you're, like, just causing a bunch of destruction.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.500
And I couldn't remember what the commands were for that.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
And there's no manual for the game.

34:59.500 --> 35:03.500
And there's no customize your button layout for the game.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.500
I'm like, what the fuck are the...

35:05.500 --> 35:08.500
Am I going to have to go on the internet to figure out what the hell do I have to push for this shit?

35:08.500 --> 35:11.500
And, like, as I push all the buttons, I'm like, oh, well, this thing's been working.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.500
I'm like, it's been so long since I played this.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.500
But, so, I've...

35:15.500 --> 35:17.500
That's the only thing, my minor gripe for that.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.500
But, and then, like...

35:19.500 --> 35:21.500
Even this was a problem with the original game.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.500
Like, the contrast in the colors.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.500
It's all, like, kind of washed out looking.

35:25.500 --> 35:29.500
And it's also really hard to see stuff, because it's so washed out.

35:29.500 --> 35:33.500
And I just wish it was more vibrantly colored.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.500
But I get that. I mean, I get that.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.500
That was the style of the game. That's the way it looked. Whatever.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.500
It's fine. But yeah, it's a great game.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.500
I love it. So, probably definitely play more of it.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
I'm excited to check it out.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
Yeah. It's great having all the cars and stuff.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.500
I was like, well, I'm not going to stick with this shitty starter car.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.500
I'm going to pick one of these better cars.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.500
And they're like, wait, this is way too fast.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.500
I can't drive this car. It's too fast.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
I guess play with the ones that have, like, alternate boost styles.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
Like, there's one...

35:59.500 --> 36:01.500
You push the boost down, it doesn't turn off.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
Ever.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.500
It just keeps going.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.500
And so I was trying that.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.500
And then I just immediately explode.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.500
Aside from that, you know, the usual stuff.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
Cell phone games.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
Pokemon. Ingress.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.500
Occasionally when I'm going to play starters.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.500
Stuff to play that.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.500
And...

36:21.500 --> 36:23.500
You know, that's pretty much it.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.500
Cool.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.500
Just a quick update for our live listeners.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.500
If you happen to be listening live, but not in the chat,

36:29.500 --> 36:31.500
where you can see that Bobby Blackwell

36:31.500 --> 36:33.500
has been consulting with our service provider

36:33.500 --> 36:35.500
as the dropouts have been occurring.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
And Bobby does have an update that apparently

36:37.500 --> 36:39.500
there is planned maintenance at the data center

36:39.500 --> 36:41.500
that runs the Shoutcast stream.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.500
And there is intermittent downtime for the next hour

36:43.500 --> 36:45.500
because of that. Funny, planned maintenance.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.500
I don't recall getting an email on that, Bobby.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.500
Did you get an email on that, Bobby?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.500
Because I don't recall getting an email on that.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.500
Anyway, that is what's going on.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.500
So, unfortunately, apparently they thought

36:55.500 --> 36:57.500
Sunday night, which... Isn't Sunday night

36:57.500 --> 36:59.500
like prime time television?

36:59.500 --> 37:01.500
Aren't all the big award shows on, like, Sunday night?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.500
So Sunday night is like prime time.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.500
Am I correct?

37:05.500 --> 37:07.500
So there was planned maintenance planned on Sunday night.

37:07.500 --> 37:09.500
Like at midnight or something.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
This is like...

37:11.500 --> 37:13.500
It's not that late.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.500
So, anyway, as I said earlier, stay tuned

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
because VOG Network is going to be moving later this year.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
Anyway.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.500
My gaming week.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.500
So some of the video games I've been playing this week.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.500
So I've also been doing cell phone gaming.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
Ingress and Pokemon Go I played a lot yesterday

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
because Ingress has been having this event called

37:29.500 --> 37:31.500
Dark XM, where in a nutshell

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
you were really encouraged to go

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
flip portals that maybe really weren't

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
normally your team's portals.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.500
So my buddy, Isette, who's listening out there

37:39.500 --> 37:41.500
and I, we went out to

37:41.500 --> 37:43.500
some areas that just, like, the portals never

37:43.500 --> 37:45.500
like, they're so remote. We went to, like, remote areas.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.500
Roseville.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
No, not that. Because they fight for it there.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.500
We went out to, like, Ione and Sutter Creek

37:51.500 --> 37:53.500
and these areas where people don't really play.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
And so we, uh, yeah, we

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
did some portal catching

37:57.500 --> 37:59.500
in those areas. And then the whole time

37:59.500 --> 38:01.500
I was running my Pokemon Go thing as well

38:01.500 --> 38:03.500
and I caught a lot of Pokemon.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.500
So, actually, one of the places we ended up at

38:05.500 --> 38:07.500
we went to Jackson Rancheria because

38:07.500 --> 38:09.500
you know, we met for coffee early on in the day

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
and then, you know, I gotta use the

38:11.500 --> 38:13.500
restroom, so we thought, oh, the casino's a good place to do it

38:13.500 --> 38:15.500
because we're right there. So we went to the casino

38:15.500 --> 38:17.500
and, uh, you know, I went to go do my

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
business and Isette pretty quickly

38:19.500 --> 38:21.500
lost $20 on the slot machine and I was

38:21.500 --> 38:23.500
like, eh, you know, I'll put $20

38:23.500 --> 38:25.500
in the slot machine. Why not? I'm gonna gamble a little bit.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.500
I actually found a Pac-Man slot machine.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.500
I did not know that there was a new,

38:29.500 --> 38:31.500
and I know it's new because it uses a lot of the sound effects

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
from Championship Edition and all that, so

38:33.500 --> 38:35.500
I actually found a Pac-Man slot machine

38:35.500 --> 38:37.500
and I played that. And, like, for the longest time

38:37.500 --> 38:39.500
it's one of those penny slots

38:39.500 --> 38:41.500
but they're not really penny slots because

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
the minimum bet is, like, 60 cents.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
Well, I kept playing and playing and it's like

38:45.500 --> 38:47.500
you lose 60 cents, you lose 60

38:47.500 --> 38:49.500
cents, you gained $1.20 and it's like

38:49.500 --> 38:51.500
I wasn't moving, like, whatsoever.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
And I was like, alright, whatever. And then I'm like

38:53.500 --> 38:55.500
okay, it's gotta be bored and

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
you know, we want to get back on the road, we want to stay here all day.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.500
So I was just like, you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna do

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
max bet. So I went boop and I bet

39:01.500 --> 39:03.500
like three bucks max bet, spin the wheel,

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
ding ding ding, you win eight times

39:05.500 --> 39:07.500
your bet. So I was like, sweet,

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
I'm up $14. Cash out,

39:09.500 --> 39:11.500
we're done, let's go.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.500
So for once in my life

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
I knew when to quit, so I quit.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
Thank you Pac-Man for the $14, I appreciate

39:17.500 --> 39:19.500
that. So

39:19.500 --> 39:21.500
that was Saturday.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.500
I will talk about a newer game I've been playing

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
because I'm still playing the old favorites.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.500
Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, POM SE 14.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.500
Let's talk about a new game I've actually been playing

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
quite a bit of this week.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.500
It's a game that just came out on PlayStation 4

39:33.500 --> 39:35.500
here in the US, although I did

39:35.500 --> 39:37.500
kind of play this once before because the

39:37.500 --> 39:39.500
game had came out, I think in like Thailand

39:39.500 --> 39:41.500
a few months ago, and Shane made me

39:41.500 --> 39:43.500
play it a few months ago, but now I've really spent

39:43.500 --> 39:45.500
some time with DJ Max Respect.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
So I've been playing that on PlayStation 4.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.500
It is right now

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
download only, I think it's gonna set you back

39:51.500 --> 39:53.500
$49.99 as well.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.500
It's a music game, it's very very

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
very very similar to Beatmania.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
In fact it's one of those things where

39:59.500 --> 40:01.500
I always sometimes wonder how

40:01.500 --> 40:03.500
Konami doesn't sue them because it's the whole

40:03.500 --> 40:05.500
falling notes on the line and I

40:05.500 --> 40:07.500
thought Konami had the patent for that, but whatever.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.500
I'm not gonna complain because if Konami

40:09.500 --> 40:11.500
isn't gonna do shit with Beatmania, which they

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
they are in the arcades,

40:13.500 --> 40:15.500
but when was the last time they put out a

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
console Beatmania game?

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
PlayStation 2 is how long

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
ago, anyway, you do the math.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.500
So, I'm really happy to

40:23.500 --> 40:25.500
have a game like that that I can play on

40:25.500 --> 40:27.500
the PlayStation 4, and

40:27.500 --> 40:29.500
unfortunately there's no special controller, you just have to

40:29.500 --> 40:31.500
use the, well, I hear there's a third

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
party special controller, but I'm

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
not getting into any of that. So

40:35.500 --> 40:37.500
you use your regular controller and you can

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
play in four button mode,

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
five button, six button, or eight button.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
So in four button mode you're using

40:43.500 --> 40:45.500
left and up, and

40:45.500 --> 40:47.500
triangle and circle are the four buttons.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.500
So you can play like that. If you add

40:49.500 --> 40:51.500
five buttons then it's square

40:51.500 --> 40:53.500
or right, six buttons is

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
square and right, and then

40:55.500 --> 40:57.500
eight button adds L1 and R1 and it's

40:57.500 --> 40:59.500
really hard. I did a little

40:59.500 --> 41:01.500
bit of a stream with this where I had a lot of technical

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
difficulties, so thank you guys who stuck with me, so

41:03.500 --> 41:05.500
I finally figured out how to broadcast

41:05.500 --> 41:07.500
with no audio lag on the PlayStation 4,

41:07.500 --> 41:09.500
that took me a little bit. But anyway,

41:09.500 --> 41:11.500
I've

41:11.500 --> 41:13.500
actually been playing more since that stream,

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
and those of you guys that were probably watching the stream

41:15.500 --> 41:17.500
saw me flop hard on the first

41:17.500 --> 41:19.500
song I played, I was really overwhelmed.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.500
I've actually, I've noticed

41:21.500 --> 41:23.500
myself making some improvements in the game,

41:23.500 --> 41:25.500
and I've just been kind of playing all over the map, like I play

41:25.500 --> 41:27.500
some four button, I play some six

41:27.500 --> 41:29.500
buttons, some five button. The game really

41:29.500 --> 41:31.500
rewards

41:31.500 --> 41:33.500
a variety of different types of play styles

41:33.500 --> 41:35.500
with the various unlocks. It's like

41:35.500 --> 41:37.500
you have to play so many four button songs to

41:37.500 --> 41:39.500
unlock this list, and you have to do so much of

41:39.500 --> 41:41.500
this to unlock this list. So yeah,

41:41.500 --> 41:43.500
I kind of like how the game has that all set up.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
I would say the one

41:45.500 --> 41:47.500
drawback, and some people are really gonna

41:47.500 --> 41:49.500
disagree with me here, but this is my

41:49.500 --> 41:51.500
opinion!

41:51.500 --> 41:53.500
I don't think the music in DJ Max

41:53.500 --> 41:55.500
is as strong as it is in Beatmania 2DX.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.500
I just, but that's because

41:57.500 --> 41:59.500
I prefer like the trance

41:59.500 --> 42:01.500
type of stuff that

42:01.500 --> 42:03.500
you know, the Japanese techno and all that

42:03.500 --> 42:05.500
stuff that Beatmania is really heavy on.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.500
I don't really see that same type

42:07.500 --> 42:09.500
of stuff present in

42:09.500 --> 42:11.500
DJ Max. There's some

42:11.500 --> 42:13.500
of it though. I mean there are, to be fair,

42:13.500 --> 42:15.500
there are a wide variety of songs

42:15.500 --> 42:17.500
but there are a lot of songs in there

42:17.500 --> 42:19.500
that I kind of find to be forgettable.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.500
But there are some songs that are

42:21.500 --> 42:23.500
really really good, and one thing I do like

42:23.500 --> 42:25.500
about it is that, you know, it's

42:25.500 --> 42:27.500
the respect is kind of

42:27.500 --> 42:29.500
a weird setup because like when you look at the

42:29.500 --> 42:31.500
title screen of the game, it's like

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
you see all these tombstones with like

42:33.500 --> 42:35.500
portable one, portable two, and like

42:35.500 --> 42:37.500
all the old DJ Max games that have

42:37.500 --> 42:39.500
come out, and then it's like push X to

42:39.500 --> 42:41.500
pay respect. And that's why it's

42:41.500 --> 42:43.500
called DJ Max Respect. So it's all

42:43.500 --> 42:45.500
the songs from the old games

42:45.500 --> 42:47.500
are in this newer game. And there's

42:47.500 --> 42:49.500
gonna be DLC coming out, like they're gonna do

42:49.500 --> 42:51.500
Classic Y as DLC because that's already

42:51.500 --> 42:53.500
out overseas, and I guess they're saying

42:53.500 --> 42:55.500
it's supposed to be here within a month, and

42:55.500 --> 42:57.500
that's gonna be awesome because I really do like the Classic Y

42:57.500 --> 42:59.500
songs. Like if you've never heard Flee, that's

42:59.500 --> 43:01.500
like the best song in all of DJ Max.

43:01.500 --> 43:03.500
So I'm really excited to have that playable

43:03.500 --> 43:05.500
and so, yeah, there are, you know, I know

43:05.500 --> 43:07.500
some of the DLC songs will be strong and so

43:07.500 --> 43:09.500
forth, but, you know,

43:09.500 --> 43:11.500
there's not a lot of like commercial

43:11.500 --> 43:13.500
or licensed stuff. All of it

43:13.500 --> 43:15.500
is like in-house developed. But you may

43:15.500 --> 43:17.500
see some familiar names, like

43:17.500 --> 43:19.500
Sampling Masters, who I think had

43:19.500 --> 43:21.500
a couple songs, 2DX, they have a couple songs in

43:21.500 --> 43:23.500
DJ Max. So, you know,

43:23.500 --> 43:25.500
it's not a completely unfamiliar list.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.500
So, anyway.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.500
Um,

43:29.500 --> 43:31.500
I think that's all

43:31.500 --> 43:33.500
I have to say on DJ Max. Oh no, is there anything else I should

43:33.500 --> 43:35.500
say about the game? There is an online mode

43:35.500 --> 43:37.500
that I've barely played it because when I go into online

43:37.500 --> 43:39.500
mode, I only see like one

43:39.500 --> 43:41.500
room ever open with an extremely high

43:41.500 --> 43:43.500
level player and I'm like, I know how that's gonna

43:43.500 --> 43:45.500
go. So I don't know if the online

43:45.500 --> 43:47.500
does matching very well, so

43:47.500 --> 43:49.500
I would get put with somebody that's at my own level.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.500
Um, but, it does have

43:51.500 --> 43:53.500
online, so like if you want to play with your friends and

43:53.500 --> 43:55.500
stuff, you could compete

43:55.500 --> 43:57.500
on certain songs or things of that sort.

43:57.500 --> 43:59.500
So. Oh, one thing I did

43:59.500 --> 44:01.500
want to mention, um, but just

44:01.500 --> 44:03.500
very briefly, because it is very brief,

44:03.500 --> 44:05.500
I have started working on a game again.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.500
On making

44:07.500 --> 44:09.500
something. And it is something new.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.500
Anything else you want to

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
say about it? Nope, that's it.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.500
What engine are you using? Unity? Yeah.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.500
I have an upgrade too.

44:17.500 --> 44:19.500
I think

44:19.500 --> 44:21.500
they have like Unity 2007. Alright.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.500
Why give Bobby Blackwell full

44:23.500 --> 44:25.500
permission and nag you every week until

44:25.500 --> 44:27.500
it's done? It's fine. Alright.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.500
Good. You hear that Bobby? Alright.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.500
Anyway, I think that's it for

44:31.500 --> 44:33.500
my gaming week. So, uh, housekeeping.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.500
As I said earlier, sadly, we're not going to be here

44:35.500 --> 44:37.500
live for the next two weeks, which I know really sucks

44:37.500 --> 44:39.500
because we're having these live service provider

44:39.500 --> 44:41.500
issues, but that is the

44:41.500 --> 44:43.500
joy and risk of live radio

44:43.500 --> 44:45.500
is that sometimes things don't always go according to plan.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.500
But, um, yeah. So we won't be here

44:47.500 --> 44:49.500
live for two weeks. We will be back on April 8th.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
As far as the podcast feed goes,

44:51.500 --> 44:53.500
you will get tonight's show uninterrupted

44:53.500 --> 44:55.500
on the podcast feed because we're still

44:55.500 --> 44:57.500
we're still doing this show as if it's

44:57.500 --> 44:59.500
gonna go to the feed. Uh, so that'll be

44:59.500 --> 45:01.500
there. And then the April 8th, uh, show

45:01.500 --> 45:03.500
will be on the podcast feed, of course. And then we're

45:03.500 --> 45:05.500
gonna do a bonus show somewhere during the time

45:05.500 --> 45:07.500
off. A little closer to April 1st.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.500
We'll do a bonus show since we won't be

45:09.500 --> 45:11.500
here that weekend. So, um,

45:11.500 --> 45:13.500
that is the upcoming schedule.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.500
Otherwise, follow us on Twitter at

45:15.500 --> 45:17.500
OLR. We're also on Facebook, Orange

45:17.500 --> 45:19.500
Lounge Radio, all one word. Let's

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
get into some gaming news.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.500
Loki. Alright. Sounds good.

45:23.500 --> 45:25.500
So, um, let's

45:25.500 --> 45:27.500
talk a little bit about, once again,

45:27.500 --> 45:29.500
um,

45:29.500 --> 45:31.500
free games.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.500
Because free games are awesome. And so

45:33.500 --> 45:35.500
this is kinda cool. So, you remember

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
with the whole, uh, Twitch Prime

45:37.500 --> 45:39.500
stuff, you kinda get, you know, your free

45:39.500 --> 45:41.500
subscription that you can do each month

45:41.500 --> 45:43.500
and stuff like that. Well, now, starting

45:43.500 --> 45:45.500
soon, they're actually gonna allow

45:45.500 --> 45:47.500
you to get free games as

45:47.500 --> 45:49.500
well. So, starting March 15th

45:49.500 --> 45:51.500
through the 31st, you're gonna get access

45:51.500 --> 45:53.500
to the following titles. So,

45:53.500 --> 45:55.500
Oxenfree, Mr. Shifty,

45:55.500 --> 45:57.500
Superhot, Shadow Tactics,

45:57.500 --> 45:59.500
and Candlekeep, the Tomb of Annihilation.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.500
And then, April,

46:01.500 --> 46:03.500
you're gonna have access to Tales of

46:03.500 --> 46:05.500
the Borderlands, or Tales from the Borderlands,

46:05.500 --> 46:07.500
Steamworld Dig 2, Kingsway,

46:07.500 --> 46:09.500
Tokyo 42, and Dubwars.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.500
So, it's kinda

46:11.500 --> 46:13.500
cool that they're gonna be offering, you know,

46:13.500 --> 46:15.500
games for free through the service

46:15.500 --> 46:17.500
as well. So, I guess

46:17.500 --> 46:19.500
another incentive for you to get Prime.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.500
That's, you know, what Amazon wants, I guess.

46:21.500 --> 46:23.500
So, neat.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.500
I don't know, these, like, Steam

46:26.500 --> 46:28.500
titles, are they just, like,

46:28.500 --> 46:30.500
DRM-free stuff?

46:30.500 --> 46:32.500
I don't really know how that works.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.500
I haven't downloaded any of them yet, but if

46:34.500 --> 46:36.500
the previous rewards are any indication,

46:36.500 --> 46:38.500
they often tend to go multiplatform.

46:38.500 --> 46:40.500
So, in other words, like,

46:40.500 --> 46:42.500
they did a Fortnite reward recently,

46:42.500 --> 46:44.500
and you could pick. Do you want it on PC or

46:44.500 --> 46:46.500
PlayStation 4? When they did the

46:46.500 --> 46:48.500
Overwatch rewards,

46:48.500 --> 46:50.500
you actually got it on everything.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.500
Because it was, like, loot boxes. You got 10 loot boxes.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.500
Or maybe it was 5 and 5, I don't remember.

46:54.500 --> 46:56.500
But it's, like, when I bring it up on PC,

46:56.500 --> 46:58.500
all my loot boxes are there, and then when I go on to the

46:58.500 --> 47:00.500
PlayStation, I have different loot boxes,

47:00.500 --> 47:02.500
but I also get the same amount of bonus

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
loot boxes there. So, that's kinda how Twitch

47:04.500 --> 47:06.500
has handled it previously. So, I think

47:06.500 --> 47:08.500
these releases are all PC,

47:08.500 --> 47:10.500
but I wouldn't say that Twitch is necessarily,

47:10.500 --> 47:12.500
or Amazon is really who it is.

47:12.500 --> 47:14.500
They're not gonna necessarily limit themselves to that.

47:14.500 --> 47:16.500
Hmm. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.500
For sure. And I think that's interesting

47:18.500 --> 47:20.500
that that is Twitch kinda competing

47:20.500 --> 47:22.500
in some ways with Xbox Live,

47:22.500 --> 47:24.500
I guess. Yeah. Because,

47:24.500 --> 47:26.500
or at PlayStation Plus

47:26.500 --> 47:28.500
and the free games there. It's very interesting that

47:28.500 --> 47:30.500
Amazon now also has this,

47:30.500 --> 47:32.500
you know, if you're paying your yearly fee

47:32.500 --> 47:34.500
for this, we're gonna give you some free games. Or even, like,

47:34.500 --> 47:36.500
a Humble Monthly or something like that.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.500
I guess. Yeah.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.500
It's neat. There's, like,

47:40.500 --> 47:42.500
at least, because

47:42.500 --> 47:44.500
Prime is kind of expensive for

47:44.500 --> 47:46.500
a year's subscription. It's starting to climb up, too.

47:46.500 --> 47:48.500
Yeah, but at least they're giving you

47:48.500 --> 47:50.500
a little bit more for that. So, that's

47:50.500 --> 47:52.500
kinda nice to get more for the money that you're

47:52.500 --> 47:54.500
paying. Yeah, for sure. Of course, they're gonna raise the

47:54.500 --> 47:56.500
price again, I'm sure, now that they're adding all

47:56.500 --> 47:58.500
this stuff to it. They

47:58.500 --> 48:00.500
probably will. But, you know, if you

48:00.500 --> 48:02.500
I don't know. I still kinda find the Twitch Prime

48:02.500 --> 48:04.500
thing to be a really good, or the Amazon

48:04.500 --> 48:06.500
Prime thing to be a good value with the, with

48:06.500 --> 48:08.500
everything that I buy online with the shipping

48:08.500 --> 48:10.500
and, you know, just the Twitch

48:10.500 --> 48:12.500
Prime included is a pretty big deal.

48:12.500 --> 48:14.500
And, you know, as somebody who streams on

48:14.500 --> 48:16.500
Twitch and does make

48:16.500 --> 48:18.500
some pocket change on Twitch, nothing that's gonna

48:18.500 --> 48:20.500
change my finances drastically, but makes

48:20.500 --> 48:22.500
pocket change on Twitch, please don't forget

48:22.500 --> 48:24.500
to use your free sub on somebody.

48:24.500 --> 48:26.500
I mean, of course, I'd love it if you used it on me, but

48:26.500 --> 48:28.500
tons of people here at the VoiceGeeks

48:28.500 --> 48:30.500
Network and our extended, you know, family

48:30.500 --> 48:32.500
and friends are streaming now, so

48:32.500 --> 48:34.500
please don't forget to use your free sub somewhere

48:34.500 --> 48:36.500
because that's, you know, that's

48:36.500 --> 48:38.500
a couple bucks that you can give out of your

48:38.500 --> 48:40.500
and then that adds up. So, it's almost like you

48:40.500 --> 48:42.500
can, that money you can kinda give to

48:42.500 --> 48:44.500
somebody else. Yeah. So, kinda nice.

48:44.500 --> 48:46.500
So, cool.

48:46.500 --> 48:48.500
Well, we'll see what Twitch Prime

48:48.500 --> 48:50.500
kinda adds to sweeten the pot later on.

48:50.500 --> 48:52.500
Yeah, I'll be very curious to see if maybe they start

48:52.500 --> 48:54.500
to get into console stuff as well.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.500
Maybe Nintendo stuff someday.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.500
I don't know. I guess nothing

48:58.500 --> 49:00.500
is unreasonable, but

49:00.500 --> 49:02.500
talking about Nintendo, Nintendo did recently

49:02.500 --> 49:04.500
update the Switch firmware.

49:04.500 --> 49:06.500
The Switch is now running on version

49:06.500 --> 49:08.500
5.0 firmware.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.500
So, some of the functionality that is now available

49:10.500 --> 49:12.500
on the Switch is that you can find your

49:12.500 --> 49:14.500
Facebook and Twitter friends on

49:14.500 --> 49:16.500
the Switch. This is something that I would have thought

49:16.500 --> 49:18.500
would have been their day one, but

49:18.500 --> 49:20.500
no, you can only historically find through

49:20.500 --> 49:22.500
your 3DS friends. But they've just now figured out that

49:22.500 --> 49:24.500
Facebook and Twitter are things.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.500
So, it's okay. No, because you can

49:26.500 --> 49:28.500
post your screenshots to Facebook and Twitter the whole time.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.500
But anyway, your friends will now

49:30.500 --> 49:32.500
come in, so that's something a little bit new.

49:32.500 --> 49:34.500
There's also some new icons

49:34.500 --> 49:36.500
if you're a fan of ARMS or Kirby

49:36.500 --> 49:38.500
Act F. You can now get some

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
icons for your account from

49:40.500 --> 49:42.500
those games, ARMS and Kirby.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.500
Stop trying to make ARMS a thing.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.500
Also, you can filter

49:46.500 --> 49:48.500
news. And then they did a lot with

49:48.500 --> 49:50.500
parental controls, where like your captured

49:50.500 --> 49:52.500
videos will only show

49:52.500 --> 49:54.500
if the person logged in meets the parental controls.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.500
And there's a lot with the app

49:56.500 --> 49:58.500
as well. I don't think many people that

49:58.500 --> 50:00.500
listen to this show use the parental controls.

50:00.500 --> 50:02.500
However, if that is something of interest to you, I would

50:02.500 --> 50:04.500
encourage you to check that out

50:04.500 --> 50:06.500
on Nintendo's website about what they've changed

50:06.500 --> 50:08.500
with parental controls, because they've added a lot more.

50:08.500 --> 50:10.500
And we do encourage all of our

50:10.500 --> 50:12.500
moms and dads and everybody

50:12.500 --> 50:14.500
else out there who do raise kids

50:14.500 --> 50:16.500
to be diligent with using these.

50:16.500 --> 50:18.500
And watch what your kids play.

50:18.500 --> 50:20.500
What you believe is best for your family.

50:20.500 --> 50:22.500
Also, which I think is kind of interesting,

50:22.500 --> 50:24.500
Nintendo Switch Pro Controller

50:24.500 --> 50:26.500
grip colors will now display

50:26.500 --> 50:28.500
in the controller's menu. So does that mean

50:28.500 --> 50:30.500
you now see the actual colors of the

50:30.500 --> 50:32.500
controller you're using?

50:32.500 --> 50:34.500
That's kind of neat. Of the grip colors for

50:34.500 --> 50:36.500
the Pro Controller? Well yeah, because the Pro Controller

50:36.500 --> 50:38.500
I have a Splatoon Pro Controller

50:38.500 --> 50:40.500
so it's pink and green.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.500
I guess. That's kind of cool that it does that

50:42.500 --> 50:44.500
just so they know which

50:44.500 --> 50:46.500
controllers are which. It's just an additional

50:46.500 --> 50:48.500
little enhancement that's kind of cool.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
I like that. You know what would be a nice additional

50:50.500 --> 50:52.500
little enhancement that they can add?

50:52.500 --> 50:54.500
It would be pretty cool is Virtual Console.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.500
Hopefully at E3 or else I have

50:58.500 --> 51:00.500
no idea what they're going to do.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.500
Anyway, also

51:02.500 --> 51:04.500
something else that apparently is happening is that

51:04.500 --> 51:06.500
third party docs seem to be bricking

51:06.500 --> 51:08.500
with this new update.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.500
So if you are using a third party doc

51:10.500 --> 51:12.500
you're going to want to be very careful

51:12.500 --> 51:14.500
because apparently some consoles are being

51:14.500 --> 51:16.500
strongly impacted by this.

51:16.500 --> 51:18.500
I know one of the makers... For absolutely

51:18.500 --> 51:20.500
no reason whatsoever. I really hope

51:20.500 --> 51:22.500
Nintendo didn't do it to be a dick. Oh, of course

51:22.500 --> 51:24.500
they did. I just put, but like to

51:24.500 --> 51:26.500
brick a console

51:26.500 --> 51:28.500
if you want to brick anything

51:28.500 --> 51:30.500
brick the dock. But brick the console

51:30.500 --> 51:32.500
that's pretty fucked up.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.500
I don't know. I mean

51:34.500 --> 51:36.500
I guess you do take a

51:36.500 --> 51:38.500
risk when you use third party stuff, but

51:38.500 --> 51:40.500
most of your Best Buys

51:40.500 --> 51:42.500
and your Game Stops sell

51:42.500 --> 51:44.500
this stuff side by side with the Switch

51:44.500 --> 51:46.500
and the average consumer doesn't sit there

51:46.500 --> 51:48.500
to think, oh, this is a third party

51:48.500 --> 51:50.500
product so I might want to be careful when using this.

51:50.500 --> 51:52.500
Come on. Dark Soccer

51:52.500 --> 51:54.500
has been covering peripherals of the month

51:54.500 --> 51:56.500
over this year and they've all been

51:56.500 --> 51:58.500
third party stuff so far.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.500
Sometimes third parties

52:00.500 --> 52:02.500
develop different things. So

52:02.500 --> 52:04.500
it would be kind of a dick

52:04.500 --> 52:06.500
move if they were doing that on purpose.

52:06.500 --> 52:08.500
That's all.

52:08.500 --> 52:10.500
Anyway, also apparently

52:10.500 --> 52:12.500
with this firmware

52:12.500 --> 52:14.500
that actually launched on the Switch

52:14.500 --> 52:16.500
some folks data mined the firmware

52:16.500 --> 52:18.500
and found that there is a new check

52:18.500 --> 52:20.500
for a SOC

52:20.500 --> 52:22.500
system on a chip.

52:22.500 --> 52:24.500
Some thoughts out there are theorizing

52:24.500 --> 52:26.500
this is probably due to a hardware

52:26.500 --> 52:28.500
vulnerability and that makes hacking

52:28.500 --> 52:30.500
possible in different firmware versions.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.500
So future Nintendo Switch units are

52:32.500 --> 52:34.500
probably going to have a different SOC.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.500
This could also, I would think,

52:36.500 --> 52:38.500
be related to maybe what's breaking the docks,

52:38.500 --> 52:40.500
but I don't know, we'll see.

52:40.500 --> 52:42.500
Going to chat over...

52:42.500 --> 52:44.500
And they're checking for the chip that's

52:44.500 --> 52:46.500
in the docks, I guess?

52:46.500 --> 52:48.500
Perhaps. Going to our chat over

52:48.500 --> 52:50.500
at live.vognetwork.com

52:50.500 --> 52:52.500
Ranma in chat says it's hard to tell it's third

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
party when the box looks just

52:54.500 --> 52:56.500
like first party products. Ain't that the

52:56.500 --> 52:58.500
truth? And they do that on purpose.

52:58.500 --> 53:00.500
You know they do. And this is Joe and Hunter Matt says

53:00.500 --> 53:02.500
yeah, this isn't like an R4 card.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.500
It's a dock. Exactly. This isn't like

53:04.500 --> 53:06.500
something that you use to pirate software.

53:06.500 --> 53:08.500
Right? These third party docks

53:08.500 --> 53:10.500
don't give you any additional... Well it's also because

53:10.500 --> 53:12.500
their dock costs like $70

53:12.500 --> 53:14.500
or something. Is it like $70 or $100

53:14.500 --> 53:16.500
for this stupid thing? For what? Pass

53:16.500 --> 53:18.500
through for a video? I mean

53:18.500 --> 53:20.500
come on. I thought the docks also had

53:20.500 --> 53:22.500
like a chip or two in them to give them a little extra

53:22.500 --> 53:24.500
oomph, which is why some games can run

53:24.500 --> 53:26.500
at 1080 when they're docked.

53:26.500 --> 53:28.500
No. No, I don't think so.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.500
I thought they did. I don't think so.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
Are you sure? Alright, maybe.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.500
I thought the docks had a little extra

53:34.500 --> 53:36.500
because they always talk about

53:36.500 --> 53:38.500
it runs like this docked and it runs like this

53:38.500 --> 53:40.500
undocked.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.500
I don't think that was the case. Interesting.

53:42.500 --> 53:44.500
One more comment from chat at live.vognetwork.com

53:44.500 --> 53:46.500
Bob C says I'm guessing

53:46.500 --> 53:48.500
the third party docks handle the handshake

53:48.500 --> 53:50.500
signal different from Nintendo's

53:50.500 --> 53:52.500
OEM dock. Yeah, it's definitely got to be something

53:52.500 --> 53:54.500
related to that. So a big warning

53:54.500 --> 53:56.500
if you're using third party docks

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
stop using them especially

53:58.500 --> 54:00.500
if your Switch updated

54:00.500 --> 54:02.500
the firmware because a lot of the Switches don't even

54:02.500 --> 54:04.500
ask. They don't ask to download the update

54:04.500 --> 54:06.500
they just do it. Ah, the Microsoft policy.

54:06.500 --> 54:08.500
Yeah, pretty much. Well, I think it's just on

54:08.500 --> 54:10.500
by default. I'm pretty sure you can turn it off

54:10.500 --> 54:12.500
but I mean

54:12.500 --> 54:14.500
for the most part you usually

54:14.500 --> 54:16.500
want the new firmware because

54:16.500 --> 54:18.500
it patches security leaks

54:18.500 --> 54:20.500
and things like that. I know that's the big deal with

54:20.500 --> 54:22.500
phones. You know, any time a new phone

54:22.500 --> 54:24.500
vulnerability is found the phone

54:24.500 --> 54:26.500
companies whether it's Apple, whether it's Android

54:26.500 --> 54:28.500
they patch that shit pretty quick and you want to

54:28.500 --> 54:30.500
download that. Yeah. So, you know

54:30.500 --> 54:32.500
anyway, let's move on to a different story

54:32.500 --> 54:34.500
Dark Sakura.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.500
Well, in other news

54:36.500 --> 54:38.500
Microsoft has some plans

54:38.500 --> 54:40.500
that is a little bit different than what

54:40.500 --> 54:42.500
they have already been doing.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
They are wanting

54:44.500 --> 54:46.500
to create a service for video games

54:46.500 --> 54:48.500
that works like Netflix.

54:48.500 --> 54:50.500
They had an interview with The Verge where

54:50.500 --> 54:52.500
one of their team members said that they are

54:52.500 --> 54:54.500
working on a service that would function the way that

54:54.500 --> 54:56.500
Netflix does for games and

54:56.500 --> 54:58.500
that would offer access to games

54:58.500 --> 55:00.500
from a variety of developers including

55:00.500 --> 55:02.500
Microsoft and stream those titles

55:02.500 --> 55:04.500
to the player's device of choice

55:04.500 --> 55:06.500
so that they could play

55:06.500 --> 55:08.500
whatever game they want on whatever

55:08.500 --> 55:10.500
device. So

55:10.500 --> 55:12.500
they said that their goal is to reach the

55:12.500 --> 55:14.500
two billion gamers in the world.

55:14.500 --> 55:16.500
So

55:16.500 --> 55:18.500
it would extend things

55:18.500 --> 55:20.500
out of that whole

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
proprietary

55:22.500 --> 55:24.500
market, you know, instead of

55:24.500 --> 55:26.500
this is exclusive to this, this is exclusive

55:26.500 --> 55:28.500
to this. If you subscribe to the service

55:28.500 --> 55:30.500
it streams to whichever device

55:30.500 --> 55:32.500
you're on. Yeah, because if you're talking about

55:32.500 --> 55:34.500
truly Netflix, I mean the thing that

55:34.500 --> 55:36.500
Netflix does is that Netflix

55:36.500 --> 55:38.500
is on your TV, Netflix is

55:38.500 --> 55:40.500
on your computer, Netflix is on your

55:40.500 --> 55:42.500
Nintendo Switch. No, no it's not.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.500
It's on your Wii U though.

55:44.500 --> 55:46.500
But Netflix is on all these places, it's on

55:46.500 --> 55:48.500
your phone. If Microsoft is truly

55:48.500 --> 55:50.500
going to look at doing a Netflix for the games

55:50.500 --> 55:52.500
this is not like the Game Pass

55:52.500 --> 55:54.500
that exists today, right, where you pay

55:54.500 --> 55:56.500
which is the same thing as PlayStation Now essentially

55:56.500 --> 55:58.500
where you pay a monthly fee to have access to a big

55:58.500 --> 56:00.500
library, but it's on your Xbox

56:00.500 --> 56:02.500
One. We're talking about you're going to be

56:02.500 --> 56:04.500
paying a fee for something

56:04.500 --> 56:06.500
that could be anywhere, on a TV

56:06.500 --> 56:08.500
or on a phone most notably.

56:08.500 --> 56:10.500
Right, so that's very

56:10.500 --> 56:12.500
interesting. But

56:12.500 --> 56:14.500
of course the one thing

56:14.500 --> 56:16.500
that's going to be the problem

56:16.500 --> 56:18.500
for this is getting these

56:20.500 --> 56:22.500
consoles, the companies

56:22.500 --> 56:24.500
that manage these consoles to play

56:24.500 --> 56:26.500
nice with the service.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
Nintendo

56:28.500 --> 56:30.500
may not want to because

56:30.500 --> 56:32.500
you know how tight and proprietary

56:32.500 --> 56:34.500
they are on everything. Sony

56:34.500 --> 56:36.500
may play nice. I don't see

56:36.500 --> 56:38.500
No they won't. I said may,

56:38.500 --> 56:40.500
they'd be more likely than Nintendo to do it.

56:40.500 --> 56:42.500
No. I don't see either one of them doing it.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.500
They're going to see it as competition.

56:44.500 --> 56:46.500
But I get where you're coming from.

56:46.500 --> 56:48.500
Hypothetically. But the incentive

56:48.500 --> 56:50.500
from offering the service is enough

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
to bring them the money?

56:52.500 --> 56:54.500
I would say this, if Microsoft

56:54.500 --> 56:56.500
announces they're exiting

56:56.500 --> 56:58.500
the console market completely

56:58.500 --> 57:00.500
then yes, they would both be open

57:00.500 --> 57:02.500
to it. But Microsoft's going to have to say

57:02.500 --> 57:04.500
we're no longer selling the Xbox

57:04.500 --> 57:06.500
One. How is Xbox One selling

57:06.500 --> 57:08.500
right now? I believe

57:08.500 --> 57:10.500
it's doing better than it was and

57:10.500 --> 57:12.500
I don't think the Xbox One X flopped

57:12.500 --> 57:14.500
but I think Microsoft is still kind of

57:14.500 --> 57:16.500
losing this console battle

57:16.500 --> 57:18.500
and I think it all comes down to exclusives.

57:18.500 --> 57:20.500
You know Sea of Thieves is just

57:20.500 --> 57:22.500
not God of War. Well and they've also lost

57:22.500 --> 57:24.500
one whole complete market

57:24.500 --> 57:26.500
because they no longer sell in Japan.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.500
That's true.

57:28.500 --> 57:30.500
But you know Microsoft is

57:30.500 --> 57:32.500
kind of a different, it's a different bar to measure

57:32.500 --> 57:34.500
because, but then you have to look at

57:34.500 --> 57:36.500
Windows gaming and Microsoft

57:36.500 --> 57:38.500
you know, gets a lot of PC

57:38.500 --> 57:40.500
games and so when you kind of

57:40.500 --> 57:42.500
consider Microsoft's gaming platform

57:42.500 --> 57:44.500
as both Windows

57:44.500 --> 57:46.500
and Xbox One

57:46.500 --> 57:48.500
are they losing? I don't

57:48.500 --> 57:50.500
know. I don't think it's really the same.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.500
So anyway,

57:52.500 --> 57:54.500
food for thought.

57:54.500 --> 57:56.500
I still wonder how much

57:56.500 --> 57:58.500
of the video game market really

57:58.500 --> 58:00.500
is, you know

58:00.500 --> 58:02.500
if a person had, you know,

58:02.500 --> 58:04.500
now keep in mind the only of those consoles I don't

58:04.500 --> 58:06.500
have is an Xbox One.

58:06.500 --> 58:08.500
So

58:08.500 --> 58:10.500
if some game came

58:10.500 --> 58:12.500
out on PC versus a

58:12.500 --> 58:14.500
console, I don't know which

58:14.500 --> 58:16.500
one gets the larger market share.

58:16.500 --> 58:18.500
You know, would it be something on

58:18.500 --> 58:20.500
PlayStation 4? Would it be something on PC?

58:20.500 --> 58:22.500
Now me, the only reason that I

58:22.500 --> 58:24.500
play things on PC is

58:24.500 --> 58:26.500
because of the three search fees I've had on my hand.

58:26.500 --> 58:28.500
It's more comfortable to play

58:28.500 --> 58:30.500
with a keyboard and mouse.

58:30.500 --> 58:32.500
But will,

58:32.500 --> 58:34.500
but what really does have the highest number

58:34.500 --> 58:36.500
of sales? Is it going to be a console

58:36.500 --> 58:38.500
or is it going to be

58:38.500 --> 58:40.500
a computer? I think it really just

58:40.500 --> 58:42.500
depends on what the game is and

58:42.500 --> 58:44.500
more importantly, kind of like how it was released.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.500
For example, I think something

58:46.500 --> 58:48.500
like Overwatch, I think they've said there's way more

58:48.500 --> 58:50.500
people playing Overwatch on PC

58:50.500 --> 58:52.500
than anything else. But you also

58:52.500 --> 58:54.500
have to consider Blizzard's World of Warcraft

58:54.500 --> 58:56.500
base, you know, Blizzard's

58:56.500 --> 58:58.500
Heroes of the Storm base and all their hardest

58:58.500 --> 59:00.500
core fans have always been PC gamers.

59:00.500 --> 59:02.500
So of course Overwatch was going to do well

59:02.500 --> 59:04.500
on PC. That's not to say it's doing crap on

59:04.500 --> 59:06.500
consoles, because it's not, but

59:06.500 --> 59:08.500
it's just Blizzard's biggest base was always

59:08.500 --> 59:10.500
PC. However, take something

59:10.500 --> 59:12.500
like Final Fantasy 15,

59:12.500 --> 59:14.500
well it's probably doing better

59:14.500 --> 59:16.500
on consoles than it is on PC,

59:16.500 --> 59:18.500
but it also had a year out on

59:18.500 --> 59:20.500
consoles before it even released on PC.

59:20.500 --> 59:22.500
So I think some of that comes into play

59:22.500 --> 59:24.500
as well.

59:24.500 --> 59:26.500
But Halo,

59:26.500 --> 59:28.500
Halo 2,

59:28.500 --> 59:30.500
I know you don't like to talk about Halo, but

59:30.500 --> 59:32.500
Halo 2 was on PC and

59:32.500 --> 59:34.500
Xbox and I think it did better on consoles.

59:34.500 --> 59:36.500
So I think it just kind of depends on

59:36.500 --> 59:38.500
what the game is and

59:38.500 --> 59:40.500
what quote-unquote feels right

59:40.500 --> 59:42.500
for the game. Yeah, but

59:42.500 --> 59:44.500
that's really what's getting back to my point is the

59:44.500 --> 59:46.500
financial impact that one would have versus the other.

59:46.500 --> 59:48.500
So, I don't

59:48.500 --> 59:50.500
know if

59:50.500 --> 59:52.500
sorry, I need to take my

59:52.500 --> 59:54.500
medicine, but

59:54.500 --> 59:56.500
I don't know if the impact would be

59:56.500 --> 59:58.500
greater for one versus the other.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
Okay. You know, that's my

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500
concern. Alright. Well, let's

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.500
move on to our next story. Loki. Alright,

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.500
so things are

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.500
coming back, and by those things they mean

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.500
microtransactions in Star Wars Battlefront 2.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.500
So they are getting rid of

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.500
the whole loot box system that they

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.500
tried to pull out, you know,

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.500
for

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.500
choice, I don't know.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.500
They basically tried to shove that in there

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500
and run the game with it. So now,

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500
you know, kind of admitting

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500
defeat, they're bringing back

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500
microtransactions into the game, but it's only

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
going to be for

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500
basically cosmetic items. So

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500
basically, they're going to be getting rid of the whole loot box

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.500
and Starbucks. Pink Vader.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500
No Pink Vader yet, because no one wants that.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.500
God dammit. So they're going to have

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500
progressions going to be linear now,

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.500
and basically, they're only going to have

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500
these cosmetic

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500
items that are

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500
available in the game as microtransactions.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.500
So you can either use

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.500
in-game credits or crystals, so you can

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500
buy premium currency

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.500
with that. So that's what they're

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.500
doing, and that's going to start,

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500
looks like actually in a few days on March 21st.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500
But

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500
if I'm not mistaken, the internet is kind of already

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.500
over Battlefront, right? Yeah,

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.500
I think so. I mean, it's taken this long

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.500
to kind of do the right thing,

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.500
but it's not even really the right thing, I think,

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.500
because it's like this...

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.500
I don't know. The way, like,

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500
I've heard it described as like,

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.500
nobody likes microtransactions

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500
in games, so then they pull out this thing

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.500
that's even worse than microtransactions

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.500
and then bring that back, and people are like,

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500
oh, thank god it's not that thing. I'll take

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500
microtransactions.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500
You know, and then

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500
in a very morbid...

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.500
So it's one of those, let me show you just

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500
how bad it can be. Okay, okay, it's not that bad.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500
It would be a morbid comparison, but like, if I'm killing,

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.500
if I'm stabbing puppies, and then,

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.500
and I, and people are like,

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.500
don't stab puppies, and so I stab babies

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500
instead, and then I stop stabbing

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
babies, and go back to stabbing puppies,

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500
they're all like, well, at least he's not stabbing babies anymore,

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500
we'll take the stabbing puppies. That's basically

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500
what it is, it's that you're getting used

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.500
to something that you hated, just because it's not the

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.500
other thing that's even worse. That is the fucking

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.500
stupidest comparison I've heard in the 15

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500
years of this program.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.500
I aim to please.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.500
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.500
And that's basically it, it's just that...

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500
This is the same person who came up with Iraqi suicide babies.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
No, that's a year,

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500
years old joke. Uh, just by the way,

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500
That was culturally insensitive, I

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500
will admit.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500
Some live reaction from our chatroom.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500
Dark Tetsuya says, wow, Loki.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.500
Dungeon Buster says, Loki logic

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500
can be scary. Psh.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.500
Sia Tabiri says, at least he's not putting them in the

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.500
blender. Alright, Sia Tabiri, you,

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.500
Loki, you're in timeout. In the

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500
corner.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.500
And don't look away from the corner

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.500
until I tell you to.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.500
Yeah,

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.500
I'm over Star Wars Battlefront 2

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500
as well, so let's see how they fuck up Star Wars

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Battlefront 3.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.500
I'm sure that'll be a thing. Be careful what you wish

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500
for. Alright, well,

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500
I know that we're getting

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.500
into Street Fighter

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.500
all over again on the Nintendo Switch, and

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.500
the game that probably should have come

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.500
out, instead of that Street Fighter

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.500
2 game that came out originally. It's the

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.500
Street Fighter 30th anniversary collection.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.500
That's right, you can play all

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.500
of the Street Fighter, including

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.500
Turbo, Championship, Original,

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.500
Super, and hey, Dark

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.500
Sakura would love to play Alpha,

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500
Alpha 2, Alpha 3, I bet she's not the only one.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.500
And you can even play Street Fighter 3.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500
Cause, how many of you

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.500
actually remember playing Street Fighter 3?

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.500
Of course you do,

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.500
of course you do. I worked in an arcade

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.500
when Street Fighter 3 came out. Yeah, but like,

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.500
you know, I think a lot of people kind of forgot

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.500
that one. But anyway. Oh, come on,

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.500
it was all about playing Ibuki.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.500
This whole collection is going to be coming out, and

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.500
I know people are jazzed about it. But what's also

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500
interesting about it is that there's going to be a

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500
kind of a special tournament mode in this.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500
It's an exclusive mode to the Switch,

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500
where you use Super

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.500
Street Fighter 2's tournament mode,

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.500
and you do this with multiple Switch

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.500
units, you put them in tabletop mode,

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.500
and you play musical chairs.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500
So like, basically, all

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.500
the four Switches are talking to each other,

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500
but you're doing your tournament and you're all playing

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.500
matches at the same time, so it's like you're going to run

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500
an eight-player tournament, or maybe more,

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.500
really, really fast. But

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500
some early reports are saying that

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.500
it does end up kind of being a confusing mess,

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.500
like which system and controller you need

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.500
to have for your next match. So you might

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500
want to consider maybe having different color controllers

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500
or something to label that. But it sounds

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.500
like it's pretty neat, and it's using the whole, like,

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.500
you know, Switches talking together in the same room.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.500
At least they tried something. Yeah, at least

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.500
it's something kind of new. I like that. It's almost

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500
like the Switch is like now the new

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.500
version of LAN.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500
That's what this sounds like. It really does. At least they

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500
get one type of networking.

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.500
Right? We'll take

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500
offline, I guess. Anyway, so yeah,

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500
I think I'm going to check this out, you know.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500
Of course I like the Street Fighter. I mean, I feel like

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.500
I've bought Street Fighter II so many times,

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500
but the fact that they are including, like,

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.500
the three different versions of Street Fighter III

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.500
and the alpha games, and, you know,

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500
it does kind of sweeten the pot in some of this other stuff.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500
Nothing will ever be the

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500
Saturn version of Street Fighter Alpha 2.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.500
Nothing? Nothing.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.500
Nothing? Unless you have a full arcade release.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500
But, this is just going to probably be an

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.500
emulated arcade machine. Right?

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.500
The Saturn version to this day is still

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.500
the best home version. Well, BobC

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.500
brings up a good point in our chat saying, question,

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.500
will be how close to arcade

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.500
perfect will the ports be, and if it's emulation,

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500
how bad will the input lag

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.500
be? No online alpha 2

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.500
makes me sad. Alpha 2 is best alpha.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.500
So, seems like

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.500
they are leaving out some modes

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.500
on some other games.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.500
By the way, I want to throw this out

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.500
to the chat room speaking of Saturn games real quick.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500
If they can hear us with all the

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500
frequent drops, sorry, but try your best.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
If someone can find me a copy of

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.500
Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.500
for under 50 bucks, please tell me.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.500
I'm serious.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500
It's like something you're targeting for the

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.500
vault next. It's something I'm targeting

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500
for the husband.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
And since he doesn't really listen,

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500
I have no problem with saying this

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500
in an announcement on live radio.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.500
Fair enough. Don't tell them.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500
Alright, but

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.500
do tell us your next story, DarcSakra.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500
My next story has to do with

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.500
shenanigans and how

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.500
people are reacting to it.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.500
So,

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.500
there is a huge

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.500
labor strike

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.500
going on

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.500
with a particular

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.500
developer, with developers

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500
at a French gaming studio.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.500
And I know it's one studio.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.500
They're the ones who put behind a

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500
steel division Normandy 44.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.500
The

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.500
company is called UGen Systems.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500
And

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.500
the reason why I'm bringing this up,

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500
they're on their 30th

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.500
day on strike, actually more than

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.500
30 by the time you're listening to

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.500
this podcast.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.500
But

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500
they are on strike because

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.500
of unpaid wages

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.500
and breached contract.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500
They

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.500
have refused to pay

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.500
as required by law.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.500
They are

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.500
underpaying for the value of their work.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.500
And so,

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.500
the quote here is, in order to make ourselves

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.500
heard, we have no option but to go on strike.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.500
And this is started on February

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.500
15th. And then

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.500
the distribution was made by a

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.500
labor advocacy group

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.500
called, and please bear with me,

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.500
I have not spoken any French in quite a while.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.500
But,

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.500
the syndicate of video game workers.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500
I hope that sounds right.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.500
I actually remember that jeu video is how you say video games

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.500
in French, yeah.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.500
It's game video, yeah.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.500
But they are

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.500
claiming that UGen management

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.500
did not budge after a 15

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.500
month negotiation on the topic.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.500
And that they put out a counter

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.500
statement claiming sloppy payroll

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.500
paperwork. And so,

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.500
the workers

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.500
have gone on strike.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.500
And I know it's

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.500
a small company.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.500
But I hope it's a

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.500
precedence. That maybe

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.500
if more, you know,

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500
employees of video game companies

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500
unionize and

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.500
stand up. Do you hear the people

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.500
sing, sing.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.500
That was the French Revolution,

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.500
Bob.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500
I couldn't help myself.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.500
It's obvious, obviously it's the first

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.500
thing that came to mind. Obviously.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.500
I don't mean to make light of it, I'm sorry.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.500
We crack stupid jokes on this show.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.500
But at any rate, you know,

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.500
and this is, I'm not trying to be

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.500
political on this one, but if you think about it,

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.500
labor unions

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.500
at least here in the US

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.500
are why we have

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.500
an average 5 day work week.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.500
It's why we have a 40 hour work week.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.500
You know, we have child labor laws.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.500
You know, the best way,

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.500
you know, and we hear about some

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.500
of the terrible conditions developers

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.500
work in. If you are

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.500
a developer and you are in these

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.500
circumstances,

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.500
hit them where it hurts.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500
Delay their games.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.500
Take a stand.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.500
You know, I know Bill's got to get

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500
paid, but unionize,

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.500
you know. And believe me, when the workers

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500
are happy, you're going to get a better final product

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.500
anyway. You don't want to play a shitty

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500
game that was rushed and you know.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.500
It's like the dinner that, imagine

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.500
dinner. And imagine

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500
I will imagine dinner, thank you.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.500
But imagine someone's making it in

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.500
a huge rush and it just doesn't have any

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.500
effort put into it. Oh, that's me every week night.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.500
Or you have someone who takes

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.500
time and prepares the ingredients with love in their

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.500
heart. Oh, Alan cooking.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.500
But you know the difference between a

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.500
dinner created with

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.500
care versus something that's just like

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500
oh, here's food to put in your mouth. I know very well

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.500
the difference between what Alan cooks and what I cook, yes.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.500
Anyway.

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.500
Am I wrong?

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.500
I haven't had your cooking, Rob.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.500
Let's just say I know how to use a

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.500
Foreman grill.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.500
And that's the end of the sentence.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500
Alright. Well,

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.500
I'm going to teach you a thing or

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.500
three one day. I'm going to teach you how to cook

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.500
Cajun. I don't want to

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.500
cook Cajun. Well,

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.500
Cajun is tasty.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.500
All right.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.500
I have tried. You know what? I tried.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500
I was like, I'm going to go on to like Ina

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.500
Garten's website and download recipes

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.500
and I'm going to cook something and like every

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.500
time I do it,

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.500
it's like that Netflix show

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.500
nailed it. Except like my shit

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.500
is just straight up inedible.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.500
I'm like, why did I follow the

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.500
directions and the chicken is uncooked?

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500
I'll tell you this. Honestly enough,

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.500
and again, not meaning to sell something,

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.500
but watch the Gordon

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.500
Z Kitchen Basics and Binging with Babish

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.500
Kitchen Basics.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.500
The two of those will give you

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.500
practical demonstrations

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500
and it makes it easy.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500
What about Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg?

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
Martha Stewart. No, I mean,

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500
OK, she's talented. She was a

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500
she was a model. She was like Linda Evangelista

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.500
in the 60s.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500
But but those two

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500
actually

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.500
I was watching the both of those while I

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.500
was sick for my first month

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500
and I used the techniques

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.500
that they showed there to teach myself how to cook things that I could eat.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.500
So just saying.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.500
I'm usually not a big advocate

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.500
for those things, but it's also

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.500
fun when you learn from someone cooking

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.500
while you're watching it and they have a passion

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.500
for it. Same with gaming, right?

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500
Someone plays a game they're getting into.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500
You don't care how badly they're playing it.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.500
They're having fun. You're having fun with them.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.500
There's Twitch in a nutshell.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.500
Just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.500
game of the week. Loki.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.500
I'm so confused by

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.500
I was watching the trailer

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.500
for this game that I'm about to talk about

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.500
and I don't understand it, but I get

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500
why it's being banned.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.500
So, Britain is

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.500
apparently banning a game called

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500
Omega Labyrinth

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.500
Z, which is also

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.500
going to be coming out over here pretty soon on PlayStation 4

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.500
and the Vita.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.500
And it's been banned, I guess,

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.500
in

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.500
other countries as well. Australia, Germany

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.500
New Zealand

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.500
and Ireland.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.500
But apparently

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.500
this is because of

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.500
the adult-like nature of the game.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.500
Basically it has lots of fan service in it.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.500
Lots of fan service.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.500
The game is kind of like a

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.500
traditional RPG

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.500
dungeon crawler type thing, but you collect

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.500
bras and panties

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.500
in the game.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.500
You also have to rescue women from the

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.500
monsters that have been trapped there

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.500
by rubbing

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.500
basically the women.

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:38.500
And then there's something,

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.500
and I couldn't quite get it because the translation's not

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.500
right on this page, something that had to do

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.500
with inspecting breasts.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.500
So I'm not really sure

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.500
what that was, and

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.500
unfortunately the trailer

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.500
doesn't really... I could just see

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.500
myself livestreaming this game, although I'm sure

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.500
it's banned. Breast inspector

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.500
checking in. I don't know what it was like.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.500
And yet they have what they're

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.500
putting something

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.500
like a crystal,

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.500
if you will, between their breasts

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.500
to inspect it, but then the crystal's getting

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.500
bigger. It's clearly a phallic

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.500
item. It's just like

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.500
what the fuck is this nonsense?

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.500
Only the crystal of fallacy can save

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.500
me.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.500
It's just interesting, I guess.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.500
That just makes me think of Evangelion

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.500
Redeath again.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.500
Yeah, they have

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.500
this sequence where

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.500
you're touching parts of

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.500
this person that has

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.500
hearts there, and it's

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.500
groping... I don't know.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.500
I can see why that they may

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.500
have... I've seen

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.500
much worse in games, but I understand

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.500
why this is something that

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.500
they would be banning from the country.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.500
Okay, that's a bit ridiculous,

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.500
okay? It's just fucking...

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.500
that's just American beauty shit right there.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.500
The fucking flower petals.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.500
Oh, yeah.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.500
It's ridiculous. They're Japanese

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.500
companies, man. Making these

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.500
such lewd games.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.500
Where do I pre-order?

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.500
Where are these?

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.500
Where do we pre-order these games?

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.500
No, really, tell me where to find them.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.500
I don't know.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.500
Alright, well something that won't

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.500
be banned, because I think a lot of people

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.500
will be checking this out at their local Dave and Busters

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.500
or a similar arcade, is

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.500
Rampage is coming back to arcades.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.500
That's right, you know, the classic 90s

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.500
game, Rampage, which is one of the

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.500
little mini-games that I got

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.500
a copy of thanks to DarkSakura.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.500
But actually, there is a brand new

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.500
if you weren't aware, there's a Rampage

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.500
movie coming out starring The Rock

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.500
and I don't know. Guys,

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.500
I have to admit, I don't give a shit

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.500
about the Rampage movie. Like, I really don't.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.500
It has nothing to do with the game. And the trailer

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.500
looks shitty to me, but some of you guys are into it.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.500
Rampage in name only. I'm not gonna

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.500
really try to

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.500
crap on your faves, but sometimes it's hard.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.500
Anyway, just in time

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.500
for the film coming out, which by the way is April

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.500
13th. I don't know if you knew. It's gonna take

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.500
on Ready Player One. Did you know that?

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.500
Just a few weeks out. Yeah, because I remember

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.500
they had to bump it up because

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.500
the Avengers got bumped

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.500
up as well. They're like, ah, fuck.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.500
Yeah. So, Rampage

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.500
is coming out April 13th and

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.500
Dave and Busters, as well as Adrenaline Amusance,

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500
they are teaming up to create

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.500
a new video game based on the film.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.500
And guess what? It's a redemption machine.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.500
Of course, you get some tickets

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.500
from it. So anyhow,

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.500
by the way, this is the sixth new

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.500
title from Adrenaline in the past six months.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.500
So you can see the little picture out there of it.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.500
It definitely looks fancy. It looks

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.500
big. It's got a big TV.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500
And it's got the three players and three

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.500
sides. I don't think this is gonna

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.500
look like the classic 90s game at

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.500
all. But that's kinda cool. It's a single

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.500
joystick and a button. And the main focus?

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.500
To play for tickets.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.500
Hopefully this means you get to tear down some

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.500
buildings, though, in a rampage.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.500
By the way, speaking

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.500
of arcade news, I thought this was a good place

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.500
for me to stick in some news about

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.500
Step Mania X. You know, this

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.500
is the new game that Kyle Ward's

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.500
been working on. Is it Step Mania X or Step Mania X?

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.500
I think it is Step Mania X,

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.500
but I can't help but call it Step Mania X.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.500
No, it's Ten. Step Mania

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.500
Ten. I like that. Step Mania Ten.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.500
Okay, Step Mania Ten

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.500
is coming out. I don't think

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.500
it's really that. But anyway, Step

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.500
Revolution is the new name of the company.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.500
So, these cabinets,

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.500
they've already kinda been coming out, but

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.500
they've been targeting, like,

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.500
exergaming types

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.500
of places. They haven't really been targeting

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.500
the arcades. Well, apparently

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.500
now the arcades are going to be

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.500
targeted. That is the next

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.500
direction for the game. How long until Konami

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.500
sues? Who knows, but new,

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.500
I don't think they can because I think the layout

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.500
of this game is different or something. Or actually,

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.500
I think there's something different

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.500
where that's been worked out. There is. There's a center button.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.500
It's set out like DDR, but there's a center button

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.500
on there as well. And we know he's

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.500
worked with Andamiro before.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.500
So, there's probably something going on there. But anyway,

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.500
the and, the thing I liked about it

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.500
when I saw this at MAGFest a couple years ago,

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.500
the monitor, the giant monitor is a touchscreen.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.500
And that's how you control it. So, the

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.500
giant monitor is also a touchscreen. That's how you pick your

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.500
songs. That's how you kinda move things around. I thought that was

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.500
kinda cool. So, anyway, the machine

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.500
will set you back $8,000 to $9,000

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.500
if you want one. But that's

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.500
actually kinda what the going rate is for

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.500
Dance Game Machines. They have conversion kits for

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.500
DDR cabinets, too. Oh, do they? Oh,

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.500
that I was not aware. So, they would not have touchscreens

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.500
if that was the case. Yeah.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.500
Alright, so anyhow, there you go.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.500
You can check that out.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.500
They've already secured distribution for Asian

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.500
territories, but we have no further information

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.500
on that at this time.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.500
But you know what we do have further information on?

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.500
A trip into the gaming vault.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.500
For the Classic Game of the Week.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.500
Oh, honey.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.500
Forget these arcade machines

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.500
with fancy, dancy

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.500
touchscreen machines.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.500
Back in the day, your arcade machines

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.500
ran vector graphics. You liked it.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.500
Oh,

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.500
honey. The Classic Game

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.500
of the Week. Dark Soccer's gonna jump into the

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.500
gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.500
hey, even though this game is only

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.500
in two colors, you should be checking

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.500
this game out. Yep.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.500
Am I right? This wasn't on the color device.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.500
No, it was not. Alright.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.500
I'm giving you a little hint. Here it is.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500
The Classic Game of the Week.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.500
Classic Game of the Week is

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.500
Wario Land Super Mario Land 3.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.500
Which, honestly, shouldn't have been

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.500
a Mario Land game, but what the fuck ever.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500
It is a platformer developed

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.500
by Nintendo for the Game Boy

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.500
in 1994.

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:28.500
Yay.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.500
It is the first game to feature Wario

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.500
as a playable character and as the

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.500
main character and the first

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.500
appearance of Captain Syrup.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.500
Yep. Captain Syrup.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.500
Wario Land

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.500
is, it is a

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.500
platformer, but it is

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.500
um,

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.500
like these different courses, you

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.500
know, that you go through ending in a boss

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.500
fight and Wario has the

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.500
power to bump into enemies or jump

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.500
on them to knock them over. They are stunned

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.500
and they can be picked up and thrown at other

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.500
enemies very, you know, um,

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.500
Super Mario Brothers 2

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.500
esque or Doki Doki Panic

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:06.500
esque. And then when he's in

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.500
his grown up form, he can do a shoulder

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.500
charge that is used to attack

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.500
enemies or break blocks and open

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.500
treasure chests.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.500
I'm sorry, I've been distracted by the

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.500
Smoosh. He's adorable.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.500
Yes, Mr. Smoosh has made his way into studio

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.500
which, by the way, I have to

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.500
add, did you see the Instagram? Did you see the picture

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.500
of him in his new tie? Yes. Isn't that

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.500
the most adorable fucking thing you've ever seen?

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.500
But he didn't, he will wear the

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.500
tie, but after a little while, he

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.500
starts to think that it's string

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.500
that he likes to chase

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.500
so he starts to, like, scratch that, so

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.500
I had to take it off him because he was driving himself bonkers.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.500
Yeah, but, um,

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.500
if you follow me on Instagram, look at

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.500
Dark Sakura, and I have

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.500
a cute little picture of Smooshy when I trapped him in the

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.500
bathroom. Well, then you ought to be following

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.500
Mr. Smoosh, spelled out M-I-S-T-E-R

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.500
Smoosh, on Instagram.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.500
So back to Wario. Oh, yes.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.500
Mr. Wario. He can get three unique

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.500
helmets. Um,

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.500
each of these helmets have their own ability.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.500
There's the bull helmet that gives

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.500
Wario extra strength and doubles

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.500
the length of his shoulder charge attack.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.500
Sorry, I just have to probably, once again,

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.500
the two seconds I have Google up

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.500
never fails. Allen sends me a message on

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Gchat, which is our preferred way of talking to each other.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.500
I pull it up for two seconds to get the YouTube

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.500
link for tonight. There's the message.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.500
Anyway, with that being said,

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.500
Allen is asking if anyone wants Starbucks,

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.500
so get your orders in.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.500
Can't. Alright.

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.500
Thank you. Low-key, anything?

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.500
Very important business, everybody.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.500
The stream's probably dropping right now.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.500
Anyways, you can't hear this part. Alright.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.500
Oh, yes, Wario. Wario box.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.500
So, um,

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.500
the other thing with the

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.500
bull helmet is that it lets

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.500
him smash through blocks more

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.500
easily, and he, um,

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.500
can stick onto ceilings and

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.500
perform a butt stomp into the ground, where he

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.500
can stun all the enemies around him

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.500
and break through the blocks underneath.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.500
He also gets a jet helmet that gives

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.500
him, uh, increases his running

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.500
speed and lets him fly

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.500
horizontally in the air,

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.500
um, as well to do an underwater

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.500
shoulder charge.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.500
And then the dragon helmet lets

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.500
Wario shoot, um,

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.500
like, these bursts of flame,

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.500
like, as a flamethrower, on land

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.500
and underwater, which destroys enemies and

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.500
blocks on contact, and it replaces

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.500
his shoulder charge while he's wearing the

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.500
dragon helmet, which the dragon helmet is,

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.500
honestly, probably one of my favorites.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.500
You can also get a star man to get temporary

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.500
invincibility. Um, if Wario takes

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.500
damage, he shrinks, losing his shoulder charge

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.500
move, and he will stay small until

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.500
he collects a clove of garlic, a

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.500
helmet, or gets to the end of the level

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.500
because, you know, Wario's supposed to have a

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.500
problem with body odor. If he's hit while

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.500
he's small, or is hit by an

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.500
instant kill obstacle, like lava,

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.500
he will lose a life.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.500
So, now the coins

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.500
don't work the way they do

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.500
in the traditional Mario game. The coins are

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.500
actually currency. So they can

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.500
be earned by collecting, fighting them in blocks,

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.500
shoulder charging enemies. If

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.500
he acquires ten or more coins in the level,

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.500
he can pull, um,

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.500
get a ten coin piece that he can

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.500
throw at an enemy, and pick back

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.500
up, so he can throw, he can kill people

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.500
with money in this game.

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.500
He can also, um, spend it to open

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.500
level exits, or activate

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.500
checkpoints, and extra lives

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.500
that are, uh,

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.500
achieved by collecting heart points,

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.500
which are earned by defeating bosses and

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.500
collecting hearts. And you get,

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.500
um, an extra heart, an extra

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.500
life every 100 points.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.500
At the end of each level, you can choose whether to

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.500
gamble the coins that you have collected in a game

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.500
of chance, or spend them to try

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.500
and earn heart points.

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.500
Um, certain levels have

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.500
a locked treasure room that, uh,

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.500
each of them contains a unique treasure.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.500
So to use the treasure, you have to find the

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.500
key within the level, carry it to the treasure room,

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.500
and you cannot use your abilities

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.500
while you're carrying the key, kind of like in

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.500
Dracula X, you know? You pick

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.500
up the key as your item,

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.500
and you have to get it to the door before

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.500
you can use it. Like, it's funny, like, in

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.500
Dracula X, if you try to use the key, he just gets

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:06.500
a question mark, and goes, huh? But

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.500
I would imagine, yeah, it's very similar

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.500
that you can't use any of

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.500
your, uh,

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.500
your, uh, abilities while you're carrying

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.500
the key. Um,

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.500
so,

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.500
yeah, you can't really do any of these other things

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.500
until you use the key.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.500
And so the game's ending also,

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.500
uh, depends on

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.500
how much, how many coins

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.500
you end with, and how much of the treasure that you've

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.500
gotten. So,

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.500
basically, um, the game

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.500
itself was a big success.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.500
It sold, um, 5.19

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.500
million copies worldwide.

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.500
And it was listed as one of the most,

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.500
one of the 13 top Game Boy

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.500
games, uh, in Game Informer.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.500
And it was, to this date,

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.500
called one of the most successful, uh, spinoff

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.500
series, I think that's until the Yoshi's

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.500
series got big. And most importantly,

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.500
lots of positive reaction from

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.500
chat to this game. Yeah.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.500
Um, it also, uh,

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.500
it actually was a sequel to Super Mario

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.500
Land 2, 6 Golden Coins.

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.500
Um, but it also spawned its own

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.500
sequels, Virtual Boy Wario Land,

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.500
Wario Land 2, Wario Land 3,

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.500
4, and Wario Land Shake It.

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.500
I was gonna say, they made like 5 Wario, like, they made

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.500
a ton of these fun games. Wario Land Shake It was such a great

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.500
game, and it's so sad that it didn't do

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.500
well. And then other titles,

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:22.500
of course, that came out after the success of Wario

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.500
Land included Wario World, Wario

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.500
Master of Disguises, and the WarioWare

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.500
Ink series. Um,

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.500
also, there were other spinoff

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.500
titles, um, that referred to

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.500
Wario Land.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.500
There's P-Cross 2, and Wario has

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500
Safari Helmet

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.500
that came in, uh, one of those

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.500
titles, and Wario's

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.500
Amiibo board map in Mario Party 10

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.500
features his Safari Helmet as

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.500
a background element. In Mario Kart 7,

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.500
Wario's build

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.500
transformation is on a billboard in

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.500
the Wario, uh, Shipyard racetrack,

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.500
and his music is the main theme of Wario Land.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.500
And there you go, that's the game.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.500
Alright, awesome, your classic game of the week.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.500
All the way back on the Game Boy, and not

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.500
the Color Game Boy, just the Game Boy.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.500
It is, uh, Wario Land.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.500
You know what, I don't know if I've mentioned this before,

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.500
but not necessarily for

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.500
Wario, because I think Wario's name is a

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.500
pun on Warui,

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.500
but I always thought that Waluigi's name was a

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.500
better pun, because it would be Waruigi.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.500
Warui is bad.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.500
I didn't think of that.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.500
And that, and I think, Waluigi

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.500
would actually kind of translate to

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.500
sick man. You know, it's a good

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.500
thing they didn't put out, uh, pictures of

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.500
Waluigi in Mario Tennis in high

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.500
definition, because you know there were people

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.500
out there this, uh, week trying to figure out just how

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.500
big Luigi's schlong is,

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.500
from some of the pictures

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.500
that are out there where I guess Luigi has a

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.500
defined, um, bulge.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.500
Yeah, he does not have the

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.500
Barbie doll thing going on. He has things

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.500
in common with the Goblin

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.500
King. Yeah.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500
By the way, proven

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.500
it was a codpiece.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.500
Just saying.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.500
David Bowie's little friends.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.500
Someone did the research. Alright, we're gonna take a break

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.500
and do some research of our own, but we'll be back with

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.500
plenty more Orange Lounge Radio, including

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.500
rapid fire news, release dates, the mail

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.500
bag, uh, we'll get to some more stories too,

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:12.500
including, yep, we gotta talk about

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.500
Toys R Us. I know we talked about it a little bit last

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.500
week, but it's coming

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.500
this week. So we're gonna talk about Toys R Us and

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.500
KB Toys. Yeah.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.500
Yeah, we're gonna talk about all that when we come back, uh,

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.500
with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.500
this.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.500
Welcome

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.500
back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.500
live on this Sunday evening.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.500
Episode number 723 of our show

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.500
for March the 18th of

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.500
2018. Uh, it's, uh,

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.500
kind of a rough night here live,

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:42.500
um, but, uh, yeah, I wanna thank

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.500
you guys that are sticking with it, uh,

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.500
despite all the, uh, intermittent drops and so forth.

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.500
On the podcast feed, everything sounds normal,

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.500
I'm sure, cause, uh, that's, that's kinda

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.500
why we, again, try to keep things going

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.500
even though there is downtime as soon as

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.500
by the time y'all download this on the podcast feed,

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.500
everything sounds normal and just fine the way it

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500
is supposed to be. But I appreciate

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.500
you guys sticking with us live. I also appreciate

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.500
Bobby Black Wolf is, uh, he's been the one

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.500
that's been kinda chatting with our, uh,

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.500
people that we pay money for to host this show

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.500
and, uh, trying to get everything worked out.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.500
I understand maintenance has to be done.

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.500
It has to be done, like, throughout the week.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.500
How many, how many live hours does

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500
Voget Network have on it? There's, like, four tonight

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.500
and two or three on Tuesday.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.500
I think that's, like, all the live shows we've

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.500
had right now. So out of those, like, less than

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.500
ten hours that we're live a week, this has to be

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.500
the hour they want to do stuff anyway.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.500
Anyway, uh,

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.500
live here as you're listening to the show,

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.500
um, hopefully you heard the music there from

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.500
Soul Calibur. I can't, I can't play that stuff

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.500
on the podcast feed, cause that would be, you know,

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.500
they want you to buy the soundtracks and stuff,

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.500
but, uh, you heard some Soul Calibur music here

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.500
live, and, uh, it just

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.500
made me think. It, it missed our show roll tonight

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.500
cause we, we talked about it a couple weeks ago

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.500
when it was really, uh,

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.500
we talked about it a couple weeks ago when it was

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.500
rumored, and the rumors had a lot of steam with it,

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.500
but, uh, Geralt, uh, from The Witcher

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.500
confirmed, so Namco actually put

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.500
out the trailer that shows him in the game,

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.500
so everything out there, uh, is confirmed, and,

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.500
uh, what do you think of that addition, Dark Soccer?

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.500
I know you've, you're a Soul Calibur fan.

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.500
I was a Soul Calibur fan. Oh, you're not a Soul Calibur?

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.500
I haven't played a Soul Calibur game since the

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.500
GameCube one. Oh, okay.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.500
Yeah, so, I really...

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.500
You didn't even try four? Not really.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.500
With, uh, Star Wars? No. Like, Starkiller or something?

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.500
It just seemed, like,

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.500
excessive. Yeah.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.500
I kinda didn't care anymore.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.500
I still love Soul Calibur, except the only Soul Calibur

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.500
I didn't like was the free one. The free one

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.500
that was on PlayStation 3 was awful.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.500
I don't think I even looked at that one. Oh, don't.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.500
It'll ruin the whole series for you.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.500
Well, we can't have that, but, I mean, back in the day,

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.500
though, I mean, Dan and I used to play

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.500
a bunch of, uh, Soul Edge.

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.500
Yeah. You know,

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500
especially cause it had that, um,

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.500
amazing soundtrack to it.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
It was one of the must-have games on the Dreamcast, too.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.500
It really was. No, I'm talking about

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.500
Soul Edge, not the first Soul Calibur. Oh, sorry.

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.500
Yes. Right. Or Soul Bla-

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.500
It was Soul Blade, sorry, was the...

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.500
And it had, oh, god,

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.500
what was the name of the group that did the

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.500
intro to it? But it had that amazing

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.500
intro to it. And we had, um,

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.500
the soundtrack for it that had, like, the long version

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.500
of it. It was really awesome. Yeah.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.500
So. You know, it was really

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.500
Soul Calibur 2 was probably the pinnacle of the

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.500
series for me. I kind of, I remember,

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.500
you know, just from the music gaming

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.500
roots of the show, I remember we used to go

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.500
to Roseville-Gothland and we played DDR.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.500
But because there were so many of us playing DDR, you know,

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:24.500
we often had to wait, like, 20 minutes in between

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.500
turns. So there was a lot of us that

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.500
while somebody else was playing, we'd go play Soul Calibur 2.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.500
Yeah. And the arcade machine had that

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.500
really cool, like, you would log

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.500
in the machine, right, with, like, your initials

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.500
and your birthday or something. Yeah. And then you, like,

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.500
could claim your team, and then you would,

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.500
like, fight other people. Like, it was a really

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.500
cool mode that I think

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.500
was ahead of its time in many ways. And then we'd go find, like,

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.500
whoever, if we knew who it was, and be like,

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.500
hey, we just kicked your ass. Yeah.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.500
Because the computer would try to emulate that person,

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.500
but we all know, we all know it was nothing

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.500
like playing against a real human. Like playing the real thing.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.500
There were a few out there that would be kind of

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.500
tough, that would give them a tough AI. Sure.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.500
But, like, you have to really

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500
play, like, that character, like, a bunch of times

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.500
to get the AI to change on it. Yeah.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.500
You know. Yeah. So I'm really,

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.500
I'm going to check out Soul Calibur 6. I'm excited.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.500
I kind of, I skipped five.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.500
Wasn't five, like, exclusive to PlayStation 3?

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:14.500
Or something? I don't remember.

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.500
I think it was. And I think at that point I was

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.500
really burned out from the free one and so forth.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.500
So I kind of skipped Soul Calibur 5.

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.500
But I will check out Soul Calibur 6.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500
I'm excited. And I think Geralt is a,

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500
it makes sense. It's a logical,

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.500
like, what video game universe character.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500
Like, they're not going to have Waluigi.

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.500
Sorry, guys. Waluigi's not going to be Soul Calibur.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.500
Wah.

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.500
I don't know why it's so funny.

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.500
Just, those big,

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.500
grandiose intros

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500
that they do, you know, like, we shall

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.500
test the blade of eternity through the soul

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.500
of time. And then, wah.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.500
And then there's, like, a fart.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.500
He wears fart caliber.

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.500
Okay, let's do

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:00.500
some rapid fire news. I'm going to get into

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.500
a laughing fit like I did on this week, Shaking

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.500
and Crying, which, if you didn't listen to Shaking

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.500
and Crying this week, cheap plug, but

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.500
I got into a laughing fit for like, two minutes

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.500
straight. And it had to do with Thelma and Louise, so I'm gonna

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.500
leave it at that. Okay.

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.500
And then they drove off the edge.

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.500
It's Victoria and I re-enacting it. Anyway,

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.500
moving on. And remember, don't fuck the guy who

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.500
wants to steal your money.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.500
Moving on, I have to say

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.500
biiitch.

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.500
Ahahaha!

01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.500
Alright.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.500
Low key. Let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.500
To register

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.500
participation for this week's episode of

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:39.420
OrangeLaundry80 with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, boot.

01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:42.240
Let's talk about Sonic.

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:46.960
So Sonic Mania is getting a re-release as Sonic Mania Plus.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:51.260
They're gonna be doing a physical release along with some additional features added

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.260
to it.

01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:57.340
So they're gonna have two new playable characters, Mighty and Ray, and a new Encore mode, a four-player

01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.340
competitive mode.

01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.340
Oh no.

01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:01.740
Wait, is this Mighty number 10?

01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:02.740
It might be.

01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:03.740
Oh no.

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.980
More like Mighty number 2.

01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:11.940
And a deluxe packaging with a holographic slipcover, reversible Genesis Mega Drive sleeve,

01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:13.900
and 32-page artbook.

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.660
And SSG100, Matt, I'm kidding with the Mighty number 9 jokes.

01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:18.660
It's all in good fun.

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:20.620
I did get the game free on PlayStation Plus.

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:21.620
Anyway.

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:22.620
Yes.

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:23.620
Oh yeah, Sonic Mania Plus, yes.

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.620
As did I.

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:29.660
So they'll be coming out this summer on Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4.

01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:30.920
So check those out.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:34.160
That's cool, except for the fact, you know, I already bought this game one time, so I

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:38.360
don't know if I'm excited to buy it again, but it was a really solid Sonic game, so.

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:45.560
What, are you excited to watch a Sonic Mania Adventures cartoon, perhaps?

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:50.640
That's because they're gonna be making five animated shorts starring Sonic Tails and Knuckles

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:57.980
as part of the Sonic Mania Adventures, and it's gonna be, they say, a dialogue-free thing

01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:03.900
that's gonna be relying just on music and visuals to tell the story.

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:06.420
Neat, I guess.

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.420
It's a cartoon.

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:10.020
It looks better than the other cartoon that they put out, so.

01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:15.820
I think it would be okay, because it's not that, whatever that really shitty Sonic thing

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:18.820
was, you know, it had no- It's best not to try to remember what it was.

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:23.820
Will they be giving Sonic new friends?

01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:26.100
I think Sonic just needs to find some new friends.

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:28.180
Maybe Sonic needs to move to a new city.

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.420
Maybe it's time for Emerald Hill Zone to no longer be the first act.

01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.260
Maybe- Are you suggesting that he needs, like, new

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.260
sunk city or something?

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:38.340
Yeah, actually, yes I am.

01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:46.100
He needs to move to New Donk City and be friends with Waluigi!

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:47.940
Quick move on before we get back to that.

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:58.420
Well, in yet another game tease, there was a post on Twitter teasing a new Sonic Racing

01:33:58.420 --> 01:33:59.420
game.

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:04.620
They have the Sonic R from the Sega Saturn in there as well, but yeah, it says Sonic

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:05.620
Racing.

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:12.700
I did, however, laugh at the response from CEO Kaz Harai, who said, I'll be excited if

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:16.580
it says Sonic Retires.

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:22.460
Hey, I like Sonic R. So yeah, new Sonic Racing game.

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:25.660
So maybe there'll be a follow-up with a Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing transfer game.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.660
That would be cool.

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.300
It was a great racing game.

01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:29.300
So yeah.

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:30.300
Danica Patrick!

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:31.300
Come on!

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:32.300
Danica Patrick!

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:33.820
Come back to me!

01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.860
What other weird characters could they put in there?

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:41.140
They should just, like, just go full all out like, you know, they were doing before.

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:44.620
He's not a Sega character!

01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:45.620
Why would not?

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:47.380
Like, Sonic is in Smash Bros.

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:48.820
Isn't he in Mario Kart?

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.740
No, Waluigi is not in Mario Kart.

01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:52.540
Man, what is all the hate for him?

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.620
Because Nintendo fucking hates him.

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:56.540
At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:57.620
You gave him life.

01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:59.540
You can't hate him.

01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.540
Yeah?

01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:01.540
Ehh.

01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:02.540
Alright.

01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:04.540
He'll start his own.

01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:06.780
It'll be just Waluigi Racing.

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.020
He has his own courses, though.

01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:09.540
Yeah, I'm all for that.

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:14.620
Anyway, you can relive other Sega Genesis classics in an all-new Sega Genesis collection

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.740
that's coming out for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:22.300
It was leaked through some art that was posted early to Sega's press site and, of course,

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:23.660
the press said, well, you posted it.

01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:24.660
We're running with it.

01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.740
So, Sega did have to confirm it.

01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:33.620
They are releasing on May 29th for the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, but not the Switch.

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:38.900
The Sega Genesis Classics collection, which will contain over, er, more than 50 titles,

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:44.420
so yeah, over 50 titles, meaning online multiplayer, achievements, mirror modes, to make the game

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.100
a little harder, rewind, and save states.

01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:52.140
You can check out the official page, MegadriveClassics.com, I mean, that's the Europe version, but whatever.

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.720
You can check that out.

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:58.540
Over 50 games in the collection, including, let's see, Sonic the Hedgehog, Altered Beast,

01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:03.020
Streets of Rage, Space Harrier, Gunstar Heroes, Revenge of Sanobi, Toejam and Earl.

01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.860
I know I saw the Alex Kidd Genesis game in there, too, so that's cool, because that wasn't

01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.380
in the last collection, so yeah, very cool.

01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:14.740
But yeah, no Nintendo Switch version, although, Loki, wanna guess?

01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:16.620
Why aren't they gonna put this on Nintendo Switch?

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:20.020
Virtual Console, that doesn't exist, but, you know.

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:23.380
But will eventually, and they can charge you $5 a pop.

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:26.300
Because they're greedy fuckers, and they, you know.

01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.300
You'll pay it.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.300
Well, maybe not you specifically, but somebody will.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.300
No, I'm not gonna pay it.

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:35.060
I'll just get one of their fucking, I don't know, I'll get something.

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:36.460
I'll use my PC!

01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:39.020
Well, maybe you'll pay for this.

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:43.720
Super Bomberman R, which was a pretty successful Switch game, considering, you know, it was

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.100
a launch Bomberman title, it did pretty well.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:50.220
It's actually gonna come out on other platforms, but this is interesting, each platform is

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:52.500
getting an exclusive character.

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:57.180
So Super Bomberman R is gonna be released for the Xbox One, with the little chibi Master

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:00.100
Chief will be added to the bombing arena.

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:04.900
And for the PlayStation 4, you get Ratchet, from Ratchet and Clank, we'll be joining that.

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:09.700
And again, this is pretty cool, on the PC, you will get Peabody, from Portal 2.

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.000
He was one of the co-op robots.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.460
So Peabody from Portal will be an additional character in that game.

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:17.860
That's pretty neat.

01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:22.460
So you can check that out with all the DLC and updates, of course, will be included in

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.460
that.

01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:24.460
That's another thing they did very well with that.

01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:28.620
June 12th is when they all come out, except the PC version is a day late.

01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:33.940
But essentially that same week is when all those versions of Super Bomberman R come out.

01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:34.980
Dark Sakura.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:39.380
More stuff coming out.

01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:46.080
Hamster is bringing stuff out to the Japanese eShop for Nintendo.

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:52.540
We have the ACA Neo Geo World Heroes 2 Jet and Moon Patrol will both be coming out on

01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:54.780
March 22nd.

01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:57.700
World Heroes is actually a really fun series.

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:01.660
It wasn't amazing, but it was really fun.

01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:08.800
And then Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja will be out for the Switch on March 21st, I guess

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.300
as the prelude.

01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:14.140
But are you a bad enough dude to beat the Dragon Ninja?

01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:19.660
Well, I know the line is usually, are you a bad enough dude to save the president?

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:20.660
And I'm just kind of going-

01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:21.660
Why would you want to?

01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:24.740
Do I want to?

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:29.780
Are you a bad enough dude to totally not give a shit about saving the president?

01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.620
Why yes, we are.

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:40.380
And then Microsoft's E3 2018 press conference has a date that will be June 10th for those

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:41.380
who care.

01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:46.620
I probably care more about that than I do about saving the president.

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:51.580
I probably care more about a stinky dog shit than the president.

01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:53.580
Just saying.

01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:56.540
Well I'm excited for Microsoft's press conference.

01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:01.140
You know, again, I want to see what big stunts they pull this year, you know, what big exclusives

01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.140
they're going to announce.

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.180
They got to put out a date for Crackdown 3.

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:06.260
That one keeps getting pushed back and back.

01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:07.620
That's got to be this holiday.

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.620
They don't have any time left.

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:09.620
I've stopped caring.

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:10.620
Really?

01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:11.620
Yeah.

01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:12.620
It's taking too long.

01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:13.620
All right.

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:14.620
I've got PC that can run it, so who gives a shit?

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:15.620
Yeah.

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620
Well, yeah, there you go.

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:17.620
When it comes out, you'll get it on PC.

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:18.620
Of course you will.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:19.620
Yeah.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.620
That's still a win for Microsoft.

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.620
So.

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.620
All right.

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:23.620
Anyway-

01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:24.620
Is it though?

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.780
Because I would have bought their system if they hadn't put it on PC.

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:28.220
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:29.220
Loki.

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:30.220
All right.

01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:35.500
So, coming out this week, we've got Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered on PlayStation 4 and

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:43.060
Xbox One, Assault Gunners HD Edition on PC and PlayStation 4, Attack on Titan 2 on PC

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:46.740
Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:54.020
We have Sea of Thieves coming out this week on Windows 10 and Xbox One, Valkyria Chronicles

01:39:54.020 --> 01:40:03.460
4 on PlayStation 4, Way Out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Detective Pikachu on the

01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:10.220
3DS, and Bobby's new favorite game, Ni No Kuni 2, Revenant Kingdom is coming out this

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:11.220
week.

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:12.700
Mark your calendar, Bobby.

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.740
That is out on PC and PlayStation 4.

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:16.740
They do have a demo available.

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:17.740
Oh, do they?

01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:18.740
I think so.

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:19.740
Oh, great.

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.000
Couldn't give it a whole other try there.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.940
What a great wedding present for Bobby.

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:23.940
There you go.

01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.780
And that's it for this week.

01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:27.780
All right.

01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.780
Moving on to Japan.

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:33.260
Let's get in a plane and travel to Japan and check out some of the releases they get this

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.580
week, including on the PlayStation 4.

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:40.420
Senju no Valkyria 4 comes out on the PlayStation 4.

01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:44.660
And yeah, that is, I believe that is their version of Valkyria Chronicles.

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:48.300
Is that just like a reimagining of the old game or is this like a new one?

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.820
I didn't know there was a new one coming out.

01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:51.620
I think it is a new one.

01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:53.620
And yeah, it's Valkyria Chronicles 4, basically.

01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.620
That's pretty cool.

01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.340
So that's coming out on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:00.180
Also, I guess that's it.

01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:03.100
There's a whole new PlayStation 4 to support that coming out.

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.280
And that is the only release.

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.860
That's a pretty big deal, though.

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:06.940
Is that also on the Vita?

01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:09.180
I'm asking myself, no, it is not.

01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:12.460
But you can check out Ikemen Sengoku.

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:19.780
Toko o Kakeru Koi comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita, as is a game called Dance

01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:22.540
with Devils, My Carol.

01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:23.540
I don't know.

01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:24.540
Is it like Carol Channing?

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:25.540
Like who?

01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.500
Dance with Devils or is that like Carol is a song?

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:28.500
I don't know.

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:29.500
But anyway.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.500
I don't know.

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:33.340
But Carol Channing is still kicking and I'm afraid for the world while she's still alive.

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:40.000
Every single screenshot is like some hetero anime couple dancing in a meadow.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.060
And that's like all this is.

01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:45.620
Oh, and then you got this guy in a cape because there's always some guy in a cape in these

01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:46.620
anime games.

01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:51.900
But he's in a cape, so you know he's cool and he's badass.

01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:57.520
On the Nintendo Switch this week, let's see, Zelda Musou Hyrule All Stars comes out this

01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.520
week.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.520
That is probably a big release.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:02.180
That, of course, is the Hyrule Warriors release on the Switch.

01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:08.240
And then Pri Para All Idol Perfect Stage also out in Japan this week, because if you don't

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:13.940
have enough idol games to play, then you can check out this very pink and purple and OMG,

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:20.940
we're all very super quite happy to be here game where, oh, I thought she was playing

01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:24.960
maracas in that screenshot first, but it turns out it just the background makes it look like

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:30.420
she's playing a heart, like she's shaking a valentine and that's how she plays the instrument.

01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:31.420
I don't know.

01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:32.420
The other one claps her hands.

01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.420
That's a lot easier to follow.

01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.420
I clap my hands.

01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:35.420
I'm contributing too.

01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.540
What's your role in the band?

01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:38.540
I'm the clapper.

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:41.220
I clap my hands together.

01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:43.060
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.540
A few things.

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:54.020
We have on the 20th Sea of Thieves for looks like Xbox One and as well as the the big bundle

01:42:54.020 --> 01:43:00.680
for it, Titan Quest Anniversary Edition for Xbox and PlayStation.

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:06.240
Also on the 20th, we have Assassin's Creed Rogue for Xbox and PlayStation.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:13.960
We have AoT2 by Koei Tecmo on, that's Attack on Titan by the way, on PlayStation, Xbox

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:15.560
and Switch.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:25.240
We have Detective Pikachu on the 23rd, which is going to be adorable.

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:30.120
We also have WWE 2K18 WrestleMania edition.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.080
We have A Way Out.

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:33.840
I'd like a way out.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:41.000
Ni No Kuni 2 Revenant Kingdom and that's it for this week.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.520
All right, well then I think with those releases, it's time to jump into the mailbag.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:46.520
No.

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.520
Yes.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:48.520
No.

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:55.280
Every week, you guys email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com and no server issues

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.280

01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.520
Dark Sakura's going to dive into the mailbag and pick out her favorite emails, which really

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.400
is usually all the emails, unless you're a spammer.

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.120
She filters out the spam.

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.820
She sends the spam- I banish it to the sticky room.

01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:09.240
Back to whence it came.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.760
So here it is.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:14.520
The emails, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:23.320
Hello L.R. as they say, that's not how, that's not how YYR does it, Robert M. He does H-E-L-L

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.960
capital O-L-R instead of doing it as two words.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:29.520
So just telling you if you're going to do it, do it right.

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.560
But clever of you to try.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:37.720
One of the first YouTube videos I remember seeing was piano player Tom Briar, who I have

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:42.880
done for Fortune Cookie a few times, who was sadly incapacitated in the severe auto accident

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:47.960
sight reading an arrangement of KK Slider's KK Ragtime from Animal Crossing, which he

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.140
declared, that's cute.

01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:54.840
Other Ragtime video game music he's included the themed Capcom's Ghosts and Goblins, the

01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:00.680
athletic theme from Yoshi's Island, the piano version of the chirpy, barely dog song from

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.680
Undertale, which works shockingly well as a Ragtime composition.

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:07.460
What's your favorite other Ragtime video game themes?

01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:09.760
Does anything from Cuphead fall into Ragtime?

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:13.600
The closest I can think of is a Dixieland themed winner take all music, and I'm not

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.640
sure that's Ragtime per se.

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:20.360
I'm sure Rob has several Commodore 64 games which explicitly use Joplin's music.

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:27.040
Speaking of the C64, I did see Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb playing a fan made port of Bruce

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:28.880
Lee for the Sega Master System.

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:31.920
Okay, so Ragtime, Ragtime is just a style.

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:37.680
A song doesn't need to specifically be Ragtime to be able to be played in the Ragtime style.

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:43.520
And my favorite one to this day is another one of Tom Breyer's videos, where he does

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:50.840
the Super Mario World ending, and then just starts free, just completely using that theme

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.680
and doing his own variations on it, it was really good.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:46:02.280
He also did, um, it's one of the other Super Mario World musics where, um, usually it's

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.640
on the ones where you have the little platforms that move across and you have to ride the

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.000
platforms on switch boxes and stuff.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.640
I can't help but think of the old theme song to Hoard House, which is my favorite Ragtime

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:15.640
music.

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:19.040
And I don't, did people ever get the joke there?

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.960
Let me just, let me, you guys know the full name of the show was the best little Hoard

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:29.100
House in Azeroth, which, you know, the best little whorehouse in Texas.

01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:34.000
So it was supposed to be like a Ragtime song to make you think of an old saloon where whores

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
are.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000
That was the joke.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I don't know.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
So the Maple Leaf Rag was the theme to that show.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.560
The Maple Leaf Rag is actually a classic.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:45.960
I'm also a fan of Gershwin's Rialto Ripples from 1917, which I believe you can also hear

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:49.040
on the player piano at Disneyland.

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:52.500
You are absolutely right though, that a ton of Commodore 64 stuff would use like Ragtime

01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:54.440
style music in their games.

01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:58.120
Um, didn't Tapper use it in that game?

01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.120
That's what I'm thinking of.

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:02.040
I could never really hear it the last few times I've played it cause it's at Calix stream.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.040
I feel like it was, that's the game that comes to mind.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.760
Of course, in the moment when I'm trying to think of something, I can't think of anything.

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:10.680
I know it was the background music in several games.

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:15.000
Like I remember there was this weird Commodore 64 game that we had that was like, you were

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:20.320
decorating a house and that's what it was, it was like a house decorating game.

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.840
And I think it was supposed to be something for like people that wanted to pretend that

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:27.240
they had a big old house to decorate cause you could decorate mansions and stuff.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.380
And it would just play like Ragtime music in the background while you were working.

01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:34.360
So I have no idea what that music had to do with house decorating, but that's what's coming

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.360
to my mind right now.

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.500
Loki, do you have any interest in Ragtime?

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.120
I have no idea what we're talking about.

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:41.160
I have no idea what Ragtime music is.

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:45.680
It's a style of music that's like, think of like old saloons, old westerns music.

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:50.560
It's more or less the style that was out between, I'd say 1910 and 1925.

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.120
My favorite genre of music?

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:53.120
No.

01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:54.120
I have no idea.

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.120
I don't know.

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:56.120
Well, we've got to follow up to that email.

01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:57.120
Okay.

01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.400
And to start it off, I really need to stop having to do these follow up emails.

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.440
After another listen to the Cuphead soundtrack, the music to the forced follies level, one

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.120
of the first run and gun segments is clearly Ragtime.

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:09.520
That also is Robert M.

01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:14.160
So next email comes from Chris.

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.840
Hello, OLR crew.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:20.320
First thing I want to say is the call from Ronmo was a great perspective to hear on the

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.960
gaming slash gun control issue.

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:24.360
It was heartfelt, emotional and real.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.640
Thanks Rob for letting the call go over.

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.640
You're welcome.

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:29.120
I think that was a really power.

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.000
I'm sorry you weren't here, Jamie, to hear it.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I think you would have really had a-

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.880
I was already sorry I wasn't here, but I'm extra sorry now.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:39.040
I think you would have really had a lot to say on that piece, but we had a lot.

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.680
We had a lot of callers share some very, very powerful stuff.

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:45.680
It was a bonding by the campfire night for sure.

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:48.000
So I had no problem letting that go on.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.560
Well, next I wanted to say thank you for giving us podcasts all these years.

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.640
I've been listening for a long time and I've enjoyed your real takes on subjects that other

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.400
gaming podcasts don't.

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.160
Last week was a great episode.

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.600
My question, however, is something that all gaming podcasts go over, but I still find

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.240
interesting to hear every time.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.080
I wanted to ask you, what do you think we will see from E3 this year and what do you

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.400
hope gets announced?

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:14.400
Oops.

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.800
Sorry, I went early.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:20.440
I'm excited to finally see the Kingdom Hearts 3 release date.

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:25.580
I also want to hear more about the Spyro trilogy, Smash Brothers, and maybe that Avengers game

01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:27.440
from Crystal Dynamics.

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.520
I'm expecting to see a 2019 release date for The Last of Us Part II and a wild prediction

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:36.680
I'll throw out there for Microsoft as the new Banjo Kazooie so that they can win back

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:37.680
fans.

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.240
Once again, thanks for producing these shows and helping me get through my early morning

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:42.240
commutes.

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.280
Also, I sincerely hope the next console generation won't fuck us over.

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:47.280
That's Chris.

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.280
Thanks for the email, Chris.

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.920
What I'd like to see is something meaningful for VR.

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:59.360
I think necessarily, even on PC, or any VR platform actually, there hasn't really been

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:07.080
like that game that you can kind of define this is why I need VR type of thing.

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:12.840
There's a lot of fun games to play, but Sony I don't think has any big first party games

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:18.640
that are like, wow, that's like, this sold me the VR platform type thing.

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.800
I would like to see something like that.

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:24.960
Although I do enjoy playing everything that's on there, it's just, you know, more is better.

01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:29.960
Well, I told you my big thing earlier about what I would dare Microsoft to do.

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:33.920
I would say outside of that, something I was thinking about today, so I was randomly watching

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.960
footage of Final Fantasy XV from PC.

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.960
I was rewatching the ending actually of Final Fantasy XV and I, you know, with all the problems

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:47.960
that game had, and there were problems, the ending to that game was really fucking good.

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:50.520
And that's something Final Fantasy games don't always get right.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.280
And again, I'm not going to spoil, but you can probably figure out what happens.

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.280
It's a Final Fantasy game.

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.200
Of course, you know, it ends.

01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.200
Everyone dies.

01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.200
No one lives.

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.480
Well, I can't really tell you.

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:04.520
But anyway, it's such a fucking good ending in Final Fantasy XV.

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:09.360
It had me thinking, why are we hearing about Final Fantasy XVI yet?

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:10.880
Where's the news on Final Fantasy XVI?

01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:15.480
I know, yes, I know about the VII remake and where is that and all that good stuff.

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:19.560
But I mean, if you logically think about it, okay, Kingdom Hearts III is going to be the

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:23.380
Christmas game this year because they've already said 2018.

01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:24.840
So that's that.

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:28.400
So I would imagine maybe Final Fantasy VII remake is going to be like the winner release

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:32.000
next year, hopefully, hopefully, or at least episode one or whatever.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.400
I think it's I think it's time to tease us a little bit with that number 16.

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.400
Let's see.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.520
Let's see at least what direction they're going in.

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.520
And I'm...

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.520
If they're out of ideas.

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.960
Please, prayer circle with me, everybody.

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:44.960
Everybody out there.

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:45.960
Everybody out there in podcast land.

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:49.720
I'd like you to join hands and prayer circle with me here.

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:54.980
Final Fantasy XVI, please take it back to the Final Fantasy roots.

01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:58.120
I want my black mages to look like black mages.

01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:01.240
My white mages look like white mages, red mages.

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:04.400
I want the feather in their cap.

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.880
Final Fantasy IX.

01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:06.880
Like that.

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:07.880
Like, remember that?

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.920
That's that's like what I want in Final Fantasy XVI.

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.640
What about Final Fantasy...

01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:12.640
That style.

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.200
But, you know, new story.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:17.000
What about like Final Fantasy VI?

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.540
I'm totally OK with that.

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:20.480
I'm totally OK with that.

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:23.680
I wish VI was what they were remaking instead of VII.

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:29.340
More like steampunk magic stuff, you know, than like this is the future and future.

01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:33.180
I am totally OK with that.

01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:34.180
Totally fine with that.

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.180
All right.

01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.180
There's there's my my prediction or whatever.

01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:40.380
I'll just take a remake of Final Fantasy VI in the Final Fantasy XV engine.

01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:41.380
Yes.

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:42.380
Yes.

01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:43.380
Would be fucking amazing.

01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:45.380
Just make a new game in XV's engine to save you time.

01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.740
I want a Metroid game that doesn't suck.

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:47.740
You want what?

01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:48.740
I want a Metroid game.

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:49.740
A new Metroid game that doesn't suck.

01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:51.060
Well, there is Metroid Prime 4.

01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:52.060
I know.

01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:53.060
Or do you want a 2D game?

01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.060
I say...

01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:55.060
I want a 2D game.

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:56.060
Go for a 2D game.

01:52:56.060 --> 01:53:00.580
Go for a WarioWare Shake It or no, Wario Land Shake It, because that was a gorgeous

01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:02.580
like hand drawn 2D game.

01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:08.660
And have them do like a, you know, a nice Metroid game or even hell, was it the company

01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:14.900
has been doing all the like, was it the one that did DK and what else do they do?

01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:19.180
Like I can't remember the name of the company now.

01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:20.180
Think Retro is in the title.

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:21.180
Yeah.

01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:22.180
RetroWare or something like that.

01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:23.180
Yeah.

01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:24.180
Have them do one.

01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:25.180
Oh, I want.

01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:27.020
And Jamie, you're going to agree with me on this.

01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.020
The guys that did Blaster Master Zero.

01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:30.020
Yes.

01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:31.020
I want it.

01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.020
Is it Arc?

01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:34.100
Is that who's what was the name of the company that did Blaster Master Zero?

01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:37.140
I want that company doing a Guardian Legend game.

01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:38.140
Yes.

01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:42.140
But what is Compile done lately?

01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:45.340
I think they do like anime games in Japan.

01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:47.340
They don't do anything that's released here really.

01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:49.340
And they're Compile Heart.

01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:57.460
Compile owns, has the Puyo Puyo still, the Puyo Puyo license, at least they're the company

01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:59.460
that put out Puyo Puyo.

01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:01.220
Oh, so is that their thing now?

01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.220
Oh, Inti Creates.

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:05.100
They, I had to look it up who the company was that made the game.

01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:08.860
And now I'm looking, they've been around a while Inti Creates actually made like Mega

01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:15.180
Man Zero on the Game Boy Advance, Galgun and Galgun 2 are their more recent releases there.

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:17.860
Mighty Gunvolt is something else they did.

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:21.140
Mighty No. 9 is something we forgive them for.

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:22.940
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures.

01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:27.260
But anyway, so yeah, I want them doing a Guardian Legend game please, thank you.

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.260
So last email.

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:29.260
Yes.

01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:30.260
Hello, LR.

01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:32.460
That, by the way, is how it works.

01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.460
Oh, is it YYR?

01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:34.460
It's YYR.

01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:35.460
Of course it is.

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:38.240
I've been busy, so I fell a week behind on OLR.

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:41.580
Now that I've listened to the last two shows over the past few weeks, I've got a lot to

01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:42.580
say.

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:45.660
So this long-winded guy will try for some rapid fire responses.

01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:51.540
First off, thanks Jamie, oh you're welcome, for highlighting the Negecon, remember we

01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:55.940
had to learn how to say it, Negecon, one of my all-time favorite controllers.

01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:00.860
One great thing about it that wasn't mentioned were the two analog face buttons.

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:05.180
They came up far beyond the surface of the controller and had a long travel distance,

01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:10.380
making it easy to step on the gas or brake exactly as far as you wanted.

01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:14.820
One more thing to note, at the time the Negecon released, it was the only available option

01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:19.500
for handheld analog control, as the dual shock and the dual analog controller that preceded

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.900
it were still two years away.

01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:30.100
Rob, you mentioned a new first-person shooter made with the old build engine, releasing

01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:33.540
on Steam at $17.99, and you questioned the price tag.

01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:38.340
I will only respond with a simple question, have you ever paid more than $18 for a 2D

01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.340
pixel art game?

01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:44.620
If your answer is yes, perhaps you'll agree with me when I say old engine 3D game could

01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:48.660
be the next 2D pixel art game if the audience turns out to be there.

01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:52.540
I'm gonna say yes, but they weren't first-person shooters.

01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.340
That's the difference.

01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:57.980
Next up, I'm sorry that I can't remember who said it, but a comment from chat said something

01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:00.100
like SNES Classic is impossible to get.

01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:02.820
I just wanted to say that it's actually not.

01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:07.540
A few weeks ago at my local Best Buy in Hartsdale, New York, one was simply sitting there in

01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:10.700
the Nintendo section, so don't give up, check your stores.

01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:15.340
I've actually been watching it online because I check maybe at least once a week just to

01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:19.580
see what the secondary markets look like, like eBay and stuff, and I've actually seen

01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:24.940
some NES classics that are, someone's like, okay, it's barely used, $70, just get it out

01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:25.940
here.

01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:29.900
I mean, so they're starting to come down.

01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:33.140
I also wanted to congratulate both Rob and Loki for the weight loss progress that they

01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:34.140
mentioned last week.

01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:35.740
Awesome job, keep it going.

01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:36.740
Thanks.

01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:42.740
I will go ahead and say now, I'm not going to go too much into detail, but since October

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:50.540
last year, I have dropped 67 pounds, so we're all losers in this room.

01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:53.260
As I sit here and sip on this Frappuccino.

01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:57.340
Yeah, that was all excess.

01:56:57.340 --> 01:56:58.780
With non-fat milk.

01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:00.580
Mr. Smooch isn't a loser.

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:01.580
No, I love Mr. Smooch.

01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:02.580
He's got a little belly on him.

01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:04.460
He's gotten fatter since we adopted him.

01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:05.460
Yeah.

01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:06.460
I don't know if you know, he's got fat.

01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:08.180
He got some tummy.

01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:09.180
That's all right.

01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:10.180
That's okay.

01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:11.180
Kitty Pudge is cute.

01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:15.380
And, but yeah, 67, I kind of almost fainted.

01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:16.380
Congrats.

01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:17.380
Thank you.

01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:19.380
So what was your, what was your success?

01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:24.700
Oh, you had, I've lost 10 pounds since a few weeks ago.

01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:25.700
Cool.

01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:26.700
Loki.

01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.700
It's been actually two months.

01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:28.700
Congrats.

01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:29.700
I am proud of you guys.

01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:30.700
Thank you.

01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:35.220
And now I want to speculate as to why WART has not come back.

01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:37.780
Well, we've lost count of how many times Bowser has shown up.

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:39.260
I want to hear this.

01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:40.780
It's not because they killed him.

01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:43.660
It was because he never actually existed to begin with.

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:44.660
Remember it was all a dream.

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:48.660
Well, if you tell me, well, that was, what about Shy Guy?

01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:51.260
Just recall that real life things appear in dreams all the time.

01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:52.260
See?

01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:55.780
You just gave the answer I was going to give.

01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:57.220
Dreams are based in reality.

01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:04.600
However, the original incarnation of WART was not in an actual real dream.

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.480
It was supposed to be that they were kidnapped into the.

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:08.480
That's true.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.040
Cause they stole all that from doki doki panic.

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.040
Precisely.

01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.040
Hmm.

01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:14.040
Good call.

01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:17.120
So WART is the dead emperor of his own dimension.

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.120
I just think that Bowser has never been killed.

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:22.400
Where WART, that was a dead frog.

01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:23.400
Sorry.

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:24.720
That, that was dead fog.

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:26.000
Well, crunchy frog.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.020
Nothing is ever really dead in a Mario game.

01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.020
Come on.

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:30.020
But WART is.

01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:31.020
Wah.

01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.020
Wah.

01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:33.020
Wah.

01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:37.500
I think they get the frog suit from wearing his skin.

01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:41.980
On the question of why Luigi's Mansion remake is coming to 3DS and not to the Switch.

01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.560
I remember hearing that one of the things the developers wanted for the original game

01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:46.740
was 3D.

01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:48.780
This is now possible, but not on Switch.

01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:50.220
So maybe that's why.

01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:51.220
Okay.

01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:52.220
But like you could have done it.

01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:53.220
They don't ever use 3D in the 3DS anymore.

01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:54.700
You could have done it five years ago.

01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:55.700
Come on.

01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:58.540
I think it's because they have the engine for the last game and they can just port it

01:58:58.540 --> 01:58:59.540
over to that engine.

01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:01.380
But you know what?

01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:02.380
Wah.

01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:03.740
Yeah.

01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:06.860
That's how you, that's how you, that's how you get me to buy it.

01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:07.860
Wah Luigi's Mansion.

01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:08.860
Wah Luigi's Mansion.

01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.460
I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have said a god damn thing if it was Wah Luigi's Mansion.

01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:14.940
I would have been like, oh cool, we're getting 3DS for another year so we can get Wah Luigi's

01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:15.940
Mansion.

01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:16.940
Fuck yeah, I'm in.

01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:21.580
Just Wah Luigi running around shitting himself.

01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:22.580
Ghost comes out.

01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:23.580
Wah.

01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:25.460
He is the ghost.

01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:26.460
He's haunting people.

01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:27.460
That's the plot twist.

01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:30.820
Is it like, Wah Luigi's exploring the mansion trying to figure out.

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:31.820
Wah.

01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:33.260
Who shit the bed.

01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:35.740
And he's exploring the mansion trying to figure out who shit the bed.

01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:37.140
And then at the end he realizes.

01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:38.140
It was him.

01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:39.620
It was, in fact it was him.

01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:44.660
So you're suggesting like an It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia plot with Wah Luigi and Wario

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:46.780
and.

01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:48.580
Why wouldn't I suggest that?

01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:49.580
That's perfect.

01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:50.580
Calm down.

01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:52.940
Okay, so there's a little bit more to this email.

01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:53.940
Alright.

01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:59.320
On the big violence slash political discussion that ended last week's episode, I will only

01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:00.320
add one thing.

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:03.800
I totally agree with the point that Congress is overwhelmingly made up of crotchety old

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:06.520
people who don't understand gaming at all.

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:08.400
Only two words can fix this.

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.080
Term and limit.

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:13.720
I wish there was some way this could happen because it's desperately needed.

02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:14.720
Sigh.

02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:17.840
And for the record, I'd greatly agree with you.

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.880
Here's how you do it.

02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:20.800
You vote for somebody else.

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.680
Yeah, vote.

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:26.440
And you know what I think is amazing, that's pointed out, is that all of these kids that

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:32.180
have walked out marching will either, you know, especially the upperclassmen, will be

02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:35.440
able to vote this year.

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.520
Or will be able to register to vote this year.

02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.680
And again, I'm going to watch very carefully not to get too political.

02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:46.360
So please, Jamie, I will say here in this very state, we are watching what's happening

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.500
with Dianne Feinstein.

02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:50.080
And she's been in there forever.

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.000
And there are people, and I have not decided where I'm voting in that yet.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.100
I want to hear more about the different positions.

02:00:56.100 --> 02:01:00.000
But she is facing a real challenge right now from somebody else.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.700
And so in some ways, that is almost the term limits thing kind of playing it out.

02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:06.180
This challenger is another Democrat.

02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:10.020
It's Kevin de Leon, is his name, he was a former speaker here, is challenging Dianne

02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:11.020
Feinstein.

02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:15.060
And when they did the poll at the Democratic convention or whatever, he actually got more

02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.060
votes.

02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:17.060
It wasn't enough to give him an endorsement.

02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:20.660
But you're definitely watching this whole, like, some people...

02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:22.060
The old guard needs to be removed.

02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:23.060
Yeah.

02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:27.020
People feel that Dianne Feinstein, you know, thank you for your service, but it's time

02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:28.020
for somebody else.

02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:30.620
Again, I don't know where I'm at yet myself.

02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:33.220
I'm just noticing this is in the news.

02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:34.740
Yeah.

02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:39.280
And last but not least, Rob, I noticed that you asked for super multitasking on Switch

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.280
twice.

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.280
I sure did.

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:43.620
On both last week's episode and the one before it.

02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.740
I'm honored that you would love to have such a thing.

02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:51.740
But until there is a demonstrated demand for versions that are currently available, I'm

02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:53.580
sorry to say it's not possible.

02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:57.060
So if you're listening and you want this thing, please support the game on Steam by playing

02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:59.160
and especially reviewing it.

02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:01.580
Thank all of you for your continued support.

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.500
Okay, back to work on an update.

02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:05.140
I hope you all have a great week.

02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:06.140
Have fun.

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:07.140
Aaron Yyr.

02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:12.260
I totally respect Aaron, because I know this thing is a labor of love and all that stuff.

02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:14.140
And he has stuff going on in his personal life, too.

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:15.820
So let me just say, as much as I'm...

02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:18.940
I'm going to continue to beg and plead for it, and that's just the way it's going to

02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:19.940
be.

02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:21.180
I totally respect your reasoning.

02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:22.180
You're right.

02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:30.340
Like, if it's not selling like crazy on Steam, as it deserves to be, then why would you take

02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:31.780
the effort to make a Switch version?

02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:34.820
So again, y'all should check out Super Multitask.

02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:36.380
I'm telling you, if you're a streamer, it's fun.

02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:38.180
Everyone play it at least once, all at the same time.

02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:40.500
Yeah, and it's a great streaming game.

02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:44.700
I don't know why this has not caught wildfire on streams.

02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:48.820
Picking what does and doesn't go viral is so weird to me.

02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:51.700
I almost wonder if this is one of those games that just isn't going to get discovered for

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:53.220
like six months or something.

02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:54.220
I don't know.

02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:55.220
We'll see.

02:02:55.220 --> 02:03:00.580
Um, I was going to say, I wonder, you know, with all the E3 stuff around the corner, I

02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:05.900
wonder how much money we'd have to give Danny DeVito to cosplay as Detective Pikachu during

02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:10.380
the Nintendo Direct event that time.

02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:11.820
Can they give him that kind of money, please?

02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:14.100
Because I would love to see that.

02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:18.140
All right, well, never say never, I suppose.

02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.140
All right.

02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:20.580
Is that it for emails?

02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:21.580
That's it.

02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:22.580
Stephanie.

02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:23.580
All right.

02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:27.980
Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you want to get in on the emails next week.

02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:30.420
But for now, we're back to the news with Loki.

02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:32.260
Ah, yes.

02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:36.020
So unfortunately, you know, we did talk a little bit about how Toys R Us was going to

02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:40.100
be closing some of its stores, um, soon.

02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:46.340
Well, now it's become all of its stores because they're unable to secure a buyer for it.

02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:52.380
And so unfortunately, they will be closing all of its 735 stores in the US.

02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:56.060
I believe, though, in Canada, those stores are getting purchased by another company and

02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:57.420
will stay on as Toys R Us.

02:03:57.420 --> 02:04:02.220
So Toys R Us still lives on in the great nation of Canada, but just not over here in the United

02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:03.220
States.

02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:10.780
So yeah, that's so depressing, because that's like a huge piece of gaming history, a huge

02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:15.740
piece of my childhood right there just kind of gone away.

02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:21.180
And I know that a lot of the reason that they haven't done well is because of just other

02:04:21.180 --> 02:04:24.780
companies, you know, being like, you know, Target or Walmart and stuff like that, having

02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:29.620
their own toy departments, but I don't know, even those don't have like the breadth of

02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:32.740
selection that, you know, Toys R Us has.

02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:40.100
It's not the same. And I guess there's online stuff, but yeah, it's not going to be as fun

02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:44.660
as going into a store and actually being able to check everything out.

02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:49.700
I don't think it's online so much as it's Walmart and Target have really put a dent

02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:50.700
in it.

02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:54.820
And I think Toys R Us has just been like extremely mismanaged, like they're not paying their

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:59.400
employees competitively, so they're not attracting the, you know, level of talent you need.

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:04.960
They're not like they're just they're just they're Toys R Us is stuck in the 90s in more

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:09.280
ways than when I talk about these fascinating, wow, I went to a Toys R Us today and it's

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:11.600
still stuck in like the 1990s.

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:17.040
That's not necessarily a compliment like and that's the same thing that I felt about Kmart.

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:20.080
And now those are like all at least in this area, they're like completely gone in this

02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:21.080
area.

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.120
And there's one like in Auburn, maybe.

02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:25.560
Yeah, it's probably another time machine up there.

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:32.120
Well, the thing that really just grinds me over this one is that the the CEO and upper

02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:37.800
management are making it out with all of this bonus money that they've been approved to

02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:43.200
receive yet long term full time employees are getting zero severance and no extension

02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:44.560
of benefits.

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:46.880
Bobby Blackwell also points this out about Toys R Us.

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:50.340
I know he talked about that a little bit on his show about this, but Bain Capital and

02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:54.860
two other partners bought Toys R Us for six point six billion, but borrowed five point

02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:58.820
three billion of it and stuck it on Toys R Us debt they had to pay down and they can

02:05:58.820 --> 02:05:59.820
never pay it down.

02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:02.640
Toys R Us was in the black when they got bought.

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:06.980
So basically these investors purchased it up, stuck the debt on the company and never

02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:08.380
recovered.

02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:09.940
So shitty.

02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:13.660
So why are these people getting the huge dollar payouts?

02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:16.020
Because the government's letting him do it.

02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:18.420
Who's in charge of the government right now?

02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:19.980
Corporations?

02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:20.980
Pretty much.

02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:21.980
We are.

02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:22.980
Look out.

02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:23.980
We'll take it back.

02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:25.220
They're supposed to work for us.

02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:30.560
So speaking of blasts from the past, since we're talking about Toys R Us, guess what's

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:34.300
planning to return maybe since Toys R Us is going away?

02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:35.300
KB Toys.

02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:36.300
Really?

02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:37.300
OK.

02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:38.300
Awesome.

02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:43.340
So KB Toys, which used to be like the toy store that was in every single mall.

02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:44.340
Sure.

02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.660
Might be coming back.

02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:47.300
So that's kind of interesting.

02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:53.140
Basically there's a company, Strategic Brands LLC, they said that they were going to save

02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:59.220
the toy industry and basically their plans to resurrect KB Toys.

02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:00.220
So well, that's good.

02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:01.980
The malls could use something because they could.

02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:05.740
I'm worried the malls are going to be the next thing to go in many places.

02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:06.740
Some of these malls around here.

02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:07.740
Yeah.

02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:08.740
Yeah.

02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:10.100
Like I don't how is Sunrise still in business?

02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:11.100
Jesus.

02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:12.100
I don't know.

02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:13.220
But then what are they going to do?

02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:14.720
That's a huge chunk of land.

02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:15.720
Like what do you do with it?

02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:17.440
Turn to a shopping center.

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.440
Oh yeah.

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.440
Build a sports arena.

02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:21.440
Yeah.

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:24.160
But it's a local joke.

02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:25.160
Sacramento joke.

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:26.160
No.

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:27.720
They could build like a shopping center or something.

02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:32.100
That's what they did with like the Birdcage member and Birdcage is a pretty awesome shopping

02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:33.100
center.

02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:38.280
They got rid of it for like, you know, Best Buy.

02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:39.720
Kids of Sacramento, pull up a chair.

02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:41.080
I'm going to get local here for a minute.

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:44.400
The rest of y'all just hear me out here because you probably had a place like this in your

02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.400
town.

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:49.220
They have this awesome little outdoor shopping mall here called the Birdcage.

02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:53.240
It does still exist, but they basically bulldoze the old one completely and built a new one

02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:54.300
from the ground up.

02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:58.480
So the old one was awesome because it had a dollar theater that showed Rocky Horror

02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:00.460
Picture Show at midnight for years and years.

02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:02.320
That's where I first started to go to it.

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:04.800
It had a bowling alley, which was rad.

02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:07.360
It also had an arcade for the longest time.

02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:09.080
And it was like the game room, the game room.

02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:12.200
And it was like the fucking arcade.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:14.920
Like that is where the competitive street fighter, Dan took me.

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:15.920
That was everything.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:17.800
And that's when they added like the game room spin.

02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:20.800
They had a spin off of it in Folsom, too, that we did a tournament out.

02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:21.800
We did.

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:22.800
Yeah.

02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:23.800
That was actually, I think, where they moved the Birdcage one to.

02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:24.800
They did.

02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:25.800
Yeah.

02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.800
That was.

02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:27.800
It wasn't necessarily a spin off.

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:28.800
So it was like cheaper rent in Folsom.

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:29.800
I thought they were both open at the same time because I swear.

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:31.480
For a very brief period of time.

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.480
Yeah.

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:33.480
So anyway.

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:36.440
But long story short, they bulldozed the theaters.

02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:39.080
The parking lot became a Best Buy.

02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:42.160
The fucking old bowling alley is like a shoe store now.

02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:43.160
It's all gone.

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.280
All the good stuff's gone.

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:45.660
This is sad.

02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:47.080
You know what else the Birdcage had?

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:48.080
Montgomery Ward.

02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:49.080
Did it?

02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:50.080
Yeah.

02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:51.840
That's where the target is now.

02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:56.480
I was Montgomery Ward's back in the day when the the Walmart on Arden was a Montgomery

02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:57.480
Ward as well.

02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:58.480
Yeah.

02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:01.220
And he still has the escalator in it with the buggy escalator.

02:09:01.220 --> 02:09:02.760
Actually the Walmart on Arden.

02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:04.080
I don't know.

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:05.480
You mean Watt and El Camino.

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:06.480
Yeah.

02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:07.480
It's gone.

02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:08.600
They close that Walmart's gone.

02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:09.600
Is it?

02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:11.940
It is closed because the Sam's went under.

02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:14.300
And that is one of the very few Walmarts there that close.

02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:17.060
But that Walmart was trash.

02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.060
That Walmart was trash.

02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:21.300
It was a diseased asshole of a wall rash.

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:24.860
Like the only reason you would go to that Walmart is that cool elevator with the shopping

02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:25.860
cart.

02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:26.860
So you can put in the elevator.

02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:27.860
Which was there in the Montgomery Ward.

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:28.860
Yes.

02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:29.860
So later, you mean?

02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:30.860
Yeah.

02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:31.860
That's not sorry.

02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:32.860
The escalator.

02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:33.860
Otherwise that that was like rash.

02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:34.860
But now they have a scary.

02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:36.940
But the new Winco across the street is pretty cool.

02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:39.440
And they are building a new movie theater.

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:41.440
It's one of the it's the studio movie girl.

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.440
People are opening it.

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:43.440
That's awesome.

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:49.960
It's going in where the Macy's used to be across the street.

02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:55.240
Anyway, there's your local news from Sacramento's number two gaming podcast.

02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.240
No.

02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:02.240
We are second to none.

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:05.100
But yeah, they've speaking of the KB Toys thing.

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:11.540
So getting back to that, they've already started kind of putting the groundwork in

02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:12.540
there.

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:17.360
They have open invitations, I guess, to people to join up.

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:22.900
And they've even registered the main KB Toys stores or toys store.

02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:24.900
So interesting.

02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:28.120
It'll be neat to see something happen.

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:29.940
We do need something to fill the void, I think.

02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:34.100
I is sad that someone's not going to come in and just buy them up.

02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:35.100
I don't know if it's possible.

02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:39.580
They could just let the whole company go down and then bring back a new company under the

02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:40.580
name Toys R Us.

02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:41.580
So they own the debt or something.

02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:42.580
But they probably can't do that.

02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:44.340
I'm trying to think of that's happened before, though.

02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:49.100
I feel like that's happened that like another company did that, like liquidate everything

02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:52.500
and just start from I circuit cities coming back.

02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:53.500
I heard that, too.

02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:54.500
Yeah.

02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.540
And that would be an example of something like that, too.

02:10:56.540 --> 02:11:00.700
You know, but anyway, we'll see what happens.

02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:01.860
I would think, though, with toys.

02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:03.940
I mean, yes, I know online is a big component.

02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:05.980
But like, you know, toys are meant to be played with.

02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:10.580
And I think there's something about getting to play with toys to see what it is that you

02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:11.580
get.

02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:14.580
The reason online, I think, is so popular, too, is you go into these places like Wal-Mart

02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:15.580
and Target.

02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:16.580
They don't have everything there.

02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:17.580
Yeah.

02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:20.180
Like you go like looking for something like, for example, I look for Legos a lot of times

02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:23.100
and I can't find what I'm looking for in the store.

02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:26.760
I have to go to like Toys R Us or something like Toys R Us is a lot of times they charge

02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:28.180
over retail for things.

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:32.780
So that's another problem that they had.

02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:37.340
It's just it is going to be online for a lot of because people get pushed to online

02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:42.220
because it's just easier, because the pricing is more competitive and it's just more available.

02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:48.240
All right, well, let's move on to talking about Xbox avatars.

02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:49.240
That's right.

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:52.900
You may remember this was actually announced at last E3, but Microsoft is finally getting

02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:54.580
around to some new Xbox avatars.

02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:57.740
They're going to be coming out in April for everybody.

02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:01.120
But you get a little bit early if you're an Xbox insider.

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:03.920
And then in May, there's going to be a brand new avatar filled stores.

02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.280
So lots new props and clothing.

02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:09.760
I guess you're going to be able to like ride a unicorn and shit, which actually is really

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:10.760
cool.

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:13.000
So that's all stuff that's going to be coming out of the new avatars.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.140
But I think it's also important to point out that like the new avatars that are coming

02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:22.000
out, there's going to be really, really detailed customization and there's going to be more

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.280
like diversity, meaning you can have a avatar in a wheelchair.

02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:29.720
You can have an avatar of the prosthetic limb.

02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:33.080
You can have a pregnant woman avatar if you want.

02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:38.220
So they are definitely thinking about what can we do besides just like generic dude and

02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:39.440
generic girl?

02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:42.200
Like what are some other body types?

02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:47.760
Yeah, I wish Nintendo would do that with the Miis because the Miis, they were neat at first,

02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:49.560
but it's kind of just, it's worn.

02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:50.560
It's welcome.

02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:51.560
Yeah.

02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:52.560
They're very dated at this point.

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.560
So like do something like this.

02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:54.560
It'd be pretty awesome.

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.560
Yeah.

02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:56.560
Well, kudos to Microsoft.

02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:57.560
I'm excited to check it out.

02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:01.080
It's really cool that they are definitely including more people by, you know, just thinking

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:07.240
about different body types than just, you know, again, generic dude and generic girl.

02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:13.560
So and if I remember right, is Microsoft the one where all the clothes went genderless?

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:19.240
So if you want to be a male body type, but wear female clothes, whatever, like it wasn't

02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:20.240
micro.

02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:21.240
Didn't Microsoft do that?

02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:22.240
Am I crazy?

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:24.120
I thought I remember hearing something about that where they removed the gender restriction

02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:28.760
on all the clothes, which you know what, y'all?

02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:31.040
It's that this is the world we live in now.

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:35.680
So all right, let's move on to our soccer.

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:37.680
You got something else for us?

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:40.160
Yeah, I do.

02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:41.360
I know.

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:45.000
And from what I understand, there was that big, massive discussion last week, but I'm

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.040
going to bring it up because yet another study has come out saying that video games do not

02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:51.040
make kids violent.

02:13:51.040 --> 02:14:01.480
And this one, I actually stopped and read the study, but it was there was basically

02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:02.600
a series of them.

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:09.040
There's one from molecular psychology that spoke of German researchers that had three

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:13.920
groups of typically non-gaming healthy volunteers, 77 in total, for the study.

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:18.320
Each group was given questionnaires and personality assessments right at the start.

02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:23.680
And then for the next two months, one group was told to play 30 minutes of GTA 5 and another

02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:25.520
one played Sims 3.

02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:30.280
The third group, as a control, got told to come back two months later for a second round

02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:32.740
of identical tests.

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:35.000
And the other two groups did the same thing.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.760
So basically your third group is your control group.

02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:42.960
So after the study, they said that they did not find any relevant negative effects in

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.440
response to violent video games.

02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:52.060
In fact, the only three tests of the 208 statistical tests performed showed significant interaction

02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:57.320
pattern that would be in line with this hypothesis, since at least 10 significant effects would

02:14:57.320 --> 02:14:59.780
be expected purely by chance.

02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:04.760
We concluded there were no detrimental effects of video game, of video game play.

02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:06.600
And that's the quote.

02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:12.800
So again, people got a tree trunk up their ass and are looking for a scapegoat.

02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:13.800
Stop!

02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:14.800
It's so cute.

02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:17.480
You think politicians are going to listen to facts and science?

02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:18.480
No one.

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:19.480
They don't.

02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:22.280
They make up their own facts and science.

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:25.120
Just stop.

02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.120
It's fine.

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:27.120
Vote them out.

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:31.800
It won't get any traction because people, they let them have their comments and stuff,

02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:32.800
but it's just...

02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:34.720
Here's another thing that I think is very beneficial.

02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:39.000
Here's the situation we're in now that we weren't in in the 90s.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.080
Here's the situation we're in now.

02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:45.720
Most people, like pretty much anybody mid 40s or younger, and then some, and certainly

02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:50.060
if you are older than your mid 40s, this might apply to you as well, but just about everybody

02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:52.800
under 40 grew up with video games.

02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:53.800
You know what I mean?

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:57.280
Video games have been a part of our culture because we all fucking grew up on Super Mario

02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:58.280
Brothers.

02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:03.240
And all the more reason why we need younger people in these political offices because

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:06.320
I think a lot of people don't get it.

02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:10.400
It's things that they're voting on and stuff that they really don't get, like net neutrality.

02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:15.240
They don't fucking understand what that is or video games and violence is that they don't

02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:22.320
understand or care because they're getting paid not to care about these issues and that's

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:23.320
a problem.

02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:26.200
We need more intelligent people in these positions.

02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:27.640
I'll fucking say it.

02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:29.300
I'm a fucking say it.

02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:32.360
Baby boomers need to stop running the country.

02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:36.960
They just all need to stop period.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000
You know what?

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.800
Although I will say a better solution would be for all of us to work together, but it

02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:46.440
needs to not just be one generation and need to actually do something.

02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:50.560
Don't just go, Oh, I'm not going to vote cause it doesn't do anything.

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:51.560
Me.

02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:53.560
Well then you don't have the ability to complain about it.

02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:59.240
We'll just form the new political party of the Waluigi, the Waluigi party where our stance,

02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:03.000
the color purple is available, where you have the, we're, you know, we're purple States

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.840
and you know, and, and then that way we'll just, you know, if someone's saying something

02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:12.360
stupid, you just respond back to him.

02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:14.360
Exactly.

02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:17.840
Perfect.

02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:25.800
Video games cause violence and you just a few more stories for you guys.

02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:28.840
Then we're going to get to the Skype line, which, you know, hopefully somebody still

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:29.840
out there.

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:31.280
Uh, Loki.

02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:38.160
So the team behind, uh, the capital wasteland project, which is basically a mod to import

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:44.640
fallout three inside the fallout four engine has been canceled because of some conversations

02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:49.200
that they had with Bethesda regarding some of the legality of the project.

02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:55.680
So what the main concern was is they were looking to use some of the, um, audio, well,

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.640
the audio from the game because they didn't want to recreate it because they felt it would

02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:04.880
lose some of the impact because, you know, they had really big names in the original

02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:05.880
game.

02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.580
Um, you know, Liam Neeson, Malcolm McDonald, that type of stuff.

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:12.640
So they decided that because they weren't able to do that and it was kind of what they

02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:17.280
were doing is sketchy as hell to basically just continue working on this project to import

02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:18.600
the game into the engine.

02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:23.960
So it's unfortunate they said they wouldn't, you know, have you decided to rerecord the

02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:24.960
audio?

02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:26.360
I mean, that would have been 90,000 lines of dialogue.

02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:35.960
So that's a lot, um, that's too bad, but maybe they'll give Bethesda an excuse to rerelease

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:39.680
the game in the fallout four engine or something like that.

02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:43.000
So it would have been cool to see that.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.440
I guess it makes sense though, that the voice acting kind of gets into a, you know, they

02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:50.960
deserve to get paid their residuals and all that, especially when you have fine with it

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:52.220
up to that point.

02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:55.200
But then, you know, once you start getting into that, it's like, that might be licensed

02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:59.520
differently and it's like, eh, can't really do that.

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:00.520
All right.

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:05.400
Well, and lastly tonight, a story about Tomb Raider to bring it full circle, but this isn't

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:06.640
about the movie.

02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:10.040
It's about the original games, the original games.

02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:11.040
That's right.

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:14.720
The Tomb Raider trilogy remasters are on their way to PC.

02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:18.120
Here's the thing though, is that the Tomb Raider games, they are on steam, but I guess

02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:20.120
it's just through like emulation and stuff.

02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:23.260
They're not the greatest, uh, translations in the world.

02:19:23.260 --> 02:19:26.340
So there are remasters coming for the three games.

02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:30.200
And if you did buy the old games on steam, you'll be able to get these for free.

02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:31.200
So that's pretty cool.

02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:33.820
Uh, a company named Realtek VR put these together.

02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:39.580
It will run at 10 ADP and 60 frames a second, but, and of course there's a catch here.

02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:41.580
This is Square Enix, right?

02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:45.580
These remasters, they're based on the mobile versions of the game.

02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:47.580
Oh fuck them.

02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:48.580
Seriously.

02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:49.580
Oh fuck them.

02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:52.220
Right to hell.

02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:53.220
And we'll just leave it at that.

02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:55.640
Let's just not, let's just put new effort into it.

02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:56.640
Fuck this.

02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:58.060
We'll make some more money.

02:19:58.060 --> 02:20:01.860
No, fuck them in their fucking mobile ports.

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.500
Fuck them in their mobile port.

02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:05.700
All right.

02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:06.700
You know what?

02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:08.020
We do have to have a fuse though, Rob.

02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:09.020
Oh, that's right.

02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.020
Cause you need to get, well, you know what?

02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:11.880
And I don't even know if we're going to be able to get calls tonight.

02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:15.900
I am going to say Skype line is open orange launch radio, all one word on Skype.

02:20:15.900 --> 02:20:19.320
If you want to get through, it may be a way for you to actually hear the show is by being

02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:20.320
on it.

02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:22.080
But meantime, dark soccer says, you know what?

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:23.680
I got something I need to get off my chair.

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:25.600
I got something to say.

02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:30.480
So we have to get to some FUs of the week tonight, which, uh, I, Oh my God, I don't

02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:31.480
have the music.

02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:32.480
We haven't done it in so long.

02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:33.480
That's okay.

02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:34.480
I'll just say it.

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:35.480
Here, here, you know what?

02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:39.400
You can have, since this character's come up a lot tonight, we'll do, uh, we'll do this

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:40.520
for the FUs of the week.

02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:41.520
If it will.

02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:42.520
Oh God.

02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:43.520
Don't do this to me.

02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:50.000
There you go.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:55.600
Fuck those shady bitches for not putting Shangela against Trixie.

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:59.000
No, no, I would know you are not allowed to do that.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.720
That is the producer's fault.

02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:02.160
Those Queens are not at fault.

02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:04.120
The producers, the ones that take the heat for that.

02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:05.120
I disagree.

02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:06.120
I disagree.

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:07.120
Importantly.

02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:11.680
You are not, you should not be putting blame on the, because I think that it wasn't them.

02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.680
I don't think it was the producers.

02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:16.240
The producers made them do it.

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.240
Where has it said that?

02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:19.720
They should not have had that jury vote in the first place.

02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:20.720
That's my point.

02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:22.320
But ultimately it was their decision.

02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:24.720
The producers put them to it, but they made the decisions.

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.160
I anybody who attacks one of those Queens, I will fight you.

02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:29.680
I'm not attacking them.

02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:33.400
I'm just saying that it was really shady.

02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:34.400
I will say this.

02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:36.240
I will say this in a, in a nice, calm manner.

02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:42.600
Aja has come out and said since then that she regrets like now that she's seen what

02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:43.600
we've all seen.

02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:49.080
She says in the moment it was a lot different than it is on TV.

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:53.120
But I still think that it should have been Shangela and Trixie.

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:55.920
And as I said on my Facebook, I'm not angry at the winner.

02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:59.240
I'm angry at the process that, that put her there.

02:21:59.240 --> 02:22:00.240
Make sense?

02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:01.240
Yes.

02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:04.040
And, but Shangela was the big front runner.

02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:07.840
I think even RuPaul looked absolutely floored by it.

02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:12.800
I mean, did it, was it just me or was it like this long, longing look as Shangela walked

02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:15.400
to the back, Rob?

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.120
Yes.

02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:23.680
But I will say in Shangela's favor, she took it like the class act she is.

02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:25.680
Stood there and cheered her sisters on.

02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:27.080
She's going to have a huge career.

02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:28.080
They all will.

02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:29.600
Kennedy's here on Thursday, by the way.

02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:32.760
I'm considering going to that.

02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:40.640
But I just want to say that, you know, that is the way that you, you take the step back

02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:41.980
with grace.

02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:44.100
And so, well done.

02:22:44.100 --> 02:22:46.800
And congratulations to Trixie on a win.

02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:48.040
Trixie is a great queen.

02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:49.160
Trixie deserved it.

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:51.840
You know, if Shangela hadn't been there.

02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:52.840
All right.

02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:56.600
I, it's only fair to check in with Logie at FUs of the Week.

02:22:56.600 --> 02:22:57.600
No.

02:22:57.600 --> 02:22:58.600
No.

02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:00.720
I don't have anything so far.

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:06.840
And my FU of the Week goes to, um, just the fact that tomorrow's Monday and I have a short

02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:10.680
week, which is a good thing, but I got to get through the week to get there.

02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:12.160
All right.

02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:13.720
We're going to turn our attention to the Skyline.

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:14.720
I'm sorry.

02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:17.680
I've seen some calls coming in and I missed them because I wanted to, I wanted Jamie to

02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:21.320
get her appropriate rant out of her system.

02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:24.800
We wouldn't want that to bottle up over three weeks, but I do believe I see a call coming

02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:25.800
in.

02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:26.800
So let's get to it.

02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:27.800
Hi.

02:23:27.800 --> 02:23:28.800
You are on Orange Knowledge Radio.

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:29.800
Who's this?

02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:30.880
Hey, everybody.

02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:31.880
It's Ronma.

02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:32.880
Hey, Ronma.

02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:33.880
What's up, buddy?

02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:34.880
Not much, Rob.

02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:35.880
Sit down.

02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:36.880
Let's get some coffee.

02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:37.880
We need to talk.

02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:38.880
You're in luck.

02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:39.880
I'm sitting.

02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:40.880
Do it, coffee.

02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:41.880
Will you give us a topic?

02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:42.880
Yes.

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:43.880
Rhode Island.

02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:44.880
It's neither a road or an island.

02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:45.880
Discuss.

02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:47.800
But it's a very nice time of the year to visit.

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:48.800
It is.

02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:49.800
No.

02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:58.320
Um, the whole talk of Toys R Us going away, the return of KB Toys.

02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:06.160
This is not a follow up to my discussion from last week, but it's more like the stores

02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:08.080
that we used to go to as a kid.

02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:10.720
I mean, you mentioned Montgomery Wards.

02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:15.960
I mean, I don't remember one in my neck of the woods, but we had consumers and that's

02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:18.640
where I bought all of my frickin' video games from.

02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:20.520
I bought Killer Instinct at Montgomery Ward.

02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:21.520
You know what?

02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:23.840
You know what this boils down to, Ronma?

02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:24.840
Getting old sucks.

02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:27.640
Who are you trying to kid?

02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:32.280
Getting old sucks because you know what, someday there's going to be, you know, some

02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:37.440
of the kids today, there's going to be some 18 year old listening to this show who when,

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:42.700
you know, he or she gets to be 40 years old, the conversation is going to be like, remember

02:24:42.700 --> 02:24:46.040
when people used to go to gas stations?

02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:49.040
Remember when gas station, remember when cars ran on gas?

02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:51.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:54.160
Back to the future too.

02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:57.400
Remember when we had to lace our shoes?

02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:00.800
Remember when we used to use hands to play video games?

02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:05.800
Remember when cars didn't fly?

02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:09.600
So I mean, that's, that's the thing, Ronma, it's just, it's just getting old sucks.

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:13.260
Like the stuff that used to be, and I'm sure, I'm sure there's stuff our parents would talk

02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:16.360
about that, you know, we never heard of.

02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:17.760
I'm trying to think of like stores that were-

02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:18.760
A party line.

02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:19.760
A lot, oh.

02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:22.760
I know, we had party lines and the extra long phone cable, remember?

02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:24.760
We did have party lines, but they were-

02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:29.760
You'd get the extra long phone cable and hide in the bathroom so no one could hear you trust your friends.

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:32.760
I do, remember, remember cordless phones?

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:33.760
Who remembers when the-

02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:37.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, they still sell them.

02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:39.760
Remember when the police were like outside my door?

02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:41.760
What is, are we getting swatted?

02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:42.760
Rotary phones.

02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:43.760
Jesus Christ, hold on.

02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:44.760
I want to see what's happening outside.

02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:45.760
Can you guys have a call?

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:46.760
Okay.

02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:49.760
Well, what other things do we remember from when we were kids?

02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:54.760
I remember the Fairchild Channel F and how much the controller blew.

02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:57.760
Jamie, when did Rob become such a nosy little bitch?

02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.760
Well, it is quite literally like right outside the door, it's really loud.

02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:03.760
Fair enough, fair enough, fair enough.

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:06.760
Yeah, and Rob is a concerned neighbor.

02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:11.760
It is not, they went by, I actually think, you know how there's like the big street,

02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:14.760
like two streets, I think they were pulled over there.

02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:15.760
Gotcha.

02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:16.760
So it's nothing.

02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:17.760
But it was at least a couple of cars.

02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:18.760
Yeah, you could, dang, you could hear that though.

02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:20.760
Sorry, just live radio.

02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:23.760
If it's not the stream cutting out, it's the police showing up.

02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:27.760
What can you do?

02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:28.760
Here's one.

02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:30.760
Remember Radio Shack?

02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:35.760
Sorry, I'm loving some of these comments in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:40.760
Kossin in chat says, we'll mention stuff and kids will be like, what the hell is Hollywood video?

02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:42.760
Tigerclaw says, remember beepers?

02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:47.760
Bobby Blackwell says, remember when you had to pull your phone out of your pocket to look something up?

02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:53.760
You know what, no, I remember, it was on one of those like Buzzfeed things too,

02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:58.760
but like someone had said like, my kid just asked me why we say hang up the phone.

02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:04.760
Bobby Blackwell says, remember when you could listen to a radio stream and not have it cut out every 20 seconds?

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:05.760
No.

02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:07.760
Canceled, this show is canceled.

02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:10.760
Fuck that comment, good night.

02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:13.760
Remember when people could just pass all the demos that they played?

02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:16.760
Remember when the snozzberries tasted like snozzberries?

02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:19.760
I remember, you remember? I remember.

02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:21.760
Ted Bridge Farm remembers.

02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:26.760
Anyway, sorry Rama, was there something else you were trying to get across?

02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:29.760
It's all good tonight, it's all good tonight, you know?

02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:30.760
It is all good.

02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:35.760
We're talking about stuff from our childhood that we're probably not going to see again.

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:38.760
I would love to see Toys R Us make a comeback.

02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:43.760
I mean, there is, we got KB that's coming back, I saw the press release for that.

02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:47.760
Circuit City is making a comeback, you know?

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:55.760
It's like I said, it's gotten to the point where the big box stores aren't cutting it anymore.

02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:59.760
These little specialty stores is where the money is at now.

02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:09.760
I'd like to see Toys R Us come back as a small, not a boutique, but like a basic store, two or three floors, basic selection of stuff.

02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:16.760
Yeah, you know, there was a tiny Toys R Us, you know what the full smell is? They have like a small Toys R Us.

02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:20.760
It was a clear out store, but it's not there anymore.

02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:24.760
Actually, it was there two weeks ago when Dan and I went.

02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:25.760
Really?

02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:28.760
And they had apparently just really expensive stuff in there.

02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:30.760
Guess what, y'all, it wasn't there last time.

02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:32.760
It ain't going to be there much longer.

02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:34.760
Actually, or it might because they're clearing out everything.

02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:37.760
Yeah, maybe. But anyway, I just think of that store because it's actually really small.

02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:41.760
I believe, ironically, it was a KB Toys when those outlets first opened.

02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:42.760
Yes, it was.

02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:51.760
The main thing I remember about KB Toys is because it was like one of the places I could buy Master System games brand new for like ten bucks.

02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:55.760
I always remember KB Toys being fucking thrashed every time I went in there.

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:56.760
Oh, I remember.

02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:57.760
It was just destroyed.

02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:00.760
I remember the bin full of Atari 2600 games.

02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:03.760
I remember getting all this stuff there.

02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:06.760
We went to a KB once, like right before they closed down.

02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:12.760
And we went through every stack of their PlayStations until we found the one that still had the IO port on it.

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:17.760
Because our PlayStation, we had to put it tilted sideways to get it to play right.

02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:21.760
So we got the last of the IO ports that that one carried.

02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:22.760
Nice.

02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:26.760
Out of like 50 that we checked the serial number on, we got one.

02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:32.760
Azet in chat says, this might be a local thing, but who remembers wishing well?

02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:33.760
I'm not wishing well.

02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:34.760
There's still one around.

02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.760
There's what? There's still a wishing well?

02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:37.760
I think so.

02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:40.760
Not the one over by Madison.

02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:41.760
No, that's gone.

02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:44.760
By strings and by the bowling alley.

02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:46.760
Yeah, that one's still there?

02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:49.760
I don't know. I haven't been there since I haven't been to the gym there.

02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:52.760
No, I'm pretty sure that wishing well is long gone.

02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:55.760
Wishing well is basically Party City, but it was cooler.

02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:58.760
Because they had the giant bins of like party favors.

02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.760
That was the coolest part of wishing well.

02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:02.760
I think that was a local chain, though.

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:04.760
I don't think wishing well existed really outside NorCal.

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:07.760
That sounds kind of familiar, but I'm not too sure.

02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:14.760
Because I mentioned in the chat earlier, I remember as a kid seeing commercials for a chain called Lionel Kitty City,

02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:16.760
and the mascot was a kangaroo.

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:20.760
And I'm probably the only person that remembers that.

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:24.760
And I think that might have also been a local chain or something, you know?

02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:27.760
It's interesting to me how everything that's successful now is a national chain.

02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:30.760
That's what's disappearing is local shit.

02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:32.760
It's disappearing big time.

02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:34.760
With few exceptions.

02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:39.760
Sorry, East Coast. In-N-Out Burger just doesn't want to be a thing, I guess.

02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:43.760
Wait, hold on. In-N-Out Burger is now available in the Midwest.

02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:47.760
Texas, right? Has it gone further than that?

02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:49.760
Colorado.

02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:51.760
Oh, it's still pretty west.

02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:54.760
It's still Midwest. It still means it's closer to me.

02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:59.760
And I have friends in Colorado who have been trying to get me to come out there and visit again.

02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:02.760
Fair enough. We don't have Waffle House, so it happens.

02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:05.760
Well, people should be bringing me some grits.

02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:10.760
But we are getting a Cracker Barrel, but that place is overrated as fuck.

02:31:12.760 --> 02:31:14.760
I do like the fried catfish.

02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:27.760
But anyway, there are, though, in Berkeley, there were a few mom and pop toy stores that had educational toys and old style wooden toys and things like that.

02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:29.760
And I thought that was really cool.

02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:36.760
They still have those. There's a big one by us in the Nimbus Winery, which is not really a winery. It's just an indoor mall thing.

02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:37.760
Shopping center, yeah.

02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:41.760
They've got one that's got a bunch of toys and all the educational stuff.

02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:42.760
Oh, yeah.

02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:46.760
They still have the Learning Company over by Mongolia Barbecue in Roseville.

02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:47.760
Yeah, okay.

02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:49.760
Yeah. Anyway.

02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:52.760
All right, well, Rama, anything else besides memory lane you want to talk about tonight?

02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:58.760
No, not really. I just wanted to talk about that cool stuff.

02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:01.760
So, the moral of the story is you're old, but so are we.

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:05.760
Yeah, and sometimes going old is not really a bad thing.

02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:08.760
And if you call me an exennial, I will beat your face in.

02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:18.760
I absolutely hate that term. You are not exennial. You are Generation X. You earned that title and you take that title to your grave.

02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:23.760
Rama, I don't believe in labels, actually. I don't think you can label me because I'm a special snowflake.

02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:26.760
And so, I reject your labels.

02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:29.760
So, I mean, I have to take off the fabulous label as well?

02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:31.760
Oh, no, that one I'll take.

02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:37.760
Wait, you said you don't do labels. So, you can't have the fabulous one too.

02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:43.760
You are not. That's it, sir. That's it, sir. If you are going to bring logic and analysis and facts into this, I'm hanging up on you.

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:46.760
I love you, Rama. I fucking love you.

02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:48.760
Hugs and kisses. Bye.

02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:49.760
Bye.

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:53.760
All right. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:59.760
I should cut that out. And that should be the clip of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:03.760
Sir, if you're going to bring facts and analysis on this program, you need to leave.

02:33:04.760 --> 02:33:07.760
That should be every video game podcast.

02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:14.760
Except Bobby. Bobby's show really is facts.

02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:18.760
All right. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype if you want to get through.

02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:21.760
I'm assuming the stream is operational right now. I have no idea.

02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:24.760
Any last minute stories from anyone here in the studio?

02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:25.760
No.

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:27.760
No? All right.

02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:28.760
I ain't got shit.

02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:33.760
Well, quickly, since we are going to be on a break for the live folks anyway, we'll be on a break for three weeks.

02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:36.760
Any games you're looking forward to playing in the next two weeks?

02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:40.760
No.

02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:43.760
Loki, how is there no Ready Player One game?

02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:46.760
They have like some VR experiences and stuff.

02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:56.760
The reason that I don't think there's a Ready Player One game per se is that, you know, with much like the licensing that they had to do for the movie,

02:33:56.760 --> 02:34:00.760
they'd have to do that type of licensing for a game and good luck with that.

02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:03.760
So we're talking about things that are long gone.

02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:06.760
SGA 100 Matt mentioned something about Orange County.

02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:09.760
But when I first read that, I thought it said Orange Julius.

02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:12.760
I don't know if that was just like my mall brain taking over.

02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:14.760
Is Orange Julius still a thing?

02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:15.760
Yes.

02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:16.760
Are they really?

02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:17.760
It's DQ and Orange Julius are together.

02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:18.760
Oh.

02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:20.760
So if I go to Dairy Queen, I can get Orange Julius.

02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:23.760
I don't know about that, but I know that they have one.

02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:25.760
I know the Galleria has one because I always get Orange Julius there.

02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:26.760
Really?

02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:28.760
They still have one at Sunrise Mall.

02:34:28.760 --> 02:34:30.760
Oh, well I never go there.

02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:32.760
So, but yeah, they're around.

02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:33.760
Unless I go to Red Robin.

02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:37.760
So they've got, yeah, I always get Orange Julius. I fucking love that shit.

02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:42.760
If I find out that they have Orange Julius at the Dairy Queen near me, I'm fucking going there too.

02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:44.760
So I love that shit.

02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:46.760
I love it.

02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:51.760
I know, that's what I'm going to, what are you going to miss the most if malls go under? Orange Julius.

02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:53.760
Mrs. Fields.

02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:57.760
Yes. Oh my God. Mrs. Fields and TCBY.

02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:03.760
You know what though? Keep in mind when I grew up with TCBY, they were always standalone. They weren't inside of a mall.

02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:04.760
Oh.

02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.760
And I worked at a cookie shop. It was one of my first jobs.

02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:14.760
Really? See, okay. I know I have to have told this story on OLR before, but I'm going to tell it again.

02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:19.760
So when I was in college, myself and my roommate who I lived with at the time, who was also a gay guy,

02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:24.760
we used to have the biggest crush on the guy that worked at Mrs. Fields, who was the cookie boy.

02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:26.760
So we all called him the cookie boy. He was the cookie boy.

02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:33.760
And then the cookie boy, but sometimes we would go and we would like, you know, go to get cookies and stuff and we'd go, I'm the cookie boy.

02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:40.760
And, uh, but then sometimes like we'd look over and he's talking to one of the yogurt gals that worked at the TCBY.

02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:43.760
I was connected to it. So it was the cookie boy and the yogurt wenches.

02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:45.760
So sometimes we walk away.

02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:47.760
Were you creating your own fan fiction in your head?

02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:49.760
Yes. Yes. We were creating TCBY fan fiction.

02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:51.760
We were shipping malls.

02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:52.760
Early shipping.

02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:53.760
We were shipping.

02:35:56.760 --> 02:35:57.760
True story.

02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:00.760
But where will kids go if they can't be dropped off at the mall?

02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:07.760
A true story. My first job in that mall that I had three different jobs in was working at the cookie place.

02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:14.760
And then I started working at the arcade next door. It was actually on the other side of the movie theater because we, we sandwiched the movie theater.

02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:21.760
And I worked there for a long time, moved to cyber station, came back to Aladdin's castle and then got hired at an herb kiosk in the middle of the mall.

02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:23.760
I worked in that mall for like four years.

02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:25.760
I missed all those retail adventures.

02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:26.760
Or three years, something like that.

02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:31.760
I mean, there's a hot topic in the, the, um, outlet mall that we have, but.

02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:32.760
And they usually have the sales there too.

02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:34.760
Where's, where would hot topic go?

02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:42.760
My, my one and only, my one and only retail job I ever had was I worked for a local video chain called Plaster TV Video.

02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:48.760
They don't exist anymore, but they were obviously VA chess rental and they didn't get on the DVD bandwagon until way too late.

02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:52.760
That's what did them in. Um, and also, uh, they rented Nintendo games.

02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:56.760
They never bothered to upgrade to Super Nintendo or Genesis.

02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:59.760
They still just would rent the same fucking Nintendo games.

02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:04.760
And the thing that really kept them in business, all the movies on the top shelf, porn.

02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:07.760
So we rented, we rented porn.

02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:14.760
Well, my first retail job here and my only retail job here was GNC until I got held up at gunpoint.

02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:16.760
Oh yeah. You told me about that. Oh my God.

02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:17.760
And the funny thing about that night.

02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:19.760
That was right after I, that was right before I met you.

02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:22.760
Yeah, but it was also, it was around Christmas.

02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:23.760
Yeah.

02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:24.760
And this guy was hitting GNCs.

02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:33.760
The thing is you don't hold up an artist who has a mostly visual memory because I ended up drawing the guy and drawing his gun.

02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:34.760
Wow.

02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:36.760
And they caught him from my drawing.

02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:38.760
They didn't have video at least?

02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:39.760
Not in that, they're cheap.

02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:42.760
It was, it was the one over on trucks next to the Walmart.

02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:45.760
Well, that must be why they were hitting GNCs because they knew their security.

02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:47.760
They also hit sunrise mall too.

02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:49.760
Okay. Even our crappy little video store had video.

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:50.760
Oh, I mean.

02:37:50.760 --> 02:38:00.760
But now thing number two, thing number two, that same night I was of course shaken after the fact Dan took me to Toys R Us at Arden Fair Mall.

02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:07.760
I found a $20 bill in the dry, in the parking lot and I bought myself my Togepi plushie, my big Togepi pillow.

02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:11.760
So it's gaming related and related to our stories tonight.

02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:16.760
So just because a show I will ever associate being held up at gunpoint at GNC with Toys R Us.

02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:17.760
And Pokemon.

02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:20.760
And, and Togepi in particular.

02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:25.760
All right. Well, uh, the skyline isn't lighting up, but I know it's been rough with the live crowd tonight.

02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:30.760
So again, I really appreciate you guys that stuck with us tonight through the ups and downs of the show.

02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:34.760
It's a little bit embarrassing, but I also know it's just completely out of our control.

02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:40.760
But for those of you listening on the podcast or catching up on the podcast as the case may be, thank you for being here.

02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:42.760
We will be off next week.

02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:44.760
Believe it or not, it's our first week off all year long.

02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:46.760
So yeah, I think we earned a week off.

02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:48.760
So we won't be here.

02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:49.760
Happy gaming next week.

02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:52.760
We will be back live in three weeks.

02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:56.760
We'll be back on the podcast feed in two weeks with a brand new Orange Launch Radio.

02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.760
Stay tuned to our Twitter for all the latest or if you have a quick question you want to ask us.

02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:03.760
I know I don't always read the tweets on the show, but I watch the Twitter.

02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:07.760
And if you have a question, I'll answer it as long as it's not, why are you such an asshole?

02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:09.760
I'm not going to, I don't have an answer for that.

02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:12.760
So, uh, but if you have questions about schedule or whatever, I can answer those.

02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:20.760
So as I always say here at Orange Launch Radio, if you enjoyed the show, skips and all, uh, please consider telling a friend or five about the show.

02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:25.760
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, only if the voices are here to like air out there.

02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:34.760
So, uh, uh, yeah, uh, please help us spread the word and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.

02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.760
Those five star reviews, let me tell you, they go a long way.

02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:39.760
And I don't even, have we even had a five star review this year on iTunes?

02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:42.760
I think you should go be the first. Go do it right now at iTunes.

02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:44.760
Leave a five star review. I'd appreciate it.

02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:52.760
Uh, that about does it, but not until we get the final, final thoughts leading into this, uh, three week live break. Uh, Loki, your final thought?

02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:57.760
My final thought is I'm glad to be working on a new game finally and working on a game.

02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:02.760
So that's, yeah, that's been about it.

02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:11.760
My final thought is I'm just, I, I am, I continue to be grateful for those of you that stick out these dumb live issues and listen to the show.

02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:19.760
And just, even if you have no idea that's going on, cause you're a podcast only person, those, you know, we, we heard from an emailer tonight who thanked us for putting out podcasts for so long.

02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:25.760
Thank you for being here to listen to it. Like, seriously, like I, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:28.760
And it's, it's just the motivation for us to keep going week after week.

02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:32.760
So, I mean, if we're going to be gone for three weeks, that's the note I want to leave on.

02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:35.760
Uh, Dark Soccer, last but not, ladies last.

02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:37.760
My cat is better than most humans.

02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:39.760
Co-signed.

02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:40.760
Yes.

02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:46.760
Uh, well, go love your pets, your, uh, kitties and your puppies or your ferrets or whatever kind of pet you have.

02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:53.760
And, uh, play some video games and we will be back here in 7, 14, 21 days to do it all over again.

02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:56.760
Have a great night, everybody. Goodbye.
