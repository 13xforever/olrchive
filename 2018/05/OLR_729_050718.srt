00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What game spans 6 platforms, 4 consoles, 3 generations, and is now 17 years old?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Treasure's gift that keeps on giving is Ikaruga, slated for release on the Nintendo Switch later this month.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, May the 6th of 2018 with episode number 729 of our show.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But joining me by my side as she always is, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Miss Vangie.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You must be getting prepared for DragCon.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I am. I'm hunting her down.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, you know what's funny? The things we do to do Orange Lounge Radio live with you all, Miss Vangie is here in town tonight with Monet X Change.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I know.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we're here, we're stuck doing this gig.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I wanted to see Miss Vangie, but no.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You guys are worth it. We love you guys.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And plus, I don't know, not that I get claustrophobic, but sometimes those shows can be, especially when it's a really popular queen like those two are.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I always pay for the balcony.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh yeah, that is true, but just like too many people, you know what I mean?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Anyway, say hello. We are happy to share our space here with Techmaster Loki as we do every week. Hello, Loki.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello, and speaking of popular queens, we can't watch American Idol anymore, unfortunately.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, I know. I know, right? Cancelled. American Idol is cancelled.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's basically, yeah. It's dead to me now.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That was some bullshit last week, wasn't it? Which, you know, well, it's not really a spoiler alert at this point, right?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So Ada Vox, who was clearly the winner of that competition, no longer there because America, the wrong people are watching that show.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who cares? No one listens to American Idol artists anyways.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's true. Can you tell me who won The Voice or who won any of like the last five seasons?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I couldn't tell you who's even on The Voice. I don't even know.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I know, I know. Those singing shows, there's too many of them. It was different when it was only American Idol, right?

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It was different when that was it and there was nothing like it and it's like, oh my God, Paula Abdul, I haven't seen her in forever, right?

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It was different then, but now it's like, okay.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But it's even now, it's like, it's not even necessarily the person that wins American Idol.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's like, if you're like in that top 12, you pretty much have potential to just start your own thing anyways.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's kind of these, you know, like Kelly Pickler and shit. Everybody has a fucking album now.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And what's funny is that that actually ties into Drag Race and a lot of what they say about RuPaul's Drag Race too is it's like,

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
it's not about what you do during the competition. It's about what you do after the competition.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You know, once you are on that show, like look at somebody like Miss Vanjie, which I wouldn't expect that everybody out there knows,

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but if you don't know Miss Vanjie, she was the first contestant eliminated this season,

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but she had such a memorable exit that like there's memes about her all over the internet now.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And like people who have no fucking clue what Drag Race is are doing these Miss Vanjie type of memes.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So like, you know, for her, she's already won.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And you know, they'll just have her, have her back, you know, in the future, like Caesar or something.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Like, oh yeah, we helped her launch her career.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I want them to do RuPaul's Drag Race Losers.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, well, well.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And do everyone who had been the first eliminated queen.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She'll be on, she'll be on season 11 cause RuPaul was spotted like going to some opening or some gala thing.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And RuPaul had a necklace on that said Vanjie in gold.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So it's like, you know, like, you know that we, the world ain't seen the last of those cookies.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do they ever do like an all stars type thing in Drag Race where they bring back? Okay.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They just finished the third season.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They do, but the third season was, was rough. Too, too many twists.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They tried to do too many twists to make it different and it really suffered as a result.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So anyway.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry, Shangela.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you want to hear more about Drag Race, I urge you to look up reading is fundamental on iTunes.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But for now we are here to talk about video games and let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We'll get into our news and all that and our gaming weeks later on.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I should also introduce the chat room. That's important.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But Bobby enjoying the last week of his two week vacation right now, and he'll be back next week.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But we are live with our chat.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And if you are listening live, you can go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com where everybody's talking about American Idol right now.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I should also mention that Becky told me Julian named his first horse in Breath of the Wild Vangie.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So it is gaming related.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I had my Minecraft. Not only did I have my Minecraft world named Vangie, but I had my Minecraft world recently named Proportionizing.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Proportionizing!

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Which, by the way, spoiler alert, Proportionizing was a really good seed, actually.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So speaking of like horses, OK, I am very disappointed.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't get to reach out. That's OK. That's fine.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know, they can wait. They can wait.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They can wait. I am so surprised that we haven't gotten an epic horse game yet on consoles.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I mean, you know, Derby's Owners Club, Derby Owners Club.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Like, why? Why don't we have a Derby Owners Club on consoles?

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's a great question.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Final Furlong is the horse humping game.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That is the, yeah. And if you don't, like, you'd have to, like, Google it, look up a picture of Final Furlong.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But, like, the machine was like you could actually, like, ride the horse.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But, like, there's a certain way you could be riding that thing where it looks like you're fucking it.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Like, that game was kind of questionable.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not just fucking. It's skull fucking.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Anyway, now can I do some chat comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Kaijuto is an Idol fan saying, American Idol is the shit. I don't get the haters.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's always good if you like listening to great voices.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you watch it just for lame ass judge lines and all the drama stuff, then you'll burn out on it fast.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It was relevant once.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's, well, the thing, well, I think the thing is, you know, I will agree with Kaijuto to a point.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The season when that show was over was when it was about Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj fighting.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And it became more about that than it did about the singers.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And that was the season it was over.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Some would argue it was before or after that.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But I would say, you know, to a point, Kaijuto, I do agree with you.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
sg100matt in chat says, I stopped paying attention to American Idol after season 3, which was like forever ago at this point.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Anyway, back to games. sg100matt also says, Derby Owners Club was serious business back in the day.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, that was always like a fun thing to do between games of DDR and other stuff that we were playing.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's hilarious. It was a great game because I didn't understand what the hell was going on.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You just want to get the card, your card that printed out with your horse's name on it, and you just want to play the game because it's stupid.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How do you, for listeners who may have never heard of Derby Owners Club, how do we explain it?

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because, I mean, it's been like 10 years. Do they still have it at Dave & Buster's places?

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know. But, Matt, you go to an arcade and you see this, like, cabinet that is like a room.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It is a giant room with, like, several consoles and you're basically watching, like, horse racing.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But you create a horse and they have, like, this whole gameplay that you play on your screen.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then you, I guess, raise the horse and stuff and then you race it and you improve its stats based on that.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And then once you get your stats high enough, you breed your horse with other horses to make even better horses.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But you get cards that print out and you can name them.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Like Initial D. Just the exact same system. Exactly the same system, yes.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And it was fantastic. And we really need that again because it's just stupid.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I remember that Dark Sakura had a book. She would bring it. She would, here's my book of horses. Which horsies am I going to race today?

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I still have the book. It's somewhere in my house. I found it not too long ago because, remember, my good one for the long time was Magical Sound.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh. And you had Palateri. I thought that was your horse. It was Palateri. Maybe. I think it was.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But we had to spell it the special way. Like P-A-L-A-T-E-R-I. Palateri.

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A character limit? No, like a bad word in it somehow. You know how game filters can be weird.

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Anyway, S2-100-MAT actually linked to the Wikipedia article. Or you could read more about that. I suppose that's a place to start.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And as S2-100-MAT continues, Derby Owners Club is 10 years old. It could be Classic Game of the Week at some point.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If I felt like it. Dropping a little hint there to Dark Sakura.

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That means that in 10 years, another 10 years, I'll finally remember to do it.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's a good one to do for like an anniversary show.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Can you imagine a Derby Owners Club with today's technology? It would look fucking amazing.

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, I'd be all about Derby Owners Club on Switch. It's Sega's game, right? Isn't it Sega's game?

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I thought, was it Sega or Konami?

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, it wasn't Konami. I'm almost positive it was Sega.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think it's Sega.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Probably a Sega thing.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sega did like to take a lot of risks in the arcade market.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They do. They had a lot of over-the-top shit. Oh yeah? It was an in-house Sega thing. It was Sega's AM3 department that did that game.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, there you go.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Alright, let's get into what we were going to talk about at the top of the show tonight. Although I'm all for a Derby Owners Club tangent.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's talk about classic video games coming back all over again in style.

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I bring this up because I think it's kind of neat. And I also know we have some collectors in the house.

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You know, I don't know about you guys in our chat, but I know Dark Sakura. We always talk about the Vault collection.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She's got quite the collection. I'll never forget the game that came with the Dish. And I was like, why?

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why not, right? You still have the Dish game?

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That was the Cardcaptor Sakura game for Dreamcast.

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's right, that's right. I can never remember what it was, but yes.

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And then of course, Loki is an owner of an arcade machine.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So that's a little bit of a collection as well.

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Dose arcade machines, actually.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Dude, really? What? What happened? You had another one.

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, no, I have an arcade machine. Remember, I had an arcade cabinet at one time. I have the candy cab.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, okay, okay. You have like a... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. That's like basically a main thing at this point, right?

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, it doesn't really work right now. My JPEG died, so I have to get a new one of those.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay. Well, anyhow, Capcom is the subject of this story.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's going to be re-releasing cartridge versions of Mega Man 2 and Mega Man X.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So these two classic Mega Man games are going to get cartridge re-releases.

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They're going to be limited runs. They're going to cost you $100 apiece, which, I mean, was more than they cost back in the day.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But, I mean, I don't know if it's inflation, if it's because, I mean, if you look at this Mega Man X cartridge, it's pretty sweet.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's in like the blue casing, and I know the Mega Man 2 has something similar. It's a pretty rad looking little thing.

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It doesn't look like it did back in the day. Like, I love that see-through cartridge.

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I gotta be curious if the ROM is also modified, too. They have like that 30th anniversary Mega Man type thing in it.

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't know. I don't know if they've said that. But anyway, but of course this makes people wonder, like, would you be able to even play these in cartridge form?

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Like, how many people still have a working Nintendo?

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Probably a lot, being with all the retro, what is it, the retro consoles.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I guess so. Those are kind of, those machines are basically, they dump the ROM and they emulate it right on the spot.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's basically what those machines do. But I feel you, I feel you. You could use those to play games.

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And dark soccer is like me. You're special in that regard because you guys collect stuff.

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You have like four Nintendos, right? Or something like that?

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Something like that. A couple of them in the box.

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah. So anyhow, I Am 8-Bit, I believe is the production house that is helping out with this effort.

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And I Am 8-Bit is going to try to sweeten the pot since it is a high value there.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They're going to package the game with instruction books. How about that? The return of an instruction booklet. Isn't that nice?

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Better for that kind of price.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Cost boxing as well. And 1,000 random buyers get the glow in the dark versions of the cartridge. That's pretty rad.

167
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, I see. Oh, that blue cartridge is the random one. So most people are going to get the regular gray one.

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Whereas the NES one is that kind of light blue.

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't even think that's great. It's more of like a white. Yeah, it looks lighter than the normal cartridge.

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And you know what?

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Something I wouldn't wear to a wedding. Or something I would wear to a wedding because I can't wear it here.

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You would probably still though buy an original for less than that.

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's true. That's true.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And then you'd have an original.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well that's why it's a collector's item.

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's for people with too much money who don't want to go hunting.

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So 8,500 copies are going to be available in total and that includes the 1,000 blue ones.

178
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They're supposed to start shipping in September of this year.

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So you guys are kind of already getting into it a little bit.

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is that, well wait a minute. What's the point of these if I can walk into a used game store and possibly find one of these on cartridge?

181
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Although I would think these games in particular are probably a little harder to find because they are so popular.

182
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, it's a collector's item is what it is.

183
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you think it's worth it?

184
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's not unreasonable considering some of the other collector's things I've seen.

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I mean look at all these collector's editions that they have from modern games. They have like a stupid statue with it and stuff.

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And those don't come with instruction booklets for the most part.

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, it's ridiculous. I wouldn't buy it because I'm not collecting Nintendo or Super Nintendo games.

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But if I was a collector, yeah, I might be interested in it.

189
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's a neat idea. Props to them for trying something different.

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Right.

191
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And hey, if it works out then you can put out more stuff.

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let me look at our chat over at live.vog.network.com.

193
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Mr. 200 Matt says $100. I mean if I was a serious Mega Man fan and collector I would dig in.

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But I have the games on so many platforms now. Legacy Collections, SNES Mini, etc.

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So maybe the fact that this game has kind of been re-released to death.

196
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Maybe this is not the type of thing that a collector would be getting at this point.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It would have been cool if it was a new Mega Man game.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like a new Mega Man X type game or that would have been like Mega Man 12 or something like that.

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And then release an NES version as well as it on modern platforms. That would have been pretty awesome.

200
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Right, right.

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's a little asking for much, but I don't know. That would have been cool.

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I guess I've seen things that have been even more ridiculous for way more money.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So I don't think it's unreasonable.

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Let's see. Brad from Pod Culture says saw SNES Mini at Target today. Didn't have the $80 to spare.

205
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's true. We've got to remember these collector's items and the money that goes with it.

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's a luxury to many people.

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Dungeon Buster says I wish Breath of the Wild or Bayonetta 2 came with manuals and stickers too.

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Those empty Switch cases need some filler.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well that's probably a whole other topic for another episode.

210
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But yeah, obviously the way games are distributed and stuff have really changed.

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, even a lot of the Switch cases...

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I have my Switch case and I just take the cartridge out and pop it in the case that comes with it.

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The cartridge holder in the case.

214
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It would be nice to have those extra instructions because I think I was looking at...

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was trying to find the instructions for something.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh yeah, I think Mario Odyssey or something like that.

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I was trying to find out if there were some motion controls you had to do.

218
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm like, why are you doing these motion controls?

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There's got to be a way that can do these moves without motion controls.

220
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And unfortunately there was not.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya brings up something that happened in the past saying,

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I know they did something similar before with the limited re-release of Street Fighter 2 on SNES.

223
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, so this is maybe something that I Am 8-Bit is exploring doing more often.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Maybe this is something that's being successful enough that it's warranting to do more releases like this.

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't know, what if they did something that's really close to your heart?

226
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Dark Sakura, how would you feel if these I Am 8-Bit wanted to do a Guardian Legend re-release that came with a dish?

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I have an original.

228
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Okay, so no need for any of these like remakes?

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No, not really, besides that no one would bring it out with a dish.

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What's something that you think is, or if there is, do you think there's something that might be really hard to find retro that maybe this would be like an answer to?

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Do you think there's anything out there where maybe it's not so easy to find a retro copy of that?

232
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Radiant Silver Gun?

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So something that's like, I guess like Suikoden comes to mind too.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Like even though they've kind of, you know, you can get that in like the PlayStation 3 backwards.

235
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm still trying to find a relatively, I'd say $50 range copy of Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn.

236
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Or Robit Mondu, which I still really want that game.

237
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Ninja Gaiden Trilogy on Super Nintendo, you guys still have that right?

238
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
In the box, with manual.

239
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, but that would be one where it's like, those are hard. You can't just walk into a used game store and find it.

240
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Someone must have given me $450 bucks for it, it can be yours.

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Because that's what it's worth, right?

242
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Crazy, crazy.

244
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let's see, Dartitsia in chat says, there's also that US release of Holy Diver. I think Famicom carts of that are still pretty expensive.

245
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sure, you know, we'll see maybe more and more homebrew stuff that shows up with these types of things, which it seems like, you know, as some of the patents and copyrights of this cartridge technology.

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And just the fact that the technology is more and more easily, like, you know, obtainable by regular people like you and me.

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I think we might see more, like, homebrew that shows up in these types of cartridges.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Anyway.

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Alright, well, I just wanted to see what you guys thought of this, and if it was something that you think would be a valuable addition to your collection.

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But it sounds like maybe the original, the OG, is still the best to get at the end of the day.

251
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Anyway, if you guys have additional thoughts on that, you can always email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

252
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
In the meantime, I think we're going to get into how was your gaming week, and we're going to start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

253
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I am, I played stuff. I actually did things.

254
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What I did is I played the Kirby game, finally, because JD loaned it to me, and I was really actually pleased to finally give a chance to play it.

255
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I got through the whole first stage, you know, the first whatever world it is, and had a really good time. It's super fun.

256
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's not, like, terribly difficult, but I wasn't really expecting it to be.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I also picked up two games. I finally actually put in to buy a reproduction game for Dan, because we've had zero luck finding it.

258
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So I picked up Ninja 5-0 for Dan, or as it was, Ninja Cop. He hasn't played it yet, but he's also been really busy.

259
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And then I picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner for Sega Saturn, which I am going to need translations to be able to play it, but I wanted it. The price was right.

260
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And other than that, I've been playing, what's the game, Idol Poring. I've been playing some Pokemon Go, and I've been playing, I've actually gotten back into Bejeweled, honestly enough, which it's like my mindless, I need to relax game.

261
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So that's what I'm playing, and I've given up on that Bust-A-Move, Puzzle Bobble, buy tickets to continue game, because it just turned into shit.

262
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's got modes in there that I don't like, and, oh no, not that one, PEGGLE. It was PEGGLE. I want the old PEGGLE back, and it doesn't work on iOS 11, so I have a sad face over that.

263
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And then a lot of pinball, because we've got the getaway and we're playing it. I will go ahead and say this, on Friday, May 18th, if you are in Northern California, come to the Golden State Pinball Expo in Lodi. It will be amazing, it will be fun, and you can play the same getaway that I keep cussing at. And that's it.

264
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Did they pay for that commercial?

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No. I want people to yell at it too, because it's a bitch.

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

267
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It was good, I played lots of Dance Dance Revolution still, and then I also played a bit more of Super Mario Odyssey, so I finally just made it to the Metro Kingdom.

268
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Because unlike my son, who's already beat the game, and now he told me today that he unlocked the dark side of the moon, I've been just collecting as many moons in each of the levels as I can as I go through it, so it's been progressing a little bit slower, but more of a completionist in that sense, I guess.

269
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Then what else? I've been kind of trying to figure out what I want to get for the Switch, actually, because I was staring at the lineup of games that they had at GameStop today, and honestly, I don't know, it doesn't seem like there's much out there.

270
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I mean, I know there's a lot of indie games that are on the platform, but not a lot of them really kind of say, hey, buy me.

271
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't know, it's just kind of hard to decide what I want to get, so I haven't gotten anything other than the three games that I have now.

272
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What else did I play? I played a little bit of PlayStation VR, because we had some guests over, so we got that back out again, so more Job Simulator.

273
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Is the PlayStation VR kind of like the Wii U was, where it's your party system?

274
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, yeah, it's more of a lot of people that haven't played VR games, so two kids that were over, they hadn't played VR games, and they've been really wanting to play VR games.

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's interesting, though, because I think, sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I think a lot of people have been apprehensive about VR, because only the person with the VR headset on can really experience the VR.

276
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Not necessarily, yeah, you can have it on TV. The one game we played, and I tried to see, my youngest son wants to play the VR games, but since a lot of the games we have are the early VR games, they're not entirely the best when it comes to setting things up.

277
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
For example, I tried the one kid that came over, he wanted to play Superhot, because he's watched a lot of YouTube videos of people playing Superhot, and he wanted to try that out.

278
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So I popped in Superhot, but I couldn't get it to go back to the first level, and I had no fucking clue on how to do anything.

279
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm like, how do I get this back to the first level in this thing? Is that even possible? Because it didn't seem possible, there was no fucking menu anywhere.

280
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So I was like, I don't know what the fuck to do with this, so we ended up moving on to something else, and then it came to Job Simulator, which Job Simulator, they have you kind of calibrate the system a little bit, but then you have to raise and lower the floor to make it so that the height feels right to you.

281
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The problem is they don't really have anything to kind of give you context to the height. There's a grid on the floor, but you can't tell how big that grid's supposed to be.

282
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Here's a counter that's supposed to be waist high or something, so get this so that it looks like the counter is waist high to you, and then be okay.

283
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Because the first time I did it, it was way too low. It looked like he was a baby trying to reach stuff, and it was just way too low, so we had to recalibrate again, and it was way too high.

284
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And it was a pain in the ass, because I just want to play the game, and I have to keep calibrating this bullshit until I get it right.

285
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And trying to do that with a kid, trying to get them to calibrate it, it's a fucking pain in the ass. So they need to do it much better in other games.

286
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But they had fun anyways, once we finally got it calibrated after the third or fourth time.

287
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And I assume that's just because that's an earlier VR game, now they probably have better solutions for that. I don't know, I just wish it would be patched better or something like that.

288
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But yeah, I think the other game we played too was the PlayStation VR, it was the Playroom VR.

289
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So that free game that they have with all the robots and stuff, the Sony stuff. So what's kind of cool about that one is they have stuff that multiple people can play at the same time.

290
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So they had one where my son was this giant monster thing, and he had to chase after other robots, which were us.

291
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And so we had controllers that were controlling those. But the problem is, it was giving him instructions on his headset, and I couldn't see what those instructions were.

292
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And because he's only four and can't read, it made it hard for him to play that. I'm like, well, I know from the trailer that it had the kid roaring, so why don't you try roaring?

293
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Because I think that's maybe what you're supposed to do. And it was hilarious, because all it did is it voice-changed his roar to sound like the chipmunks or something like that.

294
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's like, Roar! Roar! It was ridiculous. But I don't know what he was supposed to do, because the instructions were only on his screen, and like I said, he couldn't read it, so fuck if I know.

295
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But he had fun anyways.

296
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Okay, that's good. Kids like that dumb stuff too, or it's like voice-changing and all that silly stuff.

297
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, I mean, it's just hard to... they need to... UI is a big thing. UI and calibration is like a must.

298
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
People developing these games need to understand that this has to be perfect in order to be able to play the game well.

299
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I don't know, I just don't think that some of these games were there. But that's like launch games, so newer stuff I'm sure is better now.

300
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Fair enough.

301
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And then of course, Pokemon Go, I've been playing a little bit of that, and I don't know, that's about it.

302
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Sia Tabiri in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the young Simba voice, the roar, just can't wait to be king.

303
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's pretty much, like it was funny because he was talking, and it's super high-pitched, and I'm like, I don't know what the point of that is, but it was silly.

304
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And he also, he wants me to get the Labo stuff, like we were looking at it again.

305
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh boy.

306
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And I'm like, there are so many things against why I should do this. One, they want the robot ones.

307
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
They're gonna break it.

308
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They want the robot one, the robot one's $80. And I'm like, I know, if I buy this, you're gonna play it a couple times, and you're gonna get bored with it immediately.

309
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And then they're gonna throw a tantrum and smash it.

310
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
They're not gonna throw a tantrum and smash it, but it's gonna be some crap that's...

311
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Sorry, your wife is gonna throw a tantrum and smash it.

312
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's gonna be some crap that's gonna be sitting in a room somewhere because it's fucking huge.

313
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So I'm like, I don't, I can't see this as being...

314
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That's been holding me back too. Now, I don't have the whole kid factor, but you know, I like creation type of games, and you know, in theory, I like Labo, except I still don't get like, where's the game?

315
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But anyway, that's all there's to it.

316
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's a Nintendo move. It's the tech demo, let's sell it as a game.

317
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You know what, I like it in the way that I like Legos, and it's cool. I'm not gonna like knock Labo. It's just, it's not for me because I need to have less shit in this house, not more shit.

318
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And that's exactly the problem. Like, you know, even Alan was teasing me because we saw it in the store the other day. He's like, oh, you want to get the Nintendo Labo, get the piano?

319
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And I'm like, really? You really want me to bring that in the house? You really want another thing that we gotta find a place for in the house?

320
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I mean, it's neat, but it's just like, I don't see myself playing that, or even my kids playing that long term.

321
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm like, there's no way. First off, they won't build it. It'll be me building that thing.

322
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And second, it'll be me building that thing and them going, is it done yet? I want to play! Why is it taking so long?

323
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's like, so it's gonna be that. And then they're gonna play it, and they're gonna have fun with it.

324
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then they're gonna fight over who gets to play it. And then they're gonna play it for a while.

325
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And then they're gonna be bored with it. And then it's gonna be, you know, they'll do it for a few days.

326
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And they'll be like, hey, you wanna play the robot game? And they'll be like, no, that's boring.

327
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So it's just 80 bucks.

328
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dart Tetsuya says,

329
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
yeah, you wouldn't believe all the videos that have come out with people making stuff with some of the kits.

330
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I will say that much. Are they doing hacks? Like IKEA hacks?

331
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No, you can actually program your own things. So they have a toolbox or lab mode or something like that

332
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
where you can build your own things out of it.

333
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And, I mean, some of it's kind of cool, I guess.

334
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
But I don't know what the, I don't know how much utility there is there other than playing with that for a little bit.

335
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I just don't think it's, it's not like a Mario Maker or something like that where you're gonna play the game

336
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and you're gonna get a lot of use out of it. And there's a lot more, you know, playability with it.

337
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I think a lot of these things, it is, well, like even with a variety pack, there's not a lot of playability there.

338
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I mean, you can do music stuff. I mean, sure, with the piano thing.

339
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But it's not something that's gonna be, you're gonna get burnt out on it really fast.

340
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
If I had a kid who was like musically inclined, I would totally snatch that Labo thing up.

341
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Actually, and I think I've said this about Labo before, like Labo would have been the thing I wanted when I was like 9 or 10.

342
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That would have been amazing. Because, you know, I was into music, I was into Legos, I'm into video games.

343
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's a perfect marriage of all those things. So, like, Labo is for me just like a little late.

344
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But anyway. My gaming week. Types of video games I've been playing this week.

345
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So, of course, I've been playing Pokemon Go because I love my Pokemon Go.

346
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And I finally got Mew in Pokemon Go. So, I think that's kind of like a landmark thing is I finally got Mew.

347
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I kind of took my time with the quest. Like, I know a lot of people got that a long time ago.

348
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But I was like, you know, they're not gonna push anything new. Like, it's not like they're gonna come out with Celebi next week.

349
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You know, it's gonna take some time before they put out, you know, more quests.

350
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So, I'll just kind of take my time and that way I don't kind of burn myself out trying to chase down like, you know, 10 ghost types or 400 Magikarp candies or, you know, all the stuff.

351
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Although the events they've been doing, they've been doing a lot more like regular events in Pokemon Go that have, I think, really helped just kind of keep that game more interesting.

352
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So, that's pretty cool.

353
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I'm getting EX raid passes all of a sudden. Like, I have an EX raid pass for Monday and I have another one for the Monday after.

354
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So, that was weird because I wasn't getting any before and now I'm getting like EX raid passes. It just sucks that they're on Monday, but I'll make it work.

355
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Are they like local or are they just like...

356
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
They're by my work. So, they're not like here, but they're local to my work.

357
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And it makes sense because I've been known to at lunch. I'll go and walk around a park and if there's like a Magikarp or, you know, a one star, two star on the gym, I'll do it.

358
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And that's how I've gotten these raid passes. So, you know, that's kind of a thing.

359
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So, I'm still playing Pokemon Go and...

360
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Let's see, what else have I been playing?

361
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Honestly, when it comes to like other games, just a little bit of Minecraft.

362
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Don't worry, Loki. I haven't been leaving you out. I'm waiting for Bobby to get back so he can get into that realms thing.

363
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So, I'm trying not to burn myself out of Minecraft.

364
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So, for the most part, I've put that on hold, but I did play that a little bit.

365
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I've been playing... Like, the game I just suddenly like got obsessed with all over again is Diablo 3.

366
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I've been playing a ton of Diablo 3.

367
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And I know, like, this was a game I was probably talking about a year or two ago that I was playing a lot.

368
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And it's just kind of one of those things where something clicked on.

369
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And just something about that real like zen way, you just kind of sit there and kill, kill, kill, die.

370
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm playing a wizard, so it's all like pew, pew laser beams.

371
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So, I just melt things with my little lasers like...

372
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You know, and everything like dies and I get loot.

373
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And there's just something very satisfying about murdering hell demons and getting loot.

374
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So, I've been playing a lot of it.

375
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Like, to put it in perspective, I think during last week...

376
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I've probably been playing a little bit up to last week's show, but I wasn't level 70 yet.

377
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm already paragon 230 now.

378
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So, I've been playing a little bit and I'm already up through like being able to do like a greater 45,

379
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
which is like equivalent of a Torment 10.

380
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Which is, you know, it's not the best, but it's, you know, I've been investing a little time in it.

381
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And then here's another random one.

382
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Maybe Jamie will appreciate this, I don't know.

383
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But on the Xbox One, you know, they give away the free games with gold.

384
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
One of the things they're giving away this month is the Streets of Rage collection on the 360.

385
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You know who doesn't have an Xbox One?

386
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Uh, you.

387
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But Streets of Rage.

388
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I already have cartridges.

389
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah, so I had a feeling that was gonna be you as you're like, oh, I already got...

390
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I actually have a bare knuckle.

391
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Do you?

392
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah.

393
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Nice. The collection's cool.

394
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So, I played a little bit.

395
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I played a little Streets of Rage 1 and I think I made it up through like the second boss.

396
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And then I was like, okay.

397
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I remember these old beat-em-up games were the shit in the 90s.

398
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Now they feel really repetitive.

399
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Kind of sucks.

400
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah.

401
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Like, I don't know.

402
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Even the Ninja Turtles arcade game.

403
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Like, it's awesome for like a little bit.

404
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And then you're like, God, this is really repetitive.

405
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because you're missing the dark pizza-filled, you know, smell-filled rooms.

406
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Maybe.

407
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Maybe, yeah.

408
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Where you were kind of limited on one quarter into 15 minutes for your pizza to be ready.

409
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That's what I'm saying.

410
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That's what I'm saying.

411
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Like, I remember and I don't know maybe if it's just different nowadays.

412
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But like, I remember like pizza and like arcades and stuff like that were like very dark.

413
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Like, Chuck E. Cheese is like fucking bright now.

414
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I remember it being like some dark-ass, you know, arcade.

415
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
The Chuck E. Cheese's that I went to had like darker rooms.

416
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But most of the like big areas were kind of lit.

417
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But I mean, when for me all up until like my late teens, we had an Aladdin's castle that had carpeted walls.

418
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And it was dark.

419
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And it had a smoking section.

420
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So, there would be the occasional cigarette burn on the machine.

421
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And it was dark and wonderful.

422
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And then of course playing, you know, on roller skates at the roller rink too.

423
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Because like I said, I still can't play Frogger without being on roller skates to this day.

424
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Love it.

425
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

426
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Agdeft with the clarification there saying, Streets of Rage is actually 360.

427
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah, right.

428
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I should have been more clear with that.

429
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Even though I'm playing it on Xbox One, it is free through Games with Gold.

430
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And it is a 360, like the vintage collection.

431
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I also don't want to pay.

432
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Well, but if you're already paying for Games with Gold, which if you want to play Xbox online, you get anyway.

433
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Then you get Streets of Rage for that.

434
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You know, for what I could pay for Games with Gold, that could be a few tacos.

435
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It could be tacos. It is taco money.

436
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Tacos are amazing.

437
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Tacos are great.

438
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I love tacos.

439
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Let's see, also in chat.

440
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Sia Tabiri talking about Pokemon Go saying,

441
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
For the longest time I thought Mr. Mime was pronounced Mr. Mime.

442
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because it seemed weird that they'd have that word be the English pronunciation.

443
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You know how I knew it was Mr. Mime?

444
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
The cartoon.

445
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Because all those little fuckers say their names over and over.

446
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Mr. Mime!

447
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Mr. Mime!

448
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Except, is that his name?

449
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
No, that's not his name on the Japanese one.

450
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Oh, did he get a different name in Japan?

451
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah.

452
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah.

453
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's Barriered.

454
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Ah, there you go. That's why.

455
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So, yeah.

456
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Only a very small handful of them kept their Japanese name.

457
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Like Pikachu?

458
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah.

459
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Which, by the way, not on the show world tonight,

460
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
but did you hear that random story about how Pikachu supposedly had another evolution in the game?

461
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It was like Gorochu or something like that?

462
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It was supposed to be like an evolved Raichu.

463
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Gorochu, does it get like six arms?

464
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
No, but it gets buff and it was supposed to, like I think,

465
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
don't quote me on this guys, but I think it was something about it had horns and little vampire teeth.

466
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Which sounds really adorable.

467
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But, um, yeah.

468
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And it would have been, it could have been, I guess they took it out for balance reasons,

469
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
but I'm thinking, like, Raichu's really not that powerful?

470
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
No one uses Raichu, and it sucks that the Pikachus are so fucking hard to catch in the first place.

471
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's like, you're fucking useless, stupid Pikachu.

472
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I don't know, why are you so hard to catch?

473
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Poor Pikachu. Alright, anyway. But he's cute.

474
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Anyway, I guess that's really it for my gaming week.

475
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So, let's get into some housekeeping.

476
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
We will not be here towards the end of June,

477
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
although we will be having our 16th anniversary show.

478
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
We're really old, you guys.

479
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
We're going to be having our 16th anniversary show on June 17th.

480
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The best reward for 16 years hard working, a week off.

481
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So we won't be here on June 24th.

482
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Speaking of weeks off, Dark Soccer's not going to be here next week.

483
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah.

484
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But for a really good reason. You're ditching us for Drag Queens.

485
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm going to Drag Con.

486
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah, not Dragun Con.

487
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
No, Drag Con.

488
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Where there will be cosplay.

489
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
There will be queens.

490
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
My pal Aria Snark from Shaking and Crying is going to be there with you, so that will be fun.

491
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And if anyone wants to find me, I will be at the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence booth

492
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
on Friday in the afternoon, like sometime after 3 something.

493
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Cool.

494
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And around the same time, actually 2 I think, on Saturday.

495
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Awesome.

496
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So I will be there working the table with the sisters.

497
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I will be working it.

498
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Well, speaking of Dragun Con, since we're leading from drag to Dragun Con,

499
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I can confirm that I will be at Dragun Con this Labor Day.

500
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So, and I'm on the website and everything, which is really nice.

501
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So very, very happy and excited to be working with the podcasting track again.

502
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I probably won't know my schedule till less than a month before,

503
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
but as soon as I know what panels I'll be on, I'll be sure to let you guys all know.

504
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So check that out in Atlanta this Labor Day.

505
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
If you can't catch Jamie in LA this week.

506
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'll also be at Disneyland if anyone happens to be there.

507
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Are you offering to ride Space Mountain with the listeners?

508
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
No.

509
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Okay.

510
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Only if they give me the front seat.

511
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Okay.

512
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I mean, if someone wants to buy me a churro, I won't say no.

513
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
They have some good churros. Don't they have all the special stuff at Disney now?

514
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
The last time I was at Disneyland, they had the golden churros,

515
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
which are like the gold sugar.

516
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The only one that I really want to try is the carrot cake churro,

517
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
which is, I think, in Frontierland.

518
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Except the cream cheese frosting that comes with it has fucking raisins in it.

519
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And raisins are disgusting and vile and they're...

520
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Didn't we have this discussion before?

521
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
They're vile little liars.

522
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
All right.

523
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Ruiners of cookies.

524
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Let's get into some ruiners of gaming news here at Orange Lounge Radio,

525
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
together with you guys in our chat at live.vogue.com.

526
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What's going on in gaming news this week? Loki.

527
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So the FTC basically are giving Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony

528
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
a 30-day window to change their warranty language

529
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
to let consumers know that they can make repairs

530
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
or use third-party replacement products without voiding those warranties.

531
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So you may remember, we talked about this a few weeks ago,

532
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
how they said in a press release that there are certain languages

533
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
in these warranty or end-user license agreements that were basically illegal,

534
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but no one was really kind of enforcing that.

535
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So now they're kind of coming down on them.

536
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So basically this kind of includes a lot of things like,

537
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
you know, you may see those stickers on your console

538
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
where it says, warranty void if removed or damaged.

539
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I know I had to deal with that with my 360s

540
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
because they would have that, you know,

541
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
oh hey, you can't open your 360 up to do anything.

542
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But now they have to basically allow them that they can't have those.

543
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Because it won't void the warranty if there's something done to it.

544
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And also they have to have the right to repair,

545
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
which allows people to take them to a third-party location to have them repaired.

546
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Also they were saying that they've also sent letters out to

547
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
HTC, Asus, and Hyundai as well.

548
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But yeah, so it'd be interesting to see how that kind of,

549
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm sure it's just going to be some fixes to their, you know,

550
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
warranty jargon or whatever.

551
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Yeah, this is an interesting little change because of like everything

552
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that's kind of, you know, trickled down from that original little thing

553
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
that they kind of yelled at Nintendo about, right?

554
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah.

555
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So, I mean, it's good that you have other people, you know,

556
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
being able to fix those consoles and stuff.

557
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I mean, I used to just ignore it anyways.

558
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Or even better is you'd find a way to take the warranty sticker off

559
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and then put it back on.

560
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Put it back on.

561
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I just get it a little bit hot, or it's like steaming open the envelope.

562
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

563
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So, you know, it's, I don't know.

564
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I think if you're taking it someplace to get it repaired,

565
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
it's like, well, fuck it.

566
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
They're not going to, you know,

567
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
why are you taking it someplace to get it repaired third-party

568
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
if the original company's not going to fix it?

569
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I seem to remember back in the day,

570
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
with the earlier Sony consoles and maybe even Nintendo stuff,

571
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
you had your official authorized repair people.

572
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah, they don't do that anymore.

573
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's more, you have to, like, send that stuff in to them.

574
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh, well.

575
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Showing my age.

576
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't know.

577
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay.

578
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I mean, good.

579
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I think anybody should be able to repair that stuff, you know.

580
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
They shouldn't, your warranty shouldn't be voided,

581
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
especially for even, like, using third-party devices,

582
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
like third-party products because, I mean,

583
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
we had this whole, just recently, the whole thing with the third-party docks.

584
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Right, that's like what I was talking about with the third-party docks

585
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and, like, they were, like, fucking up consoles

586
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and one of them came down really hard on Nintendo about that whole thing.

587
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah, it's like, there's no reason that should be fucking up your console.

588
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah.

589
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You should get a little bit of choice into how to repair that stuff,

590
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
although I understand that they don't want people to go in there and just, you know, like...

591
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Well, they don't want people modifying their device and they also, like...

592
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
They don't want to have to pay for your fuck-up.

593
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah, basically.

594
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I get that.

595
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I get that, but, you know, come on.

596
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah.

597
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Well, moving on to a different story about Nintendo.

598
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Let's talk about reading since Dark Sakura is going to DragCon this week.

599
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You want to talk about reading? Let's talk about reading.

600
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
No.

601
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The library is open.

602
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Let's actually talk about reading

603
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
because Nintendo is pairing up with publisher Random House

604
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
for some books that are based on Nintendo characters.

605
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
These are books that are going to be coming in January of 2019 per Nintendo.

606
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The books, the first two of which entered the marketplace in early January,

607
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
are based on Nintendo characters and worlds, including Super Mario,

608
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and Animal Crossing.

609
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So earlier this year in January,

610
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Random House actually started two full-color official sticker books

611
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
based on Super Mario and Legend of Zelda.

612
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So there's, like, the Super Mario official sticker book

613
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and The Legend of Zelda official sticker book.

614
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
These are both $12.99.

615
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This summer, Mario Time and Link's Book of Adventure are coming out.

616
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
There's going to also be a Splatoon official sticker book,

617
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and, yeah, this is all sorts of fun things coming out.

618
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So I'm not sure. It's weird that it's like,

619
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
okay, they're talking about there's books that are already out,

620
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
but then I guess there's also this team-up that's happening in 2019.

621
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I don't know if that means we're going beyond stickers

622
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and getting into, like, actual, like,

623
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
that's what it kind of reads like to me that we're actually, pun intended,

624
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
that we're actually getting into, like, books based on characters.

625
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
You know, like, maybe, like, a Dr. Seuss novel

626
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
but starring Mario type of thing.

627
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Um...

628
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah.

629
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Not a fan?

630
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
No. I mean, I know they do, like, a lot of the licensed stuff, but, you know.

631
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I don't want to read about Mario. I'd rather play Mario.

632
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Okay, my brain instantly goes to, and I know some of y'all remember this,

633
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
but those Worlds of Power books from when,

634
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
God, it was probably, like, the late 80s, early 90s,

635
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
when they turned, like, Castlevania 2, Ninja Gaiden,

636
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
was Contra a book too? I don't remember.

637
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
No, it was Mega Man. One of the Mega Mans was a book too.

638
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
They turned a bunch of old, like, video games from Nintendo, like, into books,

639
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and they were, like, young adult novels.

640
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Like, they were the types of things that, like,

641
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
you know, they were maybe, like, 100 pages in slightly bigger font,

642
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
but, you know, for an 11-year-old, it was, you know,

643
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
it was summertime reading for that.

644
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I distinctly remember those books.

645
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Blaster Master, that was a big one, because the Blaster Master one,

646
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
even though the books were not really, like,

647
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
nobody involved with the official games were involved with those books,

648
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I think there was something about the people who made Blaster Master

649
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
actually incorporated something from that book into Blaster Master canon later on.

650
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It was kind of a big deal. So, do you remember those?

651
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Am I the only one that remembers these?

652
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
No, but I do remember something that's kind of random,

653
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
is I remember that they had some Nintendo scratchers,

654
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
not, like, you know, lottery tickets, but they're for kids,

655
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
where you play a little game where you had to, like, kind of,

656
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
it was kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure type thing,

657
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
but you had to scratch off the little spots,

658
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
and it would let you know if you, like, got killed or whatever.

659
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I don't remember. But I remember they had some-

660
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You were eaten by a grew.

661
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It was, like, I think the original Mario Brothers,

662
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
not, like, the new, you know, like, Super Mario Brothers.

663
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I remember, though. I do remember having those.

664
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yes. They were, like, little maze cards, right?

665
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah.

666
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Yeah, I remember those.

667
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah.

668
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That was the thing.

669
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I don't know what they were, but, like, I sort of remember that.

670
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Let's see. D'Artizia says,

671
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I remember seeing pictures of the scratch cards,

672
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and also Metal Gear had a book, I think, in that series.

673
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yes, it did.

674
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Metal Gear absolutely had a book.

675
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And it wasn't bad.

676
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
At least my 11-year-old self thought it wasn't bad.

677
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Now, if I probably went back and read it now,

678
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'd probably be like, this is trash.

679
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm gonna go looking for it.

680
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Are you gonna-

681
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I wanna say that the complete text is available online.

682
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, yeah, the PDF is out there, but hold on.

683
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
There's actually a Metal Gear Solid novel.

684
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Not Metal Gear Solid.

685
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I know, I'm looking for the old book.

686
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Worlds of Power.

687
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm almost positive it was called that.

688
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It was, like, Blaster Master was one.

689
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Anyway, Kaijiro in chat says,

690
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm gonna start a new trend on Twitch with those sticker books.

691
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's gonna be called Let's Read.

692
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I actually have a friend who does a lot of that on his channel.

693
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Holy shit, they went 43 bucks for this.

694
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
For those books?

695
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
For the Metal Gear one.

696
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Dang.

697
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
July 1st, 1990.

698
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It wasn't that good.

699
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
There's the Blaster Master book.

700
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
There's a Ninja Gaiden book.

701
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yep, I remember these.

702
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm just looking at the list of them.

703
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I had them all.

704
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You could get them at the grocery store.

705
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Like, it was the same people that did the steamy romance novels.

706
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It's just that, you know, it was like a young adult thing.

707
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Dude, I actually more want the Ninja Gaiden one.

708
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Do you remember when the grocery stores would sell steamy romance novels?

709
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
They still do.

710
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Do they still do?

711
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
They're just over in the, like, magazine section.

712
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
See, the magazine section isn't, like, prominent anymore.

713
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's, like, hidden away with, like, because who buys magazines?

714
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Ooh, okay, so I can get the Ninja Gaiden one for $5.94.

715
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But yeah, they still have trashy novels.

716
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's all that's there.

717
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Trashy novels and, like, magazines that no one's read.

718
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I didn't think trashy novels were, like, still a thing.

719
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Oh god, they are.

720
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah.

721
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Okay.

722
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
How do you know all this?

723
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's in good condition.

724
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I know because I look at those.

725
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm like, those are dumb.

726
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Who would buy that?

727
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And then I look at the magazines.

728
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Those are also dumb.

729
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Who would buy those?

730
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And then I go purchase, like, what else is on the aisle?

731
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
No, it's not candy.

732
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's, like, it's cleaning supplies.

733
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Like, it's, I need to go get some dishwasher pods.

734
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Okay, like, if I'm at Rite Aid or something, there's always, like, the, like, OK magazine.

735
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And, like, all the, all the ridiculous shit.

736
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Like, I don't know who is buying, like, Inquirer and Weekly.

737
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I don't even think Weekly World News is around anymore.

738
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But other stuff like it.

739
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Oh, I love Weekly World News.

740
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Like, this is, like, the complete, it's always, like, some horrible picture of Hillary Clinton.

741
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And it's, like, Killory did this this week.

742
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You know, it's, like, totally, like, like, all these, like, just straight up, like, made-up shit.

743
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That's, like, on these magazines.

744
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Or, you know, Cher given six months to live.

745
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And, like, this really horrible picture of Cher or something like that.

746
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Like, I'm like, who buys this garbage?

747
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
So, VG Museum that hosts the Castlevania dungeon has the Simon's Quest book as PDF.

748
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, okay.

749
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm sorry, as a Word version of plain text.

750
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Interesting.

751
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I wouldn't think that's legal, but maybe after so many years, maybe it's public domain at some point?

752
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
No.

753
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Well, I'm saving it because I'm going to read it.

754
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah, literary stuff shouldn't go into the public domain after just 30 years.

755
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I mean, it's not even quite been 30 years, so.

756
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's probably illegal, but they're probably just not selling those books anymore.

757
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So, no harm, no foul, I suppose.

758
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm sure they stopped selling those a long time ago.

759
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, anyway, if you want to get some new books, you'll be able to get Random House doing some Nintendo books in the near future.

760
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You know, it does kind of make sense, though, before we go to the next story.

761
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It does kind of make sense because Nintendo's kind of like ramping up with this whole, you know, we thought they were never going to let the rights away to make a movie again.

762
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Well, they're going to be making a movie.

763
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
They're going to be doing this theme park stuff that's, you know, coming to Universal Studios.

764
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So, maybe Nintendo is kind of learning to let go of some of the licensing a little bit and not keeping it so close to their chest, realizing that they're not going to do it all, so they might as well let somebody do it that, you know, puts Mario.

765
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I mean, Mario is like fucking Mickey Mouse at this point.

766
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Right?

767
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Like, everybody knows who fucking Mario is.

768
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Anyway.

769
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Moving on, some more stories.

770
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Dark Sakura.

771
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You'll have to tear yourself away from your new book.

772
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh, I just linked it in the chatroom.

773
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
At any rate, though, we had talked before a few weeks ago about the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

774
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
They had their nominees.

775
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Well, now they have decided which ones are going to be the final four as it is.

776
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's going to be John Madden Football, Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy VII, and Space War.

777
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And these are, of course, were all selected from a player's choice ballot and then an advisory board.

778
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So, you know, to be accepted, they have to be iconic and have stood the test of time and must have worldwide appeal.

779
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So, I guess I could see John Madden Football.

780
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I mean, the original John Madden Football.

781
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah.

782
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Tomb Raider, yeah, I'd give it that too.

783
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It is franchise spawning, you know, and is still going today.

784
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Final Fantasy VII, got the fan following.

785
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Still a decent game.

786
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And Sephiroth's hair.

787
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And Space War, pretty classic.

788
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So, of course, you know, you might not have played it if you were not around in 1962.

789
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I don't know.

790
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I cannot say that I was around in 1962 to play that game.

791
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Although, actually, it was the original one that was the 1962, but it did go, you know, and spread as it went through.

792
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And then Computer Space was the first mass market version as distributed by Nolan Bushnell.

793
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So, there you go.

794
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
All right.

795
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Very cool.

796
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Do you think the right selections were made?

797
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Yeah.

798
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I remember talking about this before when the nominees were out, because DDR was on the list of nominees.

799
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And I was like, I don't think that one's going to get picked.

800
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's not the year.

801
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Now's not the time.

802
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Now is not your year, DDR.

803
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I mean, there's logic behind them.

804
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And I'm glad that, you know, something that was more of a pioneering game like Space War,

805
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
was included this time.

806
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, for sure.

807
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Yeah.

808
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Makes sense.

809
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
All right.

810
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Let's move on.

811
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Loki.

812
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So, this week, they had a new trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2.

813
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And along with that, there's some press outlets that have been kind of talking about the game,

814
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
since they got a 45-minute demo of Red Dead Redemption 2 at Rockstar North.

815
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So, they were talking about some of what they saw, because, I guess, they wasn't playable,

816
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
but they got the watch through.

817
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So, with it, I guess the game is going to have the honor system returning back from the original game.

818
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So, depending on how you interact with people in the game, it will affect on how other people will, you know, see you,

819
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
whether you're evil or good and that type of stuff.

820
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
They talked about how there's, you know, different ways you can handle situations.

821
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So, like, one instance, they were saying how there was, you know, a lot of people in the game,

822
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:47,000
one instance, they were saying how there was a fishing camp that you can loot and then the fishermen catch you.

823
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And so, you can either, you know, give everything back, you can threaten them, or you can kill them.

824
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And those are your kind of options there.

825
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:04,000
They said that, you know, the game, of course, they're trying to, they're saying that they're not trying to outdo them,

826
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
any other company, or, like, when you, since there's a lot of different open world games now,

827
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
like Zelda and Assassin's Creed, Far Cry 5 and that type of stuff.

828
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So, they're basically trying to outdo themselves, which is great because I consider, you know,

829
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Rockstar Games one of the best open world game companies out there.

830
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And then one thing they did not show, though, was multiplayer.

831
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So, I guess we're going to have to wait for E3 to see some of that.

832
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
But they did announce during the trailer when the game's scheduled to come out,

833
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
which is October 26th on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

834
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
No word on PC yet, which is kind of disappointing.

835
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I would love it on PC, but usually with the last few games, PC comes later.

836
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So, we'll just wait.

837
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, because aren't they, like, worried about rampant piracy on PC and all that stuff?

838
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I don't know if that's really the case any, I mean, sure, I guess,

839
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
but, like, I think they don't really necessarily care anymore

840
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
because a lot of that's not necessarily made on the game's sales anymore.

841
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's made on, you know, the online currency,

842
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
so I don't really think that it's such an issue anymore.

843
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So, do you think that maybe they should just make Red Dead Free?

844
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
No, it's definitely worth money.

845
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And unlike, you know, some games that just have the online component,

846
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I mean, it is a solid single player campaign,

847
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
so I would definitely say it's worth the $60 at least.

848
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I mean, the original game was fantastic,

849
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
so I have no doubts that it's going to be a great game.

850
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with vognetwork.com,

851
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
use the passphrase BANKER.

852
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yeah, even I'm curious to check it out, but you know how it goes.

853
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Yes, I know. How much time we played Grand Theft Auto 5.

854
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Why am I being attacked?

855
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You brought it up.

856
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Dungeonbuster in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

857
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
the poster for Red Dead Redemption 2 makes the main character look a bit like Charles Bronson.

858
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I would play an open world Western as Charles Bronson.

859
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It's not Bronson, but remember they tried to do a,

860
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,000
what was it, it was a Dirty Harry game, but that never ended up happening.

861
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I remember that was like E3 2006 or something like that.

862
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Alright, well moving on to patent court, patent trolls,

863
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
well not really, I don't know if you'd call this a troll though.

864
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I mean, we have stories on the show all the time about trolls,

865
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
but this one is going to be kind of...

866
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
A reach maybe?

867
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It's a little bit open to interpretation I think.

868
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So let's talk about this one because Nintendo is apparently being sued,

869
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
or taken to court by Gamevice.

870
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
This is a company that made the WikiPad and some Snap-on controllers for mobile devices.

871
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So you know how like there's no official controller for like Apple phones or for Android,

872
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
you know there's no official controller.

873
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So these are folks that make little devices that kind of like cling to your phone

874
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
and become controllers that basically will work with games and stuff.

875
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So basically they say that the Nintendo Switch violates the patents on attachable handheld gamepads

876
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and the related accessories.

877
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Gamevice is requesting a cease and desist order against Nintendo,

878
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
meaning the Switch would be halted for its imports into the US.

879
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Nintendo has declined to comment on the investigation,

880
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
and we'll see what Gamevice has to say soon.

881
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's going to get thrown out.

882
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
As should be noted, Gamevice sued Nintendo already in August for violating the WikiPad patents.

883
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It dropped it in October.

884
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So...

885
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
This is going to get thrown out.

886
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You think so?

887
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I think so.

888
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Well, and here's the thing is that usually we say troll

889
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
because usually these are coming from companies that aren't actively using patents.

890
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Like they're just sitting on these things they've acquired that just sit in a storage thing somewhere.

891
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Whereas now, okay, at least you can say this company, Gamevice,

892
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
they've been making things that snap onto devices,

893
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
but does the Switch really infringe on that?

894
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
That's the question.

895
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I don't think so.

896
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I think one thing that the Switch does too, you have to remember,

897
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
is that those devices, they latch onto multiple things too.

898
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Wouldn't that be kind of a big...

899
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Like that's a big difference because you can take those things,

900
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
you can use them individually,

901
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
which is another kind of distinction,

902
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
is that they're not like...

903
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You can use them individually and that's one way.

904
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You can put them on the dog ears, that's another way.

905
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Or you can put them on the tablet and that's another way.

906
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So they're not used for one function, they're used for multiple functions,

907
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and being on the tablet is just one of them.

908
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
But then again, I'm not going to claim to be a lawyer when it comes to patents,

909
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
so I don't fucking know.

910
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But it just seems like this is different enough to me.

911
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And they're not the only company that's had...

912
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I mean, I'm sure that...

913
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I think Nintendo has copyrights or trademarks or whatever

914
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
on certain aspects of their controller anyways.

915
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
That's true.

916
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It's like, you want to play that type of game?

917
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm sure they could sue you over some sort of patent issue or whatever,

918
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
but I don't...

919
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Is Gamefy still making these things? I don't even know.

920
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I mean, the problem with the third-party controllers for phones

921
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
is that since there is no standard, a lot of them are garbage

922
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
because they only work with certain games.

923
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It does look like garbage too.

924
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And the other big difference is that the Switch is an integral part

925
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
of the function of the device,

926
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
whereas this is a peripheral.

927
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
The Nintendo system is a flat-out system.

928
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That's a good point.

929
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm wondering also, too, being that each controller,

930
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
each half can be used as its own controller,

931
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
if that's also different enough as well.

932
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It would be interesting to see.

933
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I don't know.

934
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think they can...

935
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I mean, sure, you can try.

936
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Just don't think they're going to win.

937
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Well, we'll see what happens.

938
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Maybe they'll be trying to settle out a court or something.

939
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
ASCII in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

940
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
another company trying to get rich quick.

941
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
They were never going to do anything with their old technology anyway.

942
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Well, to be fair, they have put out these...

943
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Unlike other patent trolls we see,

944
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
they have put out a device that works for cell phones.

945
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I don't know if it's sold very well.

946
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I mean, I haven't heard of it before,

947
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
so maybe they need to recoup some of those costs.

948
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I don't know.

949
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
But that is why I was a little hesitant to flat-out call it a troll

950
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
because when it's trolls, like these companies,

951
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
they make their income off of suing people.

952
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
This company, you know, you could argue, well...

953
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
They're trying to supplement their income by suing.

954
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yes, exactly.

955
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Perfect.

956
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
SEO 100 Matt does point out they do have a legit website.

957
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Their products are sold in mass chains.

958
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So this is a little different, a little different.

959
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Sia Tabiri in chat says,

960
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
didn't Apple basically get patents on the home button

961
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and multi-touch functionality at some point

962
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and then eventually it was, oh yeah, no,

963
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that's too vague to actually enforce.

964
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
The trademark copyright stuff in this country is so...

965
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It doesn't work.

966
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You're taking rules that were written

967
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
before technology existed.

968
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's allegedly violations of the tariff act of 1930.

969
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Because 1930 knew what the fucking internet

970
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
or like video games and all that stuff was going to do.

971
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Plus I think there's been subsequent cases since then

972
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
that have shown that certain aspects of those prior laws

973
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
are now considered irrelevant

974
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
and completely have no basis in modern society.

975
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And plus as travel gets faster,

976
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
as the internet makes the world more and more global,

977
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I mean, we've seen where like other countries

978
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
will just straight up rip shit off

979
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and there's no price to pay because they're not in the US.

980
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So that further complicates...

981
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Looking at you, China.

982
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Well, yeah, I mean, but interestingly enough about China,

983
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
you know, there has been talk about, you know,

984
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
not that I really want to get into politics discussion here on the show,

985
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
but there has been talk about China has been kind of called out

986
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
for this on a political level

987
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
and has agreed to some extent to work on it.

988
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And we'll kind of leave it at that. We don't know what that means.

989
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But at least it means something that they kind of acknowledged it.

990
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Something.

991
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Anyway, that's more than we've had for, you know, years.

992
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Anyway, Dr. Suyin Chat says,

993
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I mean, I could almost see where they're coming from,

994
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
but agree the trademark laws need serious updating and revising.

995
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
As Dr. Suyin Chat says,

996
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
it's going to take a lot to fix the patent copyright trademark laws in this country.

997
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It needs to happen, no question.

998
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Well, I think one of the right moves that they're making, though,

999
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
is that, and I think this was a very recent Supreme Court thing,

1000
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
is that they basically said that you can no longer pick and choose

1001
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
where to file these patent lawsuits.

1002
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You know, like all of these patents,

1003
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
like a big majority of these patent lawsuits

1004
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
were all being filed in one town in Texas

1005
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
because it had like the friendliest court, you know,

1006
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
if you will, to like some of the rules that the patent trolls try to go by.

1007
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Well, the Supreme Court has basically shut that down and said,

1008
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
no, you have to file in a place where you do business, basically.

1009
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And that makes logical sense.

1010
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I can't see that being a Republican or Democrat issue.

1011
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I mean, I don't know, I haven't read really that far into it,

1012
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
but I can't see where that is controversial to say,

1013
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
you need to file it in a place where you exist.

1014
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You know what I mean?

1015
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I think that's a good first step.

1016
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So we just need more stuff like that.

1017
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Anyway, let's move on before I get too far into politics.

1018
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Let's talk about gaming politics, DarkSakura.

1019
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Oh, you know I get fired up on that.

1020
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
But, well, you know, we had been talking about,

1021
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
well, this isn't really political.

1022
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It's more of a reaction, I think, to the politics.

1023
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
But Destiny 2 is doing something to revamp the loot box system

1024
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
by coming out with something called a prismatic matrix.

1025
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So the way it'll work is that you'll get ten Eververse items

1026
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
from season three each week that it's active,

1027
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
but they also will knock out things that you've already received

1028
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
so that you get something unique every time.

1029
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And if you activate one ten times, you will get every item.

1030
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So you can earn those things too.

1031
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You can pay for them with in-game currency.

1032
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Previous activations will also knock things off of the rewards list

1033
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
so that you're guaranteed to get something different each time.

1034
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Seems like it's an improvement.

1035
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The whole catch, though, with this is that...

1036
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
There's still loot boxes.

1037
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Right, you get one a week.

1038
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So if you want more, it's 200 silvers, which is $2.

1039
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So you can get more if you feel like paying for it,

1040
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
but, you know, you got to pay for it.

1041
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Or you could be patient. Patience!

1042
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Patience.

1043
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Have some.

1044
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
All right, let's move on.

1045
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
We're just a couple more stories away from our classic game of the week.

1046
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
But first, Loki.

1047
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yes, unfortunately, not some great news,

1048
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,000
but one very popular YouTube personality, John TotalBiscuitBain,

1049
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
he came out...

1050
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He's been fighting bowel cancer for several years now.

1051
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And so he posted something...

1052
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Or I should say his PR had posted something on his official Reddit

1053
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
talking about his current situation.

1054
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So I'm just going to read some of this real quick

1055
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
because it kind of sums up the whole problem.

1056
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
So when I went into a hospital a week or so ago,

1057
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
it was accompanied by the news that

1058
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
a conventional chemotherapy's effectiveness has been exhausted.

1059
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
My body has now become resistant to all forms,

1060
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
according to my oncologist.

1061
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
46 chemo treatments, 138 days plugged into the pump.

1062
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Let nobody ever say I wasn't stubborn.

1063
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Unfortunately, this was followed up by a couple days later

1064
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
with some more bad news.

1065
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
My liver is failing and its effectiveness has lowered past to the point

1066
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
where clinical trials I had been offered would take me on.

1067
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Yes, apparently there are things that are too dangerous for even the terminal.

1068
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Obviously, we're going to keep looking for other trials,

1069
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
but I'm currently coming to terms with the fact that I don't have long left.

1070
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And right now, at any rate, there's literally nothing I can do about it

1071
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
other than trying to manage pain as best as I can,

1072
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
stay hydrated as possible to ease the pressure on my liver.

1073
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And then with that, he basically said,

1074
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
it's now a case of, what do I do with the time I have left?

1075
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Why am I telling you?

1076
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Because you're a viewer of my content and this is relevant to you.

1077
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So what he's basically said he's going to do,

1078
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
he's going to stop doing the games critic bit.

1079
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
He's going to keep doing his co-optional podcast

1080
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and just basically hoping that after, it's just a matter of time.

1081
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
He's basically, he knows he's going to die

1082
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and it's just about being comfortable and spending time with family and everything.

1083
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
He's hoping that his wife takes over with the channel

1084
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and everything once he's done,

1085
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
but he's trying to provide for them at the same time.

1086
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's unfortunate.

1087
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I mean, he's been very prominent in the whole gaming industry

1088
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
and it's sad to see that this has happened

1089
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
because at one point, it had gone in the remission

1090
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
and he was doing better, but it just came back.

1091
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah. I mean, I haven't always seen eye to eye on some of his opinions,

1092
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
but some of them I have agreed with

1093
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and now is not really the time for that sort of debate.

1094
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Cancer fucking sucks and I hope he can be as comfortable as possible

1095
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
and get everything that can be done off that bucket list that he wants to do.

1096
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I have such respect for the fact that he does want to keep doing that podcast

1097
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
right up to the very end because I would like to think,

1098
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
heaven forbid, I would probably be the same way

1099
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
that you would wheel me in here on Sunday nights if you had to

1100
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
and that hopefully Alan or somebody would just be the one to push the buttons

1101
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,000
or one of you guys, I don't know, but I would like to think that I could be that,

1102
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I don't know the word I'm looking for, I could be that dedicated, I guess,

1103
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
in the face of something so scary.

1104
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So props to him and our thoughts with him

1105
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and the folks that are going to keep it going over there.

1106
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And yeah, some nice, hearty, fuck cancer, cancer sucks.

1107
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah, pretty much.

1108
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Pretty much.

1109
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:31,000
You know, I think it's a somber reminder of, you know, that not to make this about me,

1110
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
but I guess I'm going to.

1111
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But you all remember, I'm coming up on 10 years.

1112
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
So 10 years ago, remember when I was like really sick

1113
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
and I had that scare with pancreatic cancer, but it turns out it was pancreatitis?

1114
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That's what my granny died of.

1115
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And it's some scary shit, you know.

1116
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And so 10 years ago, you know, I used to be very much that person that was like,

1117
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
oh my God, when I turn 30, it's over.

1118
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I'm going to die single and alone because I'm turning 30.

1119
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Well, there's like even all sorts of things.

1120
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Like, for example, there is this woman that posts,

1121
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
she does a lot of YouTube videos as well, and she posts a lot on shitty robots,

1122
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
which is she makes a bunch of shitty robots because that's what she does.

1123
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
She said she had like a swollen eye for like a few months and it ends up,

1124
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
it's a brain tumor. Thankfully, it's not cancerous, but it's still a brain tumor.

1125
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And so it's like, you know, get your shit checked out.

1126
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I mean, like you never know. And that's kind of the thing, too,

1127
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
is like that was one of the things that John would like to, you know,

1128
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
kind of emphasize out there is like, get your shit checked out, you know,

1129
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
go see a doctor.

1130
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Well, one of the YouTubers I was following for a while, Haven Games,

1131
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
who did the World of Warcraft, you know, how to get outside the bounds

1132
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and everything, which is, you know, one of my favorite things to do.

1133
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
He died at 26 of epithelial sarcoma.

1134
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah. So I didn't really get to finish my thoughts.

1135
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
No, no, no, it's fine. We all have stories, but just, you know,

1136
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
to hear that I had a condition that did not have a 100 percent survival rate

1137
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
was very much like a very like sobering moment.

1138
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And it like it changed my perspective on a lot of things,

1139
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
because from that point on, it was like I get to be 30.

1140
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Like, yay, I'm going to be 30. And you know what?

1141
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I met Alan when I was 31 and things have turned out okay.

1142
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And now I'm looking at 40 in the face.

1143
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And even though there's still kind of that part of me that's like,

1144
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
um, you know, here I, here comes 40. There's still that I, but come on,

1145
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
come on, you had to have experienced some of this too.

1146
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
You know what I'm talking about, right?

1147
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And that's not like I'm walking around every day going, Oh, maybe 40.

1148
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
But I'm kind of, you know, there are some of those answers like, Oh, 40.

1149
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I don't feel so bad about it because I keep getting carded.

1150
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Shouldn't I have a bigger savings account if I'm going to be 40?

1151
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It's those types of things. But I'm like, I'm, I'm again,

1152
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I'm trying to be like, you know what? Like, cool.

1153
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Like I'm going to be 40, but I don't feel 40. And that's cool.

1154
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Like I don't want to be all the like 40 is the new 20 or like Molly Shannon

1155
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
on Saturday Night Live when she's playing that one character going,

1156
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and I'm 50. Yeah. But that's kind of how I feel.

1157
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I'm like, okay, cool. 40. And don't even wait until like your, you know,

1158
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
our age to start checking. I mean, John Bain's 33. Yeah. So I mean, yeah,

1159
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
it can just speak with, I mean, check it. Don't let,

1160
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
talk to your doctor, check your balls, check your titties. Like, you know,

1161
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
don't be afraid of weird things. Get your vaccines.

1162
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah. Get your vaccines and all that stuff. Well,

1163
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I mean is one thing with all the health issues that members of my family have

1164
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
had. That was why I've been so adamant about blood tests and making sure I

1165
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
take care of myself and doing all these things.

1166
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It is never too early to start look to start preparing for the inevitable.

1167
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Get a 401k if your work offers one.

1168
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I had a discussion recently with somebody about like what would happen in the

1169
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
role I would play if this person should pass away unexpectedly. And it was,

1170
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
you know, and somebody my age and it's, it was a very kind of like,

1171
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
this is morbid. I don't like talking about it. But at the same time,

1172
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I was like,

1173
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
this is extremely responsible of you to be thinking of these sorts of things and

1174
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
setting up for, you know,

1175
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
what may happen to a child in these types of scenarios. You know, I'm like,

1176
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I kind of like, even though I really don't like talking about it,

1177
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I kind of like greatly respect it sort of thing. So anyway,

1178
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and then I'm getting yelled at, not yelled at,

1179
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
but I'm getting a dirty eyes from some of our chatters right now in the chat

1180
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
over at live.vognetware.com. Brad from Geek Spin goes, fuck you, Rob.

1181
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I'm staring at 50, but ends it with a smiley face.

1182
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
So anyways, that's totally serious. Tiger class says, Rob Roberts,

1183
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm 45 and I feel fine. You know what? And I'm 39 and I feel just fine too.

1184
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's not just saying just because other people are dying of things doesn't mean

1185
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
you're going to be dying of things,

1186
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
but it never hurts to check that stuff out so that if there is an issue,

1187
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
you can catch it early.

1188
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And it's also a reminder to like be thankful for the time you do have,

1189
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
you know, and realize that, you know,

1190
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:04,000
tomorrow, tomorrow a meteor could hit like the dinosaurs got disintegrated.

1191
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It might suddenly one day it could be you one day.

1192
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
It just might be like, I don't feel so good. And that's it. All right.

1193
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Anyway, you know, and that was funny because you just made it.

1194
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I know. Don't. I just, I'm just thinking of Dennis Leary now. Okay.

1195
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I'm not. All right. One day you get it or you don't.

1196
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
A man actually nudges his poodle off the 30th story and it lands on you and

1197
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
you're dead death by poodle. Anyway. Uh, anyway, I don't,

1198
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I didn't mean for the show to go that deep, but you know, I think, um,

1199
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
you know, when we hear these, what was that in? Was it, was it,

1200
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
no, it wasn't pushing daisies. It was six feet under six.

1201
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
No, the one where she dies from, um,

1202
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
a toilet seat hitting her from it was either an airplane or like space.

1203
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Oh, uh, dead like me. Dead like me. Yes. Yes. Oh, that show was so good.

1204
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Oh, that show was so good. That was the very first episode. Wasn't it? Yes.

1205
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That's how she does. That's how she does. All right. All right. Anyway,

1206
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
a gold star for Sia Tiberi who called it out. It was a,

1207
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and clarifying it was a toilet seat from mirror.

1208
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
All right. Anyhow, uh, let's go on to one more story here.

1209
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Let's, let's change the tone a little bit and get into a story about,

1210
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Ikaruga because guess what y'all,

1211
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Ikaruga is confirmed that it is coming out for the Nintendo switch.

1212
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I know where's radiant silver gun. We've had some rumors.

1213
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
We've had some scuttlebutt when it comes to things like Ikaruga,

1214
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
but it is confirmed it is coming out actually a little sooner rather than

1215
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
later. It's coming out May 29th. So that's pretty exciting.

1216
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Uh, Ikaruga is coming out on the switch and let's see,

1217
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
my original site for all the details. Was it working?

1218
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
So I want to get, uh, uh, vertical mode. Thank you.

1219
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I wanted to confirm that cause I thought I had read that,

1220
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
that they were going to do vertical mode in it. So that is confirmed.

1221
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Vertical mode is happening, right? Yep. Yay.

1222
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
That's a great thing. Why you know shooters need that.

1223
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I have like a dock though, like for the switch.

1224
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I wonder if that will actually hold it in vertical mode. Um,

1225
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I don't think so. I mean you wouldn't want to play on your,

1226
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I mean if it docks then you wouldn't want to play on your team.

1227
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Well, no, no, it's, it's just a holder. Like it's meant cause,

1228
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
cause my son is using it and he wanted to charge at the same time and you

1229
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
can't, it sucks ass. So you can't, you know, use that.

1230
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It might go either way. But anyway,

1231
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
this is obviously not the first time they've released Ikaruga,

1232
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
but I think it's been a little while.

1233
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Like I know there was the Xbox 360 version.

1234
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I know it's been a little while since they've released it. So, um,

1235
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I just want a radiant silver gun release that I don't have to pay 250 bucks

1236
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
for. Well, maybe if this does well, treasure treasure,

1237
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,000
our will consider doing more treasure. Never does it in this game is done.

1238
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Well, can we get an Ikaruga to electric boogaloo? Sure. Sure.

1239
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Um, I don't know. Again, it's probably one of those things where it's like,

1240
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
maybe if it sells well, they'll go back to the dry board. But then again,

1241
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
you're right. It's like they always release Ikaruga and it always sells well

1242
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and they never do a new one.

1243
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So maybe they're just going to milk the classics for all it's worth,

1244
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
which we're going to talk about SNK later in the show.

1245
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That's a Nintendo way. At least Nintendo makes some really good new games.

1246
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Come on. Come on. All right. Let's talk about some really good old games.

1247
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Oops. Oh my God. I played the wrong theme song.

1248
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
And we're not talking about games anyway. All right. That's right.

1249
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So, uh, that was a fault start because we're really going to get into the

1250
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
classic peripheral of the month. Once a month,

1251
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
the dark soccer dives into the gaming vault and says, Hey, you know what?

1252
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Sometimes it's not about the game you play, but how you're playing.

1253
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Sometimes you need a controller that's as big as your fucking head.

1254
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
So it's the classic. Oh, is it steel battalion? No. Yeah.

1255
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That was a good guess though, wasn't it? All right.

1256
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Here it is. The classic peripheral of the month. Dark soccer.

1257
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Which pick for us? It's the XC one AP. I have never heard of this.

1258
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
You haven't really. It looks like a Metroid.

1259
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Kind of. It does. So I just picked a Moosham music in the background because

1260
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
it's a, uh, a Genesis controller. Well, it's for,

1261
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
it's for anything on the sake of the, that era.

1262
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
You play with it. Well, just the first time I heard of it,

1263
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
it was while they were playing Mooshah. So I picked Mooshah music.

1264
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I should probably do Mooshah as a classic game at some point if I haven't

1265
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
already. Someone tell me if I've done Mooshah or something yet. Anyway,

1266
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
it's by a company called Dempa and it was created for the,

1267
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
the Sega mega drive. Cause this only came out in Japan.

1268
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It's also compatible with the Sega CD and the 32 X. Um,

1269
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
and it also works on some of the Japanese computers out there.

1270
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It only came out in Japan. Um,

1271
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
and it was released in 1989, uh,

1272
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
with full analog capability before probably almost a

1273
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
decade before analog itself became mainstream.

1274
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
So, um, it retailed for, um,

1275
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
well actually at its first release,

1276
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
it was 13,800 yen. The real lease was 9,800 yen.

1277
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
If you were to look on eBay right now,

1278
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
you probably not find one of these for less than $250. Just saying.

1279
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Um, it has 10 buttons on it, including six buttons and four switches.

1280
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Um, four shoulder buttons. It was also one of the first, uh,

1281
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I would say major controllers that featured multiple, um, shoulder buttons.

1282
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Um,

1283
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
it had an analog thumb stick and an analog slider that you could also rotate

1284
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
the slider so it could go back and forth.

1285
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So it could technically become a throttle or another analog access.

1286
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Um, the buttons, you know, as I said, that six of, um, sorry,

1287
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
that four of those 10 buttons or switches, um,

1288
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
they will work with computers for controller, uh,

1289
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
for changing some of the controller support.

1290
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And there were turbo switches, some that just weren't needed, um,

1291
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
and a switch to put the controller into a digital mode that allowed it to be

1292
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
compatible with all the, all the games on each systems, um,

1293
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
except for ones that, uh, don't support joysticks. Um,

1294
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
it also was meant to try to simulate some of the controls for games like

1295
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Afterburner 2 that ran on the, the Sega, is it Sega 10 or Sega X board?

1296
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Um, and then, like I said, it was re-released in 1994.

1297
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
It is, uh, compatible with, um, a good number of games,

1298
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,000
but on the Mega Drive it has, it's best, um, released for Afterburner 2, um,

1299
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP2, Fastest One Galaxy Force 2,

1300
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
and Musha Aleste Full Metal Fighter Eleanor.

1301
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Mega CD would be Afterburner 3, Night Striker, and Starblade.

1302
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And 32X Afterburner complete in Space Harrier.

1303
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Which, by the way, the chat is confirming you did Musha in episode 621.

1304
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
See, I'm sure I did it at some point.

1305
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
You Wiki people are amazing.

1306
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I probably did Truxtun 2 at some point, you know.

1307
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Yeah.

1308
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And Robo Aleste and some of the other fucking games.

1309
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Um, but anyway, it also, the whole point of it having an analog thumbstick,

1310
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
it actually predated the Nintendo 64 by about six years.

1311
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So, I mean, just coming to think about what a phenomenal piece of, uh, hardware peripheral this was,

1312
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:39,000
you know, and it actually seems to, in some cases, been the, um, the, uh, inspiration for the Saturn 3D control pad.

1313
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Um, which, of course, then turned into the 3D control pad being the basis for the Dreamcast controller.

1314
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Which then was the inspiration for the Xbox controller, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1315
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Um, this thing is fucking huge, though.

1316
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It is, like, I'll try to find it for the chat room, but it's probably, the circular aspect of it is probably

1317
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:10,000
another centimeter large, centimeter to two centimeters larger in diameter than the Sega, um, Saturn's, uh, 3D control stick.

1318
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
So, and it's supposed to be pretty heavy.

1319
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I would love to get my hands on one.

1320
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Dan said he had a chance, like, 20 years ago to get his hands on one and passed it up and regrets it.

1321
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So, someone finds me one for a hundred bucks. We'll talk. But, yeah.

1322
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Alright. There it is, your classic peripheral of the month.

1323
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
XE1 AP by Dempa.

1324
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Alright. But you don't have one.

1325
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Sadly, I do not. I am not so fortunate.

1326
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
They're a little cost prohibitive, it sounds like.

1327
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Yeah, they, they, they ain't cheap.

1328
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Yeah. Uh, SG100Matt saying, I'm looking at this and I've never seen or heard of this before. It looks ridiculous.

1329
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Well, Dark Soccer is here to educate you on all the ridiculous things.

1330
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It is pretty ridiculous, but the shit that it does.

1331
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I would like to see a size comparison with that and the Duke.

1332
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Oh, the original Xbox controller?

1333
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I found a picture of it with a six button, um, uh, Mega Drive controller, so I'll post that in the chat.

1334
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It does look kind of cool, though. Like, I can see why you picked it. It's, it's, like, super unique.

1335
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You know what I mean? Like, you don't, like, even if you were to compare it to the Duke or whatever, like, it's just, the way it is is very unique.

1336
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
So, um, I like it.

1337
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Alright, anyhow, uh, we're gonna take a break, but when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1338
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Uh, so we're gonna take a break and we'll be back, so stay tuned, y'all.

1339
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight, episode number 729, already in progress for this May the 6th of 2018.

1340
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I hope everybody had a good May the 4th and, uh, a fun Cinco de Mayo as well, even though I understand we kind of blow that holiday a little bit out of proportion here in the U.S.

1341
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
But, you know, hopefully, uh, hopefully you still had a good day.

1342
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Uh, and certainly the Star Wars, uh, thing is, it's, like, I'm hearing that more and more often every year.

1343
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
We actually did a little thing in my work this year around May the 4th. I thought it was really cute.

1344
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Uh, we got to wear, like, Star Wars shirts to work, which usually you don't get to wear a t-shirt to work, so it was, like, kind of, you know, fun stuff.

1345
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Uh, and then in chat they're saying Revenge of the 5th, yes, I've heard that too. Revenge of the 6th, I've heard it that way too, but...

1346
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I, I don't like the whole, um, like, cultural insensitivity aspect of it.

1347
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Of what?

1348
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Of the Cinco de Mayo thing.

1349
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Oh, of Cinco de Mayo?

1350
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Going back to that.

1351
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
But there was a guy who had a giant taco on his head and it was so extra, I loved it.

1352
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Yeah, I mean, if you're, if you're gonna, if you're gonna go extra, be committed to your art.

1353
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
He wore, like, a Hawaiian style shirt, except it was tacos and burritos. I kind of want a dress made out of that.

1354
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
That's, you know, whatever.

1355
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I'm looking, I've been looking for fabric that's tacos and burritos to make a dress like that.

1356
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Act Deft in our, Act Deft in chat says, I really don't mind Cinco de Mayo at all.

1357
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:04,000
You know, we, we kind of talked about that before. Remember how there was a lot of outrage on the tumblers of the net and so forth about the Mario in the, you know, mariachi type of costume?

1358
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:12,000
And it was like, you know, is that appropriating Mexican culture? But you talk to most Mexicans and they're like, it's cool. Like, you know, put it out there.

1359
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Your costume DLC is not my culture.

1360
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It really is, though, an American phenomenon, this whole thing that everything is appropriation.

1361
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I'm a firm believer that you can have cultural appreciation.

1362
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Appropriation comes in when you start making money off of the disenfranchised population.

1363
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Right.

1364
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So just know the difference.

1365
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I think a lot of it's social media, too.

1366
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Like, it's just so easy to call out on social media.

1367
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
And that's why, that's why I just don't, I don't, I don't like to get involved.

1368
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I still like to go back to karma at the end of the day and like, don't, don't call out unless you're ready to get called out.

1369
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:56,000
So anyway, S2100 Matt in chat says, I'm a big Star Wars fan as much as the next, but I'm a little bah humbug on the May the 4th stuff.

1370
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
It just feels so forced. Was that a pun?

1371
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
But whatever, if you want to have fun with Star Wars that day, then go for it.

1372
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Tiger Klein chat says, when will there be a Marvel day?

1373
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
You get, you get Marvel movies like four times a year now.

1374
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
There's like superhero day, not that long ago.

1375
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
That's right.

1376
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Anyway, okay, let's move on you guys.

1377
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Let's get back into some video games and what's going on rapidly with some rapid fire news.

1378
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Loki.

1379
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
All right.

1380
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
So you may remember Val's been adding different controller support to Steam.

1381
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:32,000
So now one of the controllers that's also available for Steam use is a Switch Pro controller.

1382
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,000
So you can actually select that in your controller settings and I guess you'll see screen prompts that match the Switch.

1383
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
So that's pretty cool.

1384
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
You can even kind of adjust what those are and stuff.

1385
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
But I like how that actually maps everything to the correct buttons.

1386
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And then along with this, this is kind of a cool little free game as well.

1387
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I believe it's free.

1388
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
So you may remember there was a game not too long ago called Surgeon Simulator,

1389
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:10,000
which was, you know, kind of this physics based, you know, hard to control game that you had to perform surgery.

1390
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Surgery in quotes, of course.

1391
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Well, now there is a new game that's come out based on the London Dare 41 theme.

1392
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:28,000
And it's by, I guess, the developer, Swavgav.

1393
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
At least that's the page.

1394
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So swav, S-W-A-V dash G-A-V dot itch dot IO.

1395
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And the game's called Check, Please.

1396
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Basically, you're supposed to be going on a date.

1397
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And so you have to do date like things, but you have to use your hands are controlled with the mouse.

1398
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So you use the mouse to move your hand, you know, left click to hold and grab up and grab items and then right to rotate the hand.

1399
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So very similar to kind of like the whole Surgeon Simulator thing.

1400
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
But it's fun and it is free.

1401
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So go check it out.

1402
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It looks very silly.

1403
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
All right.

1404
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Some comments in chat on the things Loki was talking about, going back to the Switch controller on Steam, which I'm a fan of that.

1405
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
You know, I'm a fan of more stuff in my house being able to be used on more things.

1406
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm all for that.

1407
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Well, it's great, like especially when you have like Steam games like, oh, hey, I got to do a multiplayer game.

1408
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Like I only have two PlayStation 4 controllers or one Xbox 360 controller.

1409
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:34,000
It's like I want to do four players on like a game on my PC, plug into my TV and then just, hey, I've got all these controllers that work with it now.

1410
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
OK, I like that.

1411
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
That's a good good thought.

1412
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:43,000
But over in chat at live.vognetwork.com, darktetsuya says, when will Steam add support for the XE1?

1413
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
He says he's half joking, but I'm sure something on Steam could support it.

1414
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
You never know.

1415
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I'm sure that with the right peripheral to be able to plug in Sega, was it Mega Drive?

1416
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Mega Drive, Sega CD and 32X.

1417
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
So with the right peripheral, we'll port that to USB.

1418
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I'm sure Joy to Key, you can make anything possible.

1419
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
That's right.

1420
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Kaijuto talking about the game that you were mentioning there, Logi.

1421
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Kaijuto wants to know, is this a jack off game?

1422
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
No.

1423
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Well, Kaijuto, anything can be if you really want it to be.

1424
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's not a jack off game.

1425
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It is you're having a fine, you're having a date in a restaurant and you have to like feed your date meatballs and like pay the check and stuff like that.

1426
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
And it's really goofy.

1427
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
You feed your date the balls.

1428
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
You shove those sweaty balls.

1429
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Sia Tabiri mentions the jack off box party pack.

1430
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Alright, you guys are so mature.

1431
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I'm sure they have plenty of those games on Steam.

1432
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You guys are so fucking mature.

1433
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Alright, let's talk about Minecraft.

1434
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
How about you guys get your minds out of the gutter?

1435
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
We talk about a kids game called Minecraft.

1436
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Minecraft is getting another patch.

1437
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It's called the Aquatic Update, the Life Aquatic in Minecraft.

1438
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
It's actually going to be the final update for the last gen versions of the game.

1439
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
So if you're still playing on 360, PlayStation Vita is considered last gen.

1440
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Wii U, last gen.

1441
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
These things are so last gen.

1442
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And only apparently 5% of Minecraft players are even playing on these systems.

1443
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
So guess what?

1444
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
This is it.

1445
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
The Aquatic Update is it.

1446
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Microsoft will be focusing their efforts on improving the versions of the game where more players are active.

1447
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So this of course would be the PlayStation 4 version as well as the hybrid Minecraft version that's on Switch, Windows 10, all the other places basically.

1448
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:39,000
So the patch not yet available on Switch, but I guess Microsoft still is going to be doing the Better Together update for that platform.

1449
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I guess that's not all quite there yet.

1450
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Yeah, so once they have that I guess they're going to do both of those.

1451
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Yes, and so then it will be updated with the Aquatic stuff.

1452
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I don't see a date for Aquatic though.

1453
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Will it be the Life Aquatic?

1454
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I just said that.

1455
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I think it's soon.

1456
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Honestly, I thought it was already out.

1457
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It might already be out.

1458
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
It might have just already been out.

1459
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Let's see.

1460
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Let's see if we can find out when it is here.

1461
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Apparently this is coming to Java Edition too.

1462
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Will it have Aquaria in it?

1463
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Yeah, the Java Edition usually gets everything as well.

1464
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's just that those are separate kind of ecosystems now.

1465
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Which is funny because Kaijuto says are they going to stop or are they still updating the Java?

1466
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So yeah, they are.

1467
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Yeah, they are.

1468
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It's just because now they have the console version which is basically Windows 10 and everything else.

1469
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And then they have the Java version which is separate.

1470
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
It doesn't say when that's going to be updated yet.

1471
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I want my 4K patch and all that stuff.

1472
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I want to play my blocky game in 4K.

1473
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Good old games.

1474
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Good old games is going to be giving away the Witcher Enhanced Edition if you sign up for the newsletter.

1475
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
So that's all you got to do.

1476
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You got to sell your email address to them.

1477
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
So sign up for the newsletter by creating a GOG account and doing this whole link thing.

1478
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
And then you get the Witcher Enhanced Edition.

1479
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Please note, this is not The Witcher 3.

1480
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
It's the original Witcher game but it's still an updated version of that game.

1481
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And you know, if you want the background story and all that.

1482
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
It's a free game.

1483
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And I know some of you raging here love your free games.

1484
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
So there's a way to get that.

1485
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So yeah, check that out.

1486
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
The dialogue in this game was rewritten, rerecorded.

1487
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
The inventory was changed.

1488
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
So it's still a little dated by today's standards.

1489
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
But it's free.

1490
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's fucking free.

1491
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
So don't complain about it.

1492
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Also, you get a Gwent card keg with this.

1493
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Which is, if I'm not mistaken, like The Witcher to Hearthstone sort of thing.

1494
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Right?

1495
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Like it's their trading card game.

1496
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
So you can also get that.

1497
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Check that out.

1498
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Dark Sakura.

1499
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Well, you know we all like our Luminess.

1500
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And there is a date for Luminess Remastered.

1501
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Yay!

1502
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It's June 26th.

1503
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
My birthday!

1504
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Happy birthday, Rob!

1505
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That's a great birthday present.

1506
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Even though it was supposed to be out in May, I'll still take the time to get it right.

1507
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And of course it's on Switch.

1508
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Yay!

1509
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Also, there is the Neo Geo Mini.

1510
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I hope it has better emulation than the last attempts to do one of these.

1511
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
But it has, it looks like it's got controllers.

1512
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
It's got the full size controller as well.

1513
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And I'm just trying to see, scroll through some of these images, but they don't seem to be working.

1514
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:21,000
It's supposed to have 40 built in games, including 5 of the King of the Fighters titles and 3 of the Metal Slug games.

1515
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And, um, I don't know.

1516
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Do they have a, I see one picture that looks like an arcade cabinet.

1517
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It looks like a mini cabinet.

1518
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
That's pretty awesome.

1519
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I mean, if it comes with a mini cab, that'd be even better.

1520
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I would think that's going to make the price of that thing go up if it's a little cabinet.

1521
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
But again, it also depends on the emulation.

1522
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Yeah.

1523
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Because the previous ones had some shit emulation.

1524
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So that is the actual console.

1525
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,000
So it says, yeah, the console has a, it has like a built in joystick with a three and a half inch screen.

1526
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,000
But then it also has output to HDMI and auxiliary video and stuff.

1527
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Cool.

1528
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
RageNator wants to point out about one of those stories I talked about.

1529
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I've had The Witcher on GOG for free for ages now.

1530
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'm on those freebies.

1531
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Of course, of course.

1532
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Well, for those that missed out, here's, here's, here's another chance, I guess.

1533
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Uh, so yeah.

1534
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I want to know what that price the Neo Geo is though.

1535
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I'm tempted.

1536
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
It has Fatal Fury special.

1537
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
That's all I need.

1538
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Which I have that on a real Neo Geo.

1539
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
I know, but I don't, I don't Jamie.

1540
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Do you want to borrow a Neo Geo CD?

1541
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Maybe.

1542
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
And so you can wait with five hours of loading time between every stage?

1543
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Do some streaming.

1544
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
If only you could play Neo Geo games on a certain arcade cabinet that's in this room.

1545
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Oh, wait.

1546
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Yes, you can.

1547
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Or, or they're, they're all, all these games are on the switch with the ACA and the PS4 as well.

1548
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
So probably Xbox one too.

1549
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I just don't stay on top of all that stuff.

1550
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out something you can buy a little bit sooner, uh, than, um, this Neo Geo mini.

1551
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Uh, what's coming out this week in the U S Loki?

1552
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Uh, we have Conan exiles on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one pillars of eternity to dead fire on windows, Mac, and Linux, uh, Steins gate zero on PC.

1553
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:18,000
We have a game called laser league on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, battle chasers.

1554
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Uh, oh, I'm sorry.

1555
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
That's actually next week.

1556
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
So yes, laser league will be the last thing for the week.

1557
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
That's it.

1558
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Very short.

1559
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
All right.

1560
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Let's go to the PlayStation four and check out some of the releases there.

1561
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Although I know that, uh, the golden week sale is going on on a PlayStation.

1562
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So, uh, I think in Japan, uh, it's probably gonna be a little slower this week.

1563
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Uh, I think that's why we've seen some releases slowing down.

1564
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:52,000
In fact, actually, as I look at the PlayStation four releases in Japan this week, the next big release that I see is Caligula overdose on the 17th.

1565
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
So I think this week is probably going to be a little more quiet.

1566
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Um, yeah, in fact, as I'm looking at the, uh, switch releases, there's really nothing of note there either.

1567
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So I think things are pretty quiet in Japan this week with the, uh, various holidays.

1568
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Uh, nothing on the 3DS either.

1569
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So it's, it's just, it's just a little slow right now.

1570
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
So we'll head on over to Europe.

1571
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Dark sakura.

1572
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
We have only a handful of things on May 8th.

1573
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
We have, uh, pillars of eternity two dead fire for PC.

1574
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Um, Conan exiles on May 8th as well for Xbox and PlayStation.

1575
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And super chariot for switch on the 11th.

1576
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
All right.

1577
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Well, now we can take a trip into our mailbag and I can play the theme song that I accidentally played early earlier.

1578
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It was a preview.

1579
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
It was a sneak peek.

1580
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Uh, anyway, uh, every week dark sakura dives into the mailbag at participate at orange launch radio.com and takes a peek at what y'all have to say.

1581
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Dark Sakura.

1582
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I got a very concerning one.

1583
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
This is super important bulletin and it's by yyr.

1584
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So, um, here it is.

1585
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Super multitasking broke sales records.

1586
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I hope it's what it deserves.

1587
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Tacos are fantastic.

1588
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Thank you.

1589
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
A brand new title of his new game.

1590
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,000
The sequel to pixel shit.

1591
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Pixel shits to tacos are fantastic.

1592
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Dude, make this happen, please.

1593
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I think yyr might be done with making our dream games come true for a while.

1594
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Cause you guys aren't coming through and making him a billionaire on steam.

1595
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
What's wrong with y'all pick up asking.

1596
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I can only purchase the game once.

1597
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I know.

1598
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I know you can purchase it as gifts for other people.

1599
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I could.

1600
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
It's true gift.

1601
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:45,000
You know, you know why I think yyr sent that email because didn't we say on last week's show, like every listener should send us an email and what we got one email.

1602
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
We have another one from Rachel here.

1603
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Well, that's how many listeners we have.

1604
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I guess the number two gaming podcast in town, two emails.

1605
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I'll give, I'll give that a number one.

1606
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Cause we don't have a wall or write names on.

1607
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
We had names and we had to be taking those names.

1608
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I mean, people have to be there to take the names.

1609
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
That's right.

1610
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I'm going to kick ass and take.

1611
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
All right, Jamie, come on.

1612
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
What's the next, next email.

1613
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Hi all.

1614
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
It's Reaganator yet again.

1615
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I have some good news for you three and for chat.

1616
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:30,000
If you care to remember last week, I called in to mention that a buddy of mine from high school responded to my venting on my tech woes, dead TV and PC video card by saying that he offered, dude, I understand you're excited about the video card, but this has nothing to do with gaming news.

1617
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Just saying.

1618
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Is there a question or anything in it?

1619
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I'm going to keep reading.

1620
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
All right.

1621
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Um, he offered to send me his little video card.

1622
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Well, shipment for me came on Wednesday and it was no video card.

1623
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It was a 40 inch, 10 ADP Visio smart TV.

1624
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Oh shit.

1625
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Seemingly brand spanking you too.

1626
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Naturally I was confused and I confirmed with him.

1627
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Apparently it was no mistake.

1628
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
He and his wife sent it intentionally saying happy birthday or something.

1629
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Or something.

1630
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
That's a nice friend.

1631
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
That is a good friend.

1632
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Anyways, regarding the video card, the extra money that I requested for my SSD payee, all $50 of it, finally came on Thursday and it was deposited Friday.

1633
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Luckily I found a video card that I could afford on Amazon, an MSI Geforce GT710 for $44.95 plus tax.

1634
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,000
That card, as far as I know, is marginally better than the Geforce GT610 that came with my PC.

1635
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I ordered it and I should have it on Friday.

1636
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
All that being said, I should be back to PC gaming in less than a week.

1637
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
In the meantime, I'm going nuts watching TV and playing games on the 360.

1638
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I tell you, the picture on this TV is absolutely gorgeous.

1639
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Any better and my eyes would orgasm.

1640
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
The anime titties are as big as your face.

1641
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
This email was brought to you by Kenmore East, once a bulldog, always a bulldog.

1642
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
What does that mean?

1643
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
There's no question?

1644
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
No.

1645
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It's like, I'm glad for you.

1646
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Yeah, no, it's a rad present.

1647
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
It is a really rad present.

1648
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Enjoy your jumbo anime titties.

1649
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
But still, a little relevancy.

1650
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Relevancy.

1651
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
It was a follow up to a call, whatever.

1652
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Okay.

1653
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
That's it?

1654
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
That's it.

1655
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
What?

1656
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I want a relevant email.

1657
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Tacos are great and you've got a great friend, but we want stuff related to what we are talking about on the show or how awesome I am.

1658
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Unless that really was a game announcement from YYR, in which case, you know.

1659
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Okay, then I'll take it.

1660
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
YYR has a pass with the occasional short email because his emails are fucking novels.

1661
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
And plus, I believe there's like family stuff going on and all that.

1662
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So, YYR wants to take a break from game development.

1663
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
He's fucking earned it.

1664
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Anyway, let's see.

1665
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Let's move on then while we await more emails that participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1666
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Send our soccer an email and tell her what anime titties you like to see on your 50 inch TV.

1667
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Speaking of anime titties, I've been like on the fence of purchasing Gal...

1668
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I like the first Galgun game.

1669
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
It's ridiculous, but I thought about purchasing the second one.

1670
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It's on the Switch, though.

1671
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That would not be a Switch appropriate game, unfortunately.

1672
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
You know, I understand that some games, like, people kind of look at it and go, Jesus Christ, really?

1673
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Is this really needed?

1674
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
But sometimes, like, it's like Dark Soccer said about the hat, right?

1675
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Sometimes, if you're going to go extra, be fucking extra.

1676
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
You know?

1677
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Be as extra as you can fucking be.

1678
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And that's why I love Bayonetta.

1679
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Like, if Galgun came with, like, boob attachments for the, you know, D-pad, that would be extra.

1680
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
You have a pheromone gun. You have to shoot your pheromones at them.

1681
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
And didn't they just re-release... God, they just re-released it on PS4.

1682
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Is this week or next?

1683
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
It's like that side-scroller with the totally unrealistic, like, cartoon babes with the gigantic titties.

1684
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
What, the Queen's...

1685
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Which one?

1686
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Dragon's something... Damn it.

1687
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Oh, I know what you mean. Yeah, yeah.

1688
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
It was some frickin' PlayStation 3 and, like, Vita or PSP game.

1689
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
No, that one's actually really...

1690
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Dragon's Crown. Thank you, MXC.

1691
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Dragon's Crown's a great game. It's a really, like...

1692
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I know it's a good game, but not very...

1693
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
It's...

1694
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
It just needs proportionizing.

1695
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
It just needs a little bit of that.

1696
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Yeah, no, that's... I know, that's the gag of the season.

1697
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It's actually a good game.

1698
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
How many references can I drop in one minute?

1699
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
All right. Anyway, let's move on to some more news.

1700
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Loki.

1701
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
All right.

1702
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
So, um...

1703
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Apparently, there's, um...

1704
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
We talked about how there's been hackers with PUBG that have gotten into...

1705
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Or is it PUBG or Fortnite?

1706
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
One of the two got in the big trouble with, um...

1707
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
You know, creating hacks and stuff.

1708
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Well, now, apparently, Overwatch hackers are getting arrested and fined as well.

1709
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:45,000
So, South Korea has a new law that is targeting hackers.

1710
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And apparently, with this new law, 13 Overwatch cheaters have been arrested now.

1711
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:59,000
And apparently, they're saying that one of the 13 has received two years of probation from the government.

1712
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And if he violates it, he'll see jail time, as well as the others have been fined around 10 million won, which is about $10,000.

1713
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Will this finally end cheating?

1714
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Nope.

1715
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Please.

1716
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I'm just surprised you can, like, go to jail and get fined for that, like...

1717
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Well, I mean, of course, when you're, like, fucking with the game, like, that much, like, I kind of get it.

1718
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
But it's, like, I feel like...

1719
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I feel like that would never...

1720
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Like, that sort of punishment would never happen here.

1721
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I've missed something.

1722
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
But I just feel like there's so many, uh...

1723
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Yeah, it's...

1724
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
You're never gonna end cheating.

1725
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Yeah.

1726
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
You can certainly make an example out of people that get caught.

1727
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
And I think that's what happens here.

1728
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Apparently, the law has a maximum fine of $50,000.

1729
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
And a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

1730
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Wow.

1731
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Kaijuto in chat says, cheating online, but jail time?

1732
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Come on, now.

1733
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I'm all for the death penalty when it comes...

1734
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
No, I'm kidding. I'm not.

1735
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
But...

1736
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Yeah, I just, um...

1737
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
I am a little surprised, but at the same time, like, when are people gonna fucking stop?

1738
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I don't know.

1739
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Alright.

1740
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Let's talk about Miis.

1741
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Let's talk about Miis.

1742
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
But M-I-I would be the thing I want to talk about.

1743
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Which, I want to talk about making Mii characters in a web browser.

1744
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Apparently, this is something that you're gonna be able to do soon.

1745
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Even though Miitomo is...

1746
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Like, there's only so much time left with Miitomo.

1747
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
The 9th.

1748
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
That's...

1749
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
That's like Tuesday!

1750
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Yeah.

1751
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Oh my gosh, that's kinda sad.

1752
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I've been trying to use up all of those tickets I get.

1753
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Yeah?

1754
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
But, and you really, you're not gonna be able to, like, get anything for it, right?

1755
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
You just kinda, like, the whole game's gonna get flushed in the toilet and that's that, right?

1756
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
As far as I can tell.

1757
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Kind of a bummer that you can't, like, download or archive anything or there isn't some type of, like, Miitomo archive.

1758
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I... I don't know.

1759
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Why don't they just let it exist, right?

1760
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I took pictures of all of my Mii characters that I made.

1761
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Well, that's good.

1762
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Get all the screenshots that you can now.

1763
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Well, I guess what's happening soon is that Mii characters are going to be available for you to actually edit online.

1764
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
The story is not coming up for me for some reason, so I don't know... I don't remember all the details.

1765
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I did read something about... Oh, finally! Just as I say that, it pops up on my screen there. Thank you.

1766
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
As if by magic.

1767
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Jesus. It's like complaining works.

1768
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Excuse me, internet. Can I speak to your manager?

1769
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Alright, there it is. Anyway.

1770
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Alright, so here's the thing.

1771
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
So, when it comes to Miis, you can create and edit your Mii characters in a web browser.

1772
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
There's gonna be maintenance, though, when Miitomo is terminated.

1773
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:37,000
So, if you link your Nintendo account to Miitomo, you can use the Mii characters from Miitomo on your Nintendo account.

1774
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
So, that's something.

1775
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I've already linked mine an age ago, so that's good.

1776
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Awesome.

1777
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
So, with the end of the Miitomo service, you can't make things on Miitomo anymore,

1778
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:51,000
but they're gonna add a feature in late May where you can edit the Mii characters via your web browser of choice,

1779
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
if it'll work, unlike this relic of a computer that I'm using now.

1780
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,000
So, the system migration maintenance will be happening in late May 2018.

1781
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
So, during that period, you can't really do anything with your Miis,

1782
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
but once that's done, you can make Miis online,

1783
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,000
and I'm sure people will be sharing all the hilarious creations that they've made within the Mii Broadcaster.

1784
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
So, there you go.

1785
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

1786
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Well, there is a series of retail gaming stores in Nebraska called Gamers,

1787
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:32,000
and all three of their stores closed as of Thursday, May 3rd,

1788
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:40,000
with one of the reasons being that there were employees who yelled at customers and used racial slurs while working.

1789
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:48,000
They also listed a lack of good employees, and a few things about declining sales and unreasonable landlords.

1790
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:56,000
However, the employees themselves have spoken up, said that there was quite another thing going on with them.

1791
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:07,000
That basically, that the company was only paying minimum wage, that they also offered no benefits,

1792
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:13,000
had employees working overtime for no pay, high turnover, terrible management,

1793
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:21,000
and even making them go to meetings on their day off with no pay, which is all illegal.

1794
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:32,000
So, they're apparently still operating as a store, but I guess only online, so that's still pretty crappy.

1795
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I mean, every single one of those employees under those circumstances should have actually taken it to their state labor board,

1796
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
but people don't think to do stuff like that, and that's why companies like this get away with it.

1797
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:52,000
So, I don't know. I'm pretty glad that if that really is the truth that a company so unstable is closing their shop,

1798
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:59,000
and I hope that they go out of business or get intensely sued, but there's not really too much else I can say about that.

1799
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I don't think this is a customer I sold to, but the name sounds familiar, Gamers.

1800
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Because honestly, the independent game stores, there's not a ton of them out there.

1801
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Well, honestly enough, really the big chains are taking it over, but I'd like to support independent game stores,

1802
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
but I don't support this kind of attitude.

1803
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Well, it's just bad business all around.

1804
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,000
It really is. So, do you have anything more for us?

1805
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
At least not on that.

1806
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Anyways, I guess we could talk a little bit about Nintendo.

1807
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:51,000
And you know, one of the things we keep wondering with Nintendo is like, so we've got this system, the Switch and stuff,

1808
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:58,000
why do they keep making 3DS games still? When is the 3DS going to basically be over?

1809
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:06,000
And the reason for that, they claim, is because Nintendo is basically going to keep making games for the 3DS

1810
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
until the Switch becomes a one-per-person system.

1811
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:17,000
So, with the Switch, I think that's a nice idea, but the fact that it's a console system, though,

1812
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
you're going to have multiplayer support on that. It's not like a 3DS.

1813
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:27,000
But you're saying, consumers purchased the 3DS system in numbers we expected last fiscal year,

1814
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
or the numbers we expected last fiscal year.

1815
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:37,000
It had an ample supply of ample software lineup at the price point that makes the system affordable,

1816
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
especially for parents looking to buy for their kids.

1817
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,000
We expect the demand to continue this fiscal year as well, which is through March 2019.

1818
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So we will continue to sell the product.

1819
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Given that Nintendo Switch is a home gaming system that can be taken on the go,

1820
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:58,000
this situation may change if it grows from being a one-per-household system to a one-per-person system.

1821
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Well, take it out back and fucking shoot it already.

1822
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Well, the problem is, though, it's a $300 system. The 3DS was never a $300 system,

1823
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
so it's hard to say, well, you better buy a Switch for each person in the house.

1824
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Oh, and hey, you want to play those games? Well, you better buy a game for each person.

1825
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
That's the problem. You made a system that's a home console system,

1826
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,000
and you're shocked that people aren't buying it like a portable system.

1827
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Look, this is honestly just a line they're using because they're not planning on selling the 3DS yet.

1828
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
They can't. They've got that Luigi game that's already slated for next year, the Luigi's Mansion remake.

1829
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So they're not going to say anything about stopping to sell the 3DS for a long time.

1830
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:40,000
And honestly, even if they were to say, like, we're going to actively stop making new 3DS games or whatever,

1831
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
which is probably not something they would say, you'd just probably have to figure it out,

1832
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:49,000
they're still going to sell the consoles themselves for at least another probably two years after that

1833
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:55,000
because there is, and I see in chat that there's still fans of the 3DS.

1834
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Of course, the 3DS and the DS, which you can play on your 3DS,

1835
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
has such a rich back catalog that, of course, they're going to sell systems.

1836
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Like, what if your system breaks and you want a new one and all this other stuff?

1837
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:13,000
So, I mean, there's still reasons to get 3DS, but it's more like that active development

1838
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
and using resources on making new big games and stuff.

1839
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
It's like, okay, let it go. We can let it go now.

1840
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Put them on great Switch games and maybe you will sell a million Switches.

1841
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Yeah. Or, I mean, they have sold a million Switches, but you know what I mean.

1842
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
That's my figurative million. One for every person or whatever it is.

1843
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,000
So, Tigerclaw does point out in chat, plus the 3DS Fitch in your pocket, not the Switch,

1844
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
until Nintendo does the Switch Mini.

1845
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Well, there will be another version of the Switch. Absolutely.

1846
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Why wouldn't there be? There's almost always been another version of the console.

1847
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Like, even the Wii sort of had one where they took the internet out and all that stuff. Remember that?

1848
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Yeah, that was a very good version of the console.

1849
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Have we had another Wii U?

1850
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Well, but the Wii U kind of, they wanted to get rid of that pretty quick.

1851
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,000
But, like, the Nintendo had the top loader, the Super Nintendo had a redo,

1852
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
the Nintendo 64, they kind of did, like, the Pikachu version.

1853
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Yeah, 3DS, the DS.

1854
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
3DS, DS, Game Boy, those are always going through remakes and stuff.

1855
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:18,000
So, I mean, they will do a Switch XL or XS or something to get more people to use them.

1856
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
A Switch and you'll poke it, if that's what they want.

1857
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Asky in chat says, what do you think the recent hack on the Switch will affect the sales of the Switch?

1858
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Do you think it will become another Dreamcast? Awesome platform, but was flawed by piracy early on.

1859
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Here's what they're going to do, Asky, I think, is that maybe you can't stop the old systems and this stuff,

1860
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
but they can put their foot down with the new systems.

1861
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I don't think they can, because they're going to have to go with a whole other processor if that's the case,

1862
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
because it's the taker chip that is the problem.

1863
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:55,000
So, unless Nvidia has a way around that, I don't think they're going to change it.

1864
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Right now, though, there's nothing to say that it's going to be piracy,

1865
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,000
because the problem was that they don't have access to the keys yet to be able to decode the software.

1866
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,000
The best they're going to be able to do is load homebrew on there.

1867
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Rama in chat says, here's the thing, drop the Switch to $199 and it will be one console per person per household.

1868
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Until then, viva la 3DS.

1869
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

1870
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:24,000
That's true, I guess that price, but I could see the price maybe coming down.

1871
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I even have a problem, though, with the games being $60 at that point,

1872
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
because if you're saying that you want it one per person, then you're going to buy one game per person.

1873
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

1874
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
All right, one more story for you guys before we get to calls, and this has to do with a music game.

1875
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Why not kind of end the official news segment tonight with news on a music game,

1876
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
and ask to do with harmonics and Rock Band, which, yes, it's still going.

1877
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And actually, Rock Band is bringing it back.

1878
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
We also talked about RBM.

1879
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Hey, be quiet.

1880
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Shut up.

1881
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Normally, don't talk about it too much.

1882
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Shut up, autoplay Twitch thing, don't do that.

1883
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Anyway, that was part of the livestream where harmonics was about to announce that the Rock Band network would be coming back.

1884
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
The Rock Band network was unveiled about ten years ago, I think,

1885
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
and it allowed folks to basically put their own tracks into Rock Band, including for sale.

1886
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
I mean, it did have to go through quality review and stuff,

1887
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:21,000
but it basically unleashed the Rock Band tools to smaller bands and indie bands that wanted to be in Rock Band.

1888
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Now, Rock Band network is going to be coming back for Rock Band 4 on the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One.

1889
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:32,000
There never did end up being a Rock Band 4 on PC, because that crowdfunding didn't quite work out.

1890
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:37,000
However, due to the royalty agreements, your purchases can't move over.

1891
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,000
So, womp womp on that, you will have to start over if you had a lot of the Rock Band network stuff.

1892
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Harmonics is prioritizing songs that were the most popular before on Rock Band network,

1893
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
and is also taking requests via an online forum.

1894
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
So, that's kind of neat that, like, this thing that they shut down is now coming back.

1895
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
So, pretty cool.

1896
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
And Orange, right in chat, says,

1897
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Oh, I didn't hear about this. Cool to hear.

1898
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Yeah, they announced it on Tuesday during a livestream that Harmonics did.

1899
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
So, it is happening.

1900
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I don't know if I caught the when it's happening, but it's something that they're working on.

1901
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
So, pretty cool.

1902
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.

1903
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1877 Game OLR if you want to do it the old school way,

1904
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
but I don't remember the last time we got a phone call.

1905
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
It's all Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1906
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:26,000
If you would like to Skype us and talk about anything that maybe we've talked about so far tonight,

1907
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
or have yet to talk about.

1908
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Until then, I don't know if we have any last minute stories or other things to bring up,

1909
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
but, Loki, any last minute stories?

1910
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
If you have any discussion, maybe if you don't want to call,

1911
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
but you just have a discussion question or something you want to ask us,

1912
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
go ahead and throw it out in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1913
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,000
It's a small mention, but I guess that the Oculus Go, I think, has been released.

1914
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Oh, yeah, the whole Facebook event unveiled this, right?

1915
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
The Oculus without a computer, basically, right?

1916
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Yeah, so that's available.

1917
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:01,000
The only issue with that is you have to have a phone that you can connect to their store with, which is stupors.

1918
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Of course, of course.

1919
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Well, they want you to buy things.

1920
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Well, why, but yeah, but if I have a phone, then why would I want the Oculus Go, because I could just plug in...

1921
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Well, why would you get the other thing, the other Samsung thing that everybody's getting...

1922
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
The Gear VR?

1923
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Yeah, the Gear VR.

1924
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Or like the...

1925
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
We have one, and I've used it once.

1926
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
It's kind of a novelty thing.

1927
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I gave mine away a couple weeks ago.

1928
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
The experiences just aren't there for that, you know?

1929
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I mean, at least with PlayStation VR, you've got quite a few games at this point that exist in there.

1930
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Same thing with, you know, HTC Vive and Oculus on PC and so forth.

1931
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:42,000
So, SSU100Matt points out the Gear VR is pretty much the Oculus Go.

1932
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Yeah.

1933
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Yeah.

1934
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
AskianChat points out, I just bought a cat. That's important, right?

1935
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Fuck yes, cats are always important.

1936
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
We love animals.

1937
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Cats are always relevant.

1938
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Cats are always relevant.

1939
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
And I suppose, if you're a dog person, I suppose puppies, especially if it's Corgi.

1940
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
If it's Corgi, it's like priority.

1941
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
So, yes.

1942
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Puppies and kitties are very important.

1943
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
You know what? I would say pretty much any.

1944
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:15,000
If you wanted to get a ferret, that is also noteworthy, especially if you're breaking the law and it's illegal in your state.

1945
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Would you like to call and tell us how you're breaking the law?

1946
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Orange Launch Radio.

1947
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

1948
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Anything else to talk about here at the end?

1949
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Sadly, no. It's been a slow Newsweek.

1950
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
It is really slow.

1951
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Well, A, you have the holiday week going on in Japan.

1952
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
So, you know, that's shutting a lot of things down right now.

1953
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
B, you have E3 is just around the corner.

1954
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So, you know, that's something to do.

1955
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
It's just also slow as far as releases go, too.

1956
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
May is usually, April and May are really slow.

1957
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I mean, actually anything up until September is going to be kind of slow.

1958
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
June picked a little bit.

1959
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I feel like we usually get one or two big releases around Memorial Day.

1960
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
So people can play during the long weekend.

1961
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I don't think anything is really coming out.

1962
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Kids getting out of school.

1963
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Switch, I know they've got the remaster of Hyrule Warriors,

1964
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
which I may end up picking up.

1965
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
I'm not sure yet.

1966
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
That might be fun.

1967
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,000
So we're getting some questions in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

1968
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
which we'll certainly take those.

1969
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
We can do an Ask Orange Lounge or something.

1970
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I'm kind of like an informal Ask Orange Lounge.

1971
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Asky wants to know, did anyone buy Donkey Kong?

1972
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
And She-Hulk clarifying Donkey Kong for the Switch.

1973
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I looked at it, but I don't want to pay $60 for that game.

1974
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I played the Wii U version, and unpopular opinion, I didn't care for it.

1975
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,000
For me, it didn't really capture the magic of the Super Nintendo Donkey Kong Country games.

1976
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I don't know if I'm just as big on Donkey Kong as a franchise.

1977
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
But cool for the people that are into it.

1978
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
And maybe I need to give it a second look.

1979
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
This happens with games sometimes, you guys.

1980
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, eh, I'm not feeling it.

1981
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,000
But after I learned some more things about the franchise and how Cinematica was,

1982
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I went back and played it later.

1983
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
And now the original trilogy is one of my favorite things that's ever been done in gaming.

1984
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:16,000
So I don't want to damn a thing like Donkey Kong forever.

1985
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Anyway, actdeftinchat points out $60 is worth it.

1986
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It's good, but I already have the Wii U version.

1987
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I don't really want to double dip this one.

1988
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Captain Toad, though, gonna buy that one for sure.

1989
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I know a lot of people are fans of Captain Toad.

1990
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Actdeft pointing out we had the Octo expansion coming in July, probably.

1991
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
The whole Splatoon thing.

1992
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Which, by the way, Raphael vs. Leonardo happened this weekend.

1993
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Raphael won.

1994
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
But not based on popularity.

1995
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
If it had been straight a popularity vote, Leonardo would have won.

1996
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
But Raphael's still better anyway.

1997
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
But the Raphael players were more skilled at the end of the day winning more of the battles.

1998
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
So how about that?

1999
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Even though I didn't play.

2000
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
But of course I saw the Twitters. I saw all the Tweets about it, of course.

2001
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Alright, let's take a call that is coming in.

2002
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Hi, you're on Orange On Radio. Who's this?

2003
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Hey, what's going on? My name's Rama.

2004
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Hey, Rama. Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?

2005
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Not much. I just got here from a convention.

2006
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Our convention season has just kicked off with a bang.

2007
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
That's true. What might be a slow time for video games becomes a really fast time.

2008
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Like when the movies start coming out because that's more when people can get weekends away.

2009
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
It sounds like you had a really good time at this convention.

2010
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
A lot of good stuff.

2011
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Yeah, this is one of the few times where I was actually calm.

2012
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Not calm, but relaxed, chill. I just had a good time.

2013
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I got a little stressed, but thankfully my podcast staff was able to help me push through and get things done.

2014
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Overall, I was just having a good time.

2015
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Good. And what was the name of the con?

2016
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Zenkai Con. It's an anime, sci-fi, themed convention, mishmash of everything in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

2017
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Oh, that's not far from where I spent some time in Pennsylvania a few years ago.

2018
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Oh, yeah. I remember you mentioning that.

2019
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Yeah. So that's cool. I'm glad you had a good time at the convention.

2020
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And I'm sure people can hear more about it on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday live at VOG.

2021
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Definitely. We're all still recovering from it because it was just fun from start to finish.

2022
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:20,000
We got there early, did a little touristy thing and then just kind of rested and then just went to the whole nine yards.

2023
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Awesome. I look forward to hearing more about it. Anything gaming to bring up here on OLR?

2024
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Well, this year they had another convention covering running the game room.

2025
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:38,000
So it was mostly console gaming. They had a setup for Rock Band 3, or Rock Band 4. I don't know which one it was.

2026
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:45,000
And they also had a PS2 arcade DDR setup, as I like to call it.

2027
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Oh, okay. Cool.

2028
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Yeah, but the main issue was...

2029
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Sorry, did they gut an arcade machine and put a PS2 in it? Because I have friends that have a machine like that.

2030
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Or did they just do a PS2 with the really fancy dance pads?

2031
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Yeah, PS2 with two large arcade dance pads that were uncalibrated the whole weekend.

2032
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Oh, Jesus.

2033
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Yeah, the staff was told, but evidently nothing was done about it. So I sort of avoided the game room.

2034
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Because here's the thing about the game room. If you're going to go, the best time to go is within the first 20 minutes of it opening and in the last 20 minutes of it closing.

2035
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Before it smells like funk.

2036
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,000
That's putting it lightly.

2037
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:36,000
No, I know. I know. That's exactly how it goes. Or the cool thing is, you know, with MAGFest, it's a 24-hour gaming room.

2038
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:42,000
So it's like you kind of go at 3 in the morning. Although, God, even then, even then, it's still...

2039
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:50,000
It can be pretty crowded on Friday, Saturday night. DragonCon, I think if you go around 5 or 6 in the morning, DragonCon, you can pretty much walk up and play what you want.

2040
01:58:50,000 --> 01:59:01,000
That's what I'm going to do for MAGFest next year. I'm just going to do my thing, pass out, wake up around 3, 3, 4 o'clock, go downstairs, play some Street Fighter, find some breakfast, and just go about my day.

2041
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Yeah. No, I hear you. I hear that. I think that might be my strategy at future cons is to just go to bed early like the true old man I am and then get up really early while other people are staying up late.

2042
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
There you go. There you go.

2043
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Alright. Well, I'm sorry, I'm reading chat while I'm talking to you. Rama, I don't know if there's anything else you wanted to share or if that's it.

2044
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Oh, that's basically it because I called in because I was like, well, I figured everybody else would call in, but let me jump in, talk to you guys, kind of get things going.

2045
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Maybe after I get off the phone, more people will start calling in, you know, because I put that challenge out like several years ago, you know?

2046
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:49,000
You never know. It's just some weeks are slower than others. It's all good. Is there something on TV tonight? Walking Dead back? I don't know.

2047
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
American Idol.

2048
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Oh, nobody's watching that.

2049
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I know.

2050
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Anyway. Alright, Rama, I'm gonna let you go, but look forward to anime jam session this week. Take care.

2051
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Thank you. Take care, bro.

2052
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Bye.

2053
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Alright, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype. Otherwise, we might be wrapping things up here pretty soon, and that's okay.

2054
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:14,000
You know, again, those weeks rolling up to E3 are gonna be a little bit slower.

2055
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Sadly, none of us going to E3, but I don't know if any of you guys are going.

2056
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I don't know if I'm sad about that.

2057
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:28,000
E3's just changed, and it's just not really the same show that it was. What was the first year we all went? Was it 2004? Must have been.

2058
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Because this show started 2002, and I feel like, yeah, we went three times, right? All of us went three times before.

2059
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:41,000
2006 was the big we year, the year that I called the Paris Hilton year. That was where it was like out of fucking control.

2060
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,000
And that was our third year going, right? We all went those first three years.

2061
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Yeah, I went in 2000.

2062
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Yeah.

2063
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:52,000
No, last year I went was 2009 or 10.

2064
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Well, I went again a few more times. When they went back to the convention center, I went back, I feel like I was there in 2014 was like the last year I went.

2065
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,000
It wasn't that long ago. I think it was 2014 was the last year I went.

2066
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
It was 2009.

2067
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
We did the interactive coverage. Remember when you could submit questions, and we would try to find the answers for you?

2068
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Yeah.

2069
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I did that with Bobby one year, and I think it was the second year. I think the first year he did it, and I went to pick him up, and I did the Ouya booth because it was outside. You didn't need a badge to get in.

2070
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Yeah.

2071
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
But otherwise he had to do everything. Was it the Ouya? I feel like it was Ouya.

2072
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Yes, Ouya was outside.

2073
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:41,000
But then the problem was, and the reason why we never did the interactive coverage again was that it was like the reason why E3 is not the show it used to be is explained by the fact that the interactive coverage doesn't really work anymore.

2074
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Because nobody wants to answer a question that's off the script. And if you want to see the script, just go watch YouTube or Twitch. It's all right there.

2075
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
And nobody wants to talk about anything that's off script.

2076
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Unless it's an indie developer.

2077
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Unless it's an indie developer, which is kind of rare to see. Well, I don't know. Now that some of the bigger names are dropping out at E3.

2078
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Do they still have like the indie booth?

2079
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Sure. And that was my favorite booth. That was my favorite booth at E3 because those are the people that would talk and let you ask anything you want, but those weren't the questions we were getting because people didn't know about those games.

2080
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Yeah.

2081
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Which I don't blame the people asking the questions. It didn't work. It's unfortunate.

2082
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Dartosuya says Kensha Hall. Well, that was the really cool indie place those first three years.

2083
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
That's where you see all sorts of weird shit.

2084
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Kensha Hall turned into a parking lot later on. I don't even know.

2085
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Actually, come to think of it, didn't they just remodel the convention center? Like if you're going to DragCon, Jamie, isn't it going to be different?

2086
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Because, funny enough, DragCon is at the same place that they're doing E3, right?

2087
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Yeah.

2088
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
They use one of the halls, the West Hall or the North Hall.

2089
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I think they expanded into one of the larger ones.

2090
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Yeah, but the funny thing is that's the same place that they're going to have E3 and I think they remodeled the convention center, if I'm not mistaken, or at least that was in the cards.

2091
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Us.

2092
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I know that area around it has changed significantly since our early E3s. You know, now they have the whole LA Live shit.

2093
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Like the last year I did go to E3, I was like, wow, there's like restaurants down here and fancy hotels and all that good stuff.

2094
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Sia Tabiri says it's in South Hall. Okay, well South Hall is where they always had Nintendo and all that stuff.

2095
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Bonds006 says, how was the room booking bad for MAGFest? I had a room booked last September and it was very easy.

2096
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:30,000
I think you got lucky, my friend. A lot of people had a lot of problems booking rooms for MAGFest.

2097
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:37,000
But hopefully this year they'll get that shit sorted out. Although I have to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll go back to MAGFest.

2098
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Nothing against the con, or the people. I certainly enjoy myself, but some of y'all know I switched jobs a couple years ago.

2099
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
And with it, I took a big hit and the amount of time off I get a year.

2100
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
So I have to pick and choose my conventions a little more carefully, that's all.

2101
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Well you guys, I guess that's probably going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2102
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
If you do want to interact with our host, you can always send us an email.

2103

Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or you can send us a tweet at OLR.

2104
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:14,000
If you would like to also leave us a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, we'd really appreciate that wherever you found this podcast.

2105
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't air those voices if they're not here.

2106
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
So help us spread the word, we would really appreciate that.

2107
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,000
You can also join us on Twitter at OLR. We also have a Discord and you can always chat with us through Discord.

2108
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:33,000
We do get some of our stories from Discord, so a big thank you to those on Discord sharing info with us throughout the week.

2109
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:38,000
That's VOG Network dot com slash Discord. VOG Network dot com slash Discord.

2110
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
With that, I think we will go around the room and give everybody's final thoughts.

2111
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I know it's a little bit shorter tonight, but probably just again the slower news week, these things are going to happen.

2112
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
So, Loki, final thought for you tonight?

2113
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Final thought is my wife keeps texting me that my kids are sick.

2114
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Oh no.

2115
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Yes, apparently there's lots of screaming and yelling and sitting on the potty, so.

2116
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
That means you're going to be sick.

2117
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I hope not.

2118
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
All right.

2119
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:06,000
My final thought tonight is that Alan went shopping during the show and he brought back Oreos.

2120
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:14,000
So last week we had Cherry Coke Oreos, which weren't bad. I really liked them, but they have Pop Rocks in them, so it was a little weird.

2121
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,000
But it gives that kind of carbon-y, you know, like a carbonated beverage would have.

2122
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
It was okay.

2123
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:24,000
This week he has brought us pina colada, which I guess is a new thing they're doing, and kettle corn.

2124
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,000
And I'm really curious about kettle corn, but I feel like it's not going to make a very good Oreo.

2125
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I would like to try.

2126
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Yeah, we'll do that right after the show.

2127
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:37,000
The coconut Oreos are good because they just have regular coconuts, so I'm sure pina colada is going to be fine.

2128
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
It's just coconut with pineapple dust or something.

2129
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Do you like pina coladas?

2130
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Let's put pineapple on the pizza.

2131
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Anyway, that's my final thought.

2132
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought.

2133
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I'm disappointed in my chicken strips today, and I think I'm going to go get a taco on the way home.

2134
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Mmm, tacos.

2135
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Like, one taco.

2136
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Alright, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.

2137
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Thanks to you guys so much for tuning in, and we hope you all have a great week.

2138
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
We'll see you in seven days, at least Loki and I will.

2139
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Dark Sakura, have a ton of fun at Dragon Con. We'll see you in two weeks.

2140
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Dragon Con.

2141
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Drag Con.

2142
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Yes.

2143
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Drag on the con.

2144
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Drag that con.

2145
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Drag on and go to the con.

2146
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I will.

2147
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Forget it.

2148
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
We're out of here.

2149
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Bye.
