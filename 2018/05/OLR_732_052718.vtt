Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
On the heels of the phase-out of the PSP, one Sony chief speaks about rethinking mobile. Given the portability of the Nintendo Switch as well, we may be at a significant pivot point for mobile gaming. This is just one subject on a full night of gaming news. Join us for the rest, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:51.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 732 of our show for this May 27th, 2018. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined once again, I missed her, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers in the house.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
What'd you throw?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Everything I possibly could.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
If you threw a party, I was already at a party.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Old microphones, that's what I threw. I threw old microphones in the dumpster.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You know what was funny?

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
With our new mics, I actually considered going out and ordering myself a Pro-Sure.

01:09.000 --> 01:19.000
Hey, if you want, remember when Jason used to come to the show a lot? Our voiceover guy Jason, if you don't know who does the intro here, he would come to the show, he brought his own mic.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
And he sounds great on it. His very bassy tones that make him such a good announcer sound great. By the way, he might be here next week.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh, that'd be fun.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I should find where my Behringer mic went to.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
But it was a good mic.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
Anyway, it is a video game show, but I have to allow DarkSakura at least 30 seconds to talk about DragCon.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh my god, it was great.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
You've been gone because you were at DragCon, so quickly, how is DragCon? If there's anything remotely video game related, you should probably bring that up too.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
There is something, because my phone died right after DragCon and I lost some of my photos.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Oh no.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
I was very sad, including my ones with Maha Miller. I have my photos with BibleGirl666, who I've been following on Twitter. She's never been on Drag Race.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I love Drag.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I got to meet Karen from Finance, because my friend JJ has friends with her.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh nice.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
So I met Karen from Finance, who was a sweetheart.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
She's Australian, right?

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah. Latrice Royale, and JJ gave her edibles and she was wonderfully happy.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
But get Victoria to finish the Where Are You Going With Your Money story.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
Because she was at the season 4 thing and asked her, well Latrice said what happened after that. And it's not my story to tell.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Alright, that would be a reference.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
You know the story though, right?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I remember when Victoria yelled at her from the stage.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
And Latrice says somewhere sensual.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
That's right.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Something sensual happened.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
So Shaking and Crying is the show I do with Victoria.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
We've been on a little bit of hiatus, because I was on this special project that was taking way more of my time than it should have been.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
And then also, I had my allergy stuff. My voice was like gone.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
It was really scary. So we've been off, but we should be back with Shaking and Crying this week.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
So I will get her to give me the whole story.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Well, her sponge dress got us in to see Monet X Change.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Love it.

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm still bitter, but I still love. I'm not mad at Cameron, but I'm bitter. I'll leave it that way.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Okay.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
I literally, you know how like, maybe this is going to be my DragCon Kojima event, but I ran into Ms. Cracker.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
We both turned around at the same time and nearly ran face first into each other.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
And I was like, hi. She's like, I'm sorry, I got to go. And ran off.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
You know, because they have to bustle in between here and there.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Sure.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So Friday, when we were back, I went to see Ms. Cracker.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
And I was like, you remember a girl in red glasses wearing a red, you know, who was rocking her inner Shirley Manson?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
That was you! That was me.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I also met Dita Ritz that night, who was also really nice.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
You looked great, by the way.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Thank you. Thank you.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, I just, I got to hang out with Mayhem for a little bit.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Any game stuff in here?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
A little bit. A little bit. I'll get to it.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Because I met Yuho Hamasaki.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
And I was like, the moment I found out about you, I was like, oh my god, is it Ayumi?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
And she's like, yeah, totally Ayumi fan.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I was like, so then are you a big fan of the Ayuro CD?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
She's like, yes, I am.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
I was like, so then if we're going to go any further than that, then are you a Eurobeat fan in general?

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
She's like, yeah, I really like Eurobeat, you know, talking about the Initial D soundtrack.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I was like, okay, cool.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
So Yuho was really nice.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Okay, so we got one drag queen that's an Initial D fan. Good.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
The white horse was there, by the way.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
From the disco thing from All Stars.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
A triumph car was there, that was really cool.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
But there was a cosplay.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Okay, oh!

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
So we had, what's the character with the chainsaw from Undertale?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh, I...

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
That same cosplayer was at GamerX, by the way.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I know exactly what you're talking about, but I don't remember the name of the character.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
It's not Comic or Sans, I know that.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
We also had just a bunch of different...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I think you're thinking...

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Toriel?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, Toriel.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Okay, I didn't get to that part.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
No, not Toriel.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Toriel's the goat one.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
The little goat.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
This was the robot one with the chainsaw that has the heart on their face.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
But anyway, you know,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
and, you know,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Victoria walked in that, too.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
There were just a few other really funny ones.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Mettaton.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Mettaton. That was it. Mettaton.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
So, but it was...

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
There was some cosplay.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Oh! There was Digimon cosplay.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
This one queen.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And I got this one picture.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Did Mimi from Digimon.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
And also, her name is

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Anyonka, because she misspelled it

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
when she first made the name back in the day and kept it.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
But she does other video game and anime cosplay and drag.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
And then there was an Anji woman there the next day,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
and that's one of the photos I lost.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I was so sad.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
But yeah, there was also

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
just other cosplayers, like someone was there as

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Rudy Road from The Fifth Element.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Trixie was in Booty Shorts.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh, Ruby Rod.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Ruby Rod, sorry.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Trixie was in Booty Shorts buying for Morphe.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Alright, I gotta read some of these comments from chat.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Wait, one last one?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Alright, one last one.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Freakin' Shangela comes in on a litter

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
and sits on her throne

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
like the motherfuckin' Khaleesi she is.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
We do tape live, of course,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
at The Voice of Geeks Network,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
vognetwork.com, and you guys can chat along with us

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
where Nifty Swirl says,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Maybe someday they'll reboot it.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah, we didn't really get into all that.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Not according to what's been coming from Matt.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, here's the thing, obviously,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
like, things are different now.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Let's just put it that way. Things are different now

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
and I'm just gonna leave it at that.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
But here's the thing, I think a lot of the concepts

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
that were brought up with that,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
you know, expo and everything,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
is bigger than any one person.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
You know, so, you know,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
because it says maybe they'll reboot it.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Well, you know, I mean, I don't think you meant it this way,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
but I mean, you don't have to wait on any one person

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
or one group to do this.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Like, you can take these ideas

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
and the idea that everybody should have a place

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
to play video games and that it's not about

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
excluding straight white men.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
It's about making sure you're including everybody else

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
by welcoming folks to the table.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
You know, here at OLR, we've talked about how OLR,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
the way we envision the show is that we're all sitting

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
at the big diner table after playing DDR

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
and we're trying to welcome all people to our table, right?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I still think that we should do diversity panels at conventions.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah, so that's my thing, is that, you know,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
if there is not going to be another GamerX,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
and maybe there will, I don't know.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I mean, obviously, things are different,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
so it's gonna be interesting how that might work.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
But why not inject a little bit of that into every convention?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And that would be something I would hope to see moving forward.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And, you know, maybe it has already worked out a little bit.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Like PAX has done a very good job with, you know,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
as critical as I am of that show sometimes on a bigger scale,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
the fact that they do the diversity lounge

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
and that they do try to have that awareness there

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
and that they do have some of those panels, you know, that's cool.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That's, you know, a big step forward.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So that's, I guess those are my thoughts on that

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
because, of course, I was really sad just to see everything

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
that, you know, went down with GamerX,

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
but it's one of those things where I get it, you know?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
There's a lot more involved than what's on the surface.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm sure, I'm sure.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
And, you know, so, okay, you know, things are different now,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
so how can we proceed as a community?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Because those ideas were bigger than any one person or three people.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
You can start changes right in your own local convention.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
That's right. That's absolutely fucking right.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
By the way, Bobby asked if I used the right hashtag

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
because he, DragCon, put out a thing that said don't use DragonCon.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, they actually had a Jinx monsoon in that video.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
It looked like she was so fucking high when she did that video.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
But, yeah, they had the whole don't use DragCon

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
because of autocorrect or whatever it was, use DragCon.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Although they did acknowledge DragonCon is a real thing in Atlanta.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Yeah, but I used my right hashtag, so everything was great.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And we did it in Disneyland the next day,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
and I had a sad moment, speaking of games.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
The sign for the starkade is still up.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Oh.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah, we came out, they're doing Hyperspace Mountain right now,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
which is pretty fun, I mean.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
But, yeah, I stopped and looked up outside Star Trader,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
you know, where the starkade was,

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
and I was telling JJ, who was also Miss Patsy Declined,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
where the starkade was and what it used to be like,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
and then I looked up and I was like, oh, holy shit, there's the sign.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
This was the starkade, and the whole thing's closed off now.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
So, you know, I pointed out like a few where things used to be,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
but there was the crappiest thing happened.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
We were going to do Big Thunder for our last ride,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
when we got out from Blue Bayou.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
And so we had time, so we were going to do Hunter Mansion.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Hunter Mansion broke while we were in line.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
So then we went over to do our Fast Passes at Big Thunder.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It broke down.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So we didn't get to go on Big Thunder at all.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
And then we went over to do Indy, and it broke down.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
So our last...

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
It cost 105 bucks to get a park offer for Disney.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Excuse me. But we did Jungle Cruise for our last one.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Okay.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
With a tour guide who did not give a fuck.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
In a good way or in a bad way?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
In a good way.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Okay, good.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
She started doing some of the jokes that they're not allowed to do.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Oh, good.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Like, I'm going to tell you my favorite one of them.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Okay. And then we have to introduce,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
there is a third person on this show we have to introduce.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
When you go by the snake, like right before you get to Trader Sam,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
she's like, what kind of snake is this?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
She's like, I'll give you a clue. It starts with a P.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
We're like, Python, no plastic.

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
Because you're not supposed to break the 1800s joke book.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Because I would have yelled penis.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, girl.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Alright, but I have issues.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
She was like, do you want the thing? Because you can do it too.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I was like, will you let me?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Look, we're ten minutes into the show, and we need to introduce,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
but of course we've missed you for the past couple weeks.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And I did play a shitload of pinball on Friday, but I'll tell you about that later.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Alright, we'll get into our gaming weeks.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
But first, we've got to get over to Tech Master Loki. Hi.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Hello.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
How are you?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm here.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
You are here.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yes.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Yes, and you also have a new mic. It's new mic Monday, except it's Sunday.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
So, new mic Sunday.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Here at Studio OLR.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
New mic on Sunday.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
How was your week? Did you do anything exciting?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Have you been doing anything with your long weekend?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Just having to deal with the kids.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
It's been just annoying as fuck today.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I heard about the breakfast incident.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
No, it's been the whole day. It's just been whining.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
Like, yesterday was whining about stuff, and then today has been whining about stuff.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
And God, I just don't want to deal with it anymore.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, you're only locked in for about another, what, 13 years before they go off to college?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
You can do it.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Well, I hope they won't be whining like this then.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Teenagers are worse, Loki. What are you talking about?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Teenage boys.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Are you sure?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Are you sure?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Teenage boys have to be taught what consent is.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yes.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Have to be taught, you know, things.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
Teenage boys are just as much of a problem as teenage girls, and I was a teenage girl once.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
I don't think those topics are going to be an issue for Loki's kids, but, you know, they've got to stop whining.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Alright, anyway.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
We do, of course, again tape live on Sunday nights, and you can join us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It's kind of quiet in there right now.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
I don't think a lot of comments on DragCon, except Sia Tabiri does say,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Jinx would have been one of the queens who would have been more aware of what DragCon was than she seemed.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Tatiana's a gamer.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
Well, there's a couple of the Drag Race alumni that'll, like, Dax exclamation points there every year,

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
and some of the other, like, local, you know, people in Atlanta will be there, so.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And I'll be there, so you should make plans to be in Atlanta Labor Day weekend.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
By the way, I wanted to get a little pancake doll.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Oh, love it.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
And they were a hundred bucks.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
That's too expensive.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
So, and I wasn't also going to wait in line for Alaska.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
But, next year, when I go to DragCon, I'm cosplaying a little pancake.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
You should.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
It is happening.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Do it.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Anyway, in two weeks, speaking of Atlanta, I do want to give a shout out to this,

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
because VOG Network is going to be sponsoring the weekend of June 8th and 9th,

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
the Siege, or, no, sorry, not Siege.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
If I can even remember the name of it.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Sorry, I got it confused with something else.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Atlanta.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
No, it's something else, sorry.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It's the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Different, different acronym.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Southern Fried Game Room Expo is the thing.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It's a five-hour flight for me.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
That's why I'm not always the best at committing all these acronyms to memory.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
But the Southern Fried Game Room Expo is happening in Atlanta.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And, you know, it's a lot like how we have California Extreme up here,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
or that pinball thing that Jamie's going to talk about,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
where they have, like, classic game stuff, and then, of course, they do panels.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Our very own Bobby Blackwolf here at the network is going to be moderating a panel

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
with Billy Mitchell and Walter Day,

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
and this is after many interesting things have happened with those two individuals,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
so that panel is going to be a lot of fun.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
So check that out.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
So that is happening in the Atlanta area in just a couple of weekends.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Yes, thank you, Bobby. I got it.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Are they doing a panel on MAME?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I corrected myself.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Are they doing a panel on MAME?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I mean, they don't know what it is, right?

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
That is for Bobby to determine when he's going to be the one asking those questions.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
So check that out.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
What main version are you rocking in that cabinet over there?

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
Anyway, would you say your favorite musical on Broadway is anti-MAME?

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Anyway, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
This isn't, like, totally about video games,

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
but it's something that a lot of people are talking about in the gaming community.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
It came up on our Discord, which you can join our Discord community

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
That's all you need for the invite.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And on the Discord, they were talking about this.

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
It has to do with a nerdy show that I know a lot of people love, Doctor Who.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
And how it's a little bit adjacent to gaming

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
is the fact that they're going to be bringing it to Twitch.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Now, Twitch is mostly known as a gaming live streaming platform

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
where you can play video games and people watch

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
and, you know, build your audience and interact with them and all that good stuff.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
But, you know, more and more, Twitch has been getting into other stuff, too, right?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
Like, you know, we know that they do competitive esports like Overwatch League.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
It's like you're watching something on ESPN or something,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
but it's on Twitch and it's about a video game.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Or even the more IRL stuff like talk shows like this one.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Competitive eating sorts of things.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Competitive eating while doing a talk show.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Yes, right, competitive eating while doing your talk show and all that.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
And, of course, Twitch and marathons, not completely unheard of

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
because we had a Bob Ross marathon that was pretty legendary over there, right?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't know if you guys watched the Bob Ross marathon as much as I did,

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
but it's one of those rare instances where, like, chat was a good thing.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Like, usually with a marathon like this, I'd be like,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
don't fucking read the comments, don't read chat.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
It's going to be a cesspool.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
But, like, the Bob Ross one was, like, really fucking good.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Because you know how Bob Ross is so quiet and timid when he paints

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
and, you know, makes these happy little trees?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I can't believe he was ever a drill sergeant.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I know, right?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Oh, my God.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
But anyway, so he used to say, like,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
oh, we're just going to dip this paintbrush in the water

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
then we're going to beat the devil out of that brush.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
We're going to beat the devil out of that brush.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
And then the whole chat would light up going, R.I.P. devil.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Devil hacks.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
You know, like, all this stuff.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Like, really funny shit.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
So I'm very excited to see what happens when Doctor Who shows up on Twitch.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Now, here's the thing.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I think when most of you think of Doctor Who in these days,

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
you're thinking of, like, David Tennant and, you know,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
who are the other people that have played?

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Peter Capaldi and Christopher Eccleston, Matt Smith.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Matt Smith.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
OK, yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
It's one of those things, like, my train isn't derailed.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
My train is just moving slowly tonight.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Like, I'm thinking of things, like, five seconds after they leave my mouth.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Anyway, so most people think of the newer Doctor Who stuff,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
but actually that is not a part of this marathon, OK?

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
So that was the reboot that started in 2005 that's actually still going.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
But anyhow, so that's not a part of it.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
But Doctor Who actually started, what, 1963?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah, something like that.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
It's a very much older show.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
With Mr. Hartnell.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
So the episodes that air between 1963 and 1989 are going to be on Twitch

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
starting on May 29th.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
What they're going to do, they're going to do an eight-hour block

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
three times a day.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
So if you miss something, you can catch it again.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
You have, like, a chance to catch it again before they're rotated out.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
I wonder if they're going to do any of the recovered footage

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
from the BBC purge during the second Doctor?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Yeah, I heard about that. The ones that were lost.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
They found audio and then did animated versions to that audio.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
And then there were others that they tried to restore

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
that were people filming their televisions.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
A few roles were recovered, but yeah, the BBC did a big purge

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
of, like, a lot of their old television episodes

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
and some of it was Second Doctor.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
They have not said. They have not said if these episodes are a part of it or not.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
I just care about Fourth Doctor stuff, really.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I think that's where a lot of people are.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
They just want to see the Tom Baker stuff.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
And Sylvester McCoy, because I really freaking like Ace.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
She's like one of my favorite companions.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Well, 500 episodes from the show's classic period will be streamed.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Eight hours of Who per day starting at 11 a.m. Pacific is when the block starts.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
And then that's going to be three times that it's going to be repeated.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Also, prizes will be given out.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
If you watch ten minutes of Doctor Who in a day,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
you are entered into a drawing to win a Doctor Who fan pack

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
that includes a TARDIS money box, a themed Monopoly set,

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
and a Doctor Who doormat so you can walk all over your favorite Doctor.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
There's a grand prize as well, which is a trip to London Comic-Con,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
so that's pretty cool.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
You know, I'm not, like, super into Doctor Who,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
but I certainly don't dislike it.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Like, I watched some of the Eccleston ones because that's where I decided to start.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
And it was good. I just, you know, me and watching TV,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I don't always get to binge everything.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And then I'll, like, start binging something,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
and then suddenly somebody's like, you have to watch 13 Reasons Why.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Or you have to watch Stranger Things.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
No, you do not have to watch 13 Reasons Why.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Do you know how many people are telling me I need to watch that show?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I haven't watched it yet.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
No, please, please don't support that show.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
It does terrible things and completely misrepresents suicide.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Well, anyway, I have watched Stranger Things.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
That was the one I did. That was really good.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
And I still need to finish Queer Eye because there's a second season coming out.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Some of those guys were at DragCon.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Oh, really?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
I didn't say anything.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Oh, God.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
Every time I hit a trouble spot in my life, I just think,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
WWJVND, what would Jonathan Van Ness do?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I just think, what would Carson Kressley wear?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
He would probably call something gorgeous.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It's gorgeous. It's gorgeous.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
Anyway, over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com,

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
Nifty Squirrel wants to know, is the fanny pack bigger on the inside?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yes, I hope so.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
That's so funny because you know what fanny is everywhere else in the world?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
It means vagina.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
It's vagina, right?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yes.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
So anyway, well, fanny is your bottom, is your booty.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
At least if you are international, you did not know that that's what we take fanny to mean.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
But it's just like pants.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
I put on pants in the morning, but I'm thinking like jeans.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Trousers.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Or slacks, right?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
That's pants to us.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Pants everywhere else is your unders.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Yeah, your under thingies. So, kind of interesting.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Not the thingies that go in your under thingies, but the thingies that go over your under under thingies.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
Which is, ironically, you know how some people really get bothered by the word moist and things like that?

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
Okay, you know what, underpants, I think that is the dumbest word. You sound like you're like three years old.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
That's why you just call them pants.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I don't lie.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
It's also funny because then you can say, when we give someone a wedgie, you can say you pantsed someone.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
But that's just you pulled down your pants. You pulled down their pants.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
But you wedgie.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Anyway.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Oh, whatever.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Oh, forget it. Alright, look. We're going to move on.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
I wanted to ask you guys, though, about the Doctor Who stuff and this Twitch thing.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
Well, A, what do you think about this kind of direction for Twitch where we're seeing more and more non-gaming content on Twitch?

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Is this the future of television?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I don't hate it.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
You don't hate it?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I'm not mad at it.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I'm not mad at it either.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
It's fine.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
You know, it's good. And the thing that I like is that it'll give people easy access to seeing the classic Who to see.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Know your roots. Know your doctors.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
You know, I mean, yeah, Tom Baker made a cameo in one of the specials.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
You know, but still, you know, it's better to watch him as the doctor.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Right.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And, yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
And that fantastic scarf and outfit.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
You know the BBC released that scarf pattern.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Oh, good.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
To knit it.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
But, yeah, he had the hat.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
And I mean, of course.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
It was an ensemble.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
It was an ordeal.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
And him and Lala Ward, which he actually married her after and then they got divorced.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
But it's just funny, you know, watching them together.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
And then it's just really.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Go back and watch the seventh Doctor, though.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, my God.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
That is cranky, Doctor.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
And he is the best.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Let me get to this chat comment and then I'll ask Loki your thoughts.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
From Bobby in chat.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's on before us here at Vogue is saying, I think it's interesting

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
that Twitch is reintroducing live TV viewing again, something we stopped doing with Netflix,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Hulu and so forth.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
That's a very good point is that the whole like community coming together and like chatting

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
about it is kind of like like Twitch has kind of done that where other people kind of started

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
to do that.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
And then like the breaks got hit on it like and I'm thinking of like, remember when Netflix

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
had the party mode on 360 and then that got the plug pulled on it.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
But that was like a really fun thing to do with friends is to watch stuff together and

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
comment or TV, TV.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
I remember the we use little thing that they had where you could actually do the chat alongs

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
and stuff with football games and American Idol.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah, you probably don't remember it because Nintendo was horrible at promoting it.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I can imagine that shit with Drag Race, though.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Oh, my God.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Right.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
So that's what we needed.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
We need a Twitch Drag Race feed or something.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Anyway.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Right.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Loki, what are your thoughts on Doctor Who coming to Twitch and like what that could

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
mean for the future of like television?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
It's cool.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I never watched Doctor Who.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
So, yeah, I don't know.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I'll check it out.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
I'll watch it a little bit, even though I don't know a lot about the classic ones.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Yeah.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
I mean, it's neat that they're experimenting with that kind of stuff.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
I think we are.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
For me, I think we are looking in a little bit of a way at the future of television because

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
there's more and more stuff that people can home grow in this day and age.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
So I can talk about this now.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
The project that I was doing for the past couple of weeks that kind of kept me away

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
from a lot of things is that I was playing one of my like online games.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
That's like the survivor esque type of game.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
But I had to keep it a secret because that was part of the whole twist was that I'm not

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
going to get too into the details because I kind of want to do an episode of this show

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
about it at some point with some of the people that live here locally that play them.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
But I got voted out really early.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
The game is supposed to run through like June.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I was like the seventh person voted out.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
So I didn't even make the jury thing.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
But whatever.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
That's just because they're haters.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
But the reason why I bring that whole project up is because I think it's fascinating because

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
like when events are happening in the game, like challenges and tribal councils,

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
they're streaming them on Google Hangouts and people are watching them like it's like they

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
have this group.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
There's like something like 700, 800 people in this Facebook group.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And there's, you know, a good chunk of people that are like actually watching this shit

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
unfold live.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
And the reason why I bring that up is because like a lot more of like the television and

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
the programming stuff is homegrown.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Right.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
So people aren't necessarily waiting for a new episode of Survivor to come on this week.

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
They're making their own fucking survivor or, you know, like people aren't waiting for

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
there to be a new gaming channel for a G4 replacement to show up.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
One's never coming because Twitch, everybody has like their own thing.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
So I think you're seeing more and more like what the future of television is going to

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
look like because basic cable is on notice, in my opinion.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
They're like the room for basic cable is that window is dwindling because I think more

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
and more people are kind of making their own shit.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
I don't think local television is ever particularly going away because local TV is still

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
going to keep us informed, especially when like bad shit is happening in town and people

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
need to see like, where is the hurricane?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Where is the flood?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Where is the volcano erupting?

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Like those types of things you still need like your local news for.

25:57.000 --> 26:04.000
It's similar in a way, in my opinion, to what podcasts have done to traditional radio.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Like podcasts have really kind of fucked up traditional radio in many ways.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
You know, it really kind of put a dent in satellite radio.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
They're all under one company now, right?

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
Because people can kind of choose to listen to their own stuff.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
So it's very interesting to me how more and more media is getting more underground.

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
Of course, this could open up a whole nother can of worms about, well, when you have amateur

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
media, there's no sense of responsibility, which is how we get into spreading news stories

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
that aren't necessarily real, right?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Alternative facts, if you will.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Yeah, but the major news networks do that too.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
So, I mean, yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
So, I mean, but anyway, I don't want to go too far down that.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
To be fair, their spread, their effect on, you know, the populace is they have a larger

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
viewership is probably greater than a podcast.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Right.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
Well, but I mean, maybe because a lot of their viewership is a lot of older folks who don't

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
use, not only, but there's a lot of older folks that don't use technology.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
Like Loki, by the time we are the older generation, the ones that are over the age of 65, which

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
is only about 25 years away, you know, that using things like Twitch, using the internet

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
to get things that's going to be commonplace.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
That's not going to be like a niche thing or something that only tech savvy people know

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
how to do.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
You know what I mean?

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Yeah.

27:26.000 --> 27:34.000
So, anyway, looking at a chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Nifty Swirl says, ah, bummer, you got pork

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
chopped.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
No, I wasn't the first one gone.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I was more like Mayhem Miller.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
I was I should have went a lot further and I was like a fan favorite.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Cut too soon.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
That's I was I would prefer to be compared to Mayhem Miller, although I do love Mayhem,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
though.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Yeah, it's perfect.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
It's the perfect analogy.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
And Mayhem also was complete perfection in person.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Yes.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
And which I am, too.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I got to look at the feather dress in person.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh, I love it.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
That shit was hot.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
I love it.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Let's see.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
Tiger Claw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the problem with Google Hangout, however,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.400
if there is any copyrighted music playing in the background, it's going to nag you about

28:14.400 --> 28:17.240
it since Google Hangout is archiving the stream to YouTube.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.600
Well, that would just depend on the type of programming you're doing.

28:19.600 --> 28:23.740
Like all the game stuff I was just referencing, like you don't really play music during that.

28:23.740 --> 28:29.520
So there's no there's no need to, you know, watch that or no need to worry about copyright

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
with that.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.000
But I I mean, that's also a problem on Twitch.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.840
Like if you're going to sit there and play something like Heroes of the Storm all night

28:37.840 --> 28:38.840
long.

28:38.840 --> 28:39.840
Excuse me.

28:39.840 --> 28:44.000
And you get you get sick of the game audio or things like Warcraft.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
That's another big one.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
World of Warcraft.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.200
Like, you know, the music of World of Warcraft is great.

28:48.200 --> 28:52.760
The first 500 times you hear it and then it's like, OK, maybe I'm going to mute the soundtrack

28:52.760 --> 28:54.840
of World of Warcraft and play my own music.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.740
So I mean, you can do that.

28:56.740 --> 29:01.320
And I guess they use a DJ license or something so that the live feeds are unaffected.

29:01.320 --> 29:05.140
But your broadcast will get muted if you have copyright music in it, which I'm sure you

29:05.140 --> 29:07.440
all know is a big thing over on Twitch TV.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.440
So anyway.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.640
Whoo.

29:11.640 --> 29:15.200
I guess I kind of went off track there on the Twitch and Doctor Who thing.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.120
But I really do think it kind of all comes together about kind of like the future of

29:18.120 --> 29:23.320
like where the concept of a TV network is growing.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.520
And, you know, we're starting to grow more and more of our own stuff.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.400
So I'll leave you with that.

29:28.480 --> 29:32.360
Anyway, let's move on and talk about our video game weeks and the types of video games that

29:32.360 --> 29:34.300
we have been playing this week.

29:34.300 --> 29:39.120
So Dark Sakura, you got a little bit to catch up on, but any games you want to talk about

29:39.120 --> 29:40.400
that you've been playing this week?

29:40.400 --> 29:44.440
Kirby, Zelda Breath of the Wild.

29:44.440 --> 29:49.200
And then I went to the Golden State Pinball Expo and played a shit ton of pinball.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.680
And I'm going to go in order of what I played.

29:51.680 --> 29:56.840
Played Baby Pac-Man, Mr. and Miss Pac-Man pinball.

29:56.840 --> 29:57.840
These are all pinball by the way.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.040
Black Rose, which is one of my favorites.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.040
Dialed in.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.040
They had dialed in.

30:02.040 --> 30:06.040
So I got to play it on one of the Jersey Jack tables.

30:06.040 --> 30:12.440
Also got to play like this vertigo pinball thing, but it also had like double screen

30:12.440 --> 30:17.480
or like extra long screen video games.

30:17.480 --> 30:18.740
So one of them was Mappy.

30:18.740 --> 30:19.740
So I played Mappy.

30:19.740 --> 30:24.800
I apologize for this very important interruption, but Dark Sakura, did you want the decaf one

30:24.800 --> 30:28.880
or did you want to choose from the other flavors that I have for coffee?

30:28.880 --> 30:30.600
Coffee is a very important subject.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.080
I will always interrupt this show to talk about coffee.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.960
I really want actual caffeine, but I'm afraid about ulcers, but fuck it.

30:36.960 --> 30:37.960
You live once.

30:37.960 --> 30:38.960
Do you have hazelnut?

30:38.960 --> 30:39.960
So we want peppermint.

30:39.960 --> 30:44.560
You want vanilla macadamia, vanilla buttercream or toasted graham.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.560
Oh, I do have hazelnut cream.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.560
You want that?

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
I like hazelnut cream, please.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.560
All right.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.560
You got it.

30:49.560 --> 30:50.560
Now we resume with our gaming weeks.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.560
Okay.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.400
I also played Centaur.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.360
I played the Goldeneye table.

30:55.360 --> 30:59.760
I played Starship Troopers, which is actually a really fun table.

30:59.760 --> 31:05.120
I did play Doctor Who pinball that has one of the best multi balls to ever exist.

31:05.120 --> 31:09.440
I played, the fuck is this one?

31:09.440 --> 31:11.960
I think it's the Getaway.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.520
I played Middle Earth, which is one of the seventies ones.

31:14.520 --> 31:17.560
I played the Got Live Ninja Turtles table, which always sucks.

31:17.560 --> 31:21.960
I of course played Lexi Lightspeed, which keep your eyes open for Lexi Lightspeed because

31:21.960 --> 31:23.160
it's a modular table.

31:23.160 --> 31:27.000
You're supposed to be able to rebuild the table with different rules.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.160
And on the play field, it has like a video screen that interacts with the various targets

31:31.160 --> 31:32.160
and everything.

31:32.160 --> 31:37.800
So you can get one modular table and then switch out other tables and other programming

31:37.800 --> 31:38.800
for it.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.000
So it's pretty cool.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.960
I also played...

31:41.960 --> 31:42.960
Which one is this?

31:42.960 --> 31:45.280
I don't know which one this is.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.840
Oh, this is Lost in Space.

31:46.840 --> 31:47.840
It wasn't great.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.860
I played Tron.

31:49.860 --> 31:55.500
And then I saw a sticker that says, ask not for whom the ball rolls, it rolls for thee.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.500
Also played Ghostbusters, the new Ghostbusters, which is pretty nice.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.300
It was just funny.

32:00.300 --> 32:07.900
If you look in their headquarters, they have a picture of a pinball table that's the same

32:07.900 --> 32:11.820
pinball table that was in the firehouse in the movie.

32:11.820 --> 32:12.940
So it's pretty cool.

32:12.940 --> 32:18.300
I played Aerosmith, which I do nothing but play the Sweet Emotion mode on that one anyway.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.660
Which is an appropriate thing to do.

32:20.660 --> 32:22.780
I played one called TX Sector.

32:22.780 --> 32:26.420
I played The Hobbit, which is a slow ass table.

32:26.420 --> 32:32.700
I mean, Jersey Jack does some good tables, but this one was slow as fuck to play and

32:32.700 --> 32:33.700
not as much fun.

32:33.700 --> 32:38.780
I played Beat Time, which is the one based on the Beatles.

32:38.780 --> 32:45.800
I did not get to play one of the new ones.

32:45.800 --> 32:46.800
What was it?

32:46.800 --> 32:47.800
Houdini.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.000
One of the newest ones to come out.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.240
And then they had the Iron Maiden machines.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.100
But oh, I also played Guardians of the Galaxy, which was a really fun table.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.700
That's like their new one, huh?

32:57.700 --> 32:58.700
One of the newer ones.

32:58.700 --> 33:02.760
But actually the newest one that came out was Iron Maiden and it was okay.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.760
I didn't play it.

33:03.760 --> 33:04.760
Sorry.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.840
I have to deviate real quick because now that you're talking about all this pinball, like

33:07.840 --> 33:11.120
one of the big stories that you missed in the couple of weeks you were gone was that

33:11.120 --> 33:14.480
the pinball arcade.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.480
Is that the one?

33:15.480 --> 33:16.580
I can't, there's always like multiple.

33:16.580 --> 33:19.220
So they're losing like a ton of those licenses.

33:19.220 --> 33:23.100
They're losing, what was it, Midway, Bali.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.380
They're losing those.

33:24.380 --> 33:27.240
And so you have until the end of June to pick up everything you want.

33:27.240 --> 33:31.100
There's not going to be any sales because that's a violation of their license agreement.

33:31.100 --> 33:35.100
Like are you sad to see those go or are you just playing the virtual one?

33:35.100 --> 33:37.240
So I wasn't fun for me.

33:37.240 --> 33:42.140
I guess that is kind of a dumb question for you because you and husband are in the position

33:42.140 --> 33:44.340
where you can collect the real things.

33:44.340 --> 33:46.260
Or we know people who have them.

33:46.660 --> 33:49.660
And I'll be honest, I really don't enjoy playing virtual pinball that much.

33:49.660 --> 33:50.660
Really?

33:50.660 --> 33:55.020
Even the, um, the, the big like virtue, like the main pinball thing that they actually

33:55.020 --> 33:56.620
lay down on a vertical TV.

33:56.620 --> 34:00.580
Yeah, because it's really fucking weird to tilt them.

34:00.580 --> 34:05.220
It just doesn't, it's just not as much when you don't get the right feedback.

34:05.220 --> 34:08.340
Tilt is always weird on a virtual thing.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.440
That's one thing that is like impossible to get right.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.820
And see, for me, it's almost impossible for me to tilt a table.

34:14.740 --> 34:19.100
Usually the way that I knock the, um, the ball back into play is I just give it a smack

34:19.100 --> 34:20.100
on the side.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.100
Yeah.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.100
Same.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.300
And it's usually enough, but Dan shakes it.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.420
I don't shake the whole table.

34:25.420 --> 34:28.380
So getting a tilt is really hard for me.

34:28.380 --> 34:31.500
I mean, I wouldn't say I've never tilted before, but, but I have.

34:31.500 --> 34:32.500
I've tilted.

34:32.500 --> 34:36.940
But you know, but I am still playing Ragnarok.

34:36.940 --> 34:40.860
I'm still playing Pokemon Go and that's about it.

34:40.860 --> 34:42.180
All right.

34:42.180 --> 34:43.180
A lot of fucking pinball.

34:43.540 --> 34:47.460
And I took pictures of everything that I took so that I, that I played so I could put it

34:47.460 --> 34:51.020
on my thing for today that I played all those pins.

34:51.020 --> 34:52.020
All right.

34:52.020 --> 34:53.020
You got it.

34:53.020 --> 34:57.100
Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby says, I spent that money to buy all

34:57.100 --> 34:58.100
the packs.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.020
Uh, for someone who can't play the real thing.

35:00.020 --> 35:01.020
I liked it.

35:01.020 --> 35:03.300
I only play real pinball tables once a year.

35:03.300 --> 35:08.500
Uh, and then the VPC caps I want to get, have a tilt button on either side so I won't have

35:08.500 --> 35:09.500
to shake my table.

35:09.500 --> 35:15.100
Well, I mean, it's, it's hard because you know, a button, it's just not going to be

35:15.100 --> 35:18.580
quite that same feeling as the actual physics of shaking it.

35:18.580 --> 35:23.180
But I also get it like you may not want to put that type of stress on your table, but

35:23.180 --> 35:24.740
that is kind of part of pinball.

35:24.740 --> 35:29.100
I mean, believe it or not, tilting machine is kind of without tilting it and getting

35:29.100 --> 35:31.260
the error is kind of part of it.

35:31.260 --> 35:34.340
That's why the tables, the legs are the way that they are.

35:34.340 --> 35:39.480
They are firm steel that are meant to be shaken and the tilt mechanism inside for anyone who

35:39.480 --> 35:44.700
doesn't know it is a weighted pendulum that is a perfectly balanced pendulum with, um,

35:44.700 --> 35:47.620
a charged plate in a circle around it.

35:47.620 --> 35:52.600
And so when it hits, it'll give you a warning, but when it's a full knock, it'll give you

35:52.600 --> 35:53.600
a full tilt.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.600
Yeah.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.760
So that is how it works.

35:56.760 --> 35:57.760
To be fair.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.840
These things that we're talking about are like advanced pinball.

36:00.840 --> 36:04.560
Like most people that play pinball aren't going to be in the notion.

36:04.560 --> 36:08.400
Like I would say beginner pinball is when you're still hitting both flipper buttons

36:08.400 --> 36:11.480
at the same time for everything.

36:11.480 --> 36:12.480
Which is fine.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.480
I mean, that's fine.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.480
That's like beginner DDR.

36:14.480 --> 36:15.480
When you go back to the center.

36:15.480 --> 36:16.480
Oh my God.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.480
I was thinking the same thing.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.480
That's like beginner DDR.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.120
The first thing you have to learn about DDR is to like, don't, you don't always have to

36:21.120 --> 36:22.120
go back to the center.

36:22.120 --> 36:25.320
Well, the first thing you need to learn from DDR watching my kids is that you have to hit

36:25.320 --> 36:28.960
more than just the top arrow and you have to kind of look at the screen when you're

36:28.960 --> 36:33.100
doing it because you can't just stand there and just keep tapping the top arrow and expect

36:33.100 --> 36:34.100
to beat the level.

36:34.740 --> 36:39.940
But the, the, you know, the great thing about, about pinball for me is that physicality to

36:39.940 --> 36:40.940
it.

36:40.940 --> 36:44.900
And so that's why I just don't get the same feel with the virtual tables.

36:44.900 --> 36:49.740
I mean, I liked playing, you know, Revenge of the Gator and all that because that was

36:49.740 --> 36:54.740
how that was meant to be played or Sonics pinball, Pokemon pinball, but they were designed

36:54.740 --> 36:55.740
that way.

36:55.740 --> 36:56.740
They were never full size tables.

36:56.740 --> 37:01.580
They had that fantasy element to it and things that wouldn't like, or a devil's crush or

37:01.580 --> 37:03.260
alien crush.

37:03.260 --> 37:05.300
Those things wouldn't happen on a legit pinball table.

37:05.300 --> 37:11.540
So, but, you know, if it's a legit pinball and it doesn't and they make a virtual version

37:11.540 --> 37:16.060
of it, like it was fine before we could, you know, get these tables or new people who had

37:16.060 --> 37:17.060
them.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.060
That was kind of the only way we could.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.060
Right.

37:19.060 --> 37:20.060
But now.

37:20.060 --> 37:21.060
Which you realize is where most people are at.

37:21.060 --> 37:27.220
But now pinball is really such a growing, um, you know, it's, it's gaining its popularity

37:27.220 --> 37:28.220
again.

37:28.220 --> 37:29.220
The love has come back.

37:29.220 --> 37:32.780
We've got companies returning and I even wonder if part of these licensed failures could

37:32.780 --> 37:38.780
possibly be that maybe some of those companies might be thinking of, cause I mean, um, midway

37:38.780 --> 37:43.740
and uh, Williams have licensed their tables to stern and to some of the, um, the ones

37:43.740 --> 37:45.460
rebuilding them.

37:45.460 --> 37:50.100
So it could be, I mean, we may even, who knows, maybe we'll see a return of Williams pinball.

37:50.100 --> 37:51.100
Who knows?

37:51.100 --> 37:52.100
All right.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.540
Anyway, let's move on to Loki and your gaming week.

37:54.540 --> 37:57.540
Um, I played no pinball this week.

37:57.540 --> 37:58.540
No, it's all good.

37:58.540 --> 37:59.860
It's all good.

37:59.860 --> 38:06.140
And so, um, I did play those some new stuff, so I did try because I was looking for more

38:06.140 --> 38:12.340
games for the switch, so I ended up downloading a few and one of those being a bloodstain

38:12.340 --> 38:21.340
curse of the moon, which is a kind of retro, like it's very much like Castlevania three

38:21.340 --> 38:26.620
and it's, um, yeah, I mean, it's a good game.

38:26.620 --> 38:31.540
It's very much, it looked like it could be an NES game and I've enjoyed quite a bit of

38:31.540 --> 38:32.540
it.

38:32.540 --> 38:36.420
So definitely check it out cause you can switch between players or let's sort of like, I guess

38:36.420 --> 38:39.620
Castlevania three, cause I think Castlevania three you couldn't switch in real time, but

38:39.620 --> 38:42.820
this you can, you can actually switch between your characters in real time, which is kind

38:42.820 --> 38:43.820
of cool.

38:43.820 --> 38:47.620
Um, but yeah, I mean like every, all the enemies in the game, like dude, this is like totally

38:47.620 --> 38:48.620
Castlevania.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.380
Like this is just such a ripoff of the Castlevania.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.380
Granted.

38:52.380 --> 38:56.340
Yeah, I know it's the same people, but it's like, dude.

38:56.340 --> 38:57.340
It's exactly.

38:57.340 --> 38:59.780
It's like reskinning Castlevania and calling it something else.

38:59.780 --> 39:00.780
To be fair.

39:00.780 --> 39:02.460
That's kind of what a lot of people want though.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.560
You know, like, yeah, I'm not complaining.

39:04.560 --> 39:05.560
It's a great game.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.540
I mean, it was, it's a great game.

39:07.540 --> 39:12.300
So not complaining, but I'm just like, Oh man, enemies just like this one and the other

39:12.300 --> 39:15.380
game and it's like, it's exactly the same.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.060
There's food in the walls and stuff.

39:17.060 --> 39:19.740
And so yeah, whatever.

39:19.740 --> 39:20.740
It's all good.

39:20.740 --> 39:23.580
Um, you know, if Konami ain't going to do it, you know what?

39:23.580 --> 39:24.580
Yeah.

39:24.580 --> 39:25.580
So, um, definitely check that out.

39:25.820 --> 39:28.100
I've been asking, when do we get an old school Castlevania game yet?

39:28.100 --> 39:29.100
Here you go.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.100
Here you go.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.100
Yeah, it's great.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.100
10 bucks.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.100
Can't be it.

39:33.100 --> 39:34.100
Yeah.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.180
You should get, if you put 28 or more down, you should get a code for this retro one.

39:36.180 --> 39:38.580
But the problem is the codes are like delayed.

39:38.580 --> 39:42.860
So like I'm waiting on my switch code, but like I know people that still just went and

39:42.860 --> 39:45.460
bought it anyway, but I'm like, no, I'm going to wait on my switch code.

39:45.460 --> 39:49.900
But I think they gave backers like a temporary steam code so that you could check it out

39:49.900 --> 39:53.660
no matter where you're like copy is supposed to be.

39:53.660 --> 39:54.660
Anyway.

39:54.740 --> 39:55.740
It's good.

39:55.740 --> 39:56.740
So definitely check it out.

39:56.740 --> 40:02.580
And then my S my son had their friends over, so they wanted to do PlayStation VR.

40:02.580 --> 40:06.500
So I got more PlayStation VR stuff, but none of them played any of the new games that he

40:06.500 --> 40:09.340
wanted to play the same old shit that the key plane.

40:09.340 --> 40:13.140
So we played a little bit of, um, what do you let your children play until dawn?

40:13.140 --> 40:14.140
Rush your blood.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.420
I wanted to let them do that, but they don't know.

40:16.420 --> 40:21.500
No, the one I wanted to let them play a surgeon simulator, but that would unfortunately be

40:21.500 --> 40:23.660
a little inappropriate, but they would love it.

40:23.660 --> 40:26.020
They would, they would eat that shit.

40:26.020 --> 40:32.740
But no, the, the more, the most violent game they played was, um, super hot VR.

40:32.740 --> 40:37.460
And they liked, they liked because like that game, there's no way to like, I can't figure

40:37.460 --> 40:38.980
out how to restart the progress.

40:38.980 --> 40:42.460
So they had to play like where I left off in the game.

40:42.460 --> 40:47.620
Um, and so the one that I left off on, you start off, I think in like a helicopter maybe

40:47.620 --> 40:48.620
or something.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.620
I don't know.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.320
It's like some elevated area and you have to punch a guy.

40:52.320 --> 40:58.540
And so they kept cock punching the dude over and over and, um, shooting things.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.420
But yeah, they had fun with that.

41:00.420 --> 41:05.480
And then we also, I picked up, um, fruit ninja VR, which that's a pretty easy one from the

41:05.480 --> 41:06.480
play.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.560
Um, and then what else?

41:08.560 --> 41:14.160
And then we did a job simulator, you know, the old standby, but like I had like a bunch

41:14.160 --> 41:21.340
of stuff and stuff that I like almost accidentally started for them, like accounting plus, no,

41:21.380 --> 41:23.940
that's not, that's not a kid's game right there.

41:23.940 --> 41:30.100
Um, but yeah, I, my wife's like, well, you know, can I try that?

41:30.100 --> 41:34.260
You know, joking them like, yeah, you can, you can play until dawn rush of blood.

41:34.260 --> 41:37.460
She didn't want to do that.

41:37.460 --> 41:38.460
Is that it?

41:38.460 --> 41:43.380
And I also have Skyrim VR, which I haven't got a chance to play yet, but I have it cause

41:43.380 --> 41:48.240
I got a half off when they were doing that sale last week at GameStop.

41:48.240 --> 41:54.040
So aside from that, um, just basically, uh, Super Mario Odyssey and then on Pokemon Go

41:54.040 --> 41:58.020
because you know, we've, they've had the kind of cycling stuff out.

41:58.020 --> 42:01.880
So I've been just evolving stuff.

42:01.880 --> 42:02.880
That's it.

42:02.880 --> 42:03.880
All right.

42:03.880 --> 42:04.880
Uh, my gaming week.

42:04.880 --> 42:10.200
So, um, I, I, my project came to an end when a bunch of people half my age voted me off

42:10.200 --> 42:11.200
the Island.

42:11.200 --> 42:15.360
Um, so that's, that's that, but, uh, it, it opened up my free time to play more video

42:15.360 --> 42:16.360
games again.

42:16.360 --> 42:19.840
Um, so I was able to, you guys don't even know like how much time you spend, but it's

42:19.840 --> 42:21.520
like nonstop Skype calls.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.600
Like is, are they going to turn on you?

42:23.600 --> 42:24.600
Are they going to turn on you?

42:24.600 --> 42:25.600
Are you going to stick with me?

42:25.600 --> 42:26.600
Are you going to do this?

42:26.600 --> 42:29.000
I guess it's like nonstop, but it's actually a lot of fun.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.120
It really like, it sounds ridiculous, but like the psychological psychology games, like

42:33.120 --> 42:38.640
if you like shit, like, like mafia and werewolf and stuff and conventions, like it's basically

42:38.640 --> 42:40.440
that, like just on a much bigger scale.

42:40.440 --> 42:44.400
Anyway, that's all I'll say about that until I'm able to get some of the players here on

42:44.400 --> 42:47.600
the building, kind of like we did the Ingers episode and we'll do a, we'll do an orgy

42:47.600 --> 42:48.600
episode.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.680
Um, not to be confused with orgy.

42:50.680 --> 42:51.680
That's much different.

42:51.680 --> 42:52.680
This is an orgy episode.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.800
Um, anyhow, so video games, I picked back up final fantasy 14.

42:56.800 --> 43:00.280
I kind of slowed down on that the past couple of months because I sort of wore out that

43:00.280 --> 43:04.600
last patch, but they came out with patch 4.3 in this past week.

43:04.600 --> 43:09.300
So it's kind of reinvigorated me to go back in there and, Oh, I got a new, a dungeon unlock

43:09.300 --> 43:10.300
and check out.

43:10.300 --> 43:14.660
I really like the way they did the new dungeons and they referenced geomancers from back in

43:14.660 --> 43:18.860
like final fantasy tactics are like, even though they're not a playable class, like

43:18.860 --> 43:23.000
the enemies are geomancers and they ring the bells and it like makes the area that you're

43:23.000 --> 43:24.440
in completely change.

43:24.440 --> 43:25.440
So it's really cool.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.440
Um, I like that.

43:26.440 --> 43:31.100
Uh, and then, um, yeah, just unlocking some of the other features, like you get to rebuild

43:31.100 --> 43:32.640
Doma castle.

43:32.640 --> 43:36.700
It's one of those weird things where like Doma castle exists in final fantasy 14, but

43:36.700 --> 43:39.780
it's not necessarily the same Doma from final fantasy six.

43:39.780 --> 43:44.400
It's just like, what if this concept existed in a different time and place?

43:44.400 --> 43:49.440
Like kind of like how final well fancy games do with like Sid and chocobos, right?

43:49.440 --> 43:51.620
So they took Doma castle and kind of put it there.

43:51.620 --> 43:53.720
And so that's a big part is you get to rebuild Doma.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.380
So I had to do a lot of questing for that.

43:55.380 --> 43:58.420
So that was some time in fall of SC 14.

43:58.420 --> 44:01.380
Um, and then I also played some Nintendo switch.

44:01.380 --> 44:03.920
Um, I checked out a game kind of randomly.

44:03.920 --> 44:07.500
I noticed it was the number one selling game in the store and it was an indie game.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.380
It was beating a bunch of other stuff.

44:09.380 --> 44:11.220
And uh, I'd heard some friends talking about it on Twitter.

44:11.220 --> 44:12.220
So I was like, what the hell?

44:12.220 --> 44:13.220
I'm going to pick this up.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.220
So it's called wizard of legend.

44:14.220 --> 44:15.220
Yeah.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.220
I saw that.

44:16.220 --> 44:18.360
I almost bought it by having it's, it's not bad.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.800
Like it doesn't handhold you a lot.

44:20.800 --> 44:24.460
Like you really have to kind of learn some things the hard way.

44:24.460 --> 44:26.180
It is a rogue like, okay.

44:26.180 --> 44:27.180
At its core.

44:27.180 --> 44:31.800
Um, but even if you're like one of those people's like, I hate rogue likes, like, you know,

44:31.800 --> 44:35.260
check out some videos, see what you think about this one, because you know, a lot of

44:35.260 --> 44:40.380
it is about kind of like how you build your book of moves before you go out into the world

44:40.380 --> 44:43.040
and you can collect these different arcana basically.

44:43.040 --> 44:47.620
So like maybe you do like an earth punch or a fire punch and like, or these different

44:47.620 --> 44:52.980
moves, like the beams can be fire or lightning, but then I mean it's, it's much more intricate

44:52.980 --> 44:53.980
than that.

44:53.980 --> 44:56.220
It's not just like, Oh, it's the same beam, but a different element.

44:56.220 --> 44:59.460
No, like the ice one will like go out and freeze monster then come back.

44:59.460 --> 45:01.580
The fire one kind of does a funky pattern.

45:01.580 --> 45:05.700
You know, the thunder one will like suspend bullets in midair, you know, like they all

45:05.700 --> 45:07.940
have their own little like things that they do.

45:07.940 --> 45:11.280
So you kind of like can build that book, but they didn't, they didn't really explain the

45:11.280 --> 45:12.280
whole concept.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.700
So I'll just, I'll help you all out if you decide to check this out.

45:14.700 --> 45:18.220
So the little like chaos emeralds, I think they're called either that or I'm confused

45:18.220 --> 45:20.620
to get with Sonic the Hedgehog little chaos emeralds.

45:20.620 --> 45:24.860
That's what you use to like buy new spells that are permanent for your book that you

45:24.860 --> 45:27.580
can take each time in there.

45:27.580 --> 45:32.220
And that's, that's like, you want to grab, those persist even amongst death.

45:32.220 --> 45:37.920
Gold will lose when you die and gold is how you temporarily buy stuff in the dungeons.

45:37.920 --> 45:40.740
So you might run across shopkeepers in the dungeons that are like, do you want to buy

45:40.740 --> 45:43.480
this spell or do you want to buy this enhancement for your spell?

45:43.480 --> 45:46.380
You can spend gold on that, but it will only last during the dungeon.

45:46.380 --> 45:47.480
So it's kind of interesting.

45:47.480 --> 45:51.600
It feels a little bit like in some ways Diablo-y to me because all the dungeons are like randomly

45:51.600 --> 45:55.940
generated and so they're never going to be the same and you know, kind of like the way

45:55.940 --> 45:57.860
that you fight and stuff looks a little Diablo-y.

45:57.860 --> 45:59.260
So I'm into it.

45:59.260 --> 46:03.540
I like it, you know, especially for like a, what was it, $15, $20 indie title.

46:03.540 --> 46:04.540
Yeah.

46:04.540 --> 46:05.540
It's, it's, you know, it's cool.

46:05.540 --> 46:08.980
And apparently it has local co-op, which is cool, but I haven't really been able to test

46:08.980 --> 46:09.980
that yet.

46:09.980 --> 46:11.940
So there's that.

46:11.940 --> 46:14.500
I also picked up Mega Man collection one and two.

46:14.500 --> 46:15.500
I just haven't played it yet.

46:15.500 --> 46:19.700
So not a lot else to say on that, but I did pick up and I did play a little bit of Hyrule

46:19.700 --> 46:23.660
warriors last night because I'm, I didn't bother playing it when it was on Wii U.

46:23.660 --> 46:25.700
I didn't bother playing it when it was on 3DS.

46:25.700 --> 46:28.860
So finally I was like, all right, this, this is probably going to be the last time they

46:28.860 --> 46:31.420
do it and this will be the everything edition.

46:31.420 --> 46:32.880
So I'm going to buy it this time.

46:32.880 --> 46:35.860
So I did and I'm, I'm liking it quite a bit.

46:35.860 --> 46:38.940
Like I've only played the first two regular levels.

46:38.940 --> 46:42.140
Then I went into the adventure mode, which is the one that looks like the 8-bit Zelda

46:42.140 --> 46:43.140
a little bit.

46:43.140 --> 46:45.060
And I did a little bit of that cause I want to explore it.

46:45.060 --> 46:47.460
I'll play some more after the show tonight on my Twitch channel.

46:47.460 --> 46:52.220
I think last, last I checked my vote on my Twitter, that was the one that was leading

46:52.220 --> 46:53.220
by about 20%.

46:53.220 --> 46:55.780
So I think I'm going to be doing Hyrule warriors after the show tonight.

46:55.780 --> 46:58.540
So I'll show you a little more of that game over on my Twitch channel.

46:58.540 --> 47:02.460
It's twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, all one word.

47:02.460 --> 47:06.540
But I love the feeling of just hacking through thousands of enemies at once.

47:06.540 --> 47:10.340
And I think it's really cool how you can play as Link, but in the first stage you get to

47:10.340 --> 47:14.620
be Zelda a little bit, or you can be Impa or I just got a stage with Sheik in it.

47:14.620 --> 47:18.080
So it's cool that you can play all these different characters.

47:18.080 --> 47:22.180
And then I like that it's not just like run to the other side of the battlefield and hack

47:22.180 --> 47:25.620
as many things as you can, like you have to kind of manage everything that's going

47:25.620 --> 47:26.820
on in the battlefield.

47:26.820 --> 47:30.100
And part of how you manage it is you can flip between your characters really quick.

47:30.100 --> 47:33.780
So it's like, you might get an alert, like you have this base under attack in the top

47:33.780 --> 47:34.780
left.

47:34.780 --> 47:37.420
Okay, well Impa is up there in the top left, so I'm going to flip over to Impa and then

47:37.420 --> 47:40.660
I'll have her take the base back and get rid of, okay, now I'll go back to Link who is

47:40.660 --> 47:42.360
kind of going through the main objectives.

47:42.360 --> 47:46.860
So I kind of like how you have to juggle that a little bit and manage that is pretty cool.

47:46.860 --> 47:48.300
And that's only in the first couple of levels.

47:48.300 --> 47:50.900
Like I only can imagine how much harder this gets.

47:50.900 --> 47:56.720
And I have played a little bit of Dynasty Warriors and it is fucking Dynasty Warriors

47:56.720 --> 48:01.620
with a Zelda skin, but that's okay.

48:01.620 --> 48:05.180
Like there's probably a lot of people who haven't played Dynasty Warriors but probably

48:05.180 --> 48:09.920
will because it's Link and Zelda now and it's cool, I enjoy it.

48:09.920 --> 48:13.620
So yeah, Hyrule Warriors, I'm liking it so far.

48:13.620 --> 48:17.240
Let's check in again after another week and see if I've actually continued with it and

48:17.240 --> 48:18.240
played more.

48:18.600 --> 48:22.220
Based on the fact that this is the Definitive Edition, it sure seems like there is an awful

48:22.220 --> 48:23.580
lot to do.

48:23.580 --> 48:27.920
Like those two modes I named are only like two of like five or six modes that are in

48:27.920 --> 48:28.920
it.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.460
I mean, there's just crazy amounts of stuff to unlock and things like that.

48:31.460 --> 48:35.260
So go into our chat at live.vognetware.com.

48:35.260 --> 48:40.500
Vidpower says those blank warriors games, because I guess Fire Emblem has one too, are

48:40.500 --> 48:41.940
great stress relievers.

48:41.940 --> 48:42.940
Yes.

48:42.940 --> 48:47.740
Like I said, it's very satisfying to just chop through like 2000 monsters and you just

48:47.740 --> 48:48.940
feel like such a badass.

48:48.940 --> 48:50.320
So yeah, I'm a fan.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.180
I'm a fan of Hyrule Warriors so far.

48:52.180 --> 48:55.980
I'm almost a little sad I slept on it before but then again at the same time, I'm kind

48:55.980 --> 49:01.620
of glad that like this edition that I bought is like, this is all you need.

49:01.620 --> 49:03.340
It's the Definitive Edition.

49:03.340 --> 49:07.760
That is until, you know, it goes the way of like Super Street Fighter 2 and then we get

49:07.760 --> 49:15.280
like, it's Hyrule Warriors Turbo Championship Super Mega Definitive Collection.

49:15.280 --> 49:16.280
So we'll see.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.280
Hopefully not.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.260
Alright, that's it for my Game of the Week.

49:19.260 --> 49:24.120
Let's talk about some announcements of which I don't have an awful lot, but I will mention

49:24.120 --> 49:28.060
that we will not be here at the very last week in June.

49:28.060 --> 49:34.520
We will not be here June 24th, but we will be here June 17th for our 16th birthday.

49:34.520 --> 49:36.500
So who's going to be buying us a car?

49:36.500 --> 49:40.420
It's OLR's My Sweet Sixteen coming to you on June 17th.

49:40.420 --> 49:46.960
We need to watch the sweet 17th birthday comic extravaganza by Strongbad.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.440
I just hope there's a cake.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.720
That's all a person should get for the birthday cake.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.240
Should I get us a bunt cake?

49:52.240 --> 49:55.160
Or as I called it when I was a kid, a butt cake?

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
A butt cake.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
You know what?

49:57.160 --> 49:58.160
Any cake.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.620
Bakers can't be choosers.

49:59.620 --> 50:06.320
So when a cake is made for me, all I ask is that it's not a cake with like mayonnaise

50:06.320 --> 50:07.320
as frosting.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.320
Ice cream cake?

50:08.320 --> 50:09.320
Mmm.

50:09.320 --> 50:10.320
Ice cream cake.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.320
I can't eat ice cream anymore.

50:11.320 --> 50:12.320
Oh my God.

50:12.320 --> 50:13.920
Shane was just telling me, because Shane just had a birthday and he was telling me about

50:13.920 --> 50:19.240
a cake he got that had like banana ice cream in it and it was like graham cracker crust.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.480
Oh yeah, something for Shane.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.040
Oh, it sounded so good.

50:22.040 --> 50:23.040
Anyway.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.520
Because Christy gave him banana pocky and it's at my house.

50:25.520 --> 50:26.520
Oh, nice.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.520
So, all right.

50:27.520 --> 50:30.440
Anyway, uh, let's get into some other video game news.

50:30.440 --> 50:34.880
We have, it hasn't been a huge gaming news week, but there's a, there's a few things

50:34.880 --> 50:35.880
to talk about.

50:35.880 --> 50:36.880
Right?

50:36.880 --> 50:37.880
Logie?

50:37.880 --> 50:38.880
Yeah.

50:38.880 --> 50:39.880
The Vita might be coming back.

50:39.880 --> 50:40.880
No, no.

50:40.880 --> 50:41.880
That's not the case.

50:41.880 --> 50:42.880
Uh, no.

50:42.880 --> 50:49.720
Apparently there's a new chief of Sony Interactive Entertainment, uh, John Cadara, who's been

50:49.720 --> 50:54.960
kind of speaking his mind about the PlayStation brand and talking about, uh, the possibility

50:54.960 --> 51:01.800
of a portable system making a return and basically saying, you know, Hey, Sony portable gaming

51:01.800 --> 51:03.480
could come back.

51:03.480 --> 51:09.440
You know, if they remember that the console actually exists, um, basically put it in my

51:09.440 --> 51:14.360
opinion rather than separating portable gaming from consoles, it's necessary to continue

51:14.360 --> 51:18.900
thinking of portal gaming as one method to deliver more gaming experiences, exploring

51:18.900 --> 51:21.560
what our customers want from portable.

51:21.560 --> 51:24.920
Um, we want to think about many options.

51:24.920 --> 51:31.480
It sounds like they just want to copy the switch based on that comment, but we'll see.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.200
We'll see what happens.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.960
It would be neat to see something like the switch that's more powerful.

51:35.960 --> 51:38.200
Do you think Sony's going to just straight up copy the switch?

51:38.200 --> 51:41.160
I mean, we kind of got into this a little bit last week when we talked about, you know,

51:41.160 --> 51:46.760
the Vita dying basically officially, uh, the fact that Sony kind of like almost had it

51:46.760 --> 51:50.420
like with the Vita TV and the fact that, you know, you could pick something up and then

51:50.420 --> 51:51.420
play it on your TV.

51:51.420 --> 51:53.280
Like they, well, they kind of were really close.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.960
I don't think that the next system is going to be something like that because they talking

51:56.960 --> 52:03.360
that right now the leaked, I don't know if it's leaked, but like the, the specs or the

52:03.360 --> 52:08.120
thought was that it's going to be something that's based off the AMD Ryzen chip.

52:08.120 --> 52:12.280
So I don't think that would necessarily lend itself to a portable console cause I think,

52:12.280 --> 52:17.120
I mean they're pretty low powered, but it's, I don't think you can get it quite low enough

52:17.120 --> 52:19.480
to have good battery life.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.280
Well some folks will really be down for that.

52:21.280 --> 52:25.820
She Hulk in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says PlayStation and Xbox need to be able

52:25.820 --> 52:27.940
to take the console on the road like the switch.

52:27.940 --> 52:29.960
It is a no brainer.

52:29.960 --> 52:35.080
So I mean, but look at what Nintendo had to sacrifice in order to get the form factor

52:35.080 --> 52:36.080
and everything.

52:36.080 --> 52:40.200
You have to sacrifice some power to be able to get it that small and that portable.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.200
Fair enough.

52:41.200 --> 52:44.740
But you know, in a few more years, technology will have caught up quite a bit.

52:44.740 --> 52:49.960
You know, that, that, that switch consoles just as powerful as a PlayStation three or,

52:49.960 --> 52:50.960
you know, it's, it's lasted.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.400
It's actually a little more powerful than that, right?

52:53.400 --> 52:57.120
So you know, those guys can still pack a punch for being a little portable, you know, essentially

52:57.120 --> 52:58.120
a portable system.

52:58.120 --> 53:03.560
So yeah, you know, and how much, I mean, are we looking at with PlayStation five that every

53:03.560 --> 53:05.520
single game is going to be fully 4k?

53:05.520 --> 53:09.040
I mean, you think games are expensive to develop now?

53:09.040 --> 53:13.160
Like there's, there's gotta be a point where we can like, I almost feel like in some ways

53:13.160 --> 53:18.300
the PlayStation four was not the hugest step up from the PlayStation three.

53:18.300 --> 53:21.880
Like we were used to seeing like the one to the two and the two to the three were like

53:21.880 --> 53:22.880
big steps up.

53:22.880 --> 53:25.200
But the three to the four step was not as big.

53:25.200 --> 53:26.200
I mean, don't get me wrong.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.200
Duh.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.280
Of course you can tell the difference between PlayStation four and PlayStation three.

53:29.280 --> 53:35.080
But I mean, you know, I think that technology of what you can do on a screen, we're almost

53:35.080 --> 53:36.960
starting to plateau a little bit.

53:36.960 --> 53:37.960
Yeah.

53:37.960 --> 53:42.240
You know, and I know we've, we've, we've said this since the days of the Atari 2,600.

53:42.240 --> 53:45.400
Remember when the NES first came out when we were kids and it was like playing something

53:45.400 --> 53:49.520
like Super Mario brothers two was like, Oh my God, it's like an actual cartoon on my

53:49.520 --> 53:50.520
television.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.520
This is like a real cartoon, you know?

53:52.520 --> 53:54.040
And it's like, no, I don't think I ever said that.

53:54.040 --> 53:55.040
I did.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.000
I remember I was like, how much better can graphics get?

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
It's a fucking cartoon.

53:58.040 --> 54:01.280
I didn't say fucking when I was a kid, well, maybe I did, but it's like, it's a cartoon

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
on my television.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.440
Like how much better can we get than that?

54:03.440 --> 54:08.160
And then, you know, here we are now at PlayStation four, but it's like, you know, okay, we can

54:08.160 --> 54:13.320
go to full on four K 60 frame a second games, but you know how expensive those are going

54:13.320 --> 54:14.320
to be to make.

54:14.320 --> 54:18.680
Well, that's why I don't think necessarily it's going to be that it's going to, I mean,

54:18.680 --> 54:22.680
graphics will be one thing, but I think it's going to be more of how we interact with games,

54:22.680 --> 54:27.520
you know, pushing more of the augmented reality, the more haptics and that kind of stuff.

54:28.040 --> 54:33.040
Cause that, you know, you look at like a PlayStation VR, the graphics aren't that much better than,

54:33.040 --> 54:34.040
you know, most things.

54:34.040 --> 54:38.760
I mean, the displays aren't as good as like a, you know, a TV or something, but it's that

54:38.760 --> 54:40.520
immersion that you feel from it.

54:40.520 --> 54:43.520
You can't replicate that outside of VR.

54:43.520 --> 54:49.680
So I think once that becomes more mainstream, that's going to be the way things are going

54:49.680 --> 54:50.680
to go.

54:50.680 --> 54:56.500
Uh, looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell says, uh, I was the same way

54:56.500 --> 55:04.140
on the jump from PS3 to PS4 until I got a PS Pro on 4k PS3 and PS4 were both 1080p gaming.

55:04.140 --> 55:05.720
So that's why the jump didn't look as good.

55:05.720 --> 55:06.940
We didn't jump any resolution.

55:06.940 --> 55:10.180
Well, maybe not in my own house, but I've seen PlayStation 4 on 4k.

55:10.180 --> 55:11.180
I mean, don't get me wrong.

55:11.180 --> 55:12.580
Yes, it looks fucking great.

55:12.580 --> 55:18.780
But you know, again, like the PS3 was like already pretty fucking good, you know, and

55:18.780 --> 55:23.760
I don't expect that making every single game 4k is going to be, I mean, that just sounds

55:23.760 --> 55:27.080
like it's expensive unless, I don't know, maybe there's going to be ways to automate

55:27.080 --> 55:31.720
that more and maybe make it easier on the artists who do it, but it just seems like

55:31.720 --> 55:36.400
you think you wait a long time for games now, wait until they all have to be 4k and 120

55:36.400 --> 55:37.400
frames a second.

55:37.400 --> 55:38.960
Like it's just, it's going to be crazy.

55:38.960 --> 55:39.960
So I don't know.

55:39.960 --> 55:40.960
That's just my thought.

55:40.960 --> 55:46.360
Um, vidpower in chat says, I think the biggest graphical jump was from N64 to GameCube.

55:46.360 --> 55:50.360
Well, yeah, but that was also Nintendo's big jump from the cartridge format to the disc

55:50.360 --> 55:51.360
format.

55:51.360 --> 55:55.120
If you can wipe the Vaseline off the screen, you know, then yeah, anything looks great.

55:55.120 --> 55:58.600
Uh, dungeon buster says, I think it comes down mostly to the games.

55:58.600 --> 56:03.160
I can't imagine horizon zero dawn on the PS3 looking as it does or God of war.

56:03.160 --> 56:06.520
I don't have a PS4 pro, but both games look amazing to me regardless.

56:06.520 --> 56:09.840
Just just to be clear, cause I want to make sure I'm not coming off the wrong way.

56:09.840 --> 56:13.680
I'm not saying that the PS4 isn't noticeably better than the PlayStation three.

56:13.680 --> 56:14.680
Of course it is.

56:14.680 --> 56:20.480
I'm just saying that step, it doesn't feel like as huge of a step as it did from 1 to

56:20.480 --> 56:21.720
DVD to Blu Ray.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.800
It wasn't so, you know, noticeable.

56:24.800 --> 56:31.280
Well, it's noticeable, but it's not as noticeable as it was when we went from VHS to the right.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.280
That's for sure.

56:32.280 --> 56:33.280
Yeah.

56:33.280 --> 56:34.280
I'll give you that.

56:34.280 --> 56:35.280
I'll give you that.

56:35.280 --> 56:38.160
So anyway, um, those are just my thoughts on that.

56:38.160 --> 56:43.000
So um, w w do you think Sony is going to do something with the portable stuff or they

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
don't?

56:44.000 --> 56:46.800
I don't think it anytime soon.

56:46.800 --> 56:47.800
All right.

56:47.800 --> 56:54.240
Well, last week on the show, we talked about how, um, steam was planning to bring a mobile,

56:54.240 --> 56:57.240
uh, steam link basically to cell phones.

56:57.240 --> 57:00.360
We talked a little bit about this last week, how they were planning this for Android and

57:00.360 --> 57:01.360
iOS.

57:01.360 --> 57:05.840
Well, a little monkey wrench got thrown in the plans this week because Apple blocked

57:05.840 --> 57:08.960
steam's plan to extend the video games to iPhones.

57:08.960 --> 57:16.240
Apple blocked steam from being onto the stores, uh, not incredibly sure the why behind it

57:16.240 --> 57:19.680
because I think they got kind of a generic sort of email that was like, you know, it

57:19.680 --> 57:24.600
doesn't, uh, it doesn't gel with Apple policies basically.

57:24.600 --> 57:30.360
So people are kind of left to think, is it because the marketplace, like Apple wasn't

57:30.360 --> 57:34.080
okay with that, but apparently steam disabled the marketplace for that, like they saw that

57:34.080 --> 57:35.760
one coming and they disabled it.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.840
So apparently that's not the problem.

57:37.840 --> 57:41.820
Um, but maybe you're offering a platform that's going to compete with something that's a service

57:41.820 --> 57:43.440
that's already offered.

57:43.440 --> 57:49.480
So basically Apple TV, not Apple TV including, there's also the app store.

57:49.480 --> 57:53.760
Well but remember they disabled purchasing in the steam thing, so it wasn't going to

57:53.760 --> 57:56.480
be right, but it was still going to be a competitor.

57:56.480 --> 57:58.160
Yeah, so that's fine.

57:58.160 --> 58:00.480
Just disabled max support then out of steam.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.480
No.

58:01.480 --> 58:02.720
Oh, you think valve should just go to war?

58:02.720 --> 58:07.400
Hey, you want gaming on your, that's not going to happen because they actually have a very

58:07.400 --> 58:09.560
large number of user base that's, that's on Mac.

58:09.560 --> 58:10.560
Yeah.

58:10.560 --> 58:13.280
I was going to say, don't hurt the users that already bought the games and stuff.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.600
That would be shooting their profits.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.360
I'm all for petty Crocker.

58:17.360 --> 58:21.280
Don't get me wrong, but that may not be the best move to do there.

58:21.280 --> 58:27.480
But you know, but if they are planning on doing like a portal three or something, uh,

58:27.480 --> 58:31.760
if valve wanted to be petty, they could be like the Mac version will be out six weeks

58:31.760 --> 58:32.760
later.

58:32.760 --> 58:37.040
Oh, but maybe we could push it to get it out earlier if Apple could do this one little

58:37.040 --> 58:38.760
thing for us.

58:38.760 --> 58:39.760
But here's the thing.

58:39.760 --> 58:40.760
Yeah.

58:40.760 --> 58:42.640
And, and they don't negotiate with terrorists.

58:42.640 --> 58:44.840
You're saying here's the thing.

58:44.840 --> 58:48.440
I kind of don't think the whole phone thing was that big of a deal anyway.

58:48.440 --> 58:50.960
Like I know we were talking about it on the show last week.

58:50.960 --> 58:54.320
Like I was like, Oh, that's kind of neat, but like, would I really use it?

58:54.320 --> 58:59.280
Like how I would like to know the actual like numbers percentage wise of steam users that

58:59.280 --> 59:05.040
actually use a steam link, either the phone or cause I have one I'm like, and the problem

59:05.040 --> 59:10.120
is like, I've never wanted to just set it up to play on the TV and well, Android is

59:10.120 --> 59:11.640
going to have this app.

59:11.640 --> 59:19.120
So I think you already, yeah, I have it on my phone and I have it on my, um, my Android

59:19.120 --> 59:20.120
TV.

59:20.120 --> 59:22.640
So, but yet I've never used either one.

59:22.640 --> 59:23.640
I thought about it.

59:23.640 --> 59:24.760
I'm like, Oh, that'd be kind of cool.

59:24.760 --> 59:28.680
I used my steam link for like a month sparingly and then that's it.

59:28.680 --> 59:30.220
Like I haven't really used it since.

59:30.220 --> 59:33.920
So, but like I said on the show last week, like I'm not going to play civilization six

59:33.920 --> 59:34.960
on my phone.

59:34.960 --> 59:35.960
That's redonkulous.

59:35.960 --> 59:37.480
Like that's not, that's not going to be fun.

59:37.480 --> 59:42.200
It's not like playing that from the bed on my no button device phone.

59:42.200 --> 59:44.840
Like that's not going to be fun switch.

59:44.840 --> 59:45.840
That's fun.

59:45.840 --> 59:46.840
I can still play that embedded.

59:46.840 --> 59:51.560
It feels just like playing it on TV, but, um, maybe watching movies out of the steam

59:51.560 --> 59:52.560
marketplace or something.

59:52.560 --> 59:56.120
But how many of those do I really like to don't think about your phone necessarily.

59:56.120 --> 59:59.720
Think about like if you have a tablet, it's better because you can use as a screen prop

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.400
that Alan has an Android tablet.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:06.120
So he can whip out a Bluetooth controller and you can just play on it like a screen.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.120
Yeah.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.160
That'd be the point.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.400
If you have a computer that you can sit down in a comfy chair and just do the same shit,

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:16.240
but whatever, you know, it's flexibility and we didn't have to pay for it.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:21.080
Uh, bonds double six and chat talking about the whole petty stuff that our little fan

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:25.680
fic there, uh, bonds double six says when mommy and daddy fight, the kids suffer.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.680
It's true.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.880
We don't want, we don't want people to suffer cause they get in a fight.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.800
Um, let's see, uh, Brad from pod culture talking about the steam link says mine is collecting

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800
dust.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.440
Hate, hate, hate that damn controller.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.680
You can use like any Bluetooth controller with those things now or even like an Xbox

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.360
wire controller and stuff like that.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.960
I mean, um, I just haven't bothered to set it up yet or maybe it did and I just forgot

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.960
about it.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.400
I know I have it somewhere.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.920
It may be hooked up and I just completely forgot about it.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920
Yeah.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.620
So I, so I mean this is a surprising to hear.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.640
Maybe they'll work something out.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.640
I don't know.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.140
But at the same time, was I really going to use this anyway?

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.400
To be honest, probably not.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:09.880
Like now if I could use cellular data to like stream my steam stuff over, sell to my phone.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880
But how garbage is that?

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.960
I was like, yeah, that'd be terrible.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.700
Before y'all jump in there and chat going, that would look like shit, Rob.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.200
It's like, it's, that's kind of the joke.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.980
Like I know it's not going to look that great, but hey, you know what?

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:29.080
I remember a time when this show started that we were on dial up friendly radio and look

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.160
how far internet speeds have come in just that time.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.160
So you know what, there's going to come a time when cellular speeds, they're almost

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160
stable.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.160
I know, right?

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.600
Hey, you remember the Vita?

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.720
Remember how the Vita had a three G version?

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720
Yeah.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.440
Remember how you can remember then the coin, the phrase asynchronous multiplayer.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440
Yeah.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.440
Yeah.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.120
I'm trying to think of one Vita game that let me play over the three G connection coming

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.120
up short.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.040
Just it just didn't work so well anyway.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.040
There you go.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.000
Well anyway, if you have an Android device, uh, you could check out the steam app if,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.800
if you think it's something you'd benefit from.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.160
I mean, I don't know, again, I'm not going to be sitting there playing portal two on

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.160
my tablet.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.120
Pretty much any multiplayer game you play over three G is going to be asynchronous multiplayer.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.160
If I played more of those visual novel games, like, um, dream daddy, dream daddy, I could

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
play from the comfort of my bed or I guess, I guess I'm going to be playing in my bed.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.560
I'd have to be playing something a little more like coming out on top or something a

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.480
little more like a, you know, top shelf, if you know what I'm saying.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.480
All right.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:38.120
It clearly is going to have to be genital jousting.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.320
I was going to say, what about the bottom shelf?

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.080
Maybe that's what Apple's issue was with some of those adult games.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.840
No, because Apple is just being petty because they want a piece of that money.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.760
He could be a company has a right to stop anything that's going to be any type of competition

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.240
with services that they already offer.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.760
It's not, Microsoft has done it before in the past.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.980
We've seen other companies do the same things.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:03.980
It's really business.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:09.920
This is going to give ammunition to the anti Apple crowd and they're all idiots.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.240
I think people are free to make whatever choice they want, even if it's the wrong one.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.520
I think that's objective.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.320
And I think, I think you, I think you know better than that because like there's more

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.720
than one opinion.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.480
So anyone who hates anything just on principle alone is an idiot.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.320
Well, but when they ban certain things from things, that's, that's what it is.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.560
If someone's going to hate something, they're going to already hate it.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.080
There's no adding fuel to something that already exists.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.640
All right, let's move on.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.640
Let's change topics.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.760
I think you actually have the next story, Dark Sakura.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.960
I do.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.560
Um, so you know, e gaming is a thing.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.160
It's been, uh, e-sports has been big and bigger and growing and growing.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.360
So now the Special Olympics USA is going to host a video game tournament.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:04.040
Um, e-sports will definitely be a thing in, uh, the 2018 Special Olympics starting on

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040
July 2nd.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:11.100
Um, they're partnering with, uh, the Xbox division for, uh, the tournament.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.840
And so there will be teams that are competing in rounds of Forza, motor sports seven.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.560
Um, there will be, uh, the, the competitors have already been chosen.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.280
There were eight qualifier events that took place at different Microsoft stores.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:30.280
Um, speaking of biting on to things that other companies have done, um, and, uh, having,

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:36.560
uh, eight different, uh, teams that will consist of one athlete, um, with, and one without

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.000
an intellectual disability.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.080
So there'll be in teams, um, and basically they're, they're like, you know, since so

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:49.740
many of their special athletes are avid gamers, this gives them the ability to have another

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.260
form to compete in.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.900
So this website with the story has an autoplay videos.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.460
No, I can't read the story while you're talking about it.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.460
Sorry about that.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.180
Well, I, I think it's cool.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.180
Yeah.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.740
No, it's really cool to see, you know, we've kind of wondered more and more when the Olympics

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:08.660
we're going to acknowledge, you know, video gaming as, you know, something that is a part

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.660
of it.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:14.700
And the Special Olympics are the Olympics, you know, so, um, actually no, actually no,

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:18.340
they are Paralympics is the Olympics, right?

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.820
Special Olympics is a separate organization, but even so, the fact that they recognize

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:28.140
this as yet another forum, you know, and I think that it's great that the teams are going

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.260
to be, you know, one with an intellectual disability versus one with, you know, with

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:37.220
a team of people with both levels of disability.

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.500
And I think it's going to be pretty amazing.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.740
I'm glad that they're doing it and hopefully they'll catch on more and more.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:49.340
They'll maybe have more, like maybe just a special, you know, X games or something.

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.180
Not X games, but you know what I mean?

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.180
Sure.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.420
Um, you know, and it's, we've had a lot of great stories in the past couple of weeks

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:58.180
about, you know, more and more accessibility for, uh, gamers.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.280
Just last week we had the story about the Xbox controller that is designed with the,

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.220
you know, different able people in mind.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.220
So I think that's really cool.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.220
So, all right.

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.860
Um, let's move on.

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:08.860
Loki.

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.860
All right.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:15.780
So we talked a little bit last week how Valve was kind of coming down on some of these visual

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:19.840
novel developers saying that their games are too risky or whatever, and then they kind

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.460
of walked it back a little bit.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:28.180
Well, you know, just to be on the safe side, um, good old games is actually finding, um,

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.160
a lot of these publishers coming over their way.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:37.580
So um, you know, with that being that, you know, good old games isn't necessarily cracking

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:42.900
down on the content like that Steam is, they basically put it, you know, this opportunity

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.860
couldn't have come at a better time.

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:50.580
Um, we've been speaking with GOG prior to the recent events about adding visual novels

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:56.020
as a genre to their retail platform, and with Valve now threatening the livelihoods of visual

01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:02.000
novel developers everywhere, it's a huge relief to see GOG opening their doors to these games.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.680
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at bognetwork.com,

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.560
use the passphrase, dungeon.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560
So that's pretty awesome.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:19.280
And then Steam has now proven that it's growing unreliable, or it's growing unreliable for

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.360
small and independent developers.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:27.120
So we are very grateful to have the next biggest retailer in the PC market welcoming visual

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.240
novels with open arms and an eye for quality.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.160
Okay, but you know, there's that like petty part of me that's like, oh, so this is about

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.240
how good old games is willing to take the gaming garbage that Steam doesn't want to

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.240
have.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.800
But I wouldn't necessarily call it garbage, though, like these games, it's not necessarily

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.600
that it's garbage is a harsh word.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.600
I'm sorry.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:49.600
Because let's be honest, like, Steam does have a lot of actual like, it would be considered

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.840
like shovelware bullshit, right?

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.400
That's where I was going to tie it together, but yes, okay.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:02.240
So like, I have a problem with steam, saying, Oh, yeah, we want to curate this.

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:08.280
But not this other thing, this huge mile, like, pile of bullshit behind us, we're gonna

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.520
focus on this piece of it.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:15.600
But like all these other games that don't even function properly.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.720
Fuck that, you know, that's my problem.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.700
It's like either gonna, you know, you're there to curate all of this or you're not are these

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.640
visual novels with titties?

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.640
Like is that because this plays into something that came up with steam last week, about how

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:33.480
they're cracking down on anime titties, um, some of them know that necessarily and to

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.600
be honest, like a lot of the ones that are released on Steam are censored.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.080
But you can get an uncensored patch like through the developers website and play it like however

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.080
you want it.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.320
But I don't I think that they're well aware if that was the issue that they build a sensor

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.780
this stuff, you know, for that marketplace, but I don't think that's the issue here.

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:58.500
It's they're just like, oh, well, all visual novels are the blame, you know, we're just

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.420
gonna blame all of them instead of actually visual novels are to blame for most of gaming's

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.420
problems.

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:07.220
Just I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.220
So I don't know.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.420
I mean, whatever.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.420
You know what?

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.420
Who cares?

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.900
Like, I don't see the problem with it.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:21.780
If that's something that you want to purchase, cool, but as long as it functions as a game,

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.780
then that's fine.

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:27.180
Like these things that literally like they don't have the executable for the game in

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:31.820
the download, you know, come on, maybe maybe you should pay attention to that shit and

01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:36.040
fix that part, because that's what's making discoverability so hard is all this crap that's

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040
on there.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.660
Not, oh, hey, there's tons of visual novels.

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.340
But to be fair, there are a lot of visual novels that appear in the front page as well.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:45.660
You know, and people do tend to kind of stay within one ecosystem.

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:50.020
I mean, I'm sure there's some that own a few games on Steam, a few games on GOG, a few

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:53.340
games on HIO, you know, and the different stuff that's out there.

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:56.640
But I think there's probably a lot of people that kind of tend to stay within one ecosystem.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:01.940
So if GOG sees this opportunity to lure a fandom with visual novels, then, you know,

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:06.620
if they kind of get in the GOG universe, which GOG is a fine platform, you know, it has a

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:11.620
lot of the same things that, you know, Steam offers and some different stuff, too, especially

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:15.860
when it comes to the classic games, but, you know, they can kind of get people in their

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:19.020
ecosystem and then maybe the games that they want to buy that aren't just visual novels,

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.780
they're going to stick with GOG and it kind of gets more people there to compete with

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.260
Steam maybe a little more.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.260
Yeah.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.260
Yeah.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:27.260
Interesting.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.260
Anyway.

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.260
All right.

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.220
Well, let's move on and talk about programming your own game.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.940
Maybe you want to write your own visual novel game.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:39.160
Well, you soon can do that on the Nintendo Switch, thanks to an app called PucciCon Smile

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.820
Basic.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.820
This is a coding app.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:46.580
It was actually on the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U, although I must confess, I'd never

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.620
heard of it.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:52.180
But Smile Basic was also known as Petite Computer, I think was another name for this software.

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:53.700
That I think was on the 3DS maybe?

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.700
It was.

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.020
It was on the 3DS and the Wii U.

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:59.580
It allows you to make games by coding in basic.

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:05.100
So you know, your whole Commodore 64 programming knowledge, your Apple IIe programming and

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.900
all that can come back.

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.340
So here, I'm going to write a sample program in basic.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.340
Here we go.

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:11.340
Ready?

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:16.700
10, print, quote, OLR rules, end quote, enter.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.340
20, go to 10, run.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.340
There you go.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.500
I wrote a basic program live on air.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.020
And that's the type of thing you can actually...

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.300
Yeah, they have Smile Basic for the 3DS available now for 10 bucks.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.000
Yeah, so this is something that's going to be coming to the Switch.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.540
So it's not just stuff you can do portable, but you can also have things you can do on

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:37.620
the TV.

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:42.360
No word yet if you are able to transfer the save files.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.060
Because I would think like, well, what if I write a really awesome program?

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.860
What if I want to send that to a friend?

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.940
Or is it going to have to be like the old school days where you're going to have to

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.460
type it out of the back of a magazine?

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:58.820
Because maybe that's going to be your only option for a petite computer.

01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:59.820
Who knows?

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:00.820
So...

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.820
All right.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.060
Anyway, I'm looking forward to that.

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.060
I think that's really cool.

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:08.460
I had no idea that was the thing on 3DS and Wii U, but I know a lot of us missed some

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:09.460
Wii U stuff.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.780
So it's all getting a second chance over on the Switch.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:16.420
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to the classic game in a few stories?

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.700
I have a thingy.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.700
Not that kind of thingy.

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.700
Do you?

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.700
All right.

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.700
It's a personal thing.

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:27.300
Basically, there is a company that's receiving some backlash.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:33.960
And honestly, I kind of think that it's well-deserved backlash because they are doing a game called

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.340
Active Shooter that takes place during a school shooting.

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:43.280
You play as either the SWAT team or as an active shooter in a school setting with potential

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.700
to play as a civilian as well.

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:52.500
You know, I can see where people right now are like, this is not something I'd like to

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.500
be playing.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:54.500
I had one.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.500
Okay.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.500
I'm sorry.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.500
I'm just saying.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.540
The company putting it out is called Revived Games.

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:06.940
And basically, they put a disclaimer on there saying that it is just a simulation, not to

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.660
be taken seriously.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.540
If you feel that you might hurt people, call 911, blah, blah, blah.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:17.060
But the thing is, and what Allison says, it doesn't promote any sort of violence.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.440
The thing is that with the game coming out when we have had, what is it, like 19 school

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.420
shootings to date?

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:29.240
And how many just, like there was that story about the four-year-old that shot his two-year-old

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.580
brother because he thought it was a fucking toy gun because his idiot asshole parents

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:37.460
didn't put their damn gun with the safety on and a fucking gun locker.

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.460
Sorry, I'm a little pissed off by that.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:45.060
And you have historically on the show been a little bit of a, well, like you've said

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.380
you want a gun.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.380
You've said that here on the show.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.380
I was not at all anti-gun.

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.380
Right.

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.140
As long as you're fucking responsible with it.

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.340
Yes.

01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:57.960
But I don't believe anyone needs a fucking assault weapon.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:03.720
I don't think that anyone needs any semi-automatic or fully automatic weapons at all.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.840
There's only one purpose for a military gun and that is to kill a human.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.200
You don't need it to go hunting.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.360
You will destroy that deer and the meat will be shitty.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.840
What if I can't aim very well and you know, any quantity over quality.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.840
Take up a new hobby.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.480
Then you know what the fuck they should do is that they should make sure that anyone

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.480
who buys a gun goes through fucking training.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.320
Like when you buy a car.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:30.520
You could run over a shitload of people with a car, but no, we are required to be licensed

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.600
drivers who have gone through a year at least of training for it.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.880
If you drive drunk, they take that right away.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.880
Precisely.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.760
Guns should have the same, you know, thing on it.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.680
Anyway, not to, not to get too far from the story, but, but anyway, but to do a game like

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:52.200
this when this is such a big problem right now is highly insensitive at the best.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:59.280
It's insensitive and you know, and it's in steam's, um, uh, PMP not to release any game

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:06.880
with the, um, uh, purpose to, to, you know, gain attention by shock value, which is kind

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.880
of what this is.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.440
But you know, you know, the whole, like my perspective is that video games are art, right?

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.440
Art is commentary.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.440
Shit isn't art.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.680
It's a bad game.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.680
I let you finish.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.880
Can I finish?

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.300
So my whole thing is I'm not saying I'm not defending the game by any means, but could

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:28.340
this be that somebody feels the need to put this out there because we've become so desensitized

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.900
to what's happening in the culture.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:35.340
Like, you know, all these shootings have happened, you know, ever since Sandy Hook, Vegas, all

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:36.340
this stuff.

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:38.740
And literally nothing has been done.

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:39.740
Nothing.

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.380
Thoughts and prayers ain't shit.

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:43.020
Nothing has been done.

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:47.240
And you know, no matter, no matter what your stance is on gun laws and all that stuff,

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.160
my whole thing is that they haven't even tried anything.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160
Nothing has been done.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.680
I thought everybody agreed on this whole bump stock thing.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.680
Nothing has been done.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.120
Bump stocks are nothing anyway.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.960
They're not legal in those states.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.960
Yeah.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960
But nothing has been done.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:07.760
So in a way, like when I first heard about this, I was like, is this maybe like a commentary

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.400
that like, well, since this is commonplace in our culture anyway, let's just make a game

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.480
about it.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.800
You know, I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's shock value and all that.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.040
It's just, you know, doing it because it can, but you know, there is a part of me that says

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.240
maybe there is maybe art is the wrong word.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.160
Maybe there is an expression in here, but there's nothing on their website talking about

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.800
it being a political commentary.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.640
Well then if they were going to put in, I gave them too much credit, I guess if they

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:40.080
were going to release this as some kind of commentary, then they should have made it

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.880
very clear on their website.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.560
This is so that you can see what it's like to be in an active shooter situation when

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.920
your life is in danger.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.920
This is so you can see what we accept as the norm in our society.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:00.360
And if they were going to do it, it should only be from the civilian point of view.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.640
And it should be something with no control.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.280
You can't control anything in the game around you.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.240
Some people are going to be so, but I mean, at the same time, again, we have done nothing

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.240
about it.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.080
And like, how are you going to, how are you going to wake, wake people the fuck up to

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.160
do something about what's going on here?

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.720
Wait till it's one of their kids.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:24.040
It's a congressman was shot at a baseball.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040
Am I not?

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040
Nothing that happened.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.040
There was like a baseball thing.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040
Yeah.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.040
Like a congressman got shot.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.160
Nothing has still been done.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.600
Or the lady, the congresswoman who was under an assassination attempt, Arizona lady.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:41.160
You know, the thing that the thing is is that, and honestly enough, it really is due to the

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.160
NRA.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.520
The NRA was a tiny little organization in the 70s and started using the Second Amendment

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:53.400
and warping the words there of to make, to grow themselves in popularity and money.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.440
And now they're as big as they are.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.280
And they have married this idea with guns and patriotism.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:06.640
And so it's why we have to even look at something stupid like this and go, wow, that's insensitive

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.320
because we live in a country where people don't do jack shit unless someone's lining

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.000
their pocket to do jack shit.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.160
Guys, you don't chat at live.voggenover.com says, nah, the game is trash and the devs

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.160
are trash.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.600
A race leader says, can we just overthrow the government and just install dark soccer

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.600
and Rob Roberts?

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.360
You need to make sure that you say in writing that that was a joke.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.280
I didn't hear my name in there.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.280
Yeah.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.280
Do put, that was a joke.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.640
You'll be secretary of state.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.760
Also, you have to want the job and no thanks.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:39.920
No, I don't want to lead this shit hole unless I'm like Khaleesi because seriously, if I

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.120
had my way, if I had my way, and again, this is probably never going to happen and I'm

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.600
not actively seeking it.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.600
Commentary.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.600
This is commentary.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.600
This is commentary.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.720
Iceland had a revolution about two years ago.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.640
They overthrew their own government and rewrote their fucking government.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.240
America's too fucking big to do this peacefully.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.240
They did it peacefully on top of that.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.640
And I think that's important to say, yes.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:06.920
And in their entire, I think like last 50 years, there've been one police shooting of

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:14.360
any one and it was an active gunman situation and the cop was traumatic, traumatized by

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.360
it.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:24.800
So I'm saying that America really is too big to govern, but nobody wants to do anything

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.280
differently because as long as they're comfortable and people have their distractions, fucking

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.500
go read 1984 and read Brave New World.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.360
Both of these things were foretold.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.760
Also commentary of its time.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.760
Yeah.

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:38.760
Yeah.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.760
So.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:40.760
All right.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.760
Anyway, tricky subject.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.760
I know.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:47.080
But you know, that's again, I think that's kind of where people, whether it be for shock

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:51.320
value because they're trash, because they're, they think it's art, whatever it is, you know,

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.880
I think that's where I'd be the queen and have a parliament or yes, I would, I would

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.880
be queen.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.880
Liz seems to be doing okay.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.880
Huh?

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.880
Liz seems to be doing okay.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.880
Right.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.880
You know, her last corgi died.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.880
Oh, that's.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Well, she was breeding them all from her very first corgi, um, but she didn't want anyone

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.160
but her to handle her own corgis.

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.880
And so she let the last one die out.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.880
All right.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.640
Anyway, we got to move on just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.560
And then the classic game, we'll go back to simpler times of the classic game of the week,

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.560
but first Loki.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.920
All right.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:27.160
So, um, there's a new switch bundle that's available in Japan.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.320
Now what makes us different is it's cheaper.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:35.960
It's only 26,978 yen or about $246.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.920
But it's missing a few things.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.580
So what it's missing is of course, uh, the dock.

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:52.520
It's missing the power supply and I believe, oh, and then of course the, uh, joy con grip

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:58.540
that you would plug everything together and apparently, um, an HDMI cable.

01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:00.880
So it doesn't include any of those.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.900
The um, so what it does come with is the switch console.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.540
You get two joy cons and then the little, uh, straps that go with it.

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:14.180
So there's no way to charge this thing unless you buy a USB three charger and there's definitely

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.280
no way to dock it cause you're in need of dock.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:23.380
What I don't get though about this whole thing is the standard set actually is only 32,378

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.160
yen or $295.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.960
So you really only saving about 50 bucks on it.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.480
But the costs to replace all the items that are missing are more than $50.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.680
So why the fuck would you do that?

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.840
It seems like a really terrible idea.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:37.840
Yeah.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.360
I, I mean I can understand why they might want to put the options out there and so forth,

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:46.880
especially when there's so much more like portable gaming in Japan, you know, because

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:51.820
again, the Vita is actually still successful there gaming does so well, but yeah, I would,

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:55.480
I would hope people might have like, I would think the only way like I could see this is

01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:00.500
if they did include an AC adapter and then it could be like, Oh, this is like for like

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:01.500
your siblings.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:06.380
So you have one doc in the house, I would say multiple kids in the house that, you know,

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:11.020
that way, you know, you can do that, but still it's nice to have the doc anyways to charge

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020
the thing.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:17.760
I mean, I, I, the doc really shouldn't cost $90 or whatever it is that ridiculous amount

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.480
of money for this piece of plastic and tiny little bit of hardware.

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.920
I just, I think it's stupid, but whatever.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:27.500
It's not over here, so I'm not worried about it, but it is kind of annoying that they didn't

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:31.280
include like a lot of things that you kind of need at the very least.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.920
I think they should have put a power supply in there, but after all, they didn't do they

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.480
sell three DS without power supply.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.960
Oh yeah, they still do.

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960
Yeah.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.280
Cause there's so many power supplies already out there and there's third party ones and

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.280
all that stuff too.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:48.420
And if I'm not mistaken, uh, the, the switch just charges on USB-C it does so, but the

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:52.880
charger that comes with though charges it much faster than like an average phone charger.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.680
And those charters are still pretty expensive and yeah, I get it.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.520
You have charters for your phones and stuff, but I don't know.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.360
It's just, it seems annoying.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:08.240
Just spend the extra money and then that we don't have to worry about missing this stuff,

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.240
I guess.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.240
All right, well, uh, before we get into the classic game of the week this week and a game

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.980
that actually happened, let's talk about a game that didn't happen.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:20.520
And it's, it's really sad because this would have been a sequel to final fantasy tactics,

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.680
which I mean, God, so many people love that game and they've continued to make final fantasy

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.360
tactics like what they had, the game boy advanced one.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360
Right.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.040
And then they had, I think it's been on mobile at some point.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:34.640
Um, if you play final fantasy 14, there's like a whole quest line now where they actually

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.800
have Ramza in it, you know, like they, they, or it's, I think it's, it's a descendant of

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:42.800
the original Rams or something, but anyway, I don't know how it all plays together.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:43.800
That story.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.400
I just, I just liked the shiny things.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.280
But anyway, people love their fall fantasy tactics and it was, it was really such a,

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.400
such a great game of the PlayStation one era.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.920
Um, so whatever, how, why didn't they just do like another final fantasy tactics advance?

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:01.040
Well, they were going to, uh, director Yasumi Matsuno said that there was a full sequel

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:05.400
plan for the original PlayStation and it was called final fantasy tactics two.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:10.420
Uh, this was a plan project and it even has assets and some of those assets have hit the

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.200
internet this week and you can actually see, but unfortunately it didn't happen because

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.480
they weren't sure if they should outsource the game, which happens a lot.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:21.120
I don't know if you guys know, but games get outsourced to other companies to do the art

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120
and things like that.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.280
Uh, or you know, if they should have kept it in house also, they were going from a swap

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:33.320
from a 3d project to like a 2d hexagon thing that was going to be the big twist is that

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.320
this was going to be a hexagon.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:39.160
It's kind of like when a sieve sieve five went to sieve six and then now it's on a hexagon

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.600
grid or wait, was that sooner than that?

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.080
I'm, Oh my God.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.080
It's been a long time.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.080
You guys.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.280
Sieve three to sieve four went from square to hexagon.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.760
But anyway, it changed a lot.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:53.960
Um, so the project did ultimately get canceled.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.960
Unfortunately.

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:59.800
Um, don't know why square just didn't try to do something cause this game was so popular,

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.080
but it's probably too late now.

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.080
I don't know.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.080
Let me ask that before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.920
Is it too late to do a final fantasy tactics?

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.920
Nope.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:09.920
Never too late.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:15.040
I totally even, and you wouldn't call it just a, well, it's like Castlevania, but you know,

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:21.200
you wouldn't call it, I didn't, I don't care for tactics games and I wouldn't mind a sequel.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.920
I mean, I'm not going to play it, but yeah, that's the thing.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.820
I don't play a lot of tactical games, but I'd play final fantasy tactics and it was

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:32.200
something about the job classes in that game were so well done and maybe because it did

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.480
have those ties to, you know, the classic final fantasy world and stuff.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.320
That's part of what made it really cool.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.320
I don't know.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320
So, all right.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.920
Anyhow, well, let's take a trip down memory lane and check out a different classic game

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:50.040
because every week on this show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:55.840
that she thinks, Hey, brats, you should be checking this shit out.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.160
Check it out or, or else it's the classic game of the week.

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.840
Dark Sakura stepped into the gaming vault to find a game for you guys to play this week.

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.840
Dark Sakura.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.480
I wonder if this is my first DS game.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480
I'm not sure.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.480
Maybe not.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.480
It might.

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.480
It very well might be.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:20.040
The World Ends With You, which came out in, uh, uh, July 27th, 2007.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:24.040
Well, I'll tell you what, it's a great first 3DS game if it is.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.200
In the US it came out in April, 2008.

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:33.760
So here, 10 year old game, um, it is an action, uh, role play game, uh, with urban fantasy

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.760
elements.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.160
It was done by Square Enix and Jupiter for the Nintendo DS.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:47.200
It is set in Shibuya, um, and it is, uh, an art style that's inspired by Shibuya and

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.600
its, uh, local culture.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.360
And it was also inspired by another game that Jupiter developed, Kingdom Hearts Chain of

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360
Memories.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:03.200
Um, you play as, uh, a character named Neku Sakuraba, um, and, uh, all of his friends,

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:09.040
they are, though, forced to participate in a game that's going to decide their own fate.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:15.960
And it has, um, a very unique battle system that really uses the Nintendo DS to its best

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.720
capability, including their combat that takes place on both of the screens, and certain

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.160
attacks that are used with certain motions on the touch screen or by shouting into the

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160
microphone.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:30.800
Um, and of course, pop culture of, you know, of the day and age really play heavily into

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800
the game.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:39.000
Um, it has a great soundtrack, wonderful graphics, the gameplay is absolutely stunning, and of

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:47.600
course, um, the, uh, it had its own manga development as well, um, by, uh, Ishido Amano,

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.000
who was the, uh, writer and artist of the Kingdom Hearts manga.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Um, I think we're already getting somebody saying something in the chat room.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Oh, it's, uh, Raginator saying something that has nothing to do with the article.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.200
Um, anyway.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.200
Um, so...

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.200
And I don't think I said that, anyway.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.200
Yeah.

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.200
I got my values.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:16.600
Um, anyway, you have, um, like, uh, the real ground, which is normal life, and then you

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.400
have the underground, which is the alternate plane of existence.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:28.720
Um, so the ones who are, are, I guess, the chosen dead go there and they play the Reaper's

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:35.120
Game, so they offer up a treasured possession to the game, and then they can, uh, you know,

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.520
basically play for it and can get brought back to life or transcend into a higher form

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520
of existence.

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.520
If you go higher, you become a reaper who are the opponents in future games, so it just

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.520
really goes through and through and through.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:53.120
Um, and of course, if you are in the underground, you are, uh, invisible to people in the real

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.920
ground, vice versa.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.520
You send messages and you get your assignments through, like, your cell phone or you get

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:08.120
something imprinted on your hand, and, um, it just is, it's kind of a really neat, surrealist

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:11.320
kind of, you know, scenario in here.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.320
Um, but it was, it's a really, really neat game.

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:21.320
Um, it has just a lot of elements to it, and it was, uh, I mean, basically for the, the

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.020
game is an action roleplay game, it's divided into three chapters that are based on the

01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:31.220
three weeks that Neku is playing the Reaper's Game, um, and then each chapter is done by

01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:37.520
day of the week, so, uh, it's just a really, really compelling game, I think.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:44.720
Um, of course, you also, uh, can collect, uh, pins called psych pins that give you powers

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:49.320
while you're wearing them, and they're used for, uh, combat and different abilities in

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.320
combat.

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:58.020
So, um, like I said, it was developed by, uh, um, the same team that made, um, the Kingdom

01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:02.920
Hearts series with input from Jupiter, the company that developed Kingdom Hearts Chain

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:08.820
of Memories, and, uh, it's been, I think, a good solid two years in development, and

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:13.820
they wanted it to be a game that could only be played on the DS, which, I mean, as you

01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:17.620
can see, for anyone who's played it, as you can see from the combat, yeah, it is specific

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.620
to that.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.220
The soundtrack is really good.

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:27.320
It was, uh, composed, uh, by, um, Takeharu Ishimoto, who, um, does music from across

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.020
various, uh, disciplines.

01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:34.620
You've got rock, you have electronica, you've got hip-hop, it's just to fit the different,

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:43.620
you know, types of moods of living in Shibuya, and then, um, uh, the song in the end credits,

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:48.620
Lullaby For You, was done by, uh, a pop artist, uh, Jungri.

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:54.620
Um, the different artists in there, there's, like, uh, really, there's just a bunch of,

01:30:54.620 --> 01:31:00.620
you know, uh, artists that are too many for me to really name, um, and they also used,

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:07.620
um, the, uh, Kyouseshu Soundstreamer for the compression, which is normally used for voice-overs,

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:14.620
but it's to make the, the songs fit on the game media while still having full, you know,

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:16.620
the full motion cutscenes and everything.

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:20.620
Um, well, I mean, they replaced the full motion with, like, flash style animations, so it's

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:24.620
supposed to have a high clarity and a really striking style.

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:30.620
Um, there also was The World Ends With You solo remix that was released on iOS, um, in

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:38.620
August 2012 and on Android on, uh, June 2014, and it's basically the same game, just, you

01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:41.620
know, modified the combat for single screen.

01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:47.620
Um, it also redid all the graphics in, uh, high-def sprites, and it's optimized to use

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.620
the retina display on iOS devices.

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:54.620
So, it was taken out for a short version because it stopped working with iOS 8, but now it

01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:57.620
is back in the App Store as of 2015.

01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:03.620
And then on the Switch, The World Ends With You final remix was announced in January 2018

01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:05.620
to be released this year.

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:11.620
It is a Switch, uh, Switch release that allows you to use the Joy-Con in addition to a touchscreen,

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:14.620
and it has new scenarios to be added into the game.

01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:18.620
Um, so, it got really, really great reviews.

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:25.620
Um, the first shipment of the game sold out, and just was one of the, I'd say, best sellers

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:28.620
for the DS, you know, when it came out.

01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:34.620
So, still widely loved, widely played, um, even ten years later.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.620
So, there's the game.

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:37.620
The World Ends With You.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.620
Alright, great pick.

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:41.620
Uh, it's one of those games that you kind of go, wait, this shit's ten years old?

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.620
Oh my gosh.

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.620
Eleven, well, eleven technically.

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.620
Yeah, so there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:49.620
The World Ends With You.

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.620
Check that out on the DS or pretty soon on the Switch, or on the mobile devices as, uh,

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.620
Dark Soccer just explained to you.

01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:58.620
So, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere.

01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:01.620
We've got plenty more OLR to come, including the rapid-fire news.

01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:06.620
Uh, maybe your emails, although we're having email bag problems, but we'll try to fix that.

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:08.620
And then, uh, more news, including, ooh, Lego stuff.

01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:09.620
We'll get into that.

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:14.620
So, uh, all that and more when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:23.620
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:30.620
Live tonight, episode number 732 of our show for this May 27th, 2018, already in progress.

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:33.620
So, um, you know, it is Memorial Day weekend here in the States.

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:39.620
Uh, a big, uh, thank you and, uh, um, memorial to, uh, those who have, uh, given the ultimate sacrifice

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:45.620
so that, uh, we can continue to be free enough to do this show weeks on Sunday nights for you guys.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.620
So, let's not forget what the long weekend is about.

01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:52.620
Uh, also, I thought, uh, maybe we could take this opportunity to, uh, give you some updates on our privacy policy

01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.620
since that's all the rage right now. No, I'm just kidding. We do.

01:33:54.620 --> 01:34:00.620
What privacy policy? We don't, I mean, you sign up for accounts at VOG, but we don't really...

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:03.620
If you show us your pussies, we will post those pictures on the internet.

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:05.620
What? You mean cats. You mean cats.

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.620
Pussy cats.

01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:09.620
She says that because she had Mr. Smoosh in her lap just a minute ago.

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.620
Did you get some pictures of Mr. Smoosh?

01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.620
No, he got Wrigley.

01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:16.620
Ah, yeah, he did. Sometimes he doesn't like to be, you know, that whole constricted thing, so.

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:17.620
But he likes...

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.620
And he did give me snuggles.

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:20.620
He likes you and I told you why he likes women.

01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.620
Because boobs.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.620
Because boobs. He's like, he's a ladies man.

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:26.620
Okay, so, get this conversation I had with my mom.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.620
Okay.

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:31.620
She's like, how much weight you lose? I said, 87 pounds.

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:35.620
She's like, you lose any boob? No.

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:36.620
Just one boob.

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:41.620
Well, no, because a lot of times when women lose weight, they also lose boob size.

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.620
Sure. Sure.

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:48.620
I was like, no, I still have my shelf and the cats aren't complaining, so I was thinking of Mr. Smoosh.

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:53.620
And she's like, I don't even know what that means, but I'm mad.

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.620
So, whatever.

01:34:54.620 --> 01:35:00.620
Well, at least she didn't say, I can see your dirty pillows.

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.620
That's a different reference.

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:02.620
Yes, it is.

01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:05.620
They're all gonna laugh at you.

01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.620
They're breasts, mother.

01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:13.620
Anyway, I think that's my life goal is to star in a Carrie remake.

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.620
Yes, as a high schooler. I would still be a high schooler.

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:19.620
I actually see that second Carrie thing.

01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.620
Oh, the one with Julia Moore?

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.620
It was actually not too terrible.

01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:28.620
But then I saw the one that they were going to spin off into a Carrie TV series.

01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.620
Oh, wasn't there a Carrie musical too?

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:37.620
I don't know, but I watched the one that was like the TV version and it actually was pretty good.

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:40.620
And I kind of dug the ending to it. I would have watched a series based on that.

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:42.620
And then there was Drew Carey.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.620
No, that's different.

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.620
You know what I would like?

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:51.620
A sequel to Firestarter with Drew Barrymore now all grown up.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.620
Wouldn't that be some shit?

01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:54.620
Careful what you wish for.

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:57.620
I mean, reinventions of shit from the past is like all the rage.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:04.620
I can't believe Charmed is coming back and it's not like it's not Shannon Doherty or any of those people.

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:09.620
Well, I mean, that's cool for diversity and all, but like Charmed hasn't been gone that long.

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.620
Well, they're also bringing back Sabrina.

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:18.620
But if I watch the new Sabrina, I haven't watched any of Riverdale, but I might have how many seasons is it?

01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:19.620
Just two now.

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.620
I could probably catch up to that.

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:24.620
But I'm also like behind three seasons on Supernatural.

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.620
Can we less funny and more serious now or?

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.620
Oh, yeah, it's not going to be like that.

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.620
I don't mind because I would.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:35.620
Well, and there's now the way we're daughters is coming out the spinoff of Supernatural,

01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:39.620
which makes me mad because I would have wanted to spin off with Joe and her mama.

01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.620
But no, they had to kill them.

01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.620
Well, I imagine they got to be looking at ending Supernatural.

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:46.620
I mean, that's just been on over 10 years, hasn't it?

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:48.620
They're on season 11, I think just finished.

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:52.620
See, I think I mean, I don't know. Law and Order went for 20.

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:55.620
But I mean, I guess Supernatural has its fan base.

01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.620
Jared's still pretty and so is his wife.

01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:00.620
That's like the couple I have a crush, a couple crush on.

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:03.620
Oh, 13 just finished.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.620
13 just finished. Oh, my God. They're saying season 13, a Supernatural just finished.

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.620
You want to know what's funny thing about Supernatural?

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:11.620
It was supposed to end after the fifth season.

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:14.620
The original writer wrote through five seasons.

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:19.620
The story wrapped up in season five, which is why season six was kind of weird.

01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.620
Wasn't that kind of like Buffy was kind of like.

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:29.620
Yeah, well, I'm glad they ended Buffy after season seven, because even season seven was just kind of crap, except for the musical episode for the musical.

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:33.620
Well, that and I finally got my Buffy Spike action and I was pretty happy.

01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:37.620
As that says, Supernatural is the only show that survived the WB.

01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:41.620
That's right. Oh, my God. No, America's Top Model is still going to.

01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:43.620
Oh, no, wait, was that UPN show?

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:44.620
I don't know.

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:46.620
But America's Top Model is still going.

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:52.620
Tyra Banks is back as I'm waiting for the inevitable because Top Model is now a VH1 show.

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:56.620
And now it's crazy because Drag Race kind of started like that.

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.620
America's Top Drag Race.

01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:00.620
Well, Drag Race started as like a spoof of Top Model.

01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:05.620
And now, in some ways, it's almost more in the pop culture lexicon than Top Model.

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:11.620
So, you know, we did have Raja doing Miss Tyra herself.

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:12.620
Smizing.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.620
That's right. Raja was on Top Model.

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:17.620
No, she did Tyra Banks in Snatch Game.

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:23.620
No, but she was also she was some type of like stylist or something advisor in the early seasons of Top Model.

01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:26.620
But still, she did Tyra and that made everything for her Snatch Game.

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:28.620
Yeah, it did. It did. Anyway.

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.620
All right. We got to move on.

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:33.620
Got to get back to some video games and some rapid fire news.

01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:36.620
Quickly talking about some other things that have happened in the world of gaming.

01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620
We'll start with you, Loki.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.620
Everything old is new again.

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:43.620
And Killer7 is coming to Steam this fall.

01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:45.620
Yay.

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:47.620
It'll be optimized for PC.

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:49.620
Not much to optimize, though. It's pretty flat shaded.

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.620
So, but it is a cool game.

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.620
So looking forward to that.

01:38:54.620 --> 01:39:00.620
And then along in the same lines, there's a new Leisure Suit Larry game coming out.

01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:04.620
That's right. Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams Don't Dry.

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:07.620
It's been...

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:11.620
They totally missed an opportunity for a play on that old movie with Robin Williams.

01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:14.620
The What Dreams May Come by calling it Wet Dreams May Come.

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:15.620
Come on.

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620
No.

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:17.620
Come on.

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:22.620
It's supposed to be a parody of Dark Dreams Don't Die.

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:26.620
So, it looks cool.

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:33.620
I mean, it's a very, I don't know, it looks pretty.

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:34.620
The artwork is great.

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.620
Horrible.

01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:36.620
Yeah, the last one was horrible.

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:38.620
This doesn't look like the last one.

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.620
I mean, it's definitely more of like, it's got that...

01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.620
I'm assuming someone new has the license.

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:43.620
Yes.

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.620
Assemble Entertainment is the one that's putting it out.

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.620
It's actually on Steam.

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:49.620
That's how we kind of found out about it.

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:50.620
They're going to do...

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:55.620
It's going to be sold for 30 bucks and it's going to be coming out October 24th, I believe.

01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:01.620
Yeah, so, you know, October 24th.

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.620
Interesting.

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:09.620
Yeah, I'm with Dungeon Buster in chat saying, after Magna Cum Laude, I'm surprised that anyone would do another one.

01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:11.620
This looks different though.

01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:15.620
It looks like an actual adventure game and the graphics are really good.

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.620
I mean, it's a legendary franchise.

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.620
It's worth trying again.

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:20.620
And I know the last one was kind of just a remake of the first one.

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:24.620
So this one, I think, is supposed to be just like its own, like, a brand new game.

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:26.620
So it'd be interesting to see.

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.620
Alright, anyway.

01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:33.620
Let's move on to some other stories talking about 20XDX.

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:36.620
One of my... That's what I call it. 20XX. Or 20XX, I guess.

01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.620
Anyway, 20XX...

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:39.620
20XDX.

01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.620
I like 20XDX.

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.620
20XX is going to be coming to the Nintendo Switch.

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.620
That's awesome.

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.620
I'm surprised Capcom is going to let that happen.

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:50.620
But 20XX is different enough from Mega Man where it'll be different.

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:51.620
So that's really cool.

01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:54.620
It's going to be coming out on July 10th.

01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.620
So that's really not long.

01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:57.620
If you've never played 20XX...

01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:59.620
I've streamed this game a couple times.

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:05.620
Once I did it myself and then once my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness and I were co-streaming it.

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:06.620
It was a lot of fun.

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:08.620
So maybe we'll have to do that again if Delvin's out there listening.

01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:10.620
But anyway, 20XX.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.620
It's like a roguelike, but it's mixed with Mega Man and it's really cool.

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.620
And you can do, of course, full co-op.

01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.620
You can do that on the couch or online.

01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:23.620
So I guess you'll need Nintendo online service come September to be able to play 20XX online.

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:24.620
So pretty cool.

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:27.620
I will definitely probably double dip for 20XX.

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:28.620
Would you like that?

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.620
I will definitely probably double dip.

01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:33.620
Anyway, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:42.620
Even though we talked about that earlier, it should be noted that Europe on the Nintendo 3DS and worldwide on the Xbox One, a slight delay.

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:46.620
The European 3DS release is now on May 31st.

01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:50.620
The Xbox One version worldwide on June 6th.

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:54.620
And Inti Creates taking responsibility for that, saying the mistake's on us.

01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:58.620
We apologize to the fans affected by this from the bottom of our hearts.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:02.620
And this is the first time we've ever done such a large-scale multi-platform, multi-region simultaneous release.

01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:09.620
And we were unable to properly take into account how much time would be required to get each platform's online store set up in each region.

01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:11.620
So they're doing a my bad on that.

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.620
Inti Creates has been on fire lately.

01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:17.620
I mean, I know Mighty No. 9 was kind of, eh, but that Blaster Master game was fucking rad.

01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:20.620
This game, I'm sure, is going to do very well for them.

01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:24.620
So, you know, they're allowed a little mistake here and there where the game gets delayed.

01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:31.620
I did pick a Blaster Master this week, so I did pick a Blaster Master Zero with all the DLC, so I have yet to play that, though.

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:32.620
Oh, you should. It's so fun.

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.620
Anyway, I love that.

01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:37.620
Delvin just popped into the chat room. He must have been listening out there.

01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:39.620
Hey, we definitely need to do that stream again, Rob.

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.620
Alright, you got it. It's a date.

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:48.620
ActDef says, in other news, I did four legendary Pokémon raids and I didn't catch a single one, but I'm now level 37.

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:53.620
I'm only, like, 100k XP into level 37, so you're right behind me, ActDef.

01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:57.620
And I also have tried to catch Latias and still have not caught Latias.

01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:03.620
And I'm actually kind of pissed that Ho-Oh came back, because now people don't want to do Latias anymore.

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:06.620
Because they're like, ooh, shiny Ho-Oh. That's the only one I want to spend my raid passes on.

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:07.620
It's a little irritating.

01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:09.620
You don't need any shiny Ho-Ohs.

01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:13.620
I'm actually pretty impressed that they didn't change the name, because that just means Phoenix.

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.620
No, no, no, not here.

01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:20.620
So, anyway, that's where I'm at with my Pokémon GO.

01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:22.620
Let's move on with some more stuff.

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:26.620
Actually, I should mention this quickly, since Pokémon GO randomly got brought up.

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:30.620
The Alolan stuff in Pokémon GO, that was something they announced was going to be happening.

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:37.620
So, instead of Gen 4 or Gen 5, they're going to just fast-forward to Gen 7's Alolan Gen 1 forms.

01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:46.620
Which is the Exeggutor with the giant palm tree head, and the Persian that looks like Garfield.

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:49.620
The purple Nyasu.

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:53.620
Who looks like he's given someone some major side-eye.

01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:55.620
Some of them are really pretty, though.

01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:58.620
Like the Vulpix, that's like the snow Vulpix. Really pretty.

01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:01.620
I just want the new Exeggutor with the ridiculously tall neck.

01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.620
I can't wait to put that in a gym.

01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:08.620
I think it should sit on the ground next to the gym, and then the head comes up and pops up in the gym.

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.620
I hate this stupid challenge where you have to do ten great throws, because I suck at them.

01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:13.620
Oh, yeah, those things make you get them.

01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.620
I've got like seven.

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:18.620
Isn't there like one, because I have, I don't, I'm not that far progressed through,

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:24.620
but to complete all of the Mythic ones, do you have to do, there's one that has an excellent throw or something like that?

01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.620
You have to get an excellent one.

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:30.620
An excellent throw? No, it's, what you get from the Pokéstops is random.

01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:32.620
I need one more Oddish or Bellsprout.

01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:33.620
Oh, for the Mew.

01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.620
The Mew, yeah.

01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:38.620
For the Mew. You do have to do an excellent curveball in the last phase,

01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:42.620
but because you have to do something where you have to feed fifty berries to Pokémon,

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:45.620
like not in gyms, you have to catch fifty berries.

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:48.620
Like, you just keep trying to do the excellent curveball, and eventually you'll get it.

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:52.620
It's really easy to do on giant Pokémon like Wailmer.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:55.620
I'm trying to think of what else has a gigantic hitbox.

01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:59.620
I've heard, uh, Taro, or Taurus or whatever, the...

01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:04.620
Mmm, they're okay. I'm trying, there's something really common that also has a giant fucking hitbox that's pretty easy.

01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:06.620
Wailmer is the one that comes to my mind.

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:07.620
That's my one shiny.

01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:09.620
Oh really? I don't have a shiny Wailmer.

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:11.620
I caught it at my desk at work.

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:15.620
I mean, I was working and not playing Pokémon GO. I was on my break.

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:18.620
Ponyta does have a big hitbox, as that in our chatroom says.

01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:19.620
That is one that you can do.

01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:22.620
I don't ever remember getting an excellent throw on anything, so...

01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:24.620
Just keep practicing and get it eventually.

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:25.620
Never.

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:30.620
I got an excellent curveball, like, I was just feeding the berry and doing it, and I got it on my second one.

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:31.620
Actually, ironically, I think it was Ponyta.

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.620
How are you supposed to get an excellent?

01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:37.620
When the dot is really tiny, you just try to hit the dot.

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.620
Oh. That's it?

01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:40.620
Yeah.

01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.620
Because I usually just throw it when the thing's at its widest.

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:46.620
That's nice. So gray is when it's like at half, and then excellent is when it's almost gone.

01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:49.620
I thought that's just how close to the center you get.

01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:51.620
I thought that that was like your...

01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:53.620
Oh, well, I've been doing it wrong this whole time.

01:45:53.620 --> 01:46:01.620
I thought that was like your option of how to, like, how well, like, when you're doing bursting.

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:04.620
You know, like, it would increase your percentage.

01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:06.620
That's what I was thinking it was, like, in Ingress.

01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.620
So if it was full out, then that was supposed to be, like, your better chance.

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.620
I played Ingress today.

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:13.620
We tried to do a big triangle that would cover the city.

01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:15.620
I need more stuff. I haven't wanted to play because I haven't...

01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:17.620
I forgot to farm at Disneyland, too.

01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:19.620
I got stuff. I need stuff.

01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:21.620
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:22.620
I'm gonna take back work.

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:27.620
Yeah, stay on that because there's a player on the other team there that is very annoying with that portal.

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:29.620
I'll get him fired. I'm kidding.

01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:31.620
All right. Moving on.

01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:32.620
You've got some rap partners.

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:34.620
Which, by the way, my new friend, Dana...

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:38.620
I know. I know. She's the friend of me here locally. That's so funny.

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:41.620
Yeah, she's involved in an organization I'm involved in.

01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.620
She still owes me a drink.

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:46.620
Let her know that. I want to cash in on that drink. We need to all get a drink at some point.

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.620
Add her on Facebook.

01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:51.620
I don't... I'm so... You know I'm, like, really little on Facebook, though.

01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.620
So? Do it anyway.

01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:55.620
So, I guess it's my turn, right?

01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.620
Yes, ma'am.

01:46:56.620 --> 01:47:01.620
Okay, so there's a listing for Mega Man 11 on the PlayStation Store in Singapore.

01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:05.620
Oh, Singapore. Sorry, that is a...

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:08.620
Great. And I forgot the name of the band.

01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.620
Shona Knife. Shona Knife song.

01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:19.620
Anyway, Capcom in their press release listed something about a double gear system that would allow you to boost Mega Man's speed and power for a

01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:23.620
quote, new twist on the satisfying gameplay the series is known for.

01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:28.620
So, we'll see what that is. Like, my brain's already going to kind of theories on this one.

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:29.620
Is it just Mighty No. 9?

01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:37.620
I don't know. But would it be neat, like, if you had, like, a primary power as your weapon and a secondary power from another boss is, like...

01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:43.620
Oh, that's right. Eleven's the really nice looking one that they have coming out. That's right. I forgot all about that.

01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:53.620
But I would think, like, if you could equip, like, a second boss weapon and have that be, like, what powers, like, speed or, like, burst speed or ongoing running speed or something like that, that would be kind of cool.

01:47:53.620 --> 01:48:00.620
Don't steal my ideas, Capcom. Unless it's the idea of actually putting out, like, more good games.

01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:11.620
And then we have another character in ranked mode for Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo for the 30th anniversary collection and that is Akuma, also known as Goki.

01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:24.620
And he's pretty much disallowed usually from Street Fighter tournaments, but he is in ranked battle now.

01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:30.620
So there you go. Everyone cry because everyone's going to do nothing but play Goki. So there you go.

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:38.620
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some releases, some upcoming video games that you can soon find in your store, starting with the US. Loki.

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:45.620
Yeah, lots of stuff coming out. So we've got a game called Agony, which is a survivor horror game coming on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:53.620
We have Fallen Legion, Rise to Glory, that's on the Switch. Harvest Moon, Light of Hope Special Edition on the Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:48:53.620 --> 01:49:02.620
Ikaruga on the Switch. We have Legend of K anniversary on the Switch and now let's see some non-Switch games.

01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:09.620
Well, at least this one. Sega Genesis Classics, that's going to be on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:16.620
Then we have Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection on PC, the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:24.620
And a game that I originally read completely wrong in my head as Yoshi's Island Express, but it's Yoku's Island Express.

01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:31.620
And that's on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It'd just be weird if it was on non-Nintendo platforms.

01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:40.620
And then we have Full Metal Panic, Fight, Who Dares Win, that's on PlayStation 4.

01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:45.620
And Liar Princess and the Blind Prince on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.620
That sounds like an odd couple.

01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:52.620
It's the worst TV sitcom ever.

01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:59.620
Yesterday's Origins on the Nintendo Switch and I believe that is it for this week.

01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:05.620
I like the way you said Ikaruga, by the way. You're very excited. I don't know why, but Jamie will get this in my brain.

01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:11.620
All I heard was Ivy Winters. Ikaruga.

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.620
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:15.620
Oh, it's Drag Race.

01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:17.620
That's what makes it funny. That's what makes it funny.

01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:20.620
Ikaruga. That's what I'm going to say for now on.

01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:25.620
Oh, no, no. Just say it right. Ikaruga. It's a fun word.

01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:27.620
Ikaruga.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:33.620
It is fun to say, though, just as a word. Ikaruga. It's a fun word. Kind of like undulating is fun to say.

01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:39.620
Alright, some other fun things to say. Upcoming releases in Japan, including the same Full Metal Panic, Fight, Who Dares wins.

01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:41.620
That same game is out in Japan this week.

01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:44.620
BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle on PlayStation 4.

01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:49.620
There is some new keyboard coming out, because remember the PlayStation 4 will rock a USB keyboard.

01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:54.620
Also, Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 Plus.

01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:59.620
Liar Princess and the Blind Prince also getting its release in Japan.

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:01.620
There's also a Famitsu Deluxe Pack.

01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:07.620
And that BlazBlue is in all these different crystal sets, t-shirt packs, you name it.

01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:13.620
Also in Japan this week on PlayStation 4, Shantae, you stay, half genie hero.

01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:14.620
I knew you were going to do that.

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.620
How can you not, Shantae? Anyway.

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:19.620
But has Shantae ever cosplayed as Shantae?

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:24.620
Has Shantae ever played Ikaruga?

01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:27.620
Has Shantae sashayed away?

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:31.620
I hate this show sometimes. Alright.

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:33.620
That's okay, sometimes we hate ourselves.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:37.620
Anyway, I'm laughing so hard it's causing a coughing fit.

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:41.620
Hey, there's also games coming out on the PlayStation Vita, because they still love the Vita in Japan.

01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:44.620
Including Liar Princess and the Blind Prince.

01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:48.620
Sweet Pool, so you can play Pocket Pool with your PlayStation Vita.

01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:50.620
I was thinking like it would be Gwenpool or something.

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:56.620
I thought it was just like a thing like, you know, you just swipe left or right depending on whether you thought the pool was nice.

01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:58.620
Just a way to knock some balls around.

01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:03.620
And then Cafe Culere is the other game that's coming out in Japan this week.

01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:07.620
I don't know what they serve at Cafe Culere. I'm trying to see if it's a game that I recognize.

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:08.620
They serve fish, Rob.

01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:10.620
They serve anime school girls.

01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:13.620
Anime school boys that are kind of androgynous.

01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:16.620
Okay, androgynous anime school children.

01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:20.620
So what's the opposite of serving fish?

01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:27.620
Fujishiro Mao is a second year high school student who loves sweets and wants to be a patissiere chef.

01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:28.620
Is that like a pastry?

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:29.620
Patissiere.

01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:30.620
Is that pastry?

01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:31.620
It's pastry chef.

01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:32.620
That's what I thought, pastry chef.

01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:38.620
So anyway, God, this sounds complicated. Basically, like the love of the life is returning, blah, blah, blah.

01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:40.620
There's a twin involved and good Lord.

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:42.620
It's a soap opera.

01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:45.620
It's Cafe Drama for those of you that love Cafe Drama.

01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:50.620
Oh my God, that almost is like the book I'm reading right now, which is not very well written, but kind of entertaining.

01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:57.620
It's called Drag Queen about a gay lawyer who finds out he was adopted and meets his drag queen twin brother.

01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:01.620
And lastly, on the Nintendo Switch this week, Blaze Blue is also out on the Switch.

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:05.620
And that liar princess and the blind prince also on the Switch.

01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:09.620
Okay, MXC in chat says Sweet Pool is a boys love slash horror game.

01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:13.620
What? Hold on, now I got to look that I just assumed it was a pool scene.

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.620
Oh, no, this is this is wow.

01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:20.620
He's this is not that is not a that there there will be some balls around in this.

01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:22.620
I'll play this one.

01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:24.620
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:30.620
What is this where the dude is like erotically like grabbing the fence going like, is there a problem?

01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:35.620
I don't know about you, but whenever I stand next to a chain link, I guess I have to have to.

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:41.620
You have to just you just thread your two fingers through the chain and just being like, I'm just this is my natural pose.

01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:45.620
You have to be like Kelly Bundy in a music video.

01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:48.620
If you're if you're listening on the podcast and this makes no sense to you, you need to look this up.

01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:52.620
Sweet Pool, which I assumed was a pool game.

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:56.620
I assumed it was like an anime chibi chick like pool game.

01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:59.620
Rob, this is Japanese releases.

01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:03.620
Apparently, Yogi's missed a semester of school due to his poor health.

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:08.620
But now that he's back, he can't help but notice classmate Tetsuya's piercing gaze.

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:13.620
The boy's hard to read expressions and seeming lack of emotions give Yogi the creeps.

01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:19.620
Yet when Tetsuya suddenly touches his neck, feelings of unbridled lust well up inside of him.

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:22.620
What the fuck does Japan get these games and we don't?

01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:27.620
I think piercing gaze should be like a name of like a visual novel series.

01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:34.620
I had no idea there was like subtle like I'm going to lend you some of my yaoi anime, OK?

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:39.620
Oh, my God. You need to see. I feel like I'm 40 and there's still so much of the world I haven't seen.

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:42.620
Ronma is so disappointed in you right now. Apparently.

01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:47.620
Rob, you need to see where the corncob vibrator came from.

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:50.620
That's all corncob vibrator. It's a thing.

01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:52.620
And it came from an anime.

01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:57.620
MXC says Sweet Pool is getting released officially in English on PC.

01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:02.620
Vita version, probably not. Well, I'm assuming this is going to be on GOG.

01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:05.620
You know what? I think I think.

01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:08.620
Why don't I live? If I could live stream that, I freaking would.

01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:13.620
Because this is even better. There's a trailer.

01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:17.620
It's so mysterious. You play that, Madeline.

01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:24.620
Tell me what this is about. Don't show me the logo.

01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:27.620
Fast forward through.

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:31.620
I'm adding this amazing list right now. Seventy five bucks. Game of the week.

01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:35.620
Sweet pool. All right. He was eating an ice cream pop.

01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:39.620
All right. Well, you know what? If sweet pool is not your thing, I'll play it.

01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:45.620
Don't worry, because coming in June, love, love, which I always read as muff love.

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:50.620
It's coming out here, too. I was going to mention that, but I was going to wait till June.

01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:56.620
All right. So if this is not your thing, muff love is next month.

01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:02.620
All right. Moving on. How about the UK dark soccer? You have to take your eyes off that sweet pool for a minute.

01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:07.620
Well, no, I was actually checking something else out on May twenty ninth.

01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:14.620
We have Elboy for Switch and PlayStation agony for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:18.620
Also on the twenty ninth on the thirty first The Legend of K anniversary edition for Switch.

01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:27.620
We have tennis world tour on June 1st and yesterday origins also on June 1st for Switch.

01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:32.620
All right. Now, usually at this point in the show, we would get into the mailbag,

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:36.620
but we're having some server problems behind the scenes. So Jamie can't get in there tonight.

01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:43.620
So we'll work on that and be back in there next week. Although I did peak and there was only one email in there from Robert M.

01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:46.620
And we love hearing from him because we heard from him last week.

01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:51.620
But it's one of those timeless questions that can be asked next week. So we'll we'll just roll that over to next week.

01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:56.620
Sorry, Robert M. But what a tease, right? Gonna make you make wait one more week.

01:56:56.620 --> 01:57:02.620
But blame these weird server problems we're having. But at the same time, our server space is graciously donated.

01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:06.620
So you know what? Beggars can't be choosers. So once in a while, we just have to forego the mailbag.

01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:14.620
You can still put emails in there for next time. And that's participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:21.620
All right. Meanwhile, we've got some more news stories to cover before we get to the Skype line, which will be opened up at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:24.620
All one word. Loki, start us off.

01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:31.620
All right. So, you know, of course, there's the whole hacking of these Switch consoles because there's no way to prevent it.

01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:47.620
But apparently one person that was, you know, a big part of the homebrew community for the Nintendo Switch, Shiny Quagsire, has been banned from using the Switch online.

01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:53.620
And basically got an error code saying the use of online services on this console is currently restricted by Nintendo.

01:57:53.620 --> 01:58:01.620
Please contact customer service. And but it was weird, though, because his Switch is not hacked.

01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:08.620
And so he got that. And basically, you know, he did, you know, reach out to Nintendo.

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:12.620
So thank you for patiently waiting for play on your situation.

01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:18.620
Unfortunately, given that the information you provided will be unable to cancel your ban on your system.

01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:30.620
Thank you, Nintendo, for doing that, because, well, I mean, that's a risk you take when you, you know, mess around with those systems.

01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:36.620
I don't know. That's I mean, was it necessary? Maybe not. But we all know it's a risk you take. I guess.

01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:45.620
Yeah. So but, you know, the people they really should be coming after, though, are some hackers that are affecting some games like Splatoon two.

01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:50.620
So apparently there's been some hackers that have gone through and actually are cheating in the game.

01:58:50.620 --> 01:59:01.620
They've tweaked the weapons to basically throw them out of balance, including massively updating the rate of fire of a weapon that's meant to be slow,

01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:08.620
powerful blast that resemble hidden non-competitive weapons used in salmon or modes like salmon run and stuff like that.

01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:18.620
There's videos, I guess, of them, you know, changing parameters as if, for example, eliminating the charge time on sniper rifles so they can fire it like a machine gun,

01:59:18.620 --> 01:59:29.620
returning completely invisible and invulnerable. No word on whether you get I know that they're banning on some people using the modded firmwares,

01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:39.620
but it's weird. I don't know. They haven't really been able to track all these down yet, but it's unfortunate to see this kind of stuff affecting things.

01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:44.620
So hopefully they'll get on top of it. Yeah. And that's the stuff they really need to do something about.

01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:53.620
You're right. Because, you know, when they ruin games like that online, like that can just like kill a game's online presence when you just know you're going to run into cheaters right away.

01:59:54.620 --> 02:00:02.620
Well, now that they're in the online space, time to get used to it. It's been shit that Microsoft is fighting for years. So get used to it.

02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:05.620
All right. Let's go over to Jamie with our next story.

02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:25.620
Well, we have some Exceed games that are coming out. Actually, a good number to come out on Switch. We have Gal Metal, which looks like it is a rhythm game, rhythm music game.

02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:29.620
Plus, I think the name is really awesome because it also kind of makes me think of Baby Metal.

02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:42.620
We have, the game is also going to be coming out in Europe. We also have titles like Gungrave VR, Corpse Party 2, and Touhou Scarlet Curiosity, also confirmed by Exceed.

02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:50.620
But, I mean, Gal Metal, though, looks really cool. It's a motion-controlled rhythm game, so you use the Joy-Con to lead a female band all the way through.

02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:58.620
And just looking at the style, it's got that kind of neat cel-shaded style. So I'm really, really excited to play that one. I can't wait for it to come over.

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:06.620
I think people like the Exceed stuff and kind of the niche stuff that, you know, they do.

02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:09.620
Switch seems like the perfect console to bring it on.

02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:11.620
Yes. Switch is doing very well with a lot of that niche stuff.

02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.620
Mm-hmm.

02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:22.620
All right. Well, if that's it, then let's party like it's 1984. And you remember the Garbage Pail Kids? That's right, those infamous trading cards from the 1980s that I think stayed in the 80s.

02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:25.620
These never really came back, did they ever? I think they kind of like stayed there.

02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:32.620
If you don't know what they were, I guess you could just define them as like Mad Magazine level parodies.

02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:38.620
Although, if you don't know what Garbage Pail Kids are, you probably don't know what Mad Magazine is either, so maybe I'm just dating myself.

02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.620
But anyway, look it up. Google it.

02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:47.620
Garbage Pail Kids were a trading card and sticker series, and now they're going to be a mobile game.

02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.620
It is a card-collecting, role-playing game.

02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:54.620
So if you like magic, Rage Nator, listen up. This might be up your alley. Maybe this will be a game that you'd be into.

02:01:54.620 --> 02:02:05.620
You can virtual battle with cards from the original 1980s Garbage Pail Kids lineup, as well as more contemporary card series, because I had no idea these fucking things were still going.

02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:11.620
Yeah, Dungeon Buster in chat says they were the anti-Cabbage Patch Kids. Yeah, so I'm kind of surprised they're still going.

02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:17.620
But then again, Cabbage Patch Kids I think are still going, so I don't know. It's weird how those things kind of come around.

02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:25.620
So anyway, the new mobile game is coming from Jago Studios and Topps. It's an RPG card battler. It will be available on iOS and Android.

02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:29.620
If you want more information, gpkthegame.com.

02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:36.620
Which makes me ask, what 80s craze do you think deserves to come back in gaming form?

02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:38.620
Popples.

02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:44.620
I would say you can't do that on television, is the 80s craze. I would like you to come back in video game form.

02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:47.620
That'd have to be done like a WarioWare game.

02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:54.620
Yeah, you have to escape the children's television sausage factory. And if you hit the wrong button, you get slimed.

02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:56.620
Because you don't know?

02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:58.620
Yeah, because you don't know. You have to fight barf.

02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:00.620
That does not compute.

02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:03.620
And there's escape from locker jokes.

02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:11.620
Yes, perfect. Yeah, you can't do that on television would be a great one to come back. What do you think, Logie? 80s thing that should come back?

02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:14.620
Laser tag.

02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:22.620
Hold on now. That would be like me saying Gremlins. They already had Gremlins games. Although, I wouldn't mind my new Gremlins games.

02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:28.620
They re-released the Gizmo doll. I had one when that movie came out though. And the McDonald's records.

02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:35.620
Let's see. In chat, Dungeon Buster says, Gummy bears the RPG. Well, you get the Gummy ship in Kingdom Hearts.

02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:36.620
So it's like close.

02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:37.620
It's not the same.

02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:39.620
You're right. It's not the same. I tried.

02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:43.620
DDR Mike in chat. Wow, long time no see. DDR Mike. That's a blast from the past.

02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:47.620
DDR Mike in chat says, Double Dare. Oh wait, it is coming back. That's right.

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:49.620
But not Mark Summers.

02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:52.620
Yeah, he's doing color commentary on it. He's not hosting, but he's doing commentary.

02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:54.620
Oh, okay. So they found a space for him. That's cool.

02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:55.620
Yep.

02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:01.620
Well, that's good because he, you know, he didn't like doing that at all. Because the OCD he had, he didn't like being the sloppy stuff.

02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:05.620
So that's good that he has an off-hands role this time around.

02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:06.620
Yeah.

02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:09.620
That's cool. I miss unwrapped. That's, that's my Mark Summers jam.

02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:14.620
Uh, let's see. Is that in chat says they made a new Teddy Rex spin and he's terrifying.

02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:16.620
He is terrifying. Yes.

02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:21.620
Carmen Sandiego says, is that a Netflix series for Carmen Sandiego? If I remember right, that came up on the show a few weeks ago.

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.620
That and I thought there was a movie too. Weren't they doing them?

02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:28.620
I think so. I think so. So, uh, let's see. Oh, is that also suggest legends of the hidden temple?

02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:30.620
It's getting a little more 90s.

02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:32.620
That came back as a terrible movie.

02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:34.620
They did a movie on Nickelodeon like a few years ago.

02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:39.620
I don't know why, but they're doing a lot of the 90s stuff come back. Like I know Rocco's modern life has a movie coming out.

02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:46.620
They're doing one for invader Zim. Um, there's something else from Keenan and Cal is still on Saturday night live.

02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:53.620
Yeah. Still he actually, I think he is now like one of the longest, uh, longer than Daryl Hammond at this point.

02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:57.620
Yeah. Wow. And what Tim Meadows was on there forever too. Yeah. He's one of the longest.

02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:02.620
Um, yeah, I'm not surprised. Yeah. Host there. So interesting. All right. Who would have thought?

02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:09.620
Yeah. Who would have thought? Uh, Keenan from Keenan and Cal. Where's Cal? Where's his Saturday night live moment or was he mad TV?

02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:16.620
I think he was, he did have a cameo. They did a good burger bit. Oh, did they? Oh God. I don't think, I don't know.

02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:21.620
All right. And Bobby Blackwell says he is the longest as of this year. So like this is, wow.

02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:26.620
That's impressive. Daryl Hammond and Tim Meadows both are on that show for everything. Daryl Hammond a little bit longer, but yeah.

02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:33.620
Wow. Okay. Cool. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on with a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the Skype line. Loki.

02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:41.620
So this is awesome. Um, apparently coming out of the licensing expo, which I didn't even know was a thing.

02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:53.620
Licensing expo 2018. Um, Activision Blizzard has announced they have partnered with Lego to produce Lego Overwatch sets with multiple sets and various price points.

02:05:53.620 --> 02:06:01.620
All of which probably gonna be expensive because Lego is expensive. This is right up my alley though. Um, so we don't know what it's going to be.

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:09.620
It could be brickheads. It could be actual sets, but we'll see. I'm, I'm into Overwatch Legos. That's awesome.

02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:17.620
That's something that Alan would really be into too. I think. Yeah. Cool. So I knew I've seen some like mocks that people have done for like characters that look pretty awesome.

02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:25.620
I hope we get to build some of the stages like Volskaya industries and you know, all the, it would be cool. Yeah. Route 66. Yeah. You never know. It'd be awesome.

02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:33.620
Anyway, sadly I have to end on a sad note this week because, um, you know, we did have, uh, some losses in the game industry this week.

02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:40.620
So, um, I'm sure many of you on social media, um, heard that a total biscuit or John Bain, uh, did lose his battle with cancer this week.

02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:48.620
Um, and, uh, that was all over Twitter. Um, his wife, Jenna, uh, actually posted on Twitter that a total biscuit, uh, passed on May 24th.

02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:59.620
And, um, although I can't confess that I've, I'm like super familiar with his stuff. Um, I do know that he was big influential in the YouTube scene, uh, in the indie, you know, stuff.

02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:13.620
He was big on like a PC gaming, like one of the things he liked to do, like he had a group like talking about the, they were, um, you know, like the FPS stuff, you know, making sure games were actually 60 FPS on like PC versions and stuff like that.

02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:21.620
And just kind of keeping, you know, like, I love the, um, ethics and games and stuff like that in the gaming industry. He was kind of a proponent of that.

02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:35.620
Um, but like, I know some people are kind of angry at him because of like his stances on like some gamer gate stuff, but I don't think he really got into the thick of his more of just like ethics, just actually keeping companies honest as far as,

02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:47.620
yeah. The perception I got from that was that like, he actually was about the actual ethics side. And then when it was apparent that it was more than that, he was like, y'all are crazy. Like that's kind of, kind of, kind of what I got the gist that I got from that. Yeah.

02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:58.620
But yeah, he has a, you know, I didn't follow him so closely. So, but like, you know, he's got his web series out there. I mean, there's the WTF stuff talking about different games, like, you know, bringing highlighting indie stuff.

02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:04.620
He tried to do like his own steam curator page and stuff. There is highlight games there. So, I don't know.

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:15.620
Well, I think that the hardest part of this story is that he was only 33. I mean, you know, and I know there's like this big meme that's going around the internet right now about like when you're 35, you should.

02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:25.620
And it's all these, like, it's this play on these articles out there that are like, you should have so much money saved for retirement. And everybody's looking at it going, I don't have a goddamn thing saved for retirement at 35.

02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:34.620
So, like, there's a bunch of plays on that. But, you know, in, in, like, honestly, my first year, and it didn't even have anything to do with, with this, this unfortunate passing of cancer and so forth.

02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:43.620
But, like, when I first saw that, I was like, you know, when you turn 35, you should be, like, happy that you got to be 35. Because, like, I know for me, I had that really scary incident when I was 30.

02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:50.620
And I think we all have known people. Like, you know, I had a good friend of mine that passed away because of swine flu, and she was in her early 20s.

02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:51.620
Don't ignore health issues.

02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:54.620
It fucking sucks. So, you know, anyway.

02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:57.620
Except we don't have universal health care.

02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:00.620
No, we don't. And that's a whole nother thing.

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:03.620
Because they say they're pro-life, but they're really just pro-birth.

02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:11.620
Anyway. So, as if that wasn't enough, I mean, that was, the gaming industry was, was devastated right there.

02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:16.620
But then also, I don't know if you guys had heard this too, Ted Dabney passed away this week.

02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:21.620
You may not know the name, but he co-founded Atari alongside Nolan Bushnell.

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.620
So, he passed this week as well.

02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:28.620
Now, he was 81, which, you know, is a little more the age.

02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:32.620
I still think anything like under 90 is, you know, sad.

02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:36.620
And even, you know, sometimes when it's over 90, people are living longer in this day and age.

02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:42.620
But regardless, at least you kind of go, okay, well 81 is kind of where the average life expectancy is right now.

02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:48.620
So, but anyway, it is still tragic because he did pass, and he was one of the co-founders of Atari.

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:55.620
And who knows where gaming would be today without Atari and, you know, Pong and everything the 2600 brought us and all that.

02:09:55.620 --> 02:10:00.620
So, news of his death was announced on Facebook by a video game historian.

02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:07.620
Because I don't think this guy has been very much in the public eye since, you know, obviously Atari has really kind of gone behind the scenes.

02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:15.620
But without Dabney, you know, he was crucial in creating Computer Space, which was basically the coin-operated version of Space War,

02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:18.620
which then kind of made way for, you know, Atari to really come through.

02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:21.620
So, anyhow, he passed away as well.

02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:26.620
So, it has been a shitty week in the gaming world, that's for sure.

02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:33.620
Anyhow, let's try to make things a little bit happier here and talk about whatever you would like to on our phones.

02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:37.620
If you'd like to give us a call, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:40.620
If you'd like to give us a call and talk about whatever might be on your mind this week.

02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:41.620
Maybe there's something you're playing.

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:45.620
Maybe there's a news article we missed that you'd like to talk about, or who knows what.

02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:50.620
Let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last-minute stories while we wait for the phones to light up here.

02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:54.620
No, not really. It's been a pretty slow week.

02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:57.620
Yeah, it's been a lighter week, I think, with Memorial Day on the horizon.

02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:59.620
But we do have a call coming in. Let's get to it.

02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:00.620
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:02.620
Hey, this is Reginator.

02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:03.620
Hey, what's on your mind, Reginator?

02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:06.620
Not a whole lot.

02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:23.620
Well, since you were talking about 80s revival a few minutes ago before you opened up the phone lines, I think I'll make the bulk of my call about that.

02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:40.620
It's pretty much a given that most of us know that a lot of the video game spin-off media out there over the years hasn't been all that great.

02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:48.620
Case in point, the infamous Super Mario Brothers movie that came out in the 90s is a prime example of that.

02:11:49.620 --> 02:12:13.620
But still, even with that being said, are there any movies or TV shows based on gaming that you may have seen growing up that weren't like Casablanca level grade or Dr. Zhivago grade, but you still loved it anyway?

02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:19.620
Absolutely. In fact, it's almost kind of timely because I would say the Super Mario Brothers Super Show with the Zelda cartoons on Fridays.

02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:27.620
Like, you know, it wasn't going to win an Emmy, but it was a good time and it was stuff I remember as a kid.

02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:30.620
And I really loved the Zelda cartoons especially. The Mario cartoons were decent too.

02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:35.620
But the reason why I say it's timely is that I believe those just hit Netflix this week.

02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:40.620
So if you wanted to catch up and you happen to be a Netflix person, you can catch up on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:42.620
I know those are on there for a while. They've been on there for a while.

02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:44.620
They've been on, I think, some of the other services. I don't think they were on Netflix.

02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:45.620
No, they were.

02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:46.620
Were they?

02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:47.620
Because we've watched them.

02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:54.620
Thank you for bringing up that show. Internet high five. In fact, I grew up watching that myself.

02:12:55.620 --> 02:13:07.620
There's a, not to show anyone else's channels on Twitch, but there is a channel on Twitch called ConTV.

02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:17.620
Every so often they do show that show on there as well. So that's something to watch if you don't have Netflix or whatever.

02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:23.620
You know, otherwise I would say I was, but see, I was always a big fan and really still am of game shows.

02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:29.620
You know, like the other thing that honestly comes to my mind is things like not just Nick Arcade, which is a little more nineties, but also, um, Starrcade.

02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:35.620
Which is funny because, you know, you can think of Starrcade as that place that used to be a Disneyland that Jamie was referencing at the top of the show.

02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:37.620
Or you can think of it as that.

02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:38.620
That was Astrocade, Rob.

02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:40.620
Oh, I thought you called it Starrcade. I thought it was Starrcade.

02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:41.620
Astrocade.

02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:48.620
Oh, okay. I thought it was. All right. Well, whatever. Well, anyway, Starrcade was an old game show from 81, 82.

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.620
It's supposed to be coming back.

02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:56.620
They always say it's going to be coming back and then they never do. They still have a name to host, which I'm waiting for that call.

02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:57.620
Wait for the call, y'all.

02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:02.620
Uh, but, uh, they did, they did a Twitch marathon of that not that long ago.

02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:09.620
They did every single episode of Starrcade I remember was to build hype for a Blu-ray set, I think, or something that they were going to be coming out with.

02:14:09.620 --> 02:14:14.620
So, I mean, that was kind of gaming because like, what else do we have from that era?

02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:17.620
Captain N, which admittedly I didn't watch a ton of that.

02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:19.620
I'm aware it was the thing that exists and I knew of it.

02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:23.620
But I don't think they showed it at a good time here on the local networks, if at all.

02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:30.620
Yeah. Admittedly, I watched Captain N. I knew it wasn't great.

02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:36.620
In fact, no, no, no, no, Mega Man and, uh, Pit.

02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:41.620
Well, they called him, uh, uh, Kid Icarus on the show for whatever reason.

02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:46.620
But that aside, I thought those two characters were a little bit of an annoying sight.

02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:57.620
But you got to remember, they came out in the late 80s and there was, uh, there was, uh, you know, the prime of, uh, Nintendo's, you know, hype.

02:14:57.620 --> 02:15:00.620
You know, they're kind of, they're kind of golden age, if you will.

02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:04.620
So, you know, everyone had Nintendo fever.

02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:13.620
So, you know, and there was a whole lot in terms of, uh, gaming, uh, gaming related shows on TV at the time.

02:15:13.620 --> 02:15:21.620
So I kind of, you know, you know, granted bear that, you know, you know, even with the annoyances.

02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:29.620
And still, even with that being said, you know, ignoring the annoyances, it was still somewhat decent, you know.

02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:35.620
Yeah, somebody in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, vidpower says GameProTV was my jam.

02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:42.620
You know, um, that guy, uh, JD Roth that hosted that, he went on to do, um, he was the co-creator.

02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:46.620
I mean, he does a lot of trash TV now, like it's just like straight up trash TV.

02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:49.620
He was the co-creator of The Biggest Loser on NBC, which is trash.

02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:56.620
Uh, he hosted that unanimous reality show on Fox that I remember was like kind of a Big Brother knockoff.

02:15:56.620 --> 02:16:00.620
It was super trash. Uh, and then, God, what else did he do?

02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:05.620
It says right now he is currently the announcer of the ABC TV show Extreme Weight Loss.

02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:10.620
Never seen it, but it's probably trash. So, just kind of interesting.

02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:17.620
Yeah, you know, as long as I thought of it, granted, I'm not entirely sure if it would be considered retro or not.

02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:23.620
But, you know, the Final Fantasy movies, especially the first one, The Spirits Within,

02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:27.620
I know a lot of people like to hate on it and say, you know, in fact,

02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:30.620
Ew, that's not a real Final Fantasy movie!

02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:32.620
Hey, watch it, because that's exactly what I...

02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:36.620
I don't hate on it, but my problem is, like, it just wasn't Final Fantasy at all.

02:16:36.620 --> 02:16:38.620
They should have just called it The Spirit Within.

02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:41.620
Yeah, well, the way I look at it is this.

02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:47.620
You know, if you look at each of the, you know, all the actual Final Fantasy games,

02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:50.620
for the most part, they're very, very different from each other.

02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:57.620
Like, eight's very different from seven, nine's very different from eight, so on and so forth.

02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:01.620
And, granted, there's certain common elements in the game.

02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:09.620
It's like, you're gonna see chocobos, you're gonna see a character named Sid, so on and so forth.

02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:17.620
And, you know, some of those elements are kind of cleverly hidden in the movie.

02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:23.620
Like, the only way you'll see a chocobo is in the main character's pajamas.

02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:25.620
Well, in my opinion, that's why it flopped.

02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:30.620
It's because those things were so, like, subtle that, you know, like, they shouldn't have had to hide it.

02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:32.620
You know what I mean?

02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:38.620
That was my issue with it, but this is a debate that's, like, 15 years old at this point, so I'm only gonna slide.

02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:49.620
Yeah, but, ultimately, my point is, you know, I took all my arguments into consideration,

02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:56.620
and even with that being said, I still found the movie really, really great, despite the fact that a lot of people hate it.

02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:01.620
Yeah, maybe it's one of those things I need to watch again, but, you know, I was expecting something Final Fantasy and it just kind of wasn't.

02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:07.620
And I remember that, at that time, they were working on eight and the movie around the same time,

02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:15.620
and I remember saying this before, and I'll say it again, it would have been maybe different if the movie had been Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy VIII had been the movie.

02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:24.620
Because I think Final Fantasy VIII has a great story that is very Final Fantasy, but Final Fantasy VIII is probably the worst Final Fantasy game, in my opinion.

02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:33.620
That's my opinion only. Final Fantasy VIII is, like, the worst of all Final Fantasy games because of its battle system and the junction draw thing and all that, like, ruins it,

02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:37.620
and the scaling of the monsters and all that stuff, like, it's not a fun game, in my opinion.

02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:42.620
Whereas the story's great. I would have liked Final Fantasy VIII to have just been a movie.

02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:50.620
Yeah, well, you know, I look at it this way, you know, they tried something new with the junction system.

02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:55.620
They'll pan out, well, no, but at least they had the balls to try something new.

02:18:55.620 --> 02:19:09.620
I mean, you know, there's so many games out there, you know, your game publishers and developers out there that, you know, kind of churning out sequels after sequels without trying anything new,

02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:17.620
and we complained that it's same old, same old cookie-colored games, you know, and we complained that it gets boring after a while.

02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:25.620
You know, to Square's credit, they tried something new with VIII, and unfortunately, just one time it flapped, so...

02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:30.620
But some people would, like, fight me on the street for saying that, so, you know, everybody's got their opinion.

02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:34.620
Anyway, Rage Leader, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze in a couple more calls, but thanks for the call.

02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:36.620
Sure, have a nice night.

02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:37.620
Later, you too.

02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:38.620
Here's a story.

02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:41.620
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to call in. Yeah, you got a last minute story?

02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:43.620
Yeah, I'm just trying to check the date on this article.

02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:52.620
Yeah, this is recent, so apparently Samsung has to pay Apple $539 million for copying iPhone features.

02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:54.620
Didn't Apple have to pay them?

02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:56.620
No, this was from the appeal court.

02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:59.620
No, no, no, not this week, but like a previous thing months ago.

02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:01.620
Yeah, and it's looking like it's getting turned around.

02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:04.620
So all these companies just sue the shit out of each other.

02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:08.620
Yeah, but I just think it's absolutely hilarious.

02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:12.620
Anyway, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:14.620
Hey, this is Act Deaf.

02:20:14.620 --> 02:20:16.620
Hey, Act Deaf, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:19.620
Well, I have a story I want to talk about.

02:20:19.620 --> 02:20:28.620
Not something that you covered today, but something that happened or is happening right now in Mexico with video games.

02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:30.620
Oh, please, what's going on?

02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:37.620
Well, right now, there's somewhat contest. It's an initiative, more likely.

02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:43.620
It's called Video Juegos Mx Mexico.

02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:45.620
Sorry.

02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:55.620
And it's a competition made by the ESA, the Entertainment Software Association, and also the government of Mexico.

02:20:55.620 --> 02:21:01.620
Many private and public initiatives are industry leaders.

02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:13.620
And it's a good initiative. It promotes the creation of video games and a bigger industry here in Mexico that's still growing.

02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:18.620
But there's one thing about it, and that's the thing I don't like about it.

02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:32.620
The prices, they're given out. There are three categories. There's a category for people under 17 years.

02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:39.620
And the prices there are a video game console, so that's kind of okay.

02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:42.620
For doing what? This is for making games?

02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:51.620
For example, for the category for under 17, you have to develop an idea. Not necessarily the video game, but an idea.

02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:54.620
Oh, okay. So like a treatment or something. Okay, alright.

02:21:54.620 --> 02:22:00.620
But there's also a category for university or college students.

02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:11.620
And now there's the development involved. They have to make a game. They have to make either a mobile game or a console or PC game.

02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:40.620
The prices there are 25,000 pesos. Which right now, with the equivalency and all that, the conversions, it's around $1,200.

02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:54.620
$1,200, yeah. So it's not enough. That's really not even to pay the scholarship for any person that goes to a private school.

02:22:54.620 --> 02:23:01.620
They're the only places here in Mexico that offer a career in development for video games.

02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:12.620
So the prices are not all that, it sounds like. What is their point with this? Are they just trying to get more folks in Mexico excited about game development?

02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:21.620
Are they trying to figure out maybe the next big game idea is in Mexico? Trying to get more game design out of that? Is that what they're going for with this?

02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:35.620
Yeah, they're trying to impose the industry. And basically, this is the third year they have done this. They have done it in 2015 and 2016. They skipped 2017 for some reason.

02:23:35.620 --> 02:23:46.620
And they're doing this again. But that's not the only categories. There's a professional category for people already in the industry making games.

02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:58.620
And the top prize, the best game in the contest is 100,000 pesos.

02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:01.620
So that's going to be like $4,000 basically?

02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:07.620
Around $4,000, $5,000 I think.

02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:09.620
Yeah, $5,000.

02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:17.620
But it would depend on how much time you spent on it. If you spent months and months creating this, all things considered, that's actually not that much money.

02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:35.620
Yeah, again, and that's my problem with this. Because the prices are not exactly something that, at least for me, I wouldn't like to get this. No, I would like to actually get something else or something better.

02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:46.620
It's a bummer that the organizations can't like, as a prize, we're going to get you connected with an international publisher for your game. That would be something really cool.

02:24:47.620 --> 02:25:03.620
Yeah, the other prizes in the contest, at least for best video game, are also a trip to E3 in 2019 and an Autodesk license, which I don't really know about Autodesk. I don't know how it works.

02:25:03.620 --> 02:25:09.620
But it's something, but it's not really that great, at least in my opinion.

02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:19.620
Yeah, maybe in some ways, it's kind of about getting your name out there and getting noticed. I mean, for what it's worth, I'm sure whoever wins this competition, there will be news articles that will cover the game and so forth.

02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:35.620
And if the game is available for download or for purchase somewhere at that point, maybe that would be good for it. But I get what you're saying. The prizes are not necessarily, I mean, only one person gets to win too. What about all the other people that spend their time on this?

02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:45.620
So I don't know. Maybe this would be something that folks who already have games that they're working on, maybe something they can try to get in on to leverage their games a little more.

02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:55.620
But I like that they're trying to do something to get people motivated in other countries, but I totally get what you're saying, ActDeaf. I'm not sure this is enough.

02:25:56.620 --> 02:26:06.620
No, and you're right. It's a good initiative. It's not something like really, really bad. Because if people can take advantage of this, it's good.

02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:20.620
And BobbingtonChat, for what it's worth, says 1,000 is actually a prize amount for game jams here in the US for first place. So it's in line with other things. So, you know, maybe at the end of the day, it's more about the exposure than it is about the actual cash prize.

02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:27.620
Although let me ask you this. Do you know the game, or have heard of the game Militant?

02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:29.620
No.

02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:39.620
It's a game that is already available on Steam and PlayStation 4, and it won the first year of this initiative, of this contest.

02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:40.620
Interesting.

02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:44.620
So yeah, not exposure, I don't think so.

02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:53.620
All right. Fair enough. All right, ActDeaf. Well, thanks for the call and, you know, the update on what's going on in places that aren't necessarily the ones where we live.

02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.620
Thanks for having me.

02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:56.620
Hey, no problem. Take care, buddy.

02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:57.620
You too.

02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:04.620
All right, bye bye. All right, Kaijuto kind of another thought there saying, may not look like a lot, but it's a great start. Sometimes you have to crawl before you fly.

02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:09.620
Well, I mean, yes and no. I also get the perspective of, yeah, but I still have to support my family.

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:18.620
So, but you know, as far as that whole, like if I, if it's a hobby, if it's something I do in my spare time, you know, maybe this is a way to kind of elevate that hobby into a career.

02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:24.620
I don't know. Anyway, with that, we are going to wrap up for the night and that's going to do it for calls.

02:27:24.620 --> 02:27:30.620
But if you didn't get through, you can always still send us an email. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us an email.

02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:37.620
We do read the tweets and all that as well. Twitter.com slash O L R. But I think for now we are going to wrap up and I always like to towards.

02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:39.620
Wait, any other last minute stories? I don't want to.

02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:42.620
I mean, we can talk about Battlefield five was announced this week.

02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:44.620
Oh my God. We really didn't cover that anywhere else, did we?

02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:47.620
I mean, it's fine. I mean, it's going to be World War Two this year.

02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:48.620
Okay.

02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:52.620
And then they're going to, um, one thing that they promised that there's not going to be a premium pass this time.

02:27:52.620 --> 02:28:02.620
So you don't have any like DLC or anything like that. And there's not going to be any, um, loot boxes that are going to have, um, game affecting items in it.

02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:07.620
So if there's anything that's going to be in the game, it's going to be cosmetic stuff, I guess.

02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:16.620
Um, but, and they're not, I don't think they're doing battle rail. It didn't sound like they're doing battle rail and there's a single player campaign to take that call of duty.

02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:23.620
So definitely a battlefield and call of duty are like different games this year. It's not just like the same fucking thing.

02:28:23.620 --> 02:28:28.620
So interesting too, that it's EA that's doing the game where they kind of backed off of loot boxes.

02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:37.620
Well, I trust EA as far as I can throw them in. I'm sorry. Like I still, there's going to be shady shit somewhere.

02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:43.620
Fair enough. All right. Well, as I always say at the end of Orange Launch Radio, uh, thank you very much for supporting the show.

02:28:43.620 --> 02:28:47.620
If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, or even if you hated it, maybe you know somebody that would like it.

02:28:47.620 --> 02:28:52.620
So help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.

02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:56.620
So make sure you tell a friend or whoever might be interested in this show.

02:28:56.620 --> 02:29:02.620
Uh, also a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play, uh, goes a very long way.

02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:08.620
And I always say that, and there's not a lot of new reviews that are popping up. So if you do have 15 seconds to write a review, I'd really appreciate it.

02:29:08.620 --> 02:29:10.620
Do I need to pay for an advertisement?

02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:17.620
Sure. If you're offered for free for me advertising, I didn't say it was free. I said free for me.

02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:25.620
So actually I'm considering making little banners. So if anyone has a forum or something and wants to promote the show, yeah.

02:29:25.620 --> 02:29:32.620
Um, hit me up. I'll probably have something done by the end of the week. Sweet. All right. Uh, and I think, I think that's, that's it for that.

02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:36.620
So let's get around to final thoughts for the night. Uh, Loki, your final thought.

02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:43.620
Um, my final thoughts, hopefully I'm going to get to play all this VR stuff that I downloaded on my PlayStation four because now it's all tricked out with VR stuff.

02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:46.620
So we just need to play those things.

02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:54.620
Uh, my final thought is I'm going to be back on Twitch tonight. I've been taking a month break because of the other game I was playing and, uh, just, you know, live stuff.

02:29:54.620 --> 02:30:01.620
So I'll be excited to be back. So twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts. I appreciate all those for follow follows, subscribes, biddies, all that good stuff.

02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:10.620
We're going to play Hyrule warriors tonight. My poll closed and Hyrule warriors one. So we'll be there soon. Last but not least, dark soccer, neurotypical people don't make sense.

02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:17.620
And then I'm going to go harass your cat. Yeah. Mr. He's singing the song of his people. He's being a big, I've been fed, but I'm lying.

02:30:17.620 --> 02:30:22.620
He's being a big baby. All right. That's it. Uh, we're out of here for the night. We will be back to do it in seven days.

02:30:22.620 --> 02:30:28.620
So have a great week. And for those of you that have the day off tomorrow, have a good time staying up all night tonight. Bye everyone.

02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:37.620
