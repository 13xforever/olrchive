00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
What game spans 6 platforms, 4 consoles, 3 generations, and is now 17 years old?

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Treasure's gift that keeps on giving is Ikaruga, slated for release on the Nintendo Switch later this month.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, May the 6th of 2018 with episode number 729 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
But joining me by my side as she always is, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Miss Vangie.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
You must be getting prepared for DragCon.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I am. I'm hunting her down.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
Well, you know what's funny? The things we do to do Orange Lounge Radio live with you all, Miss Vangie is here in town tonight with Monet X Change.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I know.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And we're here, we're stuck doing this gig.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I wanted to see Miss Vangie, but no.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
You guys are worth it. We love you guys.

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
And plus, I don't know, not that I get claustrophobic, but sometimes those shows can be, especially when it's a really popular queen like those two are.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I always pay for the balcony.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh yeah, that is true, but just like too many people, you know what I mean?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
Anyway, say hello. We are happy to share our space here with Techmaster Loki as we do every week. Hello, Loki.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Hello, and speaking of popular queens, we can't watch American Idol anymore, unfortunately.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh, I know. I know, right? Cancelled. American Idol is cancelled.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It's basically, yeah. It's dead to me now.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
That was some bullshit last week, wasn't it? Which, you know, well, it's not really a spoiler alert at this point, right?

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
So Ada Vox, who was clearly the winner of that competition, no longer there because America, the wrong people are watching that show.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Who cares? No one listens to American Idol artists anyways.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
It's true. Can you tell me who won The Voice or who won any of like the last five seasons?

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
I couldn't tell you who's even on The Voice. I don't even know.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
I know, I know. Those singing shows, there's too many of them. It was different when it was only American Idol, right?

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
It was different when that was it and there was nothing like it and it's like, oh my God, Paula Abdul, I haven't seen her in forever, right?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
It was different then, but now it's like, okay.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
But it's even now, it's like, it's not even necessarily the person that wins American Idol.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
It's like, if you're like in that top 12, you pretty much have potential to just start your own thing anyways.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
It's kind of these, you know, like Kelly Pickler and shit. Everybody has a fucking album now.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
And what's funny is that that actually ties into Drag Race and a lot of what they say about RuPaul's Drag Race too is it's like,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
it's not about what you do during the competition. It's about what you do after the competition.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
You know, once you are on that show, like look at somebody like Miss Vanjie, which I wouldn't expect that everybody out there knows,

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
but if you don't know Miss Vanjie, she was the first contestant eliminated this season,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
but she had such a memorable exit that like there's memes about her all over the internet now.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
And like people who have no fucking clue what Drag Race is are doing these Miss Vanjie type of memes.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
So like, you know, for her, she's already won.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
And you know, they'll just have her, have her back, you know, in the future, like Caesar or something.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Like, oh yeah, we helped her launch her career.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
I want them to do RuPaul's Drag Race Losers.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, well, well.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
And do everyone who had been the first eliminated queen.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
She'll be on, she'll be on season 11 cause RuPaul was spotted like going to some opening or some gala thing.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And RuPaul had a necklace on that said Vanjie in gold.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
So it's like, you know, like, you know that we, the world ain't seen the last of those cookies.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Do they ever do like an all stars type thing in Drag Race where they bring back? Okay.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
They just finished the third season.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
They do, but the third season was, was rough. Too, too many twists.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
They tried to do too many twists to make it different and it really suffered as a result.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
So anyway.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm sorry, Shangela.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
If you want to hear more about Drag Race, I urge you to look up reading is fundamental on iTunes.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
But for now we are here to talk about video games and let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
We'll get into our news and all that and our gaming weeks later on.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I should also introduce the chat room. That's important.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
But Bobby enjoying the last week of his two week vacation right now, and he'll be back next week.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
But we are live with our chat.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.000
And if you are listening live, you can go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com where everybody's talking about American Idol right now.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
I should also mention that Becky told me Julian named his first horse in Breath of the Wild Vangie.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
So it is gaming related.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
And I had my Minecraft. Not only did I have my Minecraft world named Vangie, but I had my Minecraft world recently named Proportionizing.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Proportionizing!

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Which, by the way, spoiler alert, Proportionizing was a really good seed, actually.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
So speaking of like horses, OK, I am very disappointed.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I don't get to reach out. That's OK. That's fine.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
You know, they can wait. They can wait.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
They can wait. I am so surprised that we haven't gotten an epic horse game yet on consoles.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I mean, you know, Derby's Owners Club, Derby Owners Club.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Like, why? Why don't we have a Derby Owners Club on consoles?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
That's a great question.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Final Furlong is the horse humping game.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
That is the, yeah. And if you don't, like, you'd have to, like, Google it, look up a picture of Final Furlong.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
But, like, the machine was like you could actually, like, ride the horse.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
But, like, there's a certain way you could be riding that thing where it looks like you're fucking it.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Like, that game was kind of questionable.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
It's not just fucking. It's skull fucking.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Anyway, now can I do some chat comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Kaijuto is an Idol fan saying, American Idol is the shit. I don't get the haters.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
It's always good if you like listening to great voices.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
If you watch it just for lame ass judge lines and all the drama stuff, then you'll burn out on it fast.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It was relevant once.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
It's, well, the thing, well, I think the thing is, you know, I will agree with Kaijuto to a point.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
The season when that show was over was when it was about Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj fighting.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
And it became more about that than it did about the singers.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And that was the season it was over.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Some would argue it was before or after that.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
But I would say, you know, to a point, Kaijuto, I do agree with you.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
sg100matt in chat says, I stopped paying attention to American Idol after season 3, which was like forever ago at this point.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
Anyway, back to games. sg100matt also says, Derby Owners Club was serious business back in the day.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, that was always like a fun thing to do between games of DDR and other stuff that we were playing.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
It's hilarious. It was a great game because I didn't understand what the hell was going on.

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
You just want to get the card, your card that printed out with your horse's name on it, and you just want to play the game because it's stupid.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
How do you, for listeners who may have never heard of Derby Owners Club, how do we explain it?

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Because, I mean, it's been like 10 years. Do they still have it at Dave & Buster's places?

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
I don't know. But, Matt, you go to an arcade and you see this, like, cabinet that is like a room.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
It is a giant room with, like, several consoles and you're basically watching, like, horse racing.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
But you create a horse and they have, like, this whole gameplay that you play on your screen.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
And then you, I guess, raise the horse and stuff and then you race it and you improve its stats based on that.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
And then once you get your stats high enough, you breed your horse with other horses to make even better horses.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
But you get cards that print out and you can name them.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Like Initial D. Just the exact same system. Exactly the same system, yes.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
And it was fantastic. And we really need that again because it's just stupid.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
I remember that Dark Sakura had a book. She would bring it. She would, here's my book of horses. Which horsies am I going to race today?

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
I still have the book. It's somewhere in my house. I found it not too long ago because, remember, my good one for the long time was Magical Sound.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
Oh. And you had Palateri. I thought that was your horse. It was Palateri. Maybe. I think it was.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
But we had to spell it the special way. Like P-A-L-A-T-E-R-I. Palateri.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
A character limit? No, like a bad word in it somehow. You know how game filters can be weird.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Anyway, S2-100-MAT actually linked to the Wikipedia article. Or you could read more about that. I suppose that's a place to start.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
And as S2-100-MAT continues, Derby Owners Club is 10 years old. It could be Classic Game of the Week at some point.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
If I felt like it. Dropping a little hint there to Dark Sakura.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
That means that in 10 years, another 10 years, I'll finally remember to do it.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
That's a good one to do for like an anniversary show.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Can you imagine a Derby Owners Club with today's technology? It would look fucking amazing.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah, I'd be all about Derby Owners Club on Switch. It's Sega's game, right? Isn't it Sega's game?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I thought, was it Sega or Konami?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
No, it wasn't Konami. I'm almost positive it was Sega.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I think it's Sega.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Probably a Sega thing.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
It was.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Sega did like to take a lot of risks in the arcade market.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
They do. They had a lot of over-the-top shit. Oh yeah? It was an in-house Sega thing. It was Sega's AM3 department that did that game.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
So, there you go.

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
Alright, let's get into what we were going to talk about at the top of the show tonight. Although I'm all for a Derby Owners Club tangent.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Let's talk about classic video games coming back all over again in style.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
And I bring this up because I think it's kind of neat. And I also know we have some collectors in the house.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
You know, I don't know about you guys in our chat, but I know Dark Sakura. We always talk about the Vault collection.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
She's got quite the collection. I'll never forget the game that came with the Dish. And I was like, why?

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Why not, right? You still have the Dish game?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That was the Cardcaptor Sakura game for Dreamcast.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
That's right, that's right. I can never remember what it was, but yes.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
And then of course, Loki is an owner of an arcade machine.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
So that's a little bit of a collection as well.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Dose arcade machines, actually.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Dude, really? What? What happened? You had another one.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, no, I have an arcade machine. Remember, I had an arcade cabinet at one time. I have the candy cab.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh, okay, okay. You have like a... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. That's like basically a main thing at this point, right?

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah, it doesn't really work right now. My JPEG died, so I have to get a new one of those.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Okay. Well, anyhow, Capcom is the subject of this story.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
It's going to be re-releasing cartridge versions of Mega Man 2 and Mega Man X.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
So these two classic Mega Man games are going to get cartridge re-releases.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
They're going to be limited runs. They're going to cost you $100 apiece, which, I mean, was more than they cost back in the day.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
But, I mean, I don't know if it's inflation, if it's because, I mean, if you look at this Mega Man X cartridge, it's pretty sweet.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
It's in like the blue casing, and I know the Mega Man 2 has something similar. It's a pretty rad looking little thing.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
It doesn't look like it did back in the day. Like, I love that see-through cartridge.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
I gotta be curious if the ROM is also modified, too. They have like that 30th anniversary Mega Man type thing in it.

10:40.000 --> 10:49.000
Don't know. I don't know if they've said that. But anyway, but of course this makes people wonder, like, would you be able to even play these in cartridge form?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Like, how many people still have a working Nintendo?

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
Probably a lot, being with all the retro, what is it, the retro consoles.

10:59.000 --> 11:06.000
I guess so. Those are kind of, those machines are basically, they dump the ROM and they emulate it right on the spot.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
That's basically what those machines do. But I feel you, I feel you. You could use those to play games.

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
And dark soccer is like me. You're special in that regard because you guys collect stuff.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
You have like four Nintendos, right? Or something like that?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Something like that. A couple of them in the box.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah. So anyhow, I Am 8-Bit, I believe is the production house that is helping out with this effort.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
And I Am 8-Bit is going to try to sweeten the pot since it is a high value there.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
They're going to package the game with instruction books. How about that? The return of an instruction booklet. Isn't that nice?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Better for that kind of price.

11:42.000 --> 11:50.000
Cost boxing as well. And 1,000 random buyers get the glow in the dark versions of the cartridge. That's pretty rad.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
Oh, I see. Oh, that blue cartridge is the random one. So most people are going to get the regular gray one.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Whereas the NES one is that kind of light blue.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I don't even think that's great. It's more of like a white. Yeah, it looks lighter than the normal cartridge.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
And you know what?

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Something I wouldn't wear to a wedding. Or something I would wear to a wedding because I can't wear it here.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
You would probably still though buy an original for less than that.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
That's true. That's true.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And then you'd have an original.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Well that's why it's a collector's item.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
It's for people with too much money who don't want to go hunting.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
So 8,500 copies are going to be available in total and that includes the 1,000 blue ones.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
They're supposed to start shipping in September of this year.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So you guys are kind of already getting into it a little bit.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Is that, well wait a minute. What's the point of these if I can walk into a used game store and possibly find one of these on cartridge?

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Although I would think these games in particular are probably a little harder to find because they are so popular.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, it's a collector's item is what it is.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Do you think it's worth it?

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
It's not unreasonable considering some of the other collector's things I've seen.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
I mean look at all these collector's editions that they have from modern games. They have like a stupid statue with it and stuff.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And those don't come with instruction booklets for the most part.

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah, it's ridiculous. I wouldn't buy it because I'm not collecting Nintendo or Super Nintendo games.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
But if I was a collector, yeah, I might be interested in it.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
It's a neat idea. Props to them for trying something different.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Right.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
And hey, if it works out then you can put out more stuff.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Let me look at our chat over at live.vog.network.com.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Mr. 200 Matt says $100. I mean if I was a serious Mega Man fan and collector I would dig in.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
But I have the games on so many platforms now. Legacy Collections, SNES Mini, etc.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
So maybe the fact that this game has kind of been re-released to death.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Maybe this is not the type of thing that a collector would be getting at this point.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It would have been cool if it was a new Mega Man game.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
Like a new Mega Man X type game or that would have been like Mega Man 12 or something like that.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
And then release an NES version as well as it on modern platforms. That would have been pretty awesome.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Right, right.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
That's a little asking for much, but I don't know. That would have been cool.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
I guess I've seen things that have been even more ridiculous for way more money.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
So I don't think it's unreasonable.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
Let's see. Brad from Pod Culture says saw SNES Mini at Target today. Didn't have the $80 to spare.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
That's true. We've got to remember these collector's items and the money that goes with it.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
That's a luxury to many people.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
Dungeon Buster says I wish Breath of the Wild or Bayonetta 2 came with manuals and stickers too.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Those empty Switch cases need some filler.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Well that's probably a whole other topic for another episode.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
But yeah, obviously the way games are distributed and stuff have really changed.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Well, even a lot of the Switch cases...

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
I have my Switch case and I just take the cartridge out and pop it in the case that comes with it.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
The cartridge holder in the case.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
It would be nice to have those extra instructions because I think I was looking at...

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I was trying to find the instructions for something.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
Oh yeah, I think Mario Odyssey or something like that.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I was trying to find out if there were some motion controls you had to do.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I'm like, why are you doing these motion controls?

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
There's got to be a way that can do these moves without motion controls.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And unfortunately there was not.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya brings up something that happened in the past saying,

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
I know they did something similar before with the limited re-release of Street Fighter 2 on SNES.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, so this is maybe something that I Am 8-Bit is exploring doing more often.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
Maybe this is something that's being successful enough that it's warranting to do more releases like this.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
I don't know, what if they did something that's really close to your heart?

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
Dark Sakura, how would you feel if these I Am 8-Bit wanted to do a Guardian Legend re-release that came with a dish?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I have an original.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Okay, so no need for any of these like remakes?

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
No, not really, besides that no one would bring it out with a dish.

15:51.000 --> 16:00.000
What's something that you think is, or if there is, do you think there's something that might be really hard to find retro that maybe this would be like an answer to?

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Do you think there's anything out there where maybe it's not so easy to find a retro copy of that?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Radiant Silver Gun?

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
So something that's like, I guess like Suikoden comes to mind too.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Like even though they've kind of, you know, you can get that in like the PlayStation 3 backwards.

16:14.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm still trying to find a relatively, I'd say $50 range copy of Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Or Robit Mondu, which I still really want that game.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Ninja Gaiden Trilogy on Super Nintendo, you guys still have that right?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
In the box, with manual.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah, but that would be one where it's like, those are hard. You can't just walk into a used game store and find it.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Someone must have given me $450 bucks for it, it can be yours.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Because that's what it's worth, right?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Crazy, crazy.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
Let's see, Dartitsia in chat says, there's also that US release of Holy Diver. I think Famicom carts of that are still pretty expensive.

16:52.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm sure, you know, we'll see maybe more and more homebrew stuff that shows up with these types of things, which it seems like, you know, as some of the patents and copyrights of this cartridge technology.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
And just the fact that the technology is more and more easily, like, you know, obtainable by regular people like you and me.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
I think we might see more, like, homebrew that shows up in these types of cartridges.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Anyway.

17:14.000 --> 17:21.000
Alright, well, I just wanted to see what you guys thought of this, and if it was something that you think would be a valuable addition to your collection.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
But it sounds like maybe the original, the OG, is still the best to get at the end of the day.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
Anyway, if you guys have additional thoughts on that, you can always email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
In the meantime, I think we're going to get into how was your gaming week, and we're going to start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
I am, I played stuff. I actually did things.

17:42.000 --> 17:55.000
What I did is I played the Kirby game, finally, because JD loaned it to me, and I was really actually pleased to finally give a chance to play it.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
I got through the whole first stage, you know, the first whatever world it is, and had a really good time. It's super fun.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
It's not, like, terribly difficult, but I wasn't really expecting it to be.

18:05.000 --> 18:15.000
I also picked up two games. I finally actually put in to buy a reproduction game for Dan, because we've had zero luck finding it.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
So I picked up Ninja 5-0 for Dan, or as it was, Ninja Cop. He hasn't played it yet, but he's also been really busy.

18:22.000 --> 18:36.000
And then I picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner for Sega Saturn, which I am going to need translations to be able to play it, but I wanted it. The price was right.

18:36.000 --> 18:56.000
And other than that, I've been playing, what's the game, Idol Poring. I've been playing some Pokemon Go, and I've been playing, I've actually gotten back into Bejeweled, honestly enough, which it's like my mindless, I need to relax game.

18:56.000 --> 19:07.000
So that's what I'm playing, and I've given up on that Bust-A-Move, Puzzle Bobble, buy tickets to continue game, because it just turned into shit.

19:07.000 --> 19:17.000
It's got modes in there that I don't like, and, oh no, not that one, PEGGLE. It was PEGGLE. I want the old PEGGLE back, and it doesn't work on iOS 11, so I have a sad face over that.

19:17.000 --> 19:38.000
And then a lot of pinball, because we've got the getaway and we're playing it. I will go ahead and say this, on Friday, May 18th, if you are in Northern California, come to the Golden State Pinball Expo in Lodi. It will be amazing, it will be fun, and you can play the same getaway that I keep cussing at. And that's it.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Did they pay for that commercial?

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
No. I want people to yell at it too, because it's a bitch.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

19:46.000 --> 19:58.000
It was good, I played lots of Dance Dance Revolution still, and then I also played a bit more of Super Mario Odyssey, so I finally just made it to the Metro Kingdom.

19:59.000 --> 20:23.000
Because unlike my son, who's already beat the game, and now he told me today that he unlocked the dark side of the moon, I've been just collecting as many moons in each of the levels as I can as I go through it, so it's been progressing a little bit slower, but more of a completionist in that sense, I guess.

20:23.000 --> 20:38.000
Then what else? I've been kind of trying to figure out what I want to get for the Switch, actually, because I was staring at the lineup of games that they had at GameStop today, and honestly, I don't know, it doesn't seem like there's much out there.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
I mean, I know there's a lot of indie games that are on the platform, but not a lot of them really kind of say, hey, buy me.

20:45.000 --> 20:55.000
I don't know, it's just kind of hard to decide what I want to get, so I haven't gotten anything other than the three games that I have now.

20:55.000 --> 21:06.000
What else did I play? I played a little bit of PlayStation VR, because we had some guests over, so we got that back out again, so more Job Simulator.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
Is the PlayStation VR kind of like the Wii U was, where it's your party system?

21:11.000 --> 21:20.000
Well, yeah, it's more of a lot of people that haven't played VR games, so two kids that were over, they hadn't played VR games, and they've been really wanting to play VR games.

21:20.000 --> 21:30.000
That's interesting, though, because I think, sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I think a lot of people have been apprehensive about VR, because only the person with the VR headset on can really experience the VR.

21:31.000 --> 21:47.000
Not necessarily, yeah, you can have it on TV. The one game we played, and I tried to see, my youngest son wants to play the VR games, but since a lot of the games we have are the early VR games, they're not entirely the best when it comes to setting things up.

21:48.000 --> 21:57.000
For example, I tried the one kid that came over, he wanted to play Superhot, because he's watched a lot of YouTube videos of people playing Superhot, and he wanted to try that out.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
So I popped in Superhot, but I couldn't get it to go back to the first level, and I had no fucking clue on how to do anything.

22:03.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm like, how do I get this back to the first level in this thing? Is that even possible? Because it didn't seem possible, there was no fucking menu anywhere.

22:11.000 --> 22:26.000
So I was like, I don't know what the fuck to do with this, so we ended up moving on to something else, and then it came to Job Simulator, which Job Simulator, they have you kind of calibrate the system a little bit, but then you have to raise and lower the floor to make it so that the height feels right to you.

22:26.000 --> 22:34.000
The problem is they don't really have anything to kind of give you context to the height. There's a grid on the floor, but you can't tell how big that grid's supposed to be.

22:35.000 --> 22:43.000
Here's a counter that's supposed to be waist high or something, so get this so that it looks like the counter is waist high to you, and then be okay.

22:43.000 --> 22:52.000
Because the first time I did it, it was way too low. It looked like he was a baby trying to reach stuff, and it was just way too low, so we had to recalibrate again, and it was way too high.

22:52.000 --> 23:00.000
And it was a pain in the ass, because I just want to play the game, and I have to keep calibrating this bullshit until I get it right.

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
And trying to do that with a kid, trying to get them to calibrate it, it's a fucking pain in the ass. So they need to do it much better in other games.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
But they had fun anyways, once we finally got it calibrated after the third or fourth time.

23:13.000 --> 23:25.000
And I assume that's just because that's an earlier VR game, now they probably have better solutions for that. I don't know, I just wish it would be patched better or something like that.

23:26.000 --> 23:39.000
But yeah, I think the other game we played too was the PlayStation VR, it was the Playroom VR.

23:39.000 --> 23:48.000
So that free game that they have with all the robots and stuff, the Sony stuff. So what's kind of cool about that one is they have stuff that multiple people can play at the same time.

23:48.000 --> 23:58.000
So they had one where my son was this giant monster thing, and he had to chase after other robots, which were us.

23:58.000 --> 24:06.000
And so we had controllers that were controlling those. But the problem is, it was giving him instructions on his headset, and I couldn't see what those instructions were.

24:06.000 --> 24:16.000
And because he's only four and can't read, it made it hard for him to play that. I'm like, well, I know from the trailer that it had the kid roaring, so why don't you try roaring?

24:16.000 --> 24:27.000
Because I think that's maybe what you're supposed to do. And it was hilarious, because all it did is it voice-changed his roar to sound like the chipmunks or something like that.

24:27.000 --> 24:39.000
It's like, Roar! Roar! It was ridiculous. But I don't know what he was supposed to do, because the instructions were only on his screen, and like I said, he couldn't read it, so fuck if I know.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
But he had fun anyways.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
Okay, that's good. Kids like that dumb stuff too, or it's like voice-changing and all that silly stuff.

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah, I mean, it's just hard to... they need to... UI is a big thing. UI and calibration is like a must.

24:54.000 --> 25:02.000
People developing these games need to understand that this has to be perfect in order to be able to play the game well.

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
I don't know, I just don't think that some of these games were there. But that's like launch games, so newer stuff I'm sure is better now.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Fair enough.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
And then of course, Pokemon Go, I've been playing a little bit of that, and I don't know, that's about it.

25:17.000 --> 25:24.000
Sia Tabiri in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the young Simba voice, the roar, just can't wait to be king.

25:24.000 --> 25:33.000
It's pretty much, like it was funny because he was talking, and it's super high-pitched, and I'm like, I don't know what the point of that is, but it was silly.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
And he also, he wants me to get the Labo stuff, like we were looking at it again.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Oh boy.

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
And I'm like, there are so many things against why I should do this. One, they want the robot ones.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
They're gonna break it.

25:45.000 --> 25:54.000
They want the robot one, the robot one's $80. And I'm like, I know, if I buy this, you're gonna play it a couple times, and you're gonna get bored with it immediately.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And then they're gonna throw a tantrum and smash it.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
They're not gonna throw a tantrum and smash it, but it's gonna be some crap that's...

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Sorry, your wife is gonna throw a tantrum and smash it.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
It's gonna be some crap that's gonna be sitting in a room somewhere because it's fucking huge.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
So I'm like, I don't, I can't see this as being...

26:09.000 --> 26:20.000
That's been holding me back too. Now, I don't have the whole kid factor, but you know, I like creation type of games, and you know, in theory, I like Labo, except I still don't get like, where's the game?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
But anyway, that's all there's to it.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
It's a Nintendo move. It's the tech demo, let's sell it as a game.

26:26.000 --> 26:35.000
You know what, I like it in the way that I like Legos, and it's cool. I'm not gonna like knock Labo. It's just, it's not for me because I need to have less shit in this house, not more shit.

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
And that's exactly the problem. Like, you know, even Alan was teasing me because we saw it in the store the other day. He's like, oh, you want to get the Nintendo Labo, get the piano?

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
And I'm like, really? You really want me to bring that in the house? You really want another thing that we gotta find a place for in the house?

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
I mean, it's neat, but it's just like, I don't see myself playing that, or even my kids playing that long term.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm like, there's no way. First off, they won't build it. It'll be me building that thing.

26:58.000 --> 27:05.000
And second, it'll be me building that thing and them going, is it done yet? I want to play! Why is it taking so long?

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
It's like, so it's gonna be that. And then they're gonna play it, and they're gonna have fun with it.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
And then they're gonna fight over who gets to play it. And then they're gonna play it for a while.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
And then they're gonna be bored with it. And then it's gonna be, you know, they'll do it for a few days.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
And they'll be like, hey, you wanna play the robot game? And they'll be like, no, that's boring.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
So it's just 80 bucks.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dart Tetsuya says,

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
yeah, you wouldn't believe all the videos that have come out with people making stuff with some of the kits.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
I will say that much. Are they doing hacks? Like IKEA hacks?

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
No, you can actually program your own things. So they have a toolbox or lab mode or something like that

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
where you can build your own things out of it.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
And, I mean, some of it's kind of cool, I guess.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
But I don't know what the, I don't know how much utility there is there other than playing with that for a little bit.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
I just don't think it's, it's not like a Mario Maker or something like that where you're gonna play the game

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
and you're gonna get a lot of use out of it. And there's a lot more, you know, playability with it.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
I think a lot of these things, it is, well, like even with a variety pack, there's not a lot of playability there.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
I mean, you can do music stuff. I mean, sure, with the piano thing.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
But it's not something that's gonna be, you're gonna get burnt out on it really fast.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
If I had a kid who was like musically inclined, I would totally snatch that Labo thing up.

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
Actually, and I think I've said this about Labo before, like Labo would have been the thing I wanted when I was like 9 or 10.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
That would have been amazing. Because, you know, I was into music, I was into Legos, I'm into video games.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
It's a perfect marriage of all those things. So, like, Labo is for me just like a little late.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
But anyway. My gaming week. Types of video games I've been playing this week.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
So, of course, I've been playing Pokemon Go because I love my Pokemon Go.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
And I finally got Mew in Pokemon Go. So, I think that's kind of like a landmark thing is I finally got Mew.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
I kind of took my time with the quest. Like, I know a lot of people got that a long time ago.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
But I was like, you know, they're not gonna push anything new. Like, it's not like they're gonna come out with Celebi next week.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
You know, it's gonna take some time before they put out, you know, more quests.

29:11.000 --> 29:19.000
So, I'll just kind of take my time and that way I don't kind of burn myself out trying to chase down like, you know, 10 ghost types or 400 Magikarp candies or, you know, all the stuff.

29:19.000 --> 29:27.000
Although the events they've been doing, they've been doing a lot more like regular events in Pokemon Go that have, I think, really helped just kind of keep that game more interesting.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
So, that's pretty cool.

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
And I'm getting EX raid passes all of a sudden. Like, I have an EX raid pass for Monday and I have another one for the Monday after.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
So, that was weird because I wasn't getting any before and now I'm getting like EX raid passes. It just sucks that they're on Monday, but I'll make it work.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Are they like local or are they just like...

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
They're by my work. So, they're not like here, but they're local to my work.

29:47.000 --> 29:55.000
And it makes sense because I've been known to at lunch. I'll go and walk around a park and if there's like a Magikarp or, you know, a one star, two star on the gym, I'll do it.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
And that's how I've gotten these raid passes. So, you know, that's kind of a thing.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
So, I'm still playing Pokemon Go and...

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Let's see, what else have I been playing?

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
Honestly, when it comes to like other games, just a little bit of Minecraft.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
Don't worry, Loki. I haven't been leaving you out. I'm waiting for Bobby to get back so he can get into that realms thing.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So, I'm trying not to burn myself out of Minecraft.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
So, for the most part, I've put that on hold, but I did play that a little bit.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
I've been playing... Like, the game I just suddenly like got obsessed with all over again is Diablo 3.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I've been playing a ton of Diablo 3.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
And I know, like, this was a game I was probably talking about a year or two ago that I was playing a lot.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
And it's just kind of one of those things where something clicked on.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
And just something about that real like zen way, you just kind of sit there and kill, kill, kill, die.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I'm playing a wizard, so it's all like pew, pew laser beams.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
So, I just melt things with my little lasers like...

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
You know, and everything like dies and I get loot.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
And there's just something very satisfying about murdering hell demons and getting loot.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
So, I've been playing a lot of it.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Like, to put it in perspective, I think during last week...

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
I've probably been playing a little bit up to last week's show, but I wasn't level 70 yet.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
I'm already paragon 230 now.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
So, I've been playing a little bit and I'm already up through like being able to do like a greater 45,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
which is like equivalent of a Torment 10.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
Which is, you know, it's not the best, but it's, you know, I've been investing a little time in it.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And then here's another random one.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Maybe Jamie will appreciate this, I don't know.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
But on the Xbox One, you know, they give away the free games with gold.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
One of the things they're giving away this month is the Streets of Rage collection on the 360.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
You know who doesn't have an Xbox One?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Uh, you.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
But Streets of Rage.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I already have cartridges.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
Yeah, so I had a feeling that was gonna be you as you're like, oh, I already got...

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I actually have a bare knuckle.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Do you?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Yeah.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Nice. The collection's cool.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
So, I played a little bit.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
I played a little Streets of Rage 1 and I think I made it up through like the second boss.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
And then I was like, okay.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
I remember these old beat-em-up games were the shit in the 90s.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Now they feel really repetitive.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Kind of sucks.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Yeah.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Like, I don't know.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Even the Ninja Turtles arcade game.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Like, it's awesome for like a little bit.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
And then you're like, God, this is really repetitive.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
Because you're missing the dark pizza-filled, you know, smell-filled rooms.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Maybe.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Maybe, yeah.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Where you were kind of limited on one quarter into 15 minutes for your pizza to be ready.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
That's what I'm saying.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
That's what I'm saying.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Like, I remember and I don't know maybe if it's just different nowadays.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
But like, I remember like pizza and like arcades and stuff like that were like very dark.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Like, Chuck E. Cheese is like fucking bright now.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
I remember it being like some dark-ass, you know, arcade.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
The Chuck E. Cheese's that I went to had like darker rooms.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
But most of the like big areas were kind of lit.

32:28.000 --> 32:37.000
But I mean, when for me all up until like my late teens, we had an Aladdin's castle that had carpeted walls.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
And it was dark.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
And it had a smoking section.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
So, there would be the occasional cigarette burn on the machine.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
And it was dark and wonderful.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
And then of course playing, you know, on roller skates at the roller rink too.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
Because like I said, I still can't play Frogger without being on roller skates to this day.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Love it.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Agdeft with the clarification there saying, Streets of Rage is actually 360.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah, right.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I should have been more clear with that.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Even though I'm playing it on Xbox One, it is free through Games with Gold.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
And it is a 360, like the vintage collection.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
I also don't want to pay.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
Well, but if you're already paying for Games with Gold, which if you want to play Xbox online, you get anyway.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Then you get Streets of Rage for that.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
You know, for what I could pay for Games with Gold, that could be a few tacos.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
It could be tacos. It is taco money.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Tacos are amazing.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Tacos are great.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I love tacos.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Let's see, also in chat.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Sia Tabiri talking about Pokemon Go saying,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
For the longest time I thought Mr. Mime was pronounced Mr. Mime.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
Because it seemed weird that they'd have that word be the English pronunciation.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
You know how I knew it was Mr. Mime?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
The cartoon.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Because all those little fuckers say their names over and over.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Mr. Mime!

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Mr. Mime!

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
Except, is that his name?

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
No, that's not his name on the Japanese one.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Oh, did he get a different name in Japan?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
It's Barriered.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Ah, there you go. That's why.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
So, yeah.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
Only a very small handful of them kept their Japanese name.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Like Pikachu?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Which, by the way, not on the show world tonight,

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
but did you hear that random story about how Pikachu supposedly had another evolution in the game?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
It was like Gorochu or something like that?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It was supposed to be like an evolved Raichu.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Gorochu, does it get like six arms?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
No, but it gets buff and it was supposed to, like I think,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
don't quote me on this guys, but I think it was something about it had horns and little vampire teeth.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Which sounds really adorable.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
But, um, yeah.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
And it would have been, it could have been, I guess they took it out for balance reasons,

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
but I'm thinking, like, Raichu's really not that powerful?

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
No one uses Raichu, and it sucks that the Pikachus are so fucking hard to catch in the first place.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
It's like, you're fucking useless, stupid Pikachu.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
I don't know, why are you so hard to catch?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Poor Pikachu. Alright, anyway. But he's cute.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Anyway, I guess that's really it for my gaming week.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
So, let's get into some housekeeping.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
We will not be here towards the end of June,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
although we will be having our 16th anniversary show.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
We're really old, you guys.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
We're going to be having our 16th anniversary show on June 17th.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
The best reward for 16 years hard working, a week off.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
So we won't be here on June 24th.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
Speaking of weeks off, Dark Soccer's not going to be here next week.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Yeah.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
But for a really good reason. You're ditching us for Drag Queens.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
I'm going to Drag Con.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Yeah, not Dragun Con.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
No, Drag Con.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Where there will be cosplay.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
There will be queens.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
My pal Aria Snark from Shaking and Crying is going to be there with you, so that will be fun.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
And if anyone wants to find me, I will be at the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence booth

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
on Friday in the afternoon, like sometime after 3 something.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Cool.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
And around the same time, actually 2 I think, on Saturday.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Awesome.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
So I will be there working the table with the sisters.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I will be working it.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
Well, speaking of Dragun Con, since we're leading from drag to Dragun Con,

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
I can confirm that I will be at Dragun Con this Labor Day.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
So, and I'm on the website and everything, which is really nice.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
So very, very happy and excited to be working with the podcasting track again.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
I probably won't know my schedule till less than a month before,

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
but as soon as I know what panels I'll be on, I'll be sure to let you guys all know.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
So check that out in Atlanta this Labor Day.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
If you can't catch Jamie in LA this week.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I'll also be at Disneyland if anyone happens to be there.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Are you offering to ride Space Mountain with the listeners?

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
No.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Okay.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Only if they give me the front seat.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Okay.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
I mean, if someone wants to buy me a churro, I won't say no.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
They have some good churros. Don't they have all the special stuff at Disney now?

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
The last time I was at Disneyland, they had the golden churros,

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
which are like the gold sugar.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
The only one that I really want to try is the carrot cake churro,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
which is, I think, in Frontierland.

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
Except the cream cheese frosting that comes with it has fucking raisins in it.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
And raisins are disgusting and vile and they're...

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Didn't we have this discussion before?

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
They're vile little liars.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
All right.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Ruiners of cookies.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
Let's get into some ruiners of gaming news here at Orange Lounge Radio,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
together with you guys in our chat at live.vogue.com.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
What's going on in gaming news this week? Loki.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
So the FTC basically are giving Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
a 30-day window to change their warranty language

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
to let consumers know that they can make repairs

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
or use third-party replacement products without voiding those warranties.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
So you may remember, we talked about this a few weeks ago,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
how they said in a press release that there are certain languages

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
in these warranty or end-user license agreements that were basically illegal,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
but no one was really kind of enforcing that.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
So now they're kind of coming down on them.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
So basically this kind of includes a lot of things like,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
you know, you may see those stickers on your console

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
where it says, warranty void if removed or damaged.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I know I had to deal with that with my 360s

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
because they would have that, you know,

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
oh hey, you can't open your 360 up to do anything.

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
But now they have to basically allow them that they can't have those.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Because it won't void the warranty if there's something done to it.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
And also they have to have the right to repair,

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
which allows people to take them to a third-party location to have them repaired.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
Also they were saying that they've also sent letters out to

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
HTC, Asus, and Hyundai as well.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
But yeah, so it'd be interesting to see how that kind of,

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
I'm sure it's just going to be some fixes to their, you know,

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
warranty jargon or whatever.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
Yeah, this is an interesting little change because of like everything

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
that's kind of, you know, trickled down from that original little thing

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
that they kind of yelled at Nintendo about, right?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Yeah.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
So, I mean, it's good that you have other people, you know,

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
being able to fix those consoles and stuff.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I mean, I used to just ignore it anyways.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
Or even better is you'd find a way to take the warranty sticker off

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
and then put it back on.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Put it back on.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
I just get it a little bit hot, or it's like steaming open the envelope.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
So, you know, it's, I don't know.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I think if you're taking it someplace to get it repaired,

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
it's like, well, fuck it.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
They're not going to, you know,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
why are you taking it someplace to get it repaired third-party

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
if the original company's not going to fix it?

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
I seem to remember back in the day,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
with the earlier Sony consoles and maybe even Nintendo stuff,

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
you had your official authorized repair people.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Yeah, they don't do that anymore.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
It's more, you have to, like, send that stuff in to them.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Oh, well.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Showing my age.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
I don't know.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Okay.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I mean, good.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
I think anybody should be able to repair that stuff, you know.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
They shouldn't, your warranty shouldn't be voided,

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
especially for even, like, using third-party devices,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
like third-party products because, I mean,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
we had this whole, just recently, the whole thing with the third-party docks.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Right, that's like what I was talking about with the third-party docks

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
and, like, they were, like, fucking up consoles

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
and one of them came down really hard on Nintendo about that whole thing.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Yeah, it's like, there's no reason that should be fucking up your console.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Yeah.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
You should get a little bit of choice into how to repair that stuff,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
although I understand that they don't want people to go in there and just, you know, like...

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Well, they don't want people modifying their device and they also, like...

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
They don't want to have to pay for your fuck-up.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Yeah, basically.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I get that.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I get that, but, you know, come on.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Well, moving on to a different story about Nintendo.

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
Let's talk about reading since Dark Sakura is going to DragCon this week.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
You want to talk about reading? Let's talk about reading.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
No.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
The library is open.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Let's actually talk about reading

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
because Nintendo is pairing up with publisher Random House

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
for some books that are based on Nintendo characters.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
These are books that are going to be coming in January of 2019 per Nintendo.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
The books, the first two of which entered the marketplace in early January,

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
are based on Nintendo characters and worlds, including Super Mario,

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and Animal Crossing.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
So earlier this year in January,

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
Random House actually started two full-color official sticker books

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
based on Super Mario and Legend of Zelda.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
So there's, like, the Super Mario official sticker book

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
and The Legend of Zelda official sticker book.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
These are both $12.99.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
This summer, Mario Time and Link's Book of Adventure are coming out.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
There's going to also be a Splatoon official sticker book,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
and, yeah, this is all sorts of fun things coming out.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
So I'm not sure. It's weird that it's like,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
okay, they're talking about there's books that are already out,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
but then I guess there's also this team-up that's happening in 2019.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
I don't know if that means we're going beyond stickers

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
and getting into, like, actual, like,

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
that's what it kind of reads like to me that we're actually, pun intended,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
that we're actually getting into, like, books based on characters.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
You know, like, maybe, like, a Dr. Seuss novel

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
but starring Mario type of thing.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Um...

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Yeah.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Not a fan?

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
No. I mean, I know they do, like, a lot of the licensed stuff, but, you know.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
I don't want to read about Mario. I'd rather play Mario.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
Okay, my brain instantly goes to, and I know some of y'all remember this,

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
but those Worlds of Power books from when,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
God, it was probably, like, the late 80s, early 90s,

42:25.000 --> 42:31.000
when they turned, like, Castlevania 2, Ninja Gaiden,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
was Contra a book too? I don't remember.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
No, it was Mega Man. One of the Mega Mans was a book too.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
They turned a bunch of old, like, video games from Nintendo, like, into books,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
and they were, like, young adult novels.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Like, they were the types of things that, like,

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
you know, they were maybe, like, 100 pages in slightly bigger font,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
but, you know, for an 11-year-old, it was, you know,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
it was summertime reading for that.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I distinctly remember those books.

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
Blaster Master, that was a big one, because the Blaster Master one,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
even though the books were not really, like,

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
nobody involved with the official games were involved with those books,

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
I think there was something about the people who made Blaster Master

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
actually incorporated something from that book into Blaster Master canon later on.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
It was kind of a big deal. So, do you remember those?

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Am I the only one that remembers these?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
No, but I do remember something that's kind of random,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
is I remember that they had some Nintendo scratchers,

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
not, like, you know, lottery tickets, but they're for kids,

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
where you play a little game where you had to, like, kind of,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
it was kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure type thing,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
but you had to scratch off the little spots,

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
and it would let you know if you, like, got killed or whatever.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I don't remember. But I remember they had some-

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
You were eaten by a grew.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
It was, like, I think the original Mario Brothers,

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
not, like, the new, you know, like, Super Mario Brothers.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
I remember, though. I do remember having those.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Yes. They were, like, little maze cards, right?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Yeah, I remember those.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Yeah.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
That was the thing.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I don't know what they were, but, like, I sort of remember that.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Let's see. D'Artizia says,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I remember seeing pictures of the scratch cards,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
and also Metal Gear had a book, I think, in that series.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Yes, it did.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Metal Gear absolutely had a book.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
And it wasn't bad.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
At least my 11-year-old self thought it wasn't bad.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Now, if I probably went back and read it now,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I'd probably be like, this is trash.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
I'm gonna go looking for it.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Are you gonna-

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
I wanna say that the complete text is available online.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
Oh, yeah, the PDF is out there, but hold on.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
There's actually a Metal Gear Solid novel.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Not Metal Gear Solid.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
I know, I'm looking for the old book.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Worlds of Power.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
I'm almost positive it was called that.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
It was, like, Blaster Master was one.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Anyway, Kaijiro in chat says,

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
I'm gonna start a new trend on Twitch with those sticker books.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
It's gonna be called Let's Read.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
I actually have a friend who does a lot of that on his channel.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Holy shit, they went 43 bucks for this.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
For those books?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
For the Metal Gear one.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Dang.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
July 1st, 1990.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
It wasn't that good.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
There's the Blaster Master book.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
There's a Ninja Gaiden book.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Yep, I remember these.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
I'm just looking at the list of them.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
I had them all.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
You could get them at the grocery store.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
Like, it was the same people that did the steamy romance novels.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
It's just that, you know, it was like a young adult thing.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Dude, I actually more want the Ninja Gaiden one.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Do you remember when the grocery stores would sell steamy romance novels?

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
They still do.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Do they still do?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
They're just over in the, like, magazine section.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
See, the magazine section isn't, like, prominent anymore.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
It's, like, hidden away with, like, because who buys magazines?

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Ooh, okay, so I can get the Ninja Gaiden one for $5.94.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
But yeah, they still have trashy novels.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
That's all that's there.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Trashy novels and, like, magazines that no one's read.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
I didn't think trashy novels were, like, still a thing.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Oh god, they are.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Yeah.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Okay.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
How do you know all this?

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
It's in good condition.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
I know because I look at those.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
I'm like, those are dumb.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Who would buy that?

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
And then I look at the magazines.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Those are also dumb.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Who would buy those?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
And then I go purchase, like, what else is on the aisle?

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
No, it's not candy.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
It's, like, it's cleaning supplies.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
Like, it's, I need to go get some dishwasher pods.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
Okay, like, if I'm at Rite Aid or something, there's always, like, the, like, OK magazine.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
And, like, all the, all the ridiculous shit.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Like, I don't know who is buying, like, Inquirer and Weekly.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I don't even think Weekly World News is around anymore.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
But other stuff like it.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Oh, I love Weekly World News.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Like, this is, like, the complete, it's always, like, some horrible picture of Hillary Clinton.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
And it's, like, Killory did this this week.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
You know, it's, like, totally, like, like, all these, like, just straight up, like, made-up shit.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
That's, like, on these magazines.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Or, you know, Cher given six months to live.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
And, like, this really horrible picture of Cher or something like that.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Like, I'm like, who buys this garbage?

46:27.000 --> 46:33.000
So, VG Museum that hosts the Castlevania dungeon has the Simon's Quest book as PDF.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Oh, okay.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I'm sorry, as a Word version of plain text.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Interesting.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
I wouldn't think that's legal, but maybe after so many years, maybe it's public domain at some point?

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
No.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Well, I'm saving it because I'm going to read it.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Yeah, literary stuff shouldn't go into the public domain after just 30 years.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I mean, it's not even quite been 30 years, so.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
It's probably illegal, but they're probably just not selling those books anymore.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
So, no harm, no foul, I suppose.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I'm sure they stopped selling those a long time ago.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
Well, anyway, if you want to get some new books, you'll be able to get Random House doing some Nintendo books in the near future.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
You know, it does kind of make sense, though, before we go to the next story.

47:06.000 --> 47:14.000
It does kind of make sense because Nintendo's kind of like ramping up with this whole, you know, we thought they were never going to let the rights away to make a movie again.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Well, they're going to be making a movie.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
They're going to be doing this theme park stuff that's, you know, coming to Universal Studios.

47:19.000 --> 47:30.000
So, maybe Nintendo is kind of learning to let go of some of the licensing a little bit and not keeping it so close to their chest, realizing that they're not going to do it all, so they might as well let somebody do it that, you know, puts Mario.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I mean, Mario is like fucking Mickey Mouse at this point.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Right?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Like, everybody knows who fucking Mario is.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Anyway.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Moving on, some more stories.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Dark Sakura.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
You'll have to tear yourself away from your new book.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Oh, I just linked it in the chatroom.

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
At any rate, though, we had talked before a few weeks ago about the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
They had their nominees.

47:52.000 --> 48:02.000
Well, now they have decided which ones are going to be the final four as it is.

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
It's going to be John Madden Football, Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy VII, and Space War.

48:08.000 --> 48:15.000
And these are, of course, were all selected from a player's choice ballot and then an advisory board.

48:15.000 --> 48:24.000
So, you know, to be accepted, they have to be iconic and have stood the test of time and must have worldwide appeal.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
So, I guess I could see John Madden Football.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I mean, the original John Madden Football.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Yeah.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
Tomb Raider, yeah, I'd give it that too.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
It is franchise spawning, you know, and is still going today.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
Final Fantasy VII, got the fan following.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Still a decent game.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And Sephiroth's hair.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
And Space War, pretty classic.

48:47.000 --> 48:55.000
So, of course, you know, you might not have played it if you were not around in 1962.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
I don't know.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
I cannot say that I was around in 1962 to play that game.

48:59.000 --> 49:06.000
Although, actually, it was the original one that was the 1962, but it did go, you know, and spread as it went through.

49:06.000 --> 49:18.000
And then Computer Space was the first mass market version as distributed by Nolan Bushnell.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
So, there you go.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
All right.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Very cool.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Do you think the right selections were made?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Yeah.

49:27.000 --> 49:33.000
I remember talking about this before when the nominees were out, because DDR was on the list of nominees.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
And I was like, I don't think that one's going to get picked.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
It's not the year.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Now's not the time.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Now is not your year, DDR.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
I mean, there's logic behind them.

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
And I'm glad that, you know, something that was more of a pioneering game like Space War,

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
was included this time.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Yeah, for sure.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
Yeah.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Makes sense.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
All right.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Let's move on.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Loki.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
So, this week, they had a new trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
And along with that, there's some press outlets that have been kind of talking about the game,

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
since they got a 45-minute demo of Red Dead Redemption 2 at Rockstar North.

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
So, they were talking about some of what they saw, because, I guess, they wasn't playable,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
but they got the watch through.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
So, with it, I guess the game is going to have the honor system returning back from the original game.

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
So, depending on how you interact with people in the game, it will affect on how other people will, you know, see you,

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
whether you're evil or good and that type of stuff.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
They talked about how there's, you know, different ways you can handle situations.

50:33.000 --> 50:39.000
So, like, one instance, they were saying how there was, you know, a lot of people in the game,

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
one instance, they were saying how there was a fishing camp that you can loot and then the fishermen catch you.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
And so, you can either, you know, give everything back, you can threaten them, or you can kill them.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
And those are your kind of options there.

50:56.000 --> 51:04.000
They said that, you know, the game, of course, they're trying to, they're saying that they're not trying to outdo them,

51:05.000 --> 51:10.000
any other company, or, like, when you, since there's a lot of different open world games now,

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
like Zelda and Assassin's Creed, Far Cry 5 and that type of stuff.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
So, they're basically trying to outdo themselves, which is great because I consider, you know,

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
Rockstar Games one of the best open world game companies out there.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
And then one thing they did not show, though, was multiplayer.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
So, I guess we're going to have to wait for E3 to see some of that.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
But they did announce during the trailer when the game's scheduled to come out,

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
which is October 26th on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
No word on PC yet, which is kind of disappointing.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
I would love it on PC, but usually with the last few games, PC comes later.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
So, we'll just wait.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
Yeah, because aren't they, like, worried about rampant piracy on PC and all that stuff?

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
I don't know if that's really the case any, I mean, sure, I guess,

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
but, like, I think they don't really necessarily care anymore

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
because a lot of that's not necessarily made on the game's sales anymore.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
It's made on, you know, the online currency,

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
so I don't really think that it's such an issue anymore.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
So, do you think that maybe they should just make Red Dead Free?

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
No, it's definitely worth money.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
And unlike, you know, some games that just have the online component,

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
I mean, it is a solid single player campaign,

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
so I would definitely say it's worth the $60 at least.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
I mean, the original game was fantastic,

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
so I have no doubts that it's going to be a great game.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with vognetwork.com,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
use the passphrase BANKER.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
Yeah, even I'm curious to check it out, but you know how it goes.

52:50.000 --> 52:56.000
Yes, I know. How much time we played Grand Theft Auto 5.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Why am I being attacked?

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
You brought it up.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
Dungeonbuster in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
the poster for Red Dead Redemption 2 makes the main character look a bit like Charles Bronson.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
I would play an open world Western as Charles Bronson.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
It's not Bronson, but remember they tried to do a,

53:18.000 --> 53:25.000
what was it, it was a Dirty Harry game, but that never ended up happening.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
I remember that was like E3 2006 or something like that.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
Alright, well moving on to patent court, patent trolls,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
well not really, I don't know if you'd call this a troll though.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
I mean, we have stories on the show all the time about trolls,

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
but this one is going to be kind of...

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
A reach maybe?

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
It's a little bit open to interpretation I think.

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
So let's talk about this one because Nintendo is apparently being sued,

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
or taken to court by Gamevice.

53:55.000 --> 54:01.000
This is a company that made the WikiPad and some Snap-on controllers for mobile devices.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
So you know how like there's no official controller for like Apple phones or for Android,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
you know there's no official controller.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
So these are folks that make little devices that kind of like cling to your phone

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
and become controllers that basically will work with games and stuff.

54:15.000 --> 54:21.000
So basically they say that the Nintendo Switch violates the patents on attachable handheld gamepads

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
and the related accessories.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Gamevice is requesting a cease and desist order against Nintendo,

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
meaning the Switch would be halted for its imports into the US.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
Nintendo has declined to comment on the investigation,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
and we'll see what Gamevice has to say soon.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
It's going to get thrown out.

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
As should be noted, Gamevice sued Nintendo already in August for violating the WikiPad patents.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
It dropped it in October.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
So...

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
This is going to get thrown out.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
You think so?

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
I think so.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Well, and here's the thing is that usually we say troll

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
because usually these are coming from companies that aren't actively using patents.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
Like they're just sitting on these things they've acquired that just sit in a storage thing somewhere.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
Whereas now, okay, at least you can say this company, Gamevice,

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
they've been making things that snap onto devices,

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
but does the Switch really infringe on that?

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
That's the question.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
I don't think so.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
I think one thing that the Switch does too, you have to remember,

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
is that those devices, they latch onto multiple things too.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Wouldn't that be kind of a big...

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
Like that's a big difference because you can take those things,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
you can use them individually,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
which is another kind of distinction,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
is that they're not like...

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
You can use them individually and that's one way.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
You can put them on the dog ears, that's another way.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Or you can put them on the tablet and that's another way.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
So they're not used for one function, they're used for multiple functions,

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
and being on the tablet is just one of them.

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
But then again, I'm not going to claim to be a lawyer when it comes to patents,

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
so I don't fucking know.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
But it just seems like this is different enough to me.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
And they're not the only company that's had...

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I mean, I'm sure that...

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
I think Nintendo has copyrights or trademarks or whatever

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
on certain aspects of their controller anyways.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
That's true.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
It's like, you want to play that type of game?

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
I'm sure they could sue you over some sort of patent issue or whatever,

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
but I don't...

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Is Gamefy still making these things? I don't even know.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
I mean, the problem with the third-party controllers for phones

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
is that since there is no standard, a lot of them are garbage

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
because they only work with certain games.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
It does look like garbage too.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
And the other big difference is that the Switch is an integral part

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
of the function of the device,

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
whereas this is a peripheral.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
The Nintendo system is a flat-out system.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
That's a good point.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I'm wondering also, too, being that each controller,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
each half can be used as its own controller,

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
if that's also different enough as well.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
It would be interesting to see.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
I don't know.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
I think they can...

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I mean, sure, you can try.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Just don't think they're going to win.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
Well, we'll see what happens.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
Maybe they'll be trying to settle out a court or something.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
ASCII in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
another company trying to get rich quick.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
They were never going to do anything with their old technology anyway.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
Well, to be fair, they have put out these...

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Unlike other patent trolls we see,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
they have put out a device that works for cell phones.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I don't know if it's sold very well.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I mean, I haven't heard of it before,

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
so maybe they need to recoup some of those costs.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
I don't know.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
But that is why I was a little hesitant to flat-out call it a troll

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
because when it's trolls, like these companies,

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
they make their income off of suing people.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
This company, you know, you could argue, well...

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
They're trying to supplement their income by suing.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Yes, exactly.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Perfect.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
SEO 100 Matt does point out they do have a legit website.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Their products are sold in mass chains.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
So this is a little different, a little different.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Sia Tabiri in chat says,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
didn't Apple basically get patents on the home button

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
and multi-touch functionality at some point

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
and then eventually it was, oh yeah, no,

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
that's too vague to actually enforce.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
The trademark copyright stuff in this country is so...

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It doesn't work.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
You're taking rules that were written

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
before technology existed.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
It's allegedly violations of the tariff act of 1930.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
Because 1930 knew what the fucking internet

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
or like video games and all that stuff was going to do.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
Plus I think there's been subsequent cases since then

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
that have shown that certain aspects of those prior laws

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
are now considered irrelevant

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
and completely have no basis in modern society.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
And plus as travel gets faster,

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
as the internet makes the world more and more global,

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
I mean, we've seen where like other countries

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
will just straight up rip shit off

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
and there's no price to pay because they're not in the US.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
So that further complicates...

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Looking at you, China.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Well, yeah, I mean, but interestingly enough about China,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
you know, there has been talk about, you know,

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
not that I really want to get into politics discussion here on the show,

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
but there has been talk about China has been kind of called out

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
for this on a political level

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
and has agreed to some extent to work on it.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
And we'll kind of leave it at that. We don't know what that means.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
But at least it means something that they kind of acknowledged it.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Something.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
Anyway, that's more than we've had for, you know, years.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
Anyway, Dr. Suyin Chat says,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I mean, I could almost see where they're coming from,

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
but agree the trademark laws need serious updating and revising.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
As Dr. Suyin Chat says,

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
it's going to take a lot to fix the patent copyright trademark laws in this country.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
It needs to happen, no question.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Well, I think one of the right moves that they're making, though,

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
is that, and I think this was a very recent Supreme Court thing,

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
is that they basically said that you can no longer pick and choose

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
where to file these patent lawsuits.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
You know, like all of these patents,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
like a big majority of these patent lawsuits

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
were all being filed in one town in Texas

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
because it had like the friendliest court, you know,

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
if you will, to like some of the rules that the patent trolls try to go by.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
Well, the Supreme Court has basically shut that down and said,

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
no, you have to file in a place where you do business, basically.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And that makes logical sense.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I can't see that being a Republican or Democrat issue.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I mean, I don't know, I haven't read really that far into it,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
but I can't see where that is controversial to say,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
you need to file it in a place where you exist.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
You know what I mean?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I think that's a good first step.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So we just need more stuff like that.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Anyway, let's move on before I get too far into politics.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Let's talk about gaming politics, DarkSakura.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Oh, you know I get fired up on that.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But, well, you know, we had been talking about,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
well, this isn't really political.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It's more of a reaction, I think, to the politics.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
But Destiny 2 is doing something to revamp the loot box system

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
by coming out with something called a prismatic matrix.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
So the way it'll work is that you'll get ten Eververse items

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
from season three each week that it's active,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
but they also will knock out things that you've already received

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
so that you get something unique every time.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And if you activate one ten times, you will get every item.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So you can earn those things too.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
You can pay for them with in-game currency.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Previous activations will also knock things off of the rewards list

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
so that you're guaranteed to get something different each time.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Seems like it's an improvement.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The whole catch, though, with this is that...

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
There's still loot boxes.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Right, you get one a week.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So if you want more, it's 200 silvers, which is $2.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So you can get more if you feel like paying for it,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
but, you know, you got to pay for it.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Or you could be patient. Patience!

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Patience.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Have some.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
All right, let's move on.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
We're just a couple more stories away from our classic game of the week.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
But first, Loki.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Yes, unfortunately, not some great news,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000
but one very popular YouTube personality, John TotalBiscuitBain,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
he came out...

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
He's been fighting bowel cancer for several years now.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
And so he posted something...

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Or I should say his PR had posted something on his official Reddit

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
talking about his current situation.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
So I'm just going to read some of this real quick

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
because it kind of sums up the whole problem.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So when I went into a hospital a week or so ago,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
it was accompanied by the news that

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
a conventional chemotherapy's effectiveness has been exhausted.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
My body has now become resistant to all forms,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
according to my oncologist.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
46 chemo treatments, 138 days plugged into the pump.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Let nobody ever say I wasn't stubborn.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Unfortunately, this was followed up by a couple days later

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
with some more bad news.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
My liver is failing and its effectiveness has lowered past to the point

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
where clinical trials I had been offered would take me on.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Yes, apparently there are things that are too dangerous for even the terminal.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Obviously, we're going to keep looking for other trials,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000
but I'm currently coming to terms with the fact that I don't have long left.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And right now, at any rate, there's literally nothing I can do about it

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
other than trying to manage pain as best as I can,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
stay hydrated as possible to ease the pressure on my liver.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And then with that, he basically said,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
it's now a case of, what do I do with the time I have left?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Why am I telling you?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Because you're a viewer of my content and this is relevant to you.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So what he's basically said he's going to do,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
he's going to stop doing the games critic bit.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
He's going to keep doing his co-optional podcast

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000
and just basically hoping that after, it's just a matter of time.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
He's basically, he knows he's going to die

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and it's just about being comfortable and spending time with family and everything.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
He's hoping that his wife takes over with the channel

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
and everything once he's done,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
but he's trying to provide for them at the same time.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
It's unfortunate.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I mean, he's been very prominent in the whole gaming industry

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
and it's sad to see that this has happened

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
because at one point, it had gone in the remission

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and he was doing better, but it just came back.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Yeah. I mean, I haven't always seen eye to eye on some of his opinions,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
but some of them I have agreed with

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and now is not really the time for that sort of debate.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Cancer fucking sucks and I hope he can be as comfortable as possible

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
and get everything that can be done off that bucket list that he wants to do.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I have such respect for the fact that he does want to keep doing that podcast

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
right up to the very end because I would like to think,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
heaven forbid, I would probably be the same way

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
that you would wheel me in here on Sunday nights if you had to

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and that hopefully Alan or somebody would just be the one to push the buttons

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000
or one of you guys, I don't know, but I would like to think that I could be that,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I don't know the word I'm looking for, I could be that dedicated, I guess,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
in the face of something so scary.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So props to him and our thoughts with him

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and the folks that are going to keep it going over there.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And yeah, some nice, hearty, fuck cancer, cancer sucks.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Yeah, pretty much.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Pretty much.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:31.000
You know, I think it's a somber reminder of, you know, that not to make this about me,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
but I guess I'm going to.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But you all remember, I'm coming up on 10 years.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
So 10 years ago, remember when I was like really sick

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
and I had that scare with pancreatic cancer, but it turns out it was pancreatitis?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
That's what my granny died of.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
And it's some scary shit, you know.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And so 10 years ago, you know, I used to be very much that person that was like,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
oh my God, when I turn 30, it's over.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I'm going to die single and alone because I'm turning 30.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Well, there's like even all sorts of things.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Like, for example, there is this woman that posts,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
she does a lot of YouTube videos as well, and she posts a lot on shitty robots,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
which is she makes a bunch of shitty robots because that's what she does.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
She said she had like a swollen eye for like a few months and it ends up,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
it's a brain tumor. Thankfully, it's not cancerous, but it's still a brain tumor.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And so it's like, you know, get your shit checked out.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I mean, like you never know. And that's kind of the thing, too,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
is like that was one of the things that John would like to, you know,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
kind of emphasize out there is like, get your shit checked out, you know,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
go see a doctor.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Well, one of the YouTubers I was following for a while, Haven Games,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
who did the World of Warcraft, you know, how to get outside the bounds

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and everything, which is, you know, one of my favorite things to do.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
He died at 26 of epithelial sarcoma.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Yeah. So I didn't really get to finish my thoughts.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
No, no, no, it's fine. We all have stories, but just, you know,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
to hear that I had a condition that did not have a 100 percent survival rate

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
was very much like a very like sobering moment.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
And it like it changed my perspective on a lot of things,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
because from that point on, it was like I get to be 30.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Like, yay, I'm going to be 30. And you know what?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I met Alan when I was 31 and things have turned out okay.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And now I'm looking at 40 in the face.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And even though there's still kind of that part of me that's like,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
um, you know, here I, here comes 40. There's still that I, but come on,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
come on, you had to have experienced some of this too.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
You know what I'm talking about, right?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And that's not like I'm walking around every day going, Oh, maybe 40.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
But I'm kind of, you know, there are some of those answers like, Oh, 40.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I don't feel so bad about it because I keep getting carded.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Shouldn't I have a bigger savings account if I'm going to be 40?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
It's those types of things. But I'm like, I'm, I'm again,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I'm trying to be like, you know what? Like, cool.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Like I'm going to be 40, but I don't feel 40. And that's cool.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Like I don't want to be all the like 40 is the new 20 or like Molly Shannon

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
on Saturday Night Live when she's playing that one character going,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
and I'm 50. Yeah. But that's kind of how I feel.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I'm like, okay, cool. 40. And don't even wait until like your, you know,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
our age to start checking. I mean, John Bain's 33. Yeah. So I mean, yeah,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
it can just speak with, I mean, check it. Don't let,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
talk to your doctor, check your balls, check your titties. Like, you know,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
don't be afraid of weird things. Get your vaccines.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Yeah. Get your vaccines and all that stuff. Well,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I mean is one thing with all the health issues that members of my family have

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
had. That was why I've been so adamant about blood tests and making sure I

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
take care of myself and doing all these things.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000
It is never too early to start look to start preparing for the inevitable.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Get a 401k if your work offers one.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I had a discussion recently with somebody about like what would happen in the

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
role I would play if this person should pass away unexpectedly. And it was,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
you know, and somebody my age and it's, it was a very kind of like,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
this is morbid. I don't like talking about it. But at the same time,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I was like,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
this is extremely responsible of you to be thinking of these sorts of things and

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
setting up for, you know,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
what may happen to a child in these types of scenarios. You know, I'm like,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I kind of like, even though I really don't like talking about it,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I kind of like greatly respect it sort of thing. So anyway,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
and then I'm getting yelled at, not yelled at,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
but I'm getting a dirty eyes from some of our chatters right now in the chat

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
over at live.vognetware.com. Brad from Geek Spin goes, fuck you, Rob.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I'm staring at 50, but ends it with a smiley face.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
So anyways, that's totally serious. Tiger class says, Rob Roberts,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I'm 45 and I feel fine. You know what? And I'm 39 and I feel just fine too.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It's not just saying just because other people are dying of things doesn't mean

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
you're going to be dying of things,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
but it never hurts to check that stuff out so that if there is an issue,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
you can catch it early.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And it's also a reminder to like be thankful for the time you do have,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
you know, and realize that, you know,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:04.000
tomorrow, tomorrow a meteor could hit like the dinosaurs got disintegrated.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It might suddenly one day it could be you one day.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
It just might be like, I don't feel so good. And that's it. All right.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Anyway, you know, and that was funny because you just made it.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I know. Don't. I just, I'm just thinking of Dennis Leary now. Okay.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I'm not. All right. One day you get it or you don't.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
A man actually nudges his poodle off the 30th story and it lands on you and

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
you're dead death by poodle. Anyway. Uh, anyway, I don't,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I didn't mean for the show to go that deep, but you know, I think, um,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
you know, when we hear these, what was that in? Was it, was it,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
no, it wasn't pushing daisies. It was six feet under six.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
No, the one where she dies from, um,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
a toilet seat hitting her from it was either an airplane or like space.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Oh, uh, dead like me. Dead like me. Yes. Yes. Oh, that show was so good.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Oh, that show was so good. That was the very first episode. Wasn't it? Yes.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
That's how she does. That's how she does. All right. All right. Anyway,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
a gold star for Sia Tiberi who called it out. It was a,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and clarifying it was a toilet seat from mirror.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
All right. Anyhow, uh, let's go on to one more story here.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Let's, let's change the tone a little bit and get into a story about,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Ikaruga because guess what y'all,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Ikaruga is confirmed that it is coming out for the Nintendo switch.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I know where's radiant silver gun. We've had some rumors.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
We've had some scuttlebutt when it comes to things like Ikaruga,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
but it is confirmed it is coming out actually a little sooner rather than

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
later. It's coming out May 29th. So that's pretty exciting.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Uh, Ikaruga is coming out on the switch and let's see,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
my original site for all the details. Was it working?

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So I want to get, uh, uh, vertical mode. Thank you.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I wanted to confirm that cause I thought I had read that,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
that they were going to do vertical mode in it. So that is confirmed.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Vertical mode is happening, right? Yep. Yay.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That's a great thing. Why you know shooters need that.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I have like a dock though, like for the switch.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I wonder if that will actually hold it in vertical mode. Um,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I don't think so. I mean you wouldn't want to play on your,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I mean if it docks then you wouldn't want to play on your team.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Well, no, no, it's, it's just a holder. Like it's meant cause,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
cause my son is using it and he wanted to charge at the same time and you

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
can't, it sucks ass. So you can't, you know, use that.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It might go either way. But anyway,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
this is obviously not the first time they've released Ikaruga,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
but I think it's been a little while.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Like I know there was the Xbox 360 version.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I know it's been a little while since they've released it. So, um,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I just want a radiant silver gun release that I don't have to pay 250 bucks

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
for. Well, maybe if this does well, treasure treasure,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
our will consider doing more treasure. Never does it in this game is done.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Well, can we get an Ikaruga to electric boogaloo? Sure. Sure.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Um, I don't know. Again, it's probably one of those things where it's like,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
maybe if it sells well, they'll go back to the dry board. But then again,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
you're right. It's like they always release Ikaruga and it always sells well

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
and they never do a new one.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So maybe they're just going to milk the classics for all it's worth,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
which we're going to talk about SNK later in the show.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
That's a Nintendo way. At least Nintendo makes some really good new games.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Come on. Come on. All right. Let's talk about some really good old games.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Oops. Oh my God. I played the wrong theme song.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And we're not talking about games anyway. All right. That's right.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
So, uh, that was a fault start because we're really going to get into the

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
classic peripheral of the month. Once a month,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
the dark soccer dives into the gaming vault and says, Hey, you know what?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Sometimes it's not about the game you play, but how you're playing.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Sometimes you need a controller that's as big as your fucking head.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
So it's the classic. Oh, is it steel battalion? No. Yeah.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
That was a good guess though, wasn't it? All right.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Here it is. The classic peripheral of the month. Dark soccer.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Which pick for us? It's the XC one AP. I have never heard of this.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
You haven't really. It looks like a Metroid.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Kind of. It does. So I just picked a Moosham music in the background because

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
it's a, uh, a Genesis controller. Well, it's for,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
it's for anything on the sake of the, that era.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
You play with it. Well, just the first time I heard of it,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
it was while they were playing Mooshah. So I picked Mooshah music.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I should probably do Mooshah as a classic game at some point if I haven't

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
already. Someone tell me if I've done Mooshah or something yet. Anyway,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
it's by a company called Dempa and it was created for the,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
the Sega mega drive. Cause this only came out in Japan.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000
It's also compatible with the Sega CD and the 32 X. Um,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
and it also works on some of the Japanese computers out there.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
It only came out in Japan. Um,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and it was released in 1989, uh,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
with full analog capability before probably almost a

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
decade before analog itself became mainstream.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So, um, it retailed for, um,

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
well actually at its first release,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
it was 13,800 yen. The real lease was 9,800 yen.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
If you were to look on eBay right now,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
you probably not find one of these for less than $250. Just saying.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Um, it has 10 buttons on it, including six buttons and four switches.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Um, four shoulder buttons. It was also one of the first, uh,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I would say major controllers that featured multiple, um, shoulder buttons.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Um,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000
it had an analog thumb stick and an analog slider that you could also rotate

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
the slider so it could go back and forth.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So it could technically become a throttle or another analog access.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Um, the buttons, you know, as I said, that six of, um, sorry,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
that four of those 10 buttons or switches, um,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
they will work with computers for controller, uh,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
for changing some of the controller support.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And there were turbo switches, some that just weren't needed, um,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
and a switch to put the controller into a digital mode that allowed it to be

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
compatible with all the, all the games on each systems, um,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
except for ones that, uh, don't support joysticks. Um,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
it also was meant to try to simulate some of the controls for games like

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Afterburner 2 that ran on the, the Sega, is it Sega 10 or Sega X board?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Um, and then, like I said, it was re-released in 1994.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
It is, uh, compatible with, um, a good number of games,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.000
but on the Mega Drive it has, it's best, um, released for Afterburner 2, um,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP2, Fastest One Galaxy Force 2,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
and Musha Aleste Full Metal Fighter Eleanor.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Mega CD would be Afterburner 3, Night Striker, and Starblade.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And 32X Afterburner complete in Space Harrier.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Which, by the way, the chat is confirming you did Musha in episode 621.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
See, I'm sure I did it at some point.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You Wiki people are amazing.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I probably did Truxtun 2 at some point, you know.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Yeah.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And Robo Aleste and some of the other fucking games.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Um, but anyway, it also, the whole point of it having an analog thumbstick,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
it actually predated the Nintendo 64 by about six years.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.000
So, I mean, just coming to think about what a phenomenal piece of, uh, hardware peripheral this was,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:39.000
you know, and it actually seems to, in some cases, been the, um, the, uh, inspiration for the Saturn 3D control pad.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Um, which, of course, then turned into the 3D control pad being the basis for the Dreamcast controller.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Which then was the inspiration for the Xbox controller, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Um, this thing is fucking huge, though.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.000
It is, like, I'll try to find it for the chat room, but it's probably, the circular aspect of it is probably

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:10.000
another centimeter large, centimeter to two centimeters larger in diameter than the Sega, um, Saturn's, uh, 3D control stick.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
So, and it's supposed to be pretty heavy.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I would love to get my hands on one.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Dan said he had a chance, like, 20 years ago to get his hands on one and passed it up and regrets it.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So, someone finds me one for a hundred bucks. We'll talk. But, yeah.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Alright. There it is, your classic peripheral of the month.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
XE1 AP by Dempa.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Alright. But you don't have one.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Sadly, I do not. I am not so fortunate.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
They're a little cost prohibitive, it sounds like.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Yeah, they, they, they ain't cheap.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Yeah. Uh, SG100Matt saying, I'm looking at this and I've never seen or heard of this before. It looks ridiculous.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Well, Dark Soccer is here to educate you on all the ridiculous things.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It is pretty ridiculous, but the shit that it does.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I would like to see a size comparison with that and the Duke.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Oh, the original Xbox controller?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I found a picture of it with a six button, um, uh, Mega Drive controller, so I'll post that in the chat.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
It does look kind of cool, though. Like, I can see why you picked it. It's, it's, like, super unique.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.000
You know what I mean? Like, you don't, like, even if you were to compare it to the Duke or whatever, like, it's just, the way it is is very unique.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
So, um, I like it.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Alright, anyhow, uh, we're gonna take a break, but when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Uh, so we're gonna take a break and we'll be back, so stay tuned, y'all.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight, episode number 729, already in progress for this May the 6th of 2018.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I hope everybody had a good May the 4th and, uh, a fun Cinco de Mayo as well, even though I understand we kind of blow that holiday a little bit out of proportion here in the U.S.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
But, you know, hopefully, uh, hopefully you still had a good day.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Uh, and certainly the Star Wars, uh, thing is, it's, like, I'm hearing that more and more often every year.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
We actually did a little thing in my work this year around May the 4th. I thought it was really cute.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Uh, we got to wear, like, Star Wars shirts to work, which usually you don't get to wear a t-shirt to work, so it was, like, kind of, you know, fun stuff.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Uh, and then in chat they're saying Revenge of the 5th, yes, I've heard that too. Revenge of the 6th, I've heard it that way too, but...

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I, I don't like the whole, um, like, cultural insensitivity aspect of it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Of what?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Of the Cinco de Mayo thing.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Oh, of Cinco de Mayo?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Going back to that.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But there was a guy who had a giant taco on his head and it was so extra, I loved it.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Yeah, I mean, if you're, if you're gonna, if you're gonna go extra, be committed to your art.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000
He wore, like, a Hawaiian style shirt, except it was tacos and burritos. I kind of want a dress made out of that.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
That's, you know, whatever.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I'm looking, I've been looking for fabric that's tacos and burritos to make a dress like that.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Act Deft in our, Act Deft in chat says, I really don't mind Cinco de Mayo at all.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:04.000
You know, we, we kind of talked about that before. Remember how there was a lot of outrage on the tumblers of the net and so forth about the Mario in the, you know, mariachi type of costume?

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And it was like, you know, is that appropriating Mexican culture? But you talk to most Mexicans and they're like, it's cool. Like, you know, put it out there.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Your costume DLC is not my culture.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000
It really is, though, an American phenomenon, this whole thing that everything is appropriation.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I'm a firm believer that you can have cultural appreciation.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Appropriation comes in when you start making money off of the disenfranchised population.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Right.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So just know the difference.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I think a lot of it's social media, too.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Like, it's just so easy to call out on social media.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And that's why, that's why I just don't, I don't, I don't like to get involved.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I still like to go back to karma at the end of the day and like, don't, don't call out unless you're ready to get called out.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:56.000
So anyway, S2100 Matt in chat says, I'm a big Star Wars fan as much as the next, but I'm a little bah humbug on the May the 4th stuff.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
It just feels so forced. Was that a pun?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But whatever, if you want to have fun with Star Wars that day, then go for it.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Tiger Klein chat says, when will there be a Marvel day?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
You get, you get Marvel movies like four times a year now.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
There's like superhero day, not that long ago.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
That's right.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Anyway, okay, let's move on you guys.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Let's get back into some video games and what's going on rapidly with some rapid fire news.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Loki.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
All right.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
So you may remember Val's been adding different controller support to Steam.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So now one of the controllers that's also available for Steam use is a Switch Pro controller.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So you can actually select that in your controller settings and I guess you'll see screen prompts that match the Switch.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.000
You can even kind of adjust what those are and stuff.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
But I like how that actually maps everything to the correct buttons.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And then along with this, this is kind of a cool little free game as well.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
I believe it's free.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
So you may remember there was a game not too long ago called Surgeon Simulator,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:10.000
which was, you know, kind of this physics based, you know, hard to control game that you had to perform surgery.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Surgery in quotes, of course.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Well, now there is a new game that's come out based on the London Dare 41 theme.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:28.000
And it's by, I guess, the developer, Swavgav.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
At least that's the page.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.000
So swav, S-W-A-V dash G-A-V dot itch dot IO.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And the game's called Check, Please.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Basically, you're supposed to be going on a date.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And so you have to do date like things, but you have to use your hands are controlled with the mouse.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So you use the mouse to move your hand, you know, left click to hold and grab up and grab items and then right to rotate the hand.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
So very similar to kind of like the whole Surgeon Simulator thing.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
But it's fun and it is free.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
So go check it out.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
It looks very silly.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
All right.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Some comments in chat on the things Loki was talking about, going back to the Switch controller on Steam, which I'm a fan of that.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
You know, I'm a fan of more stuff in my house being able to be used on more things.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I'm all for that.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Well, it's great, like especially when you have like Steam games like, oh, hey, I got to do a multiplayer game.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Like I only have two PlayStation 4 controllers or one Xbox 360 controller.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It's like I want to do four players on like a game on my PC, plug into my TV and then just, hey, I've got all these controllers that work with it now.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
OK, I like that.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
That's a good good thought.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.000
But over in chat at live.vognetwork.com, darktetsuya says, when will Steam add support for the XE1?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000
He says he's half joking, but I'm sure something on Steam could support it.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
You never know.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I'm sure that with the right peripheral to be able to plug in Sega, was it Mega Drive?

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Mega Drive, Sega CD and 32X.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
So with the right peripheral, we'll port that to USB.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I'm sure Joy to Key, you can make anything possible.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
That's right.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Kaijuto talking about the game that you were mentioning there, Logi.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Kaijuto wants to know, is this a jack off game?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
No.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Well, Kaijuto, anything can be if you really want it to be.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It's not a jack off game.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:24.000
It is you're having a fine, you're having a date in a restaurant and you have to like feed your date meatballs and like pay the check and stuff like that.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
And it's really goofy.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
You feed your date the balls.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
You shove those sweaty balls.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Sia Tabiri mentions the jack off box party pack.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Alright, you guys are so mature.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
I'm sure they have plenty of those games on Steam.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
You guys are so fucking mature.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Alright, let's talk about Minecraft.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
How about you guys get your minds out of the gutter?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
We talk about a kids game called Minecraft.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Minecraft is getting another patch.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
It's called the Aquatic Update, the Life Aquatic in Minecraft.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
It's actually going to be the final update for the last gen versions of the game.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
So if you're still playing on 360, PlayStation Vita is considered last gen.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Wii U, last gen.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
These things are so last gen.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And only apparently 5% of Minecraft players are even playing on these systems.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
So guess what?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
This is it.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
The Aquatic Update is it.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Microsoft will be focusing their efforts on improving the versions of the game where more players are active.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:30.000
So this of course would be the PlayStation 4 version as well as the hybrid Minecraft version that's on Switch, Windows 10, all the other places basically.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:39.000
So the patch not yet available on Switch, but I guess Microsoft still is going to be doing the Better Together update for that platform.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I guess that's not all quite there yet.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Yeah, so once they have that I guess they're going to do both of those.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Yes, and so then it will be updated with the Aquatic stuff.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I don't see a date for Aquatic though.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Will it be the Life Aquatic?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I just said that.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I think it's soon.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Honestly, I thought it was already out.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It might already be out.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
It might have just already been out.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Let's see.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Let's see if we can find out when it is here.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Apparently this is coming to Java Edition too.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Will it have Aquaria in it?

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Yeah, the Java Edition usually gets everything as well.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
It's just that those are separate kind of ecosystems now.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Which is funny because Kaijuto says are they going to stop or are they still updating the Java?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
So yeah, they are.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Yeah, they are.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
It's just because now they have the console version which is basically Windows 10 and everything else.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And then they have the Java version which is separate.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
It doesn't say when that's going to be updated yet.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I want my 4K patch and all that stuff.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I want to play my blocky game in 4K.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Good old games.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Good old games is going to be giving away the Witcher Enhanced Edition if you sign up for the newsletter.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
So that's all you got to do.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
You got to sell your email address to them.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
So sign up for the newsletter by creating a GOG account and doing this whole link thing.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And then you get the Witcher Enhanced Edition.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Please note, this is not The Witcher 3.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
It's the original Witcher game but it's still an updated version of that game.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And you know, if you want the background story and all that.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
It's a free game.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And I know some of you raging here love your free games.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
So there's a way to get that.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So yeah, check that out.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
The dialogue in this game was rewritten, rerecorded.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
The inventory was changed.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
So it's still a little dated by today's standards.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
But it's free.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
It's fucking free.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
So don't complain about it.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Also, you get a Gwent card keg with this.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Which is, if I'm not mistaken, like The Witcher to Hearthstone sort of thing.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Right?

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Like it's their trading card game.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
So you can also get that.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Check that out.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Dark Sakura.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Well, you know we all like our Luminess.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
And there is a date for Luminess Remastered.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Yay!

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
It's June 26th.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
My birthday!

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Happy birthday, Rob!

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
That's a great birthday present.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Even though it was supposed to be out in May, I'll still take the time to get it right.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And of course it's on Switch.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Yay!

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Also, there is the Neo Geo Mini.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I hope it has better emulation than the last attempts to do one of these.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
But it has, it looks like it's got controllers.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It's got the full size controller as well.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And I'm just trying to see, scroll through some of these images, but they don't seem to be working.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000
It's supposed to have 40 built in games, including 5 of the King of the Fighters titles and 3 of the Metal Slug games.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And, um, I don't know.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Do they have a, I see one picture that looks like an arcade cabinet.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
It looks like a mini cabinet.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
That's pretty awesome.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I mean, if it comes with a mini cab, that'd be even better.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I would think that's going to make the price of that thing go up if it's a little cabinet.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
But again, it also depends on the emulation.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Yeah.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Because the previous ones had some shit emulation.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So that is the actual console.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.000
So it says, yeah, the console has a, it has like a built in joystick with a three and a half inch screen.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
But then it also has output to HDMI and auxiliary video and stuff.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Cool.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
RageNator wants to point out about one of those stories I talked about.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I've had The Witcher on GOG for free for ages now.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I'm on those freebies.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Of course, of course.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Well, for those that missed out, here's, here's, here's another chance, I guess.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Uh, so yeah.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I want to know what that price the Neo Geo is though.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I'm tempted.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
It has Fatal Fury special.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
That's all I need.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Which I have that on a real Neo Geo.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
I know, but I don't, I don't Jamie.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Do you want to borrow a Neo Geo CD?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Maybe.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And so you can wait with five hours of loading time between every stage?

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Do some streaming.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
If only you could play Neo Geo games on a certain arcade cabinet that's in this room.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Oh, wait.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Yes, you can.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Or, or they're, they're all, all these games are on the switch with the ACA and the PS4 as well.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So probably Xbox one too.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I just don't stay on top of all that stuff.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out something you can buy a little bit sooner, uh, than, um, this Neo Geo mini.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Uh, what's coming out this week in the U S Loki?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Uh, we have Conan exiles on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one pillars of eternity to dead fire on windows, Mac, and Linux, uh, Steins gate zero on PC.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.000
We have a game called laser league on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, battle chasers.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Uh, oh, I'm sorry.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
That's actually next week.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
So yes, laser league will be the last thing for the week.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
That's it.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Very short.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
All right.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Let's go to the PlayStation four and check out some of the releases there.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Although I know that, uh, the golden week sale is going on on a PlayStation.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So, uh, I think in Japan, uh, it's probably gonna be a little slower this week.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Uh, I think that's why we've seen some releases slowing down.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:52.000
In fact, actually, as I look at the PlayStation four releases in Japan this week, the next big release that I see is Caligula overdose on the 17th.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
So I think this week is probably going to be a little more quiet.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Um, yeah, in fact, as I'm looking at the, uh, switch releases, there's really nothing of note there either.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
So I think things are pretty quiet in Japan this week with the, uh, various holidays.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Uh, nothing on the 3DS either.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
So it's, it's just, it's just a little slow right now.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
So we'll head on over to Europe.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Dark sakura.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
We have only a handful of things on May 8th.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
We have, uh, pillars of eternity two dead fire for PC.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Um, Conan exiles on May 8th as well for Xbox and PlayStation.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And super chariot for switch on the 11th.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
All right.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Well, now we can take a trip into our mailbag and I can play the theme song that I accidentally played early earlier.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
It was a preview.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
It was a sneak peek.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Uh, anyway, uh, every week dark sakura dives into the mailbag at participate at orange launch radio.com and takes a peek at what y'all have to say.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Dark Sakura.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I got a very concerning one.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000
This is super important bulletin and it's by yyr.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So, um, here it is.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Super multitasking broke sales records.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I hope it's what it deserves.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Tacos are fantastic.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Thank you.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
A brand new title of his new game.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000
The sequel to pixel shit.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Pixel shits to tacos are fantastic.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Dude, make this happen, please.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I think yyr might be done with making our dream games come true for a while.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Cause you guys aren't coming through and making him a billionaire on steam.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
What's wrong with y'all pick up asking.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I can only purchase the game once.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
I know.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I know you can purchase it as gifts for other people.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I could.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
It's true gift.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:45.000
You know, you know why I think yyr sent that email because didn't we say on last week's show, like every listener should send us an email and what we got one email.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
We have another one from Rachel here.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Well, that's how many listeners we have.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I guess the number two gaming podcast in town, two emails.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I'll give, I'll give that a number one.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Cause we don't have a wall or write names on.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
We had names and we had to be taking those names.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I mean, people have to be there to take the names.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
That's right.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I'm going to kick ass and take.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
All right, Jamie, come on.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
What's the next, next email.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Hi all.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
It's Reaganator yet again.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I have some good news for you three and for chat.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:30.000
If you care to remember last week, I called in to mention that a buddy of mine from high school responded to my venting on my tech woes, dead TV and PC video card by saying that he offered, dude, I understand you're excited about the video card, but this has nothing to do with gaming news.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Just saying.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Is there a question or anything in it?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I'm going to keep reading.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
All right.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Um, he offered to send me his little video card.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Well, shipment for me came on Wednesday and it was no video card.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
It was a 40 inch, 10 ADP Visio smart TV.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Oh shit.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Seemingly brand spanking you too.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Naturally I was confused and I confirmed with him.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Apparently it was no mistake.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
He and his wife sent it intentionally saying happy birthday or something.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Or something.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
That's a nice friend.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
That is a good friend.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Anyways, regarding the video card, the extra money that I requested for my SSD payee, all $50 of it, finally came on Thursday and it was deposited Friday.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Luckily I found a video card that I could afford on Amazon, an MSI Geforce GT710 for $44.95 plus tax.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000
That card, as far as I know, is marginally better than the Geforce GT610 that came with my PC.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I ordered it and I should have it on Friday.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
All that being said, I should be back to PC gaming in less than a week.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000
In the meantime, I'm going nuts watching TV and playing games on the 360.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I tell you, the picture on this TV is absolutely gorgeous.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Any better and my eyes would orgasm.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
The anime titties are as big as your face.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000
This email was brought to you by Kenmore East, once a bulldog, always a bulldog.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
What does that mean?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
There's no question?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
No.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
It's like, I'm glad for you.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Yeah, no, it's a rad present.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
It is a really rad present.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Enjoy your jumbo anime titties.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
But still, a little relevancy.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Relevancy.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
It was a follow up to a call, whatever.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Okay.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
That's it?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
That's it.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
What?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I want a relevant email.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Tacos are great and you've got a great friend, but we want stuff related to what we are talking about on the show or how awesome I am.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Unless that really was a game announcement from YYR, in which case, you know.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Okay, then I'll take it.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
YYR has a pass with the occasional short email because his emails are fucking novels.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And plus, I believe there's like family stuff going on and all that.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
So, YYR wants to take a break from game development.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
He's fucking earned it.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Anyway, let's see.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Let's move on then while we await more emails that participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Send our soccer an email and tell her what anime titties you like to see on your 50 inch TV.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Speaking of anime titties, I've been like on the fence of purchasing Gal...

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I like the first Galgun game.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
It's ridiculous, but I thought about purchasing the second one.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
It's on the Switch, though.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
That would not be a Switch appropriate game, unfortunately.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
You know, I understand that some games, like, people kind of look at it and go, Jesus Christ, really?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Is this really needed?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
But sometimes, like, it's like Dark Soccer said about the hat, right?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Sometimes, if you're going to go extra, be fucking extra.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
You know?

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Be as extra as you can fucking be.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
And that's why I love Bayonetta.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Like, if Galgun came with, like, boob attachments for the, you know, D-pad, that would be extra.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
You have a pheromone gun. You have to shoot your pheromones at them.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And didn't they just re-release... God, they just re-released it on PS4.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Is this week or next?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:39.000
It's like that side-scroller with the totally unrealistic, like, cartoon babes with the gigantic titties.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
What, the Queen's...

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Which one?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Dragon's something... Damn it.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Oh, I know what you mean. Yeah, yeah.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
It was some frickin' PlayStation 3 and, like, Vita or PSP game.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
No, that one's actually really...

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Dragon's Crown. Thank you, MXC.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Dragon's Crown's a great game. It's a really, like...

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I know it's a good game, but not very...

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
It's...

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
It just needs proportionizing.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It just needs a little bit of that.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Yeah, no, that's... I know, that's the gag of the season.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
It's actually a good game.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
How many references can I drop in one minute?

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
All right. Anyway, let's move on to some more news.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Loki.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
All right.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So, um...

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Apparently, there's, um...

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000
We talked about how there's been hackers with PUBG that have gotten into...

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Or is it PUBG or Fortnite?

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
One of the two got in the big trouble with, um...

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
You know, creating hacks and stuff.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Well, now, apparently, Overwatch hackers are getting arrested and fined as well.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000
So, South Korea has a new law that is targeting hackers.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:52.000
And apparently, with this new law, 13 Overwatch cheaters have been arrested now.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:59.000
And apparently, they're saying that one of the 13 has received two years of probation from the government.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And if he violates it, he'll see jail time, as well as the others have been fined around 10 million won, which is about $10,000.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Will this finally end cheating?

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Nope.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Please.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I'm just surprised you can, like, go to jail and get fined for that, like...

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Well, I mean, of course, when you're, like, fucking with the game, like, that much, like, I kind of get it.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
But it's, like, I feel like...

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I feel like that would never...

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Like, that sort of punishment would never happen here.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I've missed something.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
But I just feel like there's so many, uh...

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Yeah, it's...

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
You're never gonna end cheating.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Yeah.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
You can certainly make an example out of people that get caught.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
And I think that's what happens here.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Apparently, the law has a maximum fine of $50,000.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
And a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Wow.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Kaijuto in chat says, cheating online, but jail time?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Come on, now.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I'm all for the death penalty when it comes...

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
No, I'm kidding. I'm not.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
But...

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Yeah, I just, um...

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I am a little surprised, but at the same time, like, when are people gonna fucking stop?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I don't know.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Alright.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Let's talk about Miis.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Let's talk about Miis.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
But M-I-I would be the thing I want to talk about.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Which, I want to talk about making Mii characters in a web browser.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Apparently, this is something that you're gonna be able to do soon.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Even though Miitomo is...

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Like, there's only so much time left with Miitomo.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
The 9th.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
That's...

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
That's like Tuesday!

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Yeah.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Oh my gosh, that's kinda sad.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I've been trying to use up all of those tickets I get.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Yeah?

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
But, and you really, you're not gonna be able to, like, get anything for it, right?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000
You just kinda, like, the whole game's gonna get flushed in the toilet and that's that, right?

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
As far as I can tell.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Kind of a bummer that you can't, like, download or archive anything or there isn't some type of, like, Miitomo archive.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I... I don't know.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Why don't they just let it exist, right?

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I took pictures of all of my Mii characters that I made.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Well, that's good.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Get all the screenshots that you can now.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Well, I guess what's happening soon is that Mii characters are going to be available for you to actually edit online.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
The story is not coming up for me for some reason, so I don't know... I don't remember all the details.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I did read something about... Oh, finally! Just as I say that, it pops up on my screen there. Thank you.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
As if by magic.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Jesus. It's like complaining works.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Excuse me, internet. Can I speak to your manager?

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Alright, there it is. Anyway.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Alright, so here's the thing.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000
So, when it comes to Miis, you can create and edit your Mii characters in a web browser.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
There's gonna be maintenance, though, when Miitomo is terminated.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.000
So, if you link your Nintendo account to Miitomo, you can use the Mii characters from Miitomo on your Nintendo account.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
So, that's something.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I've already linked mine an age ago, so that's good.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Awesome.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
So, with the end of the Miitomo service, you can't make things on Miitomo anymore,

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:51.000
but they're gonna add a feature in late May where you can edit the Mii characters via your web browser of choice,

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
if it'll work, unlike this relic of a computer that I'm using now.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.000
So, the system migration maintenance will be happening in late May 2018.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
So, during that period, you can't really do anything with your Miis,

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000
but once that's done, you can make Miis online,

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.000
and I'm sure people will be sharing all the hilarious creations that they've made within the Mii Broadcaster.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
So, there you go.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Well, there is a series of retail gaming stores in Nebraska called Gamers,

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:32.000
and all three of their stores closed as of Thursday, May 3rd,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:40.000
with one of the reasons being that there were employees who yelled at customers and used racial slurs while working.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:48.000
They also listed a lack of good employees, and a few things about declining sales and unreasonable landlords.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:56.000
However, the employees themselves have spoken up, said that there was quite another thing going on with them.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:07.000
That basically, that the company was only paying minimum wage, that they also offered no benefits,

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.000
had employees working overtime for no pay, high turnover, terrible management,

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:21.000
and even making them go to meetings on their day off with no pay, which is all illegal.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:32.000
So, they're apparently still operating as a store, but I guess only online, so that's still pretty crappy.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I mean, every single one of those employees under those circumstances should have actually taken it to their state labor board,

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.000
but people don't think to do stuff like that, and that's why companies like this get away with it.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:52.000
So, I don't know. I'm pretty glad that if that really is the truth that a company so unstable is closing their shop,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.000
and I hope that they go out of business or get intensely sued, but there's not really too much else I can say about that.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I don't think this is a customer I sold to, but the name sounds familiar, Gamers.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Because honestly, the independent game stores, there's not a ton of them out there.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Well, honestly enough, really the big chains are taking it over, but I'd like to support independent game stores,

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
but I don't support this kind of attitude.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Well, it's just bad business all around.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
It really is. So, do you have anything more for us?

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
At least not on that.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Anyways, I guess we could talk a little bit about Nintendo.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And you know, one of the things we keep wondering with Nintendo is like, so we've got this system, the Switch and stuff,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.000
why do they keep making 3DS games still? When is the 3DS going to basically be over?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And the reason for that, they claim, is because Nintendo is basically going to keep making games for the 3DS

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000
until the Switch becomes a one-per-person system.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:17.000
So, with the Switch, I think that's a nice idea, but the fact that it's a console system, though,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
you're going to have multiplayer support on that. It's not like a 3DS.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:27.000
But you're saying, consumers purchased the 3DS system in numbers we expected last fiscal year,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000
or the numbers we expected last fiscal year.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.000
It had an ample supply of ample software lineup at the price point that makes the system affordable,

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
especially for parents looking to buy for their kids.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
We expect the demand to continue this fiscal year as well, which is through March 2019.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
So we will continue to sell the product.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Given that Nintendo Switch is a home gaming system that can be taken on the go,

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:58.000
this situation may change if it grows from being a one-per-household system to a one-per-person system.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Well, take it out back and fucking shoot it already.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Well, the problem is, though, it's a $300 system. The 3DS was never a $300 system,

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
so it's hard to say, well, you better buy a Switch for each person in the house.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Oh, and hey, you want to play those games? Well, you better buy a game for each person.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
That's the problem. You made a system that's a home console system,

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.000
and you're shocked that people aren't buying it like a portable system.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Look, this is honestly just a line they're using because they're not planning on selling the 3DS yet.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000
They can't. They've got that Luigi game that's already slated for next year, the Luigi's Mansion remake.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
So they're not going to say anything about stopping to sell the 3DS for a long time.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
And honestly, even if they were to say, like, we're going to actively stop making new 3DS games or whatever,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
which is probably not something they would say, you'd just probably have to figure it out,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:49.000
they're still going to sell the consoles themselves for at least another probably two years after that

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:55.000
because there is, and I see in chat that there's still fans of the 3DS.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Of course, the 3DS and the DS, which you can play on your 3DS,

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000
has such a rich back catalog that, of course, they're going to sell systems.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Like, what if your system breaks and you want a new one and all this other stuff?

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:13.000
So, I mean, there's still reasons to get 3DS, but it's more like that active development

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
and using resources on making new big games and stuff.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
It's like, okay, let it go. We can let it go now.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Put them on great Switch games and maybe you will sell a million Switches.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Yeah. Or, I mean, they have sold a million Switches, but you know what I mean.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
That's my figurative million. One for every person or whatever it is.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:36.000
So, Tigerclaw does point out in chat, plus the 3DS Fitch in your pocket, not the Switch,

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
until Nintendo does the Switch Mini.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Well, there will be another version of the Switch. Absolutely.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Why wouldn't there be? There's almost always been another version of the console.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Like, even the Wii sort of had one where they took the internet out and all that stuff. Remember that?

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Yeah, that was a very good version of the console.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Have we had another Wii U?

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Well, but the Wii U kind of, they wanted to get rid of that pretty quick.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
But, like, the Nintendo had the top loader, the Super Nintendo had a redo,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
the Nintendo 64, they kind of did, like, the Pikachu version.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Yeah, 3DS, the DS.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
3DS, DS, Game Boy, those are always going through remakes and stuff.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:18.000
So, I mean, they will do a Switch XL or XS or something to get more people to use them.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000
A Switch and you'll poke it, if that's what they want.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Asky in chat says, what do you think the recent hack on the Switch will affect the sales of the Switch?

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Do you think it will become another Dreamcast? Awesome platform, but was flawed by piracy early on.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Here's what they're going to do, Asky, I think, is that maybe you can't stop the old systems and this stuff,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
but they can put their foot down with the new systems.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I don't think they can, because they're going to have to go with a whole other processor if that's the case,

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
because it's the taker chip that is the problem.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000
So, unless Nvidia has a way around that, I don't think they're going to change it.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Right now, though, there's nothing to say that it's going to be piracy,

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.000
because the problem was that they don't have access to the keys yet to be able to decode the software.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
The best they're going to be able to do is load homebrew on there.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Rama in chat says, here's the thing, drop the Switch to $199 and it will be one console per person per household.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Until then, viva la 3DS.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000
That's true, I guess that price, but I could see the price maybe coming down.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I even have a problem, though, with the games being $60 at that point,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000
because if you're saying that you want it one per person, then you're going to buy one game per person.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000
All right, one more story for you guys before we get to calls, and this has to do with a music game.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Why not kind of end the official news segment tonight with news on a music game,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
and ask to do with harmonics and Rock Band, which, yes, it's still going.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And actually, Rock Band is bringing it back.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000
We also talked about RBM.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Hey, be quiet.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Shut up.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Normally, don't talk about it too much.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Shut up, autoplay Twitch thing, don't do that.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Anyway, that was part of the livestream where harmonics was about to announce that the Rock Band network would be coming back.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
The Rock Band network was unveiled about ten years ago, I think,

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
and it allowed folks to basically put their own tracks into Rock Band, including for sale.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
I mean, it did have to go through quality review and stuff,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:21.000
but it basically unleashed the Rock Band tools to smaller bands and indie bands that wanted to be in Rock Band.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Now, Rock Band network is going to be coming back for Rock Band 4 on the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.000
There never did end up being a Rock Band 4 on PC, because that crowdfunding didn't quite work out.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.000
However, due to the royalty agreements, your purchases can't move over.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.000
So, womp womp on that, you will have to start over if you had a lot of the Rock Band network stuff.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Harmonics is prioritizing songs that were the most popular before on Rock Band network,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
and is also taking requests via an online forum.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
So, that's kind of neat that, like, this thing that they shut down is now coming back.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
So, pretty cool.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
And Orange, right in chat, says,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Oh, I didn't hear about this. Cool to hear.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Yeah, they announced it on Tuesday during a livestream that Harmonics did.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
So, it is happening.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I don't know if I caught the when it's happening, but it's something that they're working on.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
So, pretty cool.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1877 Game OLR if you want to do it the old school way,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
but I don't remember the last time we got a phone call.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
It's all Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:26.000
If you would like to Skype us and talk about anything that maybe we've talked about so far tonight,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
or have yet to talk about.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Until then, I don't know if we have any last minute stories or other things to bring up,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
but, Loki, any last minute stories?

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
If you have any discussion, maybe if you don't want to call,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
but you just have a discussion question or something you want to ask us,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
go ahead and throw it out in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.000
It's a small mention, but I guess that the Oculus Go, I think, has been released.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Oh, yeah, the whole Facebook event unveiled this, right?

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
The Oculus without a computer, basically, right?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Yeah, so that's available.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:01.000
The only issue with that is you have to have a phone that you can connect to their store with, which is stupors.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Of course, of course.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Well, they want you to buy things.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Well, why, but yeah, but if I have a phone, then why would I want the Oculus Go, because I could just plug in...

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Well, why would you get the other thing, the other Samsung thing that everybody's getting...

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
The Gear VR?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Yeah, the Gear VR.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Or like the...

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
We have one, and I've used it once.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
It's kind of a novelty thing.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
I gave mine away a couple weeks ago.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
The experiences just aren't there for that, you know?

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I mean, at least with PlayStation VR, you've got quite a few games at this point that exist in there.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Same thing with, you know, HTC Vive and Oculus on PC and so forth.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:42.000
So, SSU100Matt points out the Gear VR is pretty much the Oculus Go.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Yeah.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Yeah.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000
AskianChat points out, I just bought a cat. That's important, right?

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Fuck yes, cats are always important.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
We love animals.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Cats are always relevant.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Cats are always relevant.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000
And I suppose, if you're a dog person, I suppose puppies, especially if it's Corgi.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
If it's Corgi, it's like priority.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
So, yes.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Puppies and kitties are very important.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
You know what? I would say pretty much any.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:15.000
If you wanted to get a ferret, that is also noteworthy, especially if you're breaking the law and it's illegal in your state.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Would you like to call and tell us how you're breaking the law?

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Orange Launch Radio.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Anything else to talk about here at the end?

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Sadly, no. It's been a slow Newsweek.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
It is really slow.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Well, A, you have the holiday week going on in Japan.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
So, you know, that's shutting a lot of things down right now.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
B, you have E3 is just around the corner.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000
So, you know, that's something to do.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
It's just also slow as far as releases go, too.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
May is usually, April and May are really slow.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I mean, actually anything up until September is going to be kind of slow.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
June picked a little bit.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I feel like we usually get one or two big releases around Memorial Day.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
So people can play during the long weekend.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I don't think anything is really coming out.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Kids getting out of school.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Switch, I know they've got the remaster of Hyrule Warriors,

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
which I may end up picking up.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
I'm not sure yet.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
That might be fun.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000
So we're getting some questions in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
which we'll certainly take those.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
We can do an Ask Orange Lounge or something.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I'm kind of like an informal Ask Orange Lounge.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Asky wants to know, did anyone buy Donkey Kong?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
And She-Hulk clarifying Donkey Kong for the Switch.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I looked at it, but I don't want to pay $60 for that game.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I played the Wii U version, and unpopular opinion, I didn't care for it.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:44.000
For me, it didn't really capture the magic of the Super Nintendo Donkey Kong Country games.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I don't know if I'm just as big on Donkey Kong as a franchise.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
But cool for the people that are into it.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
And maybe I need to give it a second look.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000
This happens with games sometimes, you guys.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, eh, I'm not feeling it.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.000
But after I learned some more things about the franchise and how Cinematica was,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I went back and played it later.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
And now the original trilogy is one of my favorite things that's ever been done in gaming.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:16.000
So I don't want to damn a thing like Donkey Kong forever.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Anyway, actdeftinchat points out $60 is worth it.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.000
It's good, but I already have the Wii U version.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I don't really want to double dip this one.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Captain Toad, though, gonna buy that one for sure.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I know a lot of people are fans of Captain Toad.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Actdeft pointing out we had the Octo expansion coming in July, probably.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
The whole Splatoon thing.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Which, by the way, Raphael vs. Leonardo happened this weekend.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Raphael won.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
But not based on popularity.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
If it had been straight a popularity vote, Leonardo would have won.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
But Raphael's still better anyway.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
But the Raphael players were more skilled at the end of the day winning more of the battles.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000
So how about that?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Even though I didn't play.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
But of course I saw the Twitters. I saw all the Tweets about it, of course.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Alright, let's take a call that is coming in.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Hi, you're on Orange On Radio. Who's this?

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Hey, what's going on? My name's Rama.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Hey, Rama. Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Not much. I just got here from a convention.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Our convention season has just kicked off with a bang.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000
That's true. What might be a slow time for video games becomes a really fast time.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Like when the movies start coming out because that's more when people can get weekends away.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
It sounds like you had a really good time at this convention.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000
A lot of good stuff.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Yeah, this is one of the few times where I was actually calm.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Not calm, but relaxed, chill. I just had a good time.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I got a little stressed, but thankfully my podcast staff was able to help me push through and get things done.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Overall, I was just having a good time.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Good. And what was the name of the con?

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Zenkai Con. It's an anime, sci-fi, themed convention, mishmash of everything in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Oh, that's not far from where I spent some time in Pennsylvania a few years ago.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Oh, yeah. I remember you mentioning that.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Yeah. So that's cool. I'm glad you had a good time at the convention.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000
And I'm sure people can hear more about it on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday live at VOG.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Definitely. We're all still recovering from it because it was just fun from start to finish.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:20.000
We got there early, did a little touristy thing and then just kind of rested and then just went to the whole nine yards.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Awesome. I look forward to hearing more about it. Anything gaming to bring up here on OLR?

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Well, this year they had another convention covering running the game room.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:38.000
So it was mostly console gaming. They had a setup for Rock Band 3, or Rock Band 4. I don't know which one it was.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:45.000
And they also had a PS2 arcade DDR setup, as I like to call it.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Oh, okay. Cool.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Yeah, but the main issue was...

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Sorry, did they gut an arcade machine and put a PS2 in it? Because I have friends that have a machine like that.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Or did they just do a PS2 with the really fancy dance pads?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Yeah, PS2 with two large arcade dance pads that were uncalibrated the whole weekend.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Oh, Jesus.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Yeah, the staff was told, but evidently nothing was done about it. So I sort of avoided the game room.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Because here's the thing about the game room. If you're going to go, the best time to go is within the first 20 minutes of it opening and in the last 20 minutes of it closing.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Before it smells like funk.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.000
That's putting it lightly.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:36.000
No, I know. I know. That's exactly how it goes. Or the cool thing is, you know, with MAGFest, it's a 24-hour gaming room.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.000
So it's like you kind of go at 3 in the morning. Although, God, even then, even then, it's still...

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:50.000
It can be pretty crowded on Friday, Saturday night. DragonCon, I think if you go around 5 or 6 in the morning, DragonCon, you can pretty much walk up and play what you want.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:01.000
That's what I'm going to do for MAGFest next year. I'm just going to do my thing, pass out, wake up around 3, 3, 4 o'clock, go downstairs, play some Street Fighter, find some breakfast, and just go about my day.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Yeah. No, I hear you. I hear that. I think that might be my strategy at future cons is to just go to bed early like the true old man I am and then get up really early while other people are staying up late.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000
There you go. There you go.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Alright. Well, I'm sorry, I'm reading chat while I'm talking to you. Rama, I don't know if there's anything else you wanted to share or if that's it.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Oh, that's basically it because I called in because I was like, well, I figured everybody else would call in, but let me jump in, talk to you guys, kind of get things going.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Maybe after I get off the phone, more people will start calling in, you know, because I put that challenge out like several years ago, you know?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:49.000
You never know. It's just some weeks are slower than others. It's all good. Is there something on TV tonight? Walking Dead back? I don't know.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000
American Idol.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Oh, nobody's watching that.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
I know.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Anyway. Alright, Rama, I'm gonna let you go, but look forward to anime jam session this week. Take care.

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Thank you. Take care, bro.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Bye.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Alright, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype. Otherwise, we might be wrapping things up here pretty soon, and that's okay.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.000
You know, again, those weeks rolling up to E3 are gonna be a little bit slower.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Sadly, none of us going to E3, but I don't know if any of you guys are going.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I don't know if I'm sad about that.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:28.000
E3's just changed, and it's just not really the same show that it was. What was the first year we all went? Was it 2004? Must have been.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Because this show started 2002, and I feel like, yeah, we went three times, right? All of us went three times before.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:41.000
2006 was the big we year, the year that I called the Paris Hilton year. That was where it was like out of fucking control.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000
And that was our third year going, right? We all went those first three years.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Yeah, I went in 2000.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Yeah.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.000
No, last year I went was 2009 or 10.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Well, I went again a few more times. When they went back to the convention center, I went back, I feel like I was there in 2014 was like the last year I went.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000
It wasn't that long ago. I think it was 2014 was the last year I went.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
It was 2009.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.000
We did the interactive coverage. Remember when you could submit questions, and we would try to find the answers for you?

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Yeah.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:22.000
I did that with Bobby one year, and I think it was the second year. I think the first year he did it, and I went to pick him up, and I did the Ouya booth because it was outside. You didn't need a badge to get in.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Yeah.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
But otherwise he had to do everything. Was it the Ouya? I feel like it was Ouya.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Yes, Ouya was outside.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:41.000
But then the problem was, and the reason why we never did the interactive coverage again was that it was like the reason why E3 is not the show it used to be is explained by the fact that the interactive coverage doesn't really work anymore.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Because nobody wants to answer a question that's off the script. And if you want to see the script, just go watch YouTube or Twitch. It's all right there.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
And nobody wants to talk about anything that's off script.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Unless it's an indie developer.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Unless it's an indie developer, which is kind of rare to see. Well, I don't know. Now that some of the bigger names are dropping out at E3.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Do they still have like the indie booth?

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Sure. And that was my favorite booth. That was my favorite booth at E3 because those are the people that would talk and let you ask anything you want, but those weren't the questions we were getting because people didn't know about those games.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Yeah.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Which I don't blame the people asking the questions. It didn't work. It's unfortunate.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Dartosuya says Kensha Hall. Well, that was the really cool indie place those first three years.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
That's where you see all sorts of weird shit.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Kensha Hall turned into a parking lot later on. I don't even know.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Actually, come to think of it, didn't they just remodel the convention center? Like if you're going to DragCon, Jamie, isn't it going to be different?

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Because, funny enough, DragCon is at the same place that they're doing E3, right?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Yeah.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
They use one of the halls, the West Hall or the North Hall.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I think they expanded into one of the larger ones.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Yeah, but the funny thing is that's the same place that they're going to have E3 and I think they remodeled the convention center, if I'm not mistaken, or at least that was in the cards.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Us.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:04.000
I know that area around it has changed significantly since our early E3s. You know, now they have the whole LA Live shit.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Like the last year I did go to E3, I was like, wow, there's like restaurants down here and fancy hotels and all that good stuff.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Sia Tabiri says it's in South Hall. Okay, well South Hall is where they always had Nintendo and all that stuff.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Bonds006 says, how was the room booking bad for MAGFest? I had a room booked last September and it was very easy.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.000
I think you got lucky, my friend. A lot of people had a lot of problems booking rooms for MAGFest.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:37.000
But hopefully this year they'll get that shit sorted out. Although I have to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll go back to MAGFest.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Nothing against the con, or the people. I certainly enjoy myself, but some of y'all know I switched jobs a couple years ago.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000
And with it, I took a big hit and the amount of time off I get a year.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
So I have to pick and choose my conventions a little more carefully, that's all.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Well you guys, I guess that's probably going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
If you do want to interact with our host, you can always send us an email.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:06.000

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:14.000
If you would like to also leave us a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, we'd really appreciate that wherever you found this podcast.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't air those voices if they're not here.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
So help us spread the word, we would really appreciate that.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000
You can also join us on Twitter at OLR. We also have a Discord and you can always chat with us through Discord.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:33.000
We do get some of our stories from Discord, so a big thank you to those on Discord sharing info with us throughout the week.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.000
That's VOG Network dot com slash Discord. VOG Network dot com slash Discord.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
With that, I think we will go around the room and give everybody's final thoughts.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I know it's a little bit shorter tonight, but probably just again the slower news week, these things are going to happen.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.000
So, Loki, final thought for you tonight?

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Final thought is my wife keeps texting me that my kids are sick.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Oh no.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Yes, apparently there's lots of screaming and yelling and sitting on the potty, so.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
That means you're going to be sick.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I hope not.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
All right.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:06.000
My final thought tonight is that Alan went shopping during the show and he brought back Oreos.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:14.000
So last week we had Cherry Coke Oreos, which weren't bad. I really liked them, but they have Pop Rocks in them, so it was a little weird.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
But it gives that kind of carbon-y, you know, like a carbonated beverage would have.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
It was okay.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:24.000
This week he has brought us pina colada, which I guess is a new thing they're doing, and kettle corn.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And I'm really curious about kettle corn, but I feel like it's not going to make a very good Oreo.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I would like to try.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Yeah, we'll do that right after the show.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.000
The coconut Oreos are good because they just have regular coconuts, so I'm sure pina colada is going to be fine.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
It's just coconut with pineapple dust or something.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Do you like pina coladas?

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Let's put pineapple on the pizza.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Anyway, that's my final thought.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:53.000
I'm disappointed in my chicken strips today, and I think I'm going to go get a taco on the way home.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Mmm, tacos.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Like, one taco.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Alright, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Thanks to you guys so much for tuning in, and we hope you all have a great week.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
We'll see you in seven days, at least Loki and I will.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Dark Sakura, have a ton of fun at Dragon Con. We'll see you in two weeks.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Dragon Con.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Drag Con.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Yes.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Drag on the con.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Drag that con.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Drag on and go to the con.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I will.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Forget it.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
We're out of here.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Bye.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
