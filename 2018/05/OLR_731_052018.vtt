WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.960
In the continuing case of defying expectations, No Man's Sky is getting actual multiplayer

00:17.960 --> 00:19.680
rather than just light or presence.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.720
Promises are being kept, which is fair since no timeframes were specified.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.800
This is just one story tonight, stay tuned for the rest starting right now on the show

00:25.800 --> 00:31.560
where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.560 --> 00:36.040
Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.040 --> 00:43.560
It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight for May the 20th, 2018 with episode number 731

00:43.560 --> 00:47.160
of our show where we're here to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer

00:47.160 --> 00:51.680
lifestyle with your hosts here in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, you might know me on

00:51.680 --> 00:57.360
Twitter at Skie, sadly not here again tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.200
She's continuing her adventures that she kind of started last week.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.960
I think she has a friend from out of the country that is visiting and today they went to lovely

01:03.960 --> 01:08.460
San Francisco to go frolic and do the San Francisco-y things.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.960
So I am joined alone here in studio by Loki.

01:11.960 --> 01:12.960
Hello.

01:12.960 --> 01:13.960
Hi Loki, how are you?

01:13.960 --> 01:14.960
I'm good.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.960
Good.

01:15.960 --> 01:16.960
What's new with you?

01:16.960 --> 01:17.960
My mouth's on fire now.

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
Oh, with the food you were eating?

01:18.960 --> 01:19.960
Yeah, the salsa.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
All I heard you was, it's spicy.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.440
Spicy food is like really good for me right now because, and you guys can probably hear

01:24.440 --> 01:27.320
it if I seem like a little less peppy than usual.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.920
Like these, this is so weird.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.600
Like I never got allergies in my life.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.880
And then last year it seemed like a little bit, because I remember talking to a doctor

01:34.880 --> 01:38.500
and the doctor was like, well, it is possible you can develop allergies later in life.

01:38.500 --> 01:42.960
But this year, like this last week, like it started, I think it was Monday or Tuesday

01:42.960 --> 01:45.360
because I remember tweeting about this, I think it was around Tuesday, because I tried

01:45.360 --> 01:46.360
to get a doctor appointment on Tuesday.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
It was really scary.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.920
I had no voice whatsoever.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.440
And that was kind of scary and humbling for a minute because, you know, I have to use

01:54.440 --> 01:56.420
my voice to do my job.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.240
Like without my voice, I'm going to be screwed in that regard.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.880
It kind of makes you go like, oh shit.

02:00.880 --> 02:01.880
You know?

02:01.880 --> 02:03.400
And then of course there's this, you know, my hobby that I've had for years.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.600
You just have to pull a Stephen Hawking's at that point.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.600
I know, right?

02:06.600 --> 02:07.720
What else would you do?

02:07.720 --> 02:12.440
So except have a voice to chat or chat to voice, whatever, that sort of thing.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.280
So I mean, it's just like, oh my gosh.

02:14.280 --> 02:18.160
So anyway, luckily you can tell my voice is improving, but it's like these allergies are

02:18.160 --> 02:19.400
moving everywhere.

02:19.400 --> 02:23.120
Like one day it'll be my throat, one day it'll be my sinuses, which is what it is today.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.640
And if you've ever had super congested sinuses, you know, that sinus pressure is no fun to

02:26.640 --> 02:27.640
deal with at all.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.360
So it's kind of what I'm dealing with today.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.800
And then, you know, it's just some days it's just irritation, you know, so it's just, ugh.

02:33.800 --> 02:38.960
So I did go to a doctor just, you know, not to be sharing all my business on OLR, but

02:38.960 --> 02:43.600
they do agree it's probably allergies because here in lovely Sacramento where our show is

02:43.600 --> 02:46.220
based, it's been a killer year for allergies.

02:46.220 --> 02:50.140
And so I guess mine have just kind of shown themselves and really taken hold and oh my

02:50.140 --> 02:52.260
God, it's, it's awful.

02:52.260 --> 02:56.060
So we're trying over the counter stuff to try to treat it.

02:56.060 --> 03:00.180
So I don't feel a hundred percent, but at least, you know, at least I'm here and I'm

03:00.180 --> 03:01.960
able to do this show well enough.

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
That's important.

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
Right?

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
Right.

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
Yeah.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
So there you go.

03:06.960 --> 03:07.960
And it's not strep.

03:07.960 --> 03:08.960
That's it.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.960
It tested me for strep and it's not that.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.960
So that's good news.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
That's why you can sit here with me because we're confident.

03:11.960 --> 03:12.960
It's allergies.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
That's not something as contagious.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.820
You already had allergies anyway.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.220
I probably have allergies now.

03:17.220 --> 03:18.220
Yeah.

03:18.220 --> 03:20.140
You don't, you never got them as this bad though, right?

03:20.140 --> 03:21.140
I get allergies.

03:21.140 --> 03:27.060
I get like, especially like a very raspy throat, like earlier this week I had that, you know,

03:27.060 --> 03:30.060
it's just like, I always feel like I have to clear my throat and stuff.

03:30.060 --> 03:33.500
Brad from Pod Culture asking the tough question saying, could it be Mr. Smoosh?

03:33.500 --> 03:37.100
Oh, by the way, I should of course introduce our chat room because we do tape live every

03:37.100 --> 03:40.940
Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice geeks network,

03:40.940 --> 03:45.020
geeksnetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:45.020 --> 03:48.460
And a quick plug for Bobby who's going to be at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo the

03:48.460 --> 03:50.540
weekend of June 8th in Atlanta.

03:50.540 --> 03:53.880
And he talked about some pretty exciting news and things you can see him do at the expo

03:53.880 --> 03:54.880
there on the show tonight.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.020
So quick little plug there for Bobby.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.460
I'm going back to the chat though.

03:58.460 --> 04:01.260
Brad from Pod Culture asks, could it be Mr. Smoosh, our cat?

04:01.260 --> 04:04.620
I don't, I wouldn't think so because we've had the cat since November and he doesn't

04:04.620 --> 04:05.940
go outdoors.

04:05.940 --> 04:09.500
And I mean, if I had a cat allergy, I've been around cats my whole life.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.980
I think I would have seen it by now.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.460
I mean, this is the first time we've had an exotic short hair, but I grew up with a Siamese

04:14.460 --> 04:15.460
cat.

04:15.460 --> 04:18.060
And typically I would think shorter hair cats aren't going to be as bad.

04:18.060 --> 04:19.060
Exactly.

04:19.060 --> 04:22.340
And Sanrio is, you know, she was a little, little lion, so she had, you know, really

04:22.340 --> 04:23.340
thick fur.

04:23.340 --> 04:24.340
So I don't think it'd be a cat.

04:24.340 --> 04:25.340
Yeah.

04:25.340 --> 04:26.340
I don't think it's the cow allergies.

04:26.340 --> 04:29.180
I appreciate y'all playing doctor in our chat though.

04:29.180 --> 04:30.180
Everybody's WebMD.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.180
That's right.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.180
Dr. Google to the rescue.

04:32.180 --> 04:33.700
No, I'm just giving you guys a shit.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.740
Uh, as 200 Matt says, our allergies change every few years.

04:36.740 --> 04:40.440
I never used to be allergic to pollen and dust until recently, recently, my allergies

04:40.440 --> 04:42.820
manifest as headaches now, which is really annoying.

04:42.820 --> 04:43.820
Yeah.

04:43.820 --> 04:44.820
That's, that's, that's true.

04:44.820 --> 04:45.820
The case.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.500
Uh, and then Siatabiri says, thank you for sticking it out.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
Rob Roberts.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.020
Uh, I'm trying my best.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.700
Uh, it may be a little bit shorter of a show tonight though.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.020
I might be able to put in two hours, but we'll see if it's a little shorter tonight.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.020
That's why.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.140
Um, and Bobby Buckle says, are you sure you're not just allergic to Loki?

05:00.140 --> 05:02.860
Well, I think, I think that would have developed a long time ago.

05:02.860 --> 05:03.860
Yeah.

05:03.860 --> 05:08.660
Another interesting internet theory from She-Hulk who says, could be the volcano and Ash.

05:08.660 --> 05:11.660
I mean, Hawaii is a, is a very far away.

05:11.660 --> 05:17.620
I mean, Hawaii is what, like a three, four hour flight from here and like only that long,

05:17.620 --> 05:18.620
isn't it?

05:18.620 --> 05:19.620
I don't remember.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.620
It's been so long since I've been to Hawaii.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.820
I think it's like a four hour flight for the, for the like San Francisco, like a four hour

05:23.820 --> 05:24.820
flight.

05:24.820 --> 05:27.180
So that's almost the time zone changes though.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.180
No, no, no.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.180
It's not cause of time.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.180
Don't changes.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.700
It's, it's, you know, you're about four hours in the year.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.700
Uh, I don't know.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.700
It's been, it's been a long time.

05:33.740 --> 05:37.900
Don't me on that, but I feel like it's, it's like far, like Hawaii is probably as far away

05:37.900 --> 05:43.220
as like Orlando, you know, it's a long way away.

05:43.220 --> 05:45.620
So I don't think it's that, but who knows?

05:45.620 --> 05:46.620
Who knows?

05:46.620 --> 05:47.620
Anyway.

05:47.620 --> 05:50.180
Five-ish from San Francisco says, uh, Brad from Pod Culture.

05:50.180 --> 05:51.180
Okay.

05:51.180 --> 05:52.180
Fair enough.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.620
Uh, as 200 Matt says, get an allergy test.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.620
You know, what's weird.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.380
I tried hinting to my doctor.

05:56.380 --> 05:58.540
That's kind of what I wanted to do.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.920
And I guess maybe my symptoms weren't bad enough, especially because this is the way

06:01.920 --> 06:02.920
it always happens.

06:02.920 --> 06:03.920
Right.

06:03.920 --> 06:04.920
And we will get into video games.

06:04.920 --> 06:09.160
We always do, but sometimes talk about ourselves, uh, is that I go to the doctor on Thursday

06:09.160 --> 06:13.280
and of course the symptoms on Thursday were like the best they've been all week.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.300
So she was able to see that my throat was irritated a little bit, but like, it wasn't

06:16.300 --> 06:17.300
as bad as it is today.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.240
It wasn't as bad as it is Tuesday.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.400
So she's just like, oh, you're, yeah, you have a little bit of allergies.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.040
I mean, the big baby, I mean, she's not going to say that to me, but you know, it was kind

06:27.040 --> 06:30.960
of like, it wasn't bad enough for her to think like, oh, I should refer him to an allergist.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.080
So I'm going to have to keep complaining if it's really bad or something.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.440
I don't know, but I'm going to try to stick it out for at least a little while longer

06:36.440 --> 06:41.400
and see because it could be maybe that I have like a cold symptom or something that's going

06:41.400 --> 06:44.720
through, but then Alan would have got it because he kind of lives here.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.840
So I don't know guys.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.840
So confusing.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.120
Is there a doctor in the house?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.120
I'm just teasing.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.240
I saw a doctor.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.340
It'll be okay.

06:52.340 --> 06:56.440
But you know how healthcare is here in America.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.840
I have to be, I have to be coughing.

06:58.840 --> 07:04.000
I have to be, you know, really showing more symptoms and probably bleeding or something

07:04.000 --> 07:05.920
to get more expensive tests ordered.

07:05.920 --> 07:10.400
That's that's the way it is, I suppose anyway, or at least prove that these over the counter

07:10.400 --> 07:11.400
things don't work.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.400
All right.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.240
As I promised, we do talk about games here at Orange Launch Radio, and there's been quite

07:16.240 --> 07:20.960
a bit going on this week, especially as we are leading up to E3.

07:20.960 --> 07:21.960
Let's start with this.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.800
This is, this is, I guess this kickoff topic tonight is more of, I guess, maybe a little

07:25.800 --> 07:30.860
bit of a special interest thing, but it does kind of cater to how you buy games and what

07:30.860 --> 07:31.860
you're able to buy.

07:31.860 --> 07:32.860
Right, Logie?

07:32.860 --> 07:33.860
Yeah.

07:33.860 --> 07:37.880
So Valve decided, hey, you know what, we're going to actually do some content moderation

07:37.880 --> 07:43.160
now being that they don't do it for anything else ever.

07:43.160 --> 07:49.140
But now they're apparently they're cracking down on some of these more sexier pornographic

07:49.140 --> 07:54.040
games, basically actually targeting visual novels.

07:54.040 --> 07:59.200
So there's been quite a few different developers of these visual novel titles that have been

07:59.200 --> 08:04.520
getting emails basically stating that, you know, they were going to be removed from the

08:04.520 --> 08:11.040
platform because of, you know, erotic material in those games.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.860
But it sounds like that they have backtracked on that a little bit.

08:14.860 --> 08:20.980
So apparently, Mega Gamer, Honeypot and Loopy Soft have now said that they've received emails

08:20.980 --> 08:24.700
from Valve saying that they're going to be rereviewed for content and they'll be informed

08:24.700 --> 08:27.020
that there's any specific concerns.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.100
So that's kind of good.

08:28.100 --> 08:33.820
But I find it ironic that this is what they come down on, you know, this like, oh my God,

08:33.820 --> 08:38.180
there's, you know, anime breasts in a fucking game versus, oh my God, there's a bunch of

08:38.180 --> 08:42.780
broken ass shit that people are exploiting this platform to try to get online.

08:42.780 --> 08:47.400
That no big deal because we get paid, but oh my God, the titties, please don't show

08:47.400 --> 08:48.400
those titties.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.520
The ultra violent things they can get through.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.520
No problem.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.200
But that that speaks to a larger issue in this country.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.200
We all know that.

08:54.200 --> 08:59.040
Yeah, they had one that Hatred had been one of those titles that they removed for violence.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.980
But then eventually they just went ahead and put it back on there.

09:02.980 --> 09:05.840
So it was just, you know, huh?

09:05.840 --> 09:09.720
I just I mean, it's it's kind of like you said, though, like it's it's just boobs.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.840
Like, why can't they just put a warning or something like that on there?

09:12.840 --> 09:15.940
Why can't they just put it all games on the floor, you know, make it so that you have

09:15.940 --> 09:18.320
to be 18 or older to purchase it, which isn't it?

09:18.320 --> 09:23.360
I mean, granted, I I've always kind of hated, which, you know, well, those those age gates

09:23.360 --> 09:24.360
aren't very hard to get around.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.360
You just lie about your birthday.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.360
But don't you have to have like be 18 to buy games on steam anyway?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.360
Maybe not.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.240
I mean, I would think so, because you have to have a credit card, but you could have

09:31.240 --> 09:32.240
a steam.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.920
Yeah, I guess that's really hard.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.920
Steam points card.

09:34.920 --> 09:35.920
Allow them.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.640
So you have to have a credit card on file or something like that.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.640
Yeah.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.320
Something in your name or something, something to get the more intense stuff and certainly

09:43.320 --> 09:47.480
like a warning or who gives a fuck because it's just fucking drawn boobs.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.240
I mean, well, I mean, let's put it this way.

09:50.240 --> 09:55.120
If you're if you're below the age of 18 and you're on the platform and you're attempting

09:55.120 --> 09:59.360
to purchase sexy whatever game and you're not allowed to do that.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.740
Oh, my God.

10:00.740 --> 10:05.900
It's not like you don't have access to the whole Internet where there's just pornography

10:05.900 --> 10:07.660
literally everywhere.

10:07.660 --> 10:13.060
That's true that you can access parents really freely and still need to watch what their

10:13.060 --> 10:17.280
kids are doing and actually use steam, especially if like, you know, little Timmy.

10:17.280 --> 10:21.000
Who is, you know, maybe only 14 years old is going to have a steam account because grandma

10:21.000 --> 10:23.840
buys him steam port point cards for Christmas.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.400
And the parents probably want to make sure that like porty games don't go on it.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.720
But shouldn't it be very easy for the parents to be able to see receipts and what they don't

10:30.720 --> 10:31.720
they have?

10:31.720 --> 10:34.180
I'm assuming since this would be like any other platform that's out there when they

10:34.180 --> 10:37.840
have parental controls on steam to be able to prevent those types of games from even

10:37.840 --> 10:38.840
showing up in searches.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.280
I have to be honest, I've never really used that stuff because I don't have kids.

10:42.280 --> 10:46.000
I don't have kids that buy games either on my steam account because it's just me buying

10:46.000 --> 10:47.880
games on my steam.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.440
No one's buying games on my steam account.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.920
Well, I was just gonna say your kids are going to get older soon enough.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.720
So have you thought about any of this type of stuff or are you just going to kind of

10:55.720 --> 10:57.200
try to control all that?

10:57.200 --> 11:00.080
Nah, I'm not going to block anything.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.360
Who cares?

11:01.360 --> 11:02.360
It's just titties.

11:02.360 --> 11:07.000
I'll just say, I'll just tell them this, okay, it's like, listen, these games are here to

11:07.000 --> 11:09.360
try to sell you anime titties.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.560
They're not that great.

11:11.560 --> 11:15.280
If you're looking to see anime titties, you can just don't pay for fucking pornography.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
Yes, not even like good boobs.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.240
Don't pay for pornography.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.320
That's the lesson that needs to be learned there.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.840
They're not even like good boobs.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.840
They're not even tittle-lating.

11:22.840 --> 11:28.080
Anyway, let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.240
Some help from folks that have actually seen some of these things in steam.

11:32.240 --> 11:36.880
MXC says some steam games do have age gates before you go to the store page, although

11:36.880 --> 11:38.560
Kaiju-do, you know how to get around it.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.140
I tell them I was born in 1923, I can get into anything.

11:42.140 --> 11:47.780
Let's see, MXC does say, steam accounts do have family libraries you can set up, as in

11:47.780 --> 11:50.340
hiding certain games, restricting, etc.

11:50.340 --> 11:54.500
Yeah, I was gonna say, like, there has to be, I mean, that whole type of stuff is customary

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
now.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.500
I'd be very surprised if that wasn't in there.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.980
And if the issue is, oh, well then my child is gonna find a way to get around it, if they're

11:59.980 --> 12:04.500
smart enough to find a way to get around your age gating or whatever, they know where the

12:04.500 --> 12:05.740
porn is on the internet.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.260
I mean, come on.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.460
Bobby Black Wolf says, notice that Valve only cares about anime titties.

12:11.460 --> 12:14.620
3D model titties like in The Witcher 3 are not in trouble.

12:14.620 --> 12:18.860
If some of those anime visual novels were 3D models, they probably would be fine.

12:18.860 --> 12:19.900
That's a good counterpoint.

12:19.900 --> 12:20.900
There are some-

12:20.900 --> 12:22.500
Which doesn't make any goddamn sense.

12:22.500 --> 12:27.860
Is it because, like, again, I haven't played these games, but is it because the anime characters

12:27.860 --> 12:29.780
are portrayed as young girls?

12:29.780 --> 12:33.500
So it gets in that really, like, yucky area of kiddie porn, which I agree is gross.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
Let's just put it this way.

12:34.500 --> 12:40.380
Okay, so I have my Steam store page up here right now, and as I'm scrolling down, I have

12:40.380 --> 12:45.700
under, you know, the under $10 page has a bunch of the Super Dimension Neptunia stuff,

12:45.700 --> 12:47.980
which all has anime chicks on the front.

12:47.980 --> 12:52.280
Scroll down even a little bit further, and I've got this game called RabiRibi, which

12:52.280 --> 13:01.380
has, you know, scantily clad, young looking anime chicks in it as well.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.500
I mean, I don't know.

13:03.500 --> 13:07.220
I was just about to ask, like, where's the anime dicks, though?

13:07.220 --> 13:11.980
And MXC with a good point in our chat saying, some of the visual novels do feature young,

13:11.980 --> 13:13.380
in quotes, looking girls.

13:13.380 --> 13:18.700
However, coming out on top, a gay dating sim about college men was also targeted.

13:18.700 --> 13:24.420
Was- I can't keep my gay dating sims straight.

13:24.420 --> 13:27.500
But is coming out on top, is that, like, sexually explicit?

13:27.500 --> 13:31.340
Didn't it have a version on Steam that took the really gross stuff- well, I say gross,

13:31.340 --> 13:34.820
but, you know, Tumblr type stuff out?

13:34.820 --> 13:36.060
I thought that's how it worked.

13:36.060 --> 13:39.180
Not that I expect you to know, but I- somebody in chat hopefully does.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.580
There's too many games to keep track of.

13:40.580 --> 13:45.060
I remember one of those popular gay dating sims, and I think it was that one, had, like,

13:45.060 --> 13:49.340
a watered down Steam version that came out where they removed, like, the most explicit,

13:49.340 --> 13:54.860
like, jizz on my face type of scenes that were, like, in the original, if I remember

13:54.860 --> 13:55.860
correctly.

13:55.860 --> 13:58.540
You know, I have- honestly, I've never played those games.

13:58.540 --> 14:01.420
Like, if I want porn, just go to Tumblr.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.980
Or the new one that we've talked about on this show, you know where all the porn is

14:03.980 --> 14:04.980
at now?

14:04.980 --> 14:06.580
Like, it's, like, it's Twitter.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.540
Like, all the fucking porn is going to Twitter.

14:08.540 --> 14:11.960
I don't know, like, where that is, but we've talked about this on a previous episode because

14:11.960 --> 14:16.540
you get really annoyed because you just happen to have a lot of gay male friends who heart

14:16.540 --> 14:19.620
stuff and then your feed just fills up with dudes in underwear.

14:19.620 --> 14:22.220
Listen, this is what I- okay, listen.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.500
Which is not your preferred thing.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.860
Wait, and then I'll have a problem- it's really a problem with Twitter, and it's anything

14:27.860 --> 14:30.300
that basically, oh, this person liked this thing.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.940
I don't care what you liked, okay?

14:31.940 --> 14:32.940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:32.940 --> 14:37.460
Liking is good if you want to let that person know you liked the thing, or you want to bookmark

14:37.460 --> 14:41.780
it for later so that you can go back to it and it's easily able to find.

14:41.780 --> 14:45.500
That's why I did, like, I- there was a really cool animation that I saw that gave me a great

14:45.500 --> 14:48.780
idea for, like, a game idea, so I was like, okay, I'm gonna like that so that I can go

14:48.780 --> 14:52.660
back to my like list and find this thing that I'm looking for.

14:52.700 --> 14:58.340
So, you know, that's what I use it for, but like, I get it, you find that guy attractive,

14:58.340 --> 15:02.780
but dude, I can only block so many gay men on my, you know, Twitter feed.

15:02.780 --> 15:04.300
And before you start to look over the whole day.

15:04.300 --> 15:09.220
It's not that I am, like, anti-gay or anything, it's like, I browse Twitter at work and I

15:09.220 --> 15:11.900
don't want that, just like, oh, hey.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.100
Loki, it's happening to me.

15:13.100 --> 15:17.140
Believe it or not, I'm friends with some straight people, and the same thing's happening to

15:17.140 --> 15:18.140
me.

15:18.140 --> 15:21.340
I'm getting Beaver on my feed, which I'm- I try very hard not to be one of those gay

15:21.340 --> 15:24.460
guys that's like, ew, vagina.

15:24.460 --> 15:28.860
But you know, I'm just like, okay, I didn't really need to see this, this is not the content

15:28.860 --> 15:30.260
I signed up for today.

15:30.260 --> 15:37.620
Well, yeah, like, I've got a few people on my feed that enjoy, you know, very attractive

15:37.620 --> 15:40.220
cosplay women in there as well.

15:40.220 --> 15:44.620
And that also is something I can't just have popping up on my screen if I'm browsing Twitter.

15:44.620 --> 15:49.100
But you know what most people are gonna tell you, stop using Twitter at work and do your

15:49.100 --> 15:50.100
work.

15:50.140 --> 15:54.540
See, Twitter's blocked at my work, so I only have my phone if I'm gonna check Twitter.

15:54.540 --> 16:00.180
So luckily, that's, you know, pretty easy to hide, but still, I'm like, the hearted

16:00.180 --> 16:02.900
post feed, that really fucking annoys me.

16:02.900 --> 16:07.260
The only way to get around it that I found, I can do it on my PC if I use TweetDeck.

16:07.260 --> 16:11.580
You go to like TweetDeck.Twitter.com or something like that, and it will show you, you can set

16:11.580 --> 16:15.300
up different custom feeds, but like your normal feed will not have any of that shit in it.

16:15.300 --> 16:19.860
So it's like the third party stuff is the only way to get around, like, the forced like

16:19.860 --> 16:20.860
stuff.

16:20.860 --> 16:24.260
But I heard that that might be changing in the coming weeks, that like Twitter's gonna

16:24.260 --> 16:25.820
clamp down on the third party stuff.

16:25.820 --> 16:29.900
Of course they wanna market that shit, so whatever, I mean, it is what it is.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.420
I just kinda, I just block people now.

16:32.420 --> 16:34.620
I mean, that's all I have to do.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.260
And I mean, whatever.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.260
It's fine.

16:38.260 --> 16:40.420
It's not like I'm gonna follow those people anyways.

16:40.420 --> 16:41.420
That's it, yeah.

16:41.420 --> 16:44.020
Kaijuto in chat says, I respect my followers on Twitter.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.660
I never fav nude pics.

16:45.660 --> 16:46.660
I see.

16:46.660 --> 16:47.660
Same thing.

16:47.660 --> 16:49.940
And like, I would keep it real.

16:49.940 --> 16:55.020
Sometimes I've been at home, and I'm looking at Twitter late at night, and you know, some

16:55.020 --> 17:00.420
very attractive male is lying on his bed in his jockstrap, and I'm like, that is a fine

17:00.420 --> 17:02.100
looking specimen of a man.

17:02.100 --> 17:06.260
And like, I wanna click the heart to give that guy that validation he's seeking, but

17:06.260 --> 17:10.220
I don't do it out of respect for people like Loki and everybody else who follows me, because

17:10.220 --> 17:14.140
I'm like, okay, if I heart this post, everybody's gonna know you're a perv.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.900
Like, I don't, but I feel bad.

17:16.900 --> 17:21.340
I'm like, I wanna give my friends posting nudes validation, but I can't do it.

17:21.340 --> 17:24.460
That's why they should have something separate where you can do it.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.540
Or you just have to roll a separate account, and I think that's something that Bobby Blackwell's

17:27.540 --> 17:31.820
getting to in our chat, saying, don't be horny on maim.

17:31.820 --> 17:35.460
And that's what other people are doing, is that people are making, I keep wanting to

17:35.460 --> 17:37.540
say, rolling alt accounts.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.660
It's a World of Warcraft character.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.580
So you have your real World of Warcraft character Twitter account.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.140
I'm rolling the pervert class now?

17:45.140 --> 17:51.740
Yeah, then you have your Goldshirean Warcraft character on the Moonguard server.

17:51.740 --> 17:57.220
And that's actually, that's what I do see some people doing, not a lot, but I do have

17:57.220 --> 17:58.220
friends that do that.

17:58.220 --> 18:04.280
They have a, they have a, but they will follow me still on their alt.

18:04.280 --> 18:08.700
And like, I'm not interested in posting naked photographs of myself on the internet.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.540
I have nothing against people that do.

18:10.540 --> 18:14.100
I think that's cool if you have that type of like self-esteem to be able to do that,

18:14.100 --> 18:17.940
but like, it's also one of those things where I can look at it and go, you know, not for

18:17.940 --> 18:18.940
me.

18:18.940 --> 18:23.260
And especially having the increased visibility of doing this show, my career and so forth.

18:23.260 --> 18:26.240
Nudes of me on the internet, probably not the best idea, right?

18:26.240 --> 18:33.100
So like, I have no interest in rolling an alt account to post, but maybe to view, maybe.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.300
Anyway, where were we?

18:35.300 --> 18:38.020
Anime titties turned into a Twitter talk.

18:38.020 --> 18:41.020
Does Steam need to ban Twitter?

18:42.020 --> 18:45.580
I think they need to focus their selves on other things, honestly.

18:45.580 --> 18:51.900
I mean, I don't know what the, from what I, because I remember hearing a story about this.

18:51.900 --> 18:56.100
And so it was, I think another, it was like a Watchsaw group or something that like went

18:56.100 --> 18:57.500
after these types of games.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.180
And that's what kind of brought attention to the Steam about it.

19:00.180 --> 19:06.460
But I mean, really, they need to just focus more on these games that, you know, the whole

19:06.460 --> 19:09.540
getting rid of the whole, the green light thing and stuff.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.540
Terrible idea.

19:10.540 --> 19:16.540
Because now anything's on there and literally all sorts of bullshit garbage is on Steam

19:16.540 --> 19:17.540
now.

19:17.540 --> 19:18.540
It's ridiculous.

19:18.540 --> 19:19.540
All right.

19:19.540 --> 19:22.980
And then I'm looking in chat, Fifth Dreams saying, I just had this conversation on Twitter

19:22.980 --> 19:27.020
last night and this morning, a musician I follow click like on a lady and you could

19:27.020 --> 19:28.020
see her butt.

19:28.020 --> 19:31.180
I wonder out loud if people know we can sometimes see those likes.

19:31.180 --> 19:34.860
Well, remember that infamous case that happened with Senator Ted Cruz?

19:34.860 --> 19:35.860
Yeah.

19:36.180 --> 19:40.780
His account liked some porny thing and it became a meme overnight.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.900
And now you still see that come up.

19:42.900 --> 19:43.900
That lady in the glasses.

19:43.900 --> 19:44.900
What the fuck was that?

19:44.900 --> 19:48.100
I don't remember what was going on, but the lady in the glasses biting your finger because

19:48.100 --> 19:51.340
she's like looking at something sexy going on, like, you know, that infamous still from

19:51.340 --> 19:52.340
that.

19:52.340 --> 19:55.820
Like that is probably the most well-known story about that happening was when that account,

19:55.820 --> 20:01.040
whether it was him or an intern or whatever it was, it certainly was not a great look

20:01.040 --> 20:06.600
for a professional, you know, politician, no matter how you feel about politics.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.960
Let's see.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.400
Also in chat, S.J.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.760
O'Connor-Matt says, I have the same problem.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.920
I keep seeing people favoriting borderline, not safe for work, furry stuff.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.840
I have no problem or issue with friends having their, that be their interest, but I really

20:19.840 --> 20:25.760
don't want to see a sexualized fan drawing of Isabel from Animal Crossing on my feed.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.880
I also just block it now.

20:28.880 --> 20:37.760
Hey, why don't I show you where you can put those bells?

20:37.760 --> 20:40.800
She's just trying to pay off her mortgage.

20:40.800 --> 20:50.160
The things Tom Nook makes people do are very, very dark.

20:50.160 --> 20:56.520
I love that multiple people in chat are starting to put no in all caps, not just one person,

20:56.520 --> 20:58.440
but like multiple people on a row.

20:58.440 --> 21:07.080
No, stop, desist, end, cease.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.640
Vidpower says, I did not need to know about Isabel porn.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.640
A blame S.J.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.640
O'Connor-Matt.

21:11.640 --> 21:12.640
It was his idea.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.640
It's a thing.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.640
There's the Internet.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.640
Of course, there's porn of it.

21:15.640 --> 21:19.120
Oh, my God.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.120
Let's see.

21:20.120 --> 21:24.920
And then J.D. saying, there's a reason why there's a difference between like and retweet.

21:24.920 --> 21:25.920
Amen.

21:25.920 --> 21:31.760
Like, why can't it just be if I want people to know I like it, I'll retweet it.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.760
And I do.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.520
Actually, you know what I really love?

21:34.520 --> 21:40.960
I love the quote retweet thing because I know that people will block retweets because I

21:40.960 --> 21:41.960
do that.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.960
Like, I didn't do this in the beginning, but pretty much after I had about 500 people I

21:45.960 --> 21:50.680
was following, whenever I follow somebody new on Twitter, I instantly shut off their

21:50.680 --> 21:51.960
retweets.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.320
I don't care who it is.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.480
I don't want to see retweets.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.080
I want to see the content that the people I'm following are posting.

21:57.080 --> 22:01.200
That's how I'm able to follow a thousand people, not with any regularity or whatever.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.820
But you know, I try to keep tabs on, you know, whatever.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.960
So I instantly disable retweets like all the time.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.200
But if you quote a tweet, it goes around that.

22:11.200 --> 22:15.360
So if there's something where I'm like, oh, no, I want people to say see this like, oh,

22:15.360 --> 22:19.300
there's this great new Maxine Waters video you have to see of her shutting some bitch

22:19.300 --> 22:20.300
down in Washington.

22:20.300 --> 22:24.040
I'm going to quote tweet it so that you have to see it type of thing.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.000
That's how you get around the retweet thing.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.880
But it's so funny that you could turn off retweets, but it doesn't turn off the heart

22:29.880 --> 22:30.880
thing.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.460
Well, yeah, it doesn't make any sense either that you're just going to see what people

22:33.460 --> 22:34.460
like anyways.

22:34.460 --> 22:35.460
And what's the point?

22:35.460 --> 22:37.760
What's the difference between a retwee and the like?

22:37.760 --> 22:39.960
I mean, you're going to see it anyways.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.960
Yeah.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.960
I don't know.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.560
So anyway, where were we?

22:43.560 --> 22:44.560
Steam.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
Yes.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.560
Yes.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.560
Steam.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.560
How far have we gotten away from that?

22:48.560 --> 22:51.400
I guess the only thing I wanted to add on the Steam front, back on the original topic

22:51.400 --> 22:55.400
before we went to Animal Crossing porn, I wanted to say about the fact that doesn't

22:55.400 --> 22:56.560
Steam sell movies?

22:56.560 --> 22:59.040
Is that still a thing that Steam's doing is selling?

22:59.040 --> 23:01.680
So don't they sell R rated movies?

23:01.680 --> 23:02.680
I don't know.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.240
I haven't actually looked at what kind of movies they sell.

23:04.240 --> 23:10.040
I know I have just one one movie that I have that whole movie, the indie game.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.880
I was kind of like the first one that went up there.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.880
Still haven't watched it to this day.

23:12.880 --> 23:19.840
I did watch it for when I went to our innovation lab rotation thing because I was prework prerequisite

23:19.840 --> 23:20.840
for what we're doing.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.960
Literally had nothing to do with what we were doing at all.

23:23.960 --> 23:28.680
So I mean, that was nice that they had me watch it, but it was a good documentary.

23:28.680 --> 23:35.320
I really enjoyed it, but yeah, I had no bearing whatsoever on what we were doing, but it was

23:35.320 --> 23:36.320
still good.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.760
It's weird because I've watched a lot of video game documentaries.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.760
Just not that one.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.480
It is really good.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
I know.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.480
I don't.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.480
I'm not trying to be a hater.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.760
I just, for whatever reason, I just never get around to watching it.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.960
Probably because it is in my Steam library and not on Netflix.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.240
It's not something I think about watching, especially at my computer.

23:52.240 --> 23:56.960
Well, it's good too because it's like three games that I've, well okay, I haven't really

23:56.960 --> 23:57.960
played.

23:57.960 --> 24:02.560
Real quick, S200 Matt says they have 1,088 movies on Steam and MXC confirms they do sell

24:02.560 --> 24:03.560
R-rated movies.

24:03.560 --> 24:08.920
So I would assume at least one of those R-rated movies has boobs, maybe even a dong or a beav

24:08.920 --> 24:12.120
because you can get away with showing like a little bit of that in an R-rated movie,

24:12.120 --> 24:13.120
right?

24:13.120 --> 24:14.120
Maybe from like a distance, you know?

24:14.120 --> 24:17.680
So if you, like up close genitals, probably NC-17, but like from a distance.

24:17.680 --> 24:18.680
I don't know.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.800
We got away with a lot with Borat.

24:21.800 --> 24:31.120
Well, uh, Shape of Water, her lady self was on full display, full frontal display, and

24:31.120 --> 24:33.040
that was an R-rated movie.

24:33.040 --> 24:36.480
And then, what was the, I mean, spoiler alert, but what have I really spoiled?

24:36.480 --> 24:38.360
What's the other one?

24:38.360 --> 24:41.880
The other character that he played as well that was in Borat.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:42.880 --> 24:43.880
I know what you're talking about.

24:43.880 --> 24:44.880
I don't remember his name.

24:44.880 --> 24:50.720
But there was, I'm also thinking that movie with, okay, God, you all are going to judge

24:50.720 --> 24:51.840
me so hard.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.120
Who plays Magneto in X-Men now?

24:55.120 --> 24:59.120
And he was in that movie where he did a full frontal, but it was like for like two seconds.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.120
Michael something.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.680
I don't remember.

25:01.680 --> 25:02.680
Somebody in chat will know.

25:02.680 --> 25:03.680
I don't know.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.680
Anyway.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.680
Oh, and Sia Tabiri in chat says Bruno.

25:05.680 --> 25:06.680
Bruno, yes.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.680
Oh, yeah.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.680
Forgetting Sarah Marshall on that.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
Thank you.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.680
Fassbender.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.680
That's it.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.680
Fassbender.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.680
Michael Fassbender.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.680
Assassin's Creed!

25:14.680 --> 25:17.840
Because I remember joking about, is he going to show us his sword in Assassin's Creed?

25:17.840 --> 25:19.520
So, but anyway.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.640
And then pretty much half the movies you and McGregor has been in.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.680
Anyway, this isn't a nudity in film chat, I promise.

25:25.680 --> 25:30.720
Tiger Claw in chat says, did you guys see the trailer for the Happy Time murders?

25:30.720 --> 25:33.880
I'm sure there will be plenty of boobage, be it Muppet boobage.

25:33.880 --> 25:34.880
Yeah.

25:34.880 --> 25:35.880
Yeah.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.160
Alan sat me down and made me watch that.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.360
That's a total like Meet the Feebles.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.920
That's exactly where my head went to.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.000
I'm like, didn't they do this called Meet the Feebles?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.280
And like the 90 and Meet the Feebles was not very good.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.280
It was terrible.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.480
But it didn't have Melissa McCarthy or Joe McHale.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.420
So these really like funny, funny.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.420
It does look funny.

25:53.420 --> 25:56.400
Like, Alan's like, we're gonna go see this day one.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.560
And so I'm like, even though I never go to movies, I'm like, okay, if it'll make my husband

25:59.560 --> 26:04.680
happy, I'll go, you know, I'm kind of looking at it going, this looks ridiculous, but he,

26:04.680 --> 26:06.520
he will make me go to the most random comedies.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.840
What was the last one we saw?

26:07.840 --> 26:08.840
This is the end.

26:08.840 --> 26:09.840
That was hilarious.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.360
It was it was have funny moments.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.040
That's what I'll get funny moments and funny parts.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.040
It was funny.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.040
I liked it.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
All right.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.040
Anyway.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.040
Oh, wow.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.040
Okay.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.860
JD says this has the actual Jim Henson company behind it, or it sounds like it, which is

26:25.860 --> 26:26.860
a change.

26:26.860 --> 26:27.860
Wow.

26:27.860 --> 26:28.860
Sun or whatever.

26:28.860 --> 26:29.860
It's they're allowing that.

26:29.860 --> 26:30.860
Yeah.

26:30.860 --> 26:32.160
They're the ones doing the puppets.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.480
I'm kind of shocked to hear that.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.800
My how times have changed.

26:35.800 --> 26:36.800
All right.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.100
My how the topic has changed.

26:38.100 --> 26:42.000
So I think we need to shift gears here before we get into the rest of the news.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.200
Talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.680
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:46.680 --> 26:49.380
I didn't play a whole ton, but I did buy a lot of things.

26:49.380 --> 26:50.680
So I mean, there's that.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.560
So there's like all sorts of sales going on.

26:53.560 --> 26:57.920
I went to that we were looking.

26:57.920 --> 27:02.560
My son wanted me to get that Mario and Rabbids kingdom battle thing.

27:02.560 --> 27:07.920
So we ended up finding that half off at Fry's because it was their thirty third anniversary.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.720
So they had a bunch of things that were half off.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.440
With that, though, Fry's also had their DualShock 4's half off.

27:14.440 --> 27:19.120
So I got them for thirty bucks instead of like seventy dollars per controller.

27:19.120 --> 27:24.760
And because my kids had kind of destroyed a couple of my DualShock controllers, I went

27:24.760 --> 27:26.740
ahead and picked up two new ones to go along with it.

27:26.740 --> 27:29.400
So now we have four, which is awesome.

27:29.400 --> 27:35.920
And then I also picked up yesterday a completely different sale at GameStop.

27:35.920 --> 27:45.040
They're doing their pro elite, some sale thing, and they had Skyrim VR for half off.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.080
So, of course, I've been holding out and getting Skyrim VR.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.040
So I had to pick that up as well.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.660
So I can't wait to play that.

27:51.660 --> 27:55.420
And then, you know, they've been doing flash sales on the PlayStation Network.

27:55.420 --> 28:00.480
So they had Titanfall 2, like the Gold Edition or whatever like that for five bucks.

28:00.480 --> 28:05.120
So I was like, hell yes, I will pick that up for five dollars.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.120
There's some other like PlayStation VR games that I picked up.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.520
So, yeah, lots of stuff to play.

28:11.800 --> 28:12.760
Didn't play a whole lot of that.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.400
I did play just the kind of the same type of stuff that I've been playing.

28:15.400 --> 28:24.240
So lots of Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme still playing a little bit more of Mario Odyssey.

28:24.920 --> 28:28.640
And then, of course, on the front of Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme, I was also playing

28:28.920 --> 28:29.640
Statmania.

28:29.640 --> 28:36.400
I did get my replacement J-packs for my arcade cabinet and for eventually when I convert

28:36.400 --> 28:38.680
the machine into a Statmania machine.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.480
So I have those now for that.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.880
And then what else did I play?

28:45.120 --> 28:50.240
Lots of Pokemon Go because I had a field trip and we went down to like the Sacramento Zoo

28:50.240 --> 28:55.520
area. So that whole William Lamb Park stuff, tons of PokeStops everywhere.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.600
So I did that.

28:56.600 --> 29:01.200
And then also, I guess it's like a I don't know if it's a farm for like some sort of like

29:01.200 --> 29:05.000
weird frog alligator thing.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.680
I don't know what it is, but there was a ton of them around there.

29:07.680 --> 29:12.440
So I got that. And then I played through that event that they had on Saturday.

29:12.440 --> 29:19.960
Got my Charizard upgraded with the new Dragon Power thing.

29:19.960 --> 29:26.080
Sadly, did not get any shinies because the shiny Charizard looks fucking awesome.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.800
Um, and then what else?

29:30.400 --> 29:31.320
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.560
All right. My gaming week.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.960
I'm sorry. One more thing, bitch.

29:34.960 --> 29:39.800
Sorry. No, I wanted to get into this because I tweeted about this on Twitter quite a bit.

29:39.800 --> 29:42.760
My gaming week is like super short this week because I'm still working on my project.

29:42.760 --> 29:47.320
So I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto five because I haven't played Grand Theft Auto five

29:47.320 --> 29:48.480
on PC very much.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.520
And I'm like, you know what?

29:49.520 --> 29:52.800
I keep watching people play Grand Theft Auto five stuff.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.200
I'm just going to go ahead and do that.

29:55.720 --> 30:01.760
So, um, I went ahead and tried to do that and my password didn't work.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.960
And I'm like, well, that's weird.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.360
And I'm like, did I change my password and just forget what it was?

30:05.360 --> 30:06.320
Like, I don't understand.

30:06.440 --> 30:10.600
So I tried resetting it through their service or whatever, and their service is broken.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.960
It doesn't send emails out at all.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.640
So I was like, OK, well, what the fuck?

30:14.640 --> 30:19.200
So I ended up having to log back in or create a new account and relink it to my stuff.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.240
And that worked.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.320
And it was weird because I was able to keep the same name.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.160
But at the same time, I'd already sent a ticket to Rockstar to get that back.

30:26.440 --> 30:32.240
So they finally like reset the password for me after confirming my email address.

30:32.240 --> 30:36.880
And then I went and logged back in and it was tied to some the PC account was tied to

30:36.880 --> 30:37.960
some Russian guy.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.120
And I was like, what the fuck is this?

30:41.120 --> 30:46.840
And so because I never played on PC, at least online, I played on console.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.920
And so I'm like, what the fuck is this shit?

30:50.040 --> 30:54.480
Because someone even using my account to play like Grand Theft Auto online on PC, it's not

30:54.480 --> 30:57.280
like they're stealing anything from me because I never played on PC.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.720
So I don't know what would be the purpose of that other than not having to buy the game.

31:01.880 --> 31:07.440
So I was like, yeah, I was in like some Ukrainian clans or whatever on there and Cruz.

31:07.440 --> 31:11.120
And so I was like, OK, well, I reset the password already.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.920
So that's done. I'm unlinking all this stuff.

31:12.920 --> 31:18.080
I'm deleting this. Now I have a level 14 character that's in Grand Theft Auto that I

31:18.080 --> 31:21.520
don't know who it is, but it's mine now, which I thought was funny.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.400
Jokes on them. Steal my account.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.800
I was steal your shit. Wow.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.720
So somebody got in your account. That's crazy.

31:27.240 --> 31:31.000
I don't even know how, because like it was weird, though, because like I hadn't been

31:31.000 --> 31:33.520
that long since they played because I played once I got those computers and I've had

31:33.520 --> 31:34.800
this computer for almost a year.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.640
So I don't know.

31:37.640 --> 31:42.400
I was weird, but man, I mean, it's not like they were going to steal anything from me

31:42.400 --> 31:43.920
because I had nothing on that account.

31:43.920 --> 31:48.960
So I don't know what the purpose was, but they're going to be upset that their

31:48.960 --> 31:53.040
character's gone. They're only level 14 anyways, so whatever.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.720
All right. So that was just my little adventure.

31:55.720 --> 31:59.040
And then like after trying getting that all resolved and trying to play it, it's like,

31:59.040 --> 32:01.480
oh, I got downloaded like 10 gigs of updates.

32:01.480 --> 32:06.040
And so that's the worst when the game like you want to sit down and play a game and

32:06.040 --> 32:09.560
it's like, oh, I've got to download like 10 gigs of updates before I even tried to

32:09.560 --> 32:12.160
reset my password. It downloaded updates and installed them.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.320
So I'm like, OK, so we're done updating now.

32:14.480 --> 32:18.240
So I go back in there after I logged in, it's like, oh, hey, we got another like five

32:18.240 --> 32:20.360
gigs of updates now. Fuck.

32:20.920 --> 32:24.240
So I didn't end up getting the playground the thought of five this week, but I will

32:24.240 --> 32:27.640
this week. On somebody else's account.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.080
All right. Have fun with that.

32:30.760 --> 32:35.200
All right. Finally, my new week, I also did the Pokemon event on Saturday, as many of

32:35.200 --> 32:39.720
you are talking about in chat, and I hope this doesn't sound like bragging or anything

32:39.720 --> 32:43.200
because I know some people have mixed luck on that event and that sucks.

32:43.200 --> 32:47.400
But I did get five shiny Charmanders, which you asshole.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.440
And I got five. Well, I mean, we we went to the capital when everybody was like, don't

32:51.440 --> 32:54.800
go to the capital. It's gonna be fucking nuts down there because we had this big bike

32:54.800 --> 32:57.040
race called Amgem that was happening downtown.

32:57.240 --> 33:02.040
And then there was graduations going on both at the Golden One Center and at the

33:02.040 --> 33:06.240
Memorial Auditorium, which I realize means the two big places to have graduations here.

33:06.760 --> 33:09.400
And then there was something else. It was like everything that could be happening in

33:09.400 --> 33:11.960
Sacramento was going on this weekend. So they're like, don't go downtown.

33:11.960 --> 33:16.040
But I was like, I have guaranteed parking at Alan's work, you know, not to tell all his

33:16.040 --> 33:20.720
business, but he works a reasonable distance from the capital so I can park at his work.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.040
No problem. And walk.

33:22.040 --> 33:26.040
And that's what we did. And, you know, the capital had a few Pokemon players, but it was

33:26.040 --> 33:30.600
like probably a quarter of what we usually see at the community days because I think the

33:30.600 --> 33:31.560
news scared everybody off.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.280
But there was still a lot of Charmanders to be found.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.720
And we just kept catching over and over and over again.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.760
And I would say we were getting probably one about every 30 minutes.

33:39.960 --> 33:43.880
So finally, when we got the third, I say we, it was me and my buddy John, who I used to

33:43.880 --> 33:45.000
live with a long time ago.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.720
He's like, he was not like a big gamer back in the day.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.360
I don't remember if he was ever on this show, but I lived with him for a while.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.520
This is a long time ago, guys.

33:52.760 --> 33:56.560
This was when, for those of you that have been with OLR a long time, this was when we

33:56.560 --> 34:01.680
were simulcasting the show on Justin TV, which, yes, I know a lot of you would like us

34:01.680 --> 34:03.760
to go back to and we're talking about it.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.400
That's all I can say with Twitch now, obviously.

34:06.640 --> 34:11.280
But when we had Justin TV, the simulcast there, remember that that garage studio that

34:11.280 --> 34:14.720
had the lights and everything, that was me and John's house.

34:14.880 --> 34:18.920
OK, so John was not like a huge gamer, although he was really rad because he always

34:18.920 --> 34:21.600
supported this show and the fact that we kind of took over the house every Sunday night.

34:21.920 --> 34:26.760
So but he he's he's like more into Pokemon Go than I am.

34:27.160 --> 34:30.280
Like we have a competition about who can get more gyms, gym badges.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.480
I think 569 gym badges.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.640
This bitch has like 630 gym badges.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.880
It's like he's visited that many unique gyms around the area.

34:37.880 --> 34:42.200
It's pretty crazy. Anyway, so but John's great.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.160
He wouldn't hear this anyway.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.160
But so him and I went out.

34:46.160 --> 34:50.360
We were technically Shane, who you all know him, I'm sure from Ranger Pride and all that.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.400
He was there, too.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.600
But Shane gets and I'm sure you all know this.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.640
He gets in the zone when it comes to shiny hunting.

34:56.880 --> 35:01.440
So if we're not moving fast enough for him, he goes off and does his own thing.

35:01.440 --> 35:05.480
So within like 20, not even 20 minutes, 15 minutes, that's what happened.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.840
John and I were lagging too far behind and he went off to go catch more jar manners.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.800
So we weren't able to catch up with it until the end of the day.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.800
So anyway, John and I were kind of both like catching about one every 30 minutes.

35:14.960 --> 35:20.440
So finally, about the time we got to 90 minutes in and we had three, we were like, OK, well,

35:20.440 --> 35:23.160
like three, that's kind of the goal.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.600
Like if you get one, you're content.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.160
If you get three, you're great because you can have one for each evolution.

35:29.160 --> 35:33.720
Right. And even one of the shinies I caught appraised as a wonder or highest appraisal.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.840
So it's my first shiny wonder.

35:35.840 --> 35:39.680
And it was it was probably like level twenty nine or something also.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.560
So like I think I caught a good Charmander.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.920
We're good. So I got my little black dragon Charmander.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.080
I'm good. So we kind of took it easy at that point.

35:47.160 --> 35:51.720
You know, we went over to Starbucks, just would catch whatever shows up on the Starbucks,

35:51.920 --> 35:53.400
got a drink, took it easy.

35:53.400 --> 35:56.320
Then we walked back and caught a couple more shinies on the way back.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.280
So we had a nice kind of like easy day.

35:58.480 --> 36:02.680
So I hope you guys had a good Charmander experience, those of you that went out and did

36:02.680 --> 36:06.760
it. If you didn't catch a shiny, I can sympathize again.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.360
I'm not trying to rub it in. You know what I think they should do.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.720
Here's what I think they should do.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.520
And those of you that may be a little more frustrated at community day, maybe you'd

36:13.520 --> 36:17.720
agree with me on this. They have that questing system in Pokemon Go.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.840
Why don't they just make it during community day?

36:20.040 --> 36:24.880
Like if you catch fifty Charmanders or you complete twelve quests, which are all I

36:24.880 --> 36:26.240
catch three Charmanders or whatever.

36:26.440 --> 36:30.120
If you if you do the questing, you get a guaranteed shiny spawn.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.320
Wouldn't that be nice?

36:31.360 --> 36:34.520
And then, you know, you could at least get one if you put a little effort into it.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.840
Yeah, it's kind of like the theory from MMOs.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.000
I see Warcraft, I see Final Fantasy 14 doing this.

36:39.200 --> 36:44.480
If you do the boss enough times, the boss drops an item or the boss drops points.

36:44.680 --> 36:48.720
So you can at least get some sort of reward, even if the thing you want is noise

36:48.720 --> 36:52.360
dropping. That I think would be a nice I'd be very happy with that.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.360
Even to somebody who did very well this community day, I'd be very happy with a

36:55.360 --> 36:59.480
system like that. So anyway, we'll see.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.520
I'm finally just now looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.840
S2100 Matt says, I got three shinies.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.320
I got nothing until the last hour and then I got all three.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.000
I was sweating and not happy about it during it.

37:10.200 --> 37:14.520
It doesn't help that it was pouring in NYC and the map was messed up with a lot of

37:14.520 --> 37:15.720
weather boosted Pokemon.

37:15.920 --> 37:20.440
Well, I mean, it probably worsened my allergies and here I am today.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.680
So there you go. All right.

37:21.680 --> 37:25.280
So besides Pokemon Go, which I talked about plenty enough, I played Blaster Master

37:25.280 --> 37:28.320
Zero this week because I was just looking through stuff on Switch.

37:28.520 --> 37:32.440
I almost got Hyrule Warriors, but I was like, I haven't had a lot of time.

37:32.440 --> 37:36.440
Yeah, I thought about I saw that the sort of like, am I really going to do I want to

37:36.440 --> 37:37.680
drop 60 bucks on this?

37:37.680 --> 37:41.560
I mean, well, I if I can, which I know Nintendo games never go on sale, but if

37:41.560 --> 37:44.800
maybe like Amazon Prime still has the deal, maybe I'll get it through that or

37:44.800 --> 37:51.320
something to excuse me, guys, maybe I'll get it there at some point.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.080
But yeah, 60 bucks.

37:53.080 --> 37:54.240
Yeah, it's always like 60 dollars.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.520
Take a risk. Will I really play this game or not?

37:57.280 --> 37:59.040
But I think I will probably end up getting it.

37:59.040 --> 37:59.880
But I was like, what do I want to play?

37:59.880 --> 38:03.720
And I was like, you know, I love this Blaster Master Zero game and there's all

38:03.720 --> 38:05.200
these DLC characters I've barely touched.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.600
So I went in and played that for a little while.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.680
That was my good little like decompression game earlier this week.

38:09.720 --> 38:14.080
So anyway, hopefully I'll get to play more games this week.

38:14.080 --> 38:18.720
I still need to go binge spend money on Pinball Arcade because like you guys

38:18.720 --> 38:21.760
that news last week, I'm sad that all those tables are going away.

38:21.760 --> 38:26.200
But I think, Loki, I think I'm going to double dip on PC if for nothing else.

38:26.200 --> 38:29.640
The fact that I can stream some of them and just kind of have them in my steam

38:29.640 --> 38:33.240
library because like PC, that's always going to be there, right?

38:33.440 --> 38:35.720
Yeah. PlayStation three, PlayStation four.

38:36.120 --> 38:39.720
You know, if PlayStation five, I can't believe I just brought up PlayStation

38:39.720 --> 38:41.000
five on this podcast, but here we are.

38:41.200 --> 38:44.800
If PlayStation five isn't backwards compatible again, I wouldn't.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.480
I wouldn't guarantee anything.

38:46.520 --> 38:47.960
I don't think it's ever going to.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.400
I'm not going to guarantee it either.

38:49.400 --> 38:52.480
And like honestly, like when it comes down to the next gen systems, whatever

38:52.480 --> 38:55.920
that's going to be, I'm probably going to go Xbox this time again, because

38:56.120 --> 38:59.440
honestly, it's like I like the first party games.

38:59.440 --> 39:03.600
But when it comes to some of these other games that I tend to play more, which are

39:03.600 --> 39:07.040
like, you know, Skyrim and stuff like that, you know, the Bethesda games, look

39:07.040 --> 39:08.960
who's supporting modding a lot better.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.720
Yeah. I mean, like they have like these whole beyond Skyrim things, you know,

39:12.720 --> 39:14.640
that giant mod that they're talking about and stuff.

39:14.800 --> 39:18.440
They have the first part of that available on the Xbox.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.560
You can you can download that mod on the Xbox.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.200
Can't do that shit on PlayStation four.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.720
So, yeah, I mean, I think take the stance

39:27.920 --> 39:31.680
of someone that actually seems to be listening to their user base.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.120
JD in our chat at live.vognetwork.com

39:34.320 --> 39:36.400
points out Nintendo games do go on sale.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.280
The eShop has an on sale section, for instance.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.280
I should have. Well, I should have clarified.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.280
I meant like first party Nintendo games rarely go on sale.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.600
I am aware that the indie stuff, they are pretty good.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.600
And that's a good way to like feature the indie stuff to just like on Steam.

39:50.800 --> 39:55.000
Now, and to be fair, I know that sometimes you have like the gold coins

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
you can trade in for deals.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.160
I'm not talking about one cent per coin, but like you can buy

39:58.160 --> 39:59.480
like a 40 percent off coupon.

39:59.480 --> 40:00.720
They do those types of things.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.400
Maybe Black Friday, they'll have a sale.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.400
But Nintendo first party sales are pretty rare.

40:06.880 --> 40:07.600
Well, I don't.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.640
Maybe the Wii U was a little more generous because the Wii U was struggling

40:10.640 --> 40:14.160
a little bit, but I think like, no, even the Wii U wasn't very.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.640
Yeah, you know. Yeah.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.320
So, you know,

40:17.480 --> 40:19.440
anyway, just like I think,

40:19.440 --> 40:22.600
JD, nothing that's going to be on sale, like in the next couple months,

40:22.600 --> 40:25.040
like Black Friday would probably be the first time a game like that.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.160
Weird stance to take, though, like I get it.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.600
And I guess, you know, with the switch, it's still early in its lifespan.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.680
But I mean, they did the whole Nintendo select stuff with the Wii U.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.040
So maybe they'll do that with the switch.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.320
So they'll re-release them for 20 bucks or something like that.

40:37.760 --> 40:42.400
But I mean, even first party companies on all the other platforms,

40:42.400 --> 40:43.720
you know, they discount their stuff.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.880
I just don't understand

40:45.880 --> 40:48.520
why they're so stingy with their titles.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.360
Like, I get it. They're, you know, these games are masterpieces.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.720
Yeah, no one is arguing that.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.800
But they're arguing that, you know, hey,

40:55.800 --> 40:58.880
maybe charging $60 for a game that came out four years ago.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.560
Not a great idea. You know, I don't know.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.400
To register participation for this week's

41:06.400 --> 41:10.640
episode of Orange Island Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase cover.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.640
All right. Well, let's you know what?

41:13.640 --> 41:14.920
We're talking about game sales.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.000
What a great transition into our first topic tonight.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.240
Let's get this gaming news.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.240
I'll just quickly do some housekeeping.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.080
No shows off plan in the immediate future.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.320
We will be out the weekend of June 24th.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.920
I think the day is as I'm going to be out of town on a trip.

41:26.920 --> 41:30.720
But you can look forward to our 16th anniversary special the week before that.

41:30.720 --> 41:33.120
I say there's not going to be anything special about the show.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.160
Maybe we'll try to get a guest or two.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.160
But that will be on June 17th.

41:37.160 --> 41:42.400
We'll be celebrating 16 years doing this old enough to drive this show is.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.720
But, you know, it's one of those things where I'm like, I'm actually like

41:45.720 --> 41:49.840
not to get too sappy, but I'm I'm really proud that we've had the drive to just

41:49.840 --> 41:54.200
fucking stick with it this long, like 16 years is a long time to do anything.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.840
It's amazing. It's pretty amazing.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.960
Anyway, that's the one little toot our own horn.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.200
I will do we'll do more of that in June.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.800
But yeah, so and of course, follow us on Twitter.

42:03.800 --> 42:06.760
Twitter dot com slash all our and Facebook, Facebook dot com slash Orange

42:06.760 --> 42:09.640
Lounge Radio. OK, now we can do gaming news about sales.

42:09.640 --> 42:12.480
Yes, Logie. So this is actually unfortunate.

42:12.480 --> 42:17.080
But Best Buy, they've canceled their Gamers Club and they haven't even really made a big

42:17.080 --> 42:22.520
announcement. But apparently Gamers Club unlocked was that service that you could get

42:22.520 --> 42:25.160
20 percent discounts on new games.

42:25.160 --> 42:30.320
You pay like a one time fee each year and you get those wonderful discounts.

42:30.320 --> 42:36.400
Well, there was apparently rumors that the service had been canceled.

42:36.400 --> 42:41.920
And it's been confirmed now, speaking with some Best Buy employees, that there was an

42:41.920 --> 42:45.640
internal memo saying that the service ended on May 17th.

42:45.640 --> 42:52.720
They haven't given a reason why it was ended, but apparently, you know, they're going to

42:52.720 --> 42:56.040
honor the subscriptions for as long as they have left.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.280
But you're not going to be able to renew that subscription going forward.

42:59.280 --> 43:06.000
So that's unfortunate because I know a lot of people use that for preordering games, but

43:06.000 --> 43:07.600
maybe it just wasn't profitable for them.

43:07.600 --> 43:11.600
Yeah. And I know some people that swear by that as opposed to Amazon Prime.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.760
So that's a little bit shocking because that Gamers Club is also giving you discounts on

43:14.760 --> 43:17.680
Amiibo and that stuff, which the Prime thing doesn't do.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.000
So this is a little bit.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.760
Well, I mean, it is and it isn't shocking, you know, because they probably were losing a

43:23.760 --> 43:26.480
bit of money on it and retail's kind of hurting as it is.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.440
So maybe this is something they had to do.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.240
Maybe they're going to think about a way to try to discount games from the top for

43:32.240 --> 43:36.600
everybody, as opposed to just having to sign into this program to make it a little more

43:36.600 --> 43:41.360
appealing that like, hey, we do cheaper games even if you don't have our subscription.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.600
I obviously you probably go, Rob, that makes mathematically no sense.

43:44.600 --> 43:48.480
Obviously, I'm talking about not as deep of a discount, but maybe, you know, a couple

43:48.480 --> 43:52.160
bucks. Well, not that they promote GameStop or anything, but I know they have their

43:52.760 --> 43:55.160
because I was looking at it this week, their used game.

43:55.160 --> 43:59.000
I think they have this now elite thing you can buy, which is slightly more expensive than

43:59.000 --> 44:01.040
just the fifteen dollars a year.

44:01.040 --> 44:05.840
And you get 20 percent off their used games versus just the 10 percent off that you

44:05.840 --> 44:07.960
normally get, which isn't a great deal.

44:07.960 --> 44:11.880
But I mean, you could if you were looking to purchase, you know, quite a few games like

44:11.880 --> 44:16.400
I was thinking to purchase, you know, quite different games or quite a few games on the

44:16.400 --> 44:17.440
switch and other platforms.

44:17.440 --> 44:21.440
I was like, well, you know, I could probably make up that difference, that cost to pay

44:21.440 --> 44:24.840
for that with the savings I would get from purchasing those games.

44:24.840 --> 44:29.440
So I was like, it might be worth it in that sense, but I don't know, maybe not something

44:29.440 --> 44:30.880
I'd pay for every year.

44:31.120 --> 44:34.800
So some of the comments from our chat, some surprise actually at this news, fifth dream

44:34.800 --> 44:36.080
says, whoa, shit, they canceled it.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.440
So many people are going to be pissed.

44:37.880 --> 44:40.080
Tiger class says maybe because nobody took advantage of it.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.640
Nobody ever talks about this gamers club.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.040
I know people that used it.

44:43.040 --> 44:47.600
I mean, I think more people are using the Amazon Prime thing, but that's not to say I

44:47.600 --> 44:51.960
don't certainly know people using the Best Buy thing because somebody else points out in

44:51.960 --> 44:55.040
chat, you could double dip on it and get the points and so forth.

44:55.040 --> 44:58.120
And JD said that you can double dip and get points and the discount.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.840
And that's what kind of sells it for some people.

44:59.840 --> 45:03.720
So, yeah, you kind of have to wonder, like, was it really profitable for Best Buy or was

45:03.720 --> 45:04.840
it, you know, they're taking a step back.

45:05.800 --> 45:09.800
Fifth dream with another perspective here says game companies have been fighting back

45:09.800 --> 45:14.760
to Sony and others have been stopping Amazon from offering presales on their games because

45:14.760 --> 45:16.280
of that discount, I'm sure.

45:16.640 --> 45:17.840
Very, very interesting.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.600
And Brad from Pod Culture says, I used it a lot.

45:20.880 --> 45:23.320
Lego Dimensions alone saved me the cost.

45:23.320 --> 45:26.320
Yeah. If you buy a lot of those add ons and so forth, for sure.

45:26.360 --> 45:31.080
For sure. So many times I've been so tempted to buy Lego Dimensions every time like I'll

45:31.080 --> 45:33.360
see it. It could be dirt cheap, like 20 bucks.

45:33.360 --> 45:36.840
And I'm like, I know if I buy that, I'm not going to play that game.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.440
Yeah, I know I'm going to buy that.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.080
I'm like, ooh, I'm not going to play the game.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.600
I'm like, there's no way I'm buying this game.

45:44.160 --> 45:45.200
It's a fun game, though.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.640
That being said, though, I have so many of the characters.

45:47.640 --> 45:50.800
I really appreciate that they didn't put out a new version every year.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.680
Seriously, though, if you are into Lego Dimensions and want to pick up some of those

45:54.680 --> 45:59.840
things before they go away, Dollar Store has them for two dollars a pack and they're

45:59.840 --> 46:04.160
still selling them and like best like GameStop and Target and Walmart for 20 bucks a

46:04.160 --> 46:05.960
piece for those little things.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.440
Two dollars. I have a desk drawer full of them.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.320
All right. Let's move on to another story.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.480
This is another big story from this week talking about the game No Man's Sky.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.120
Yeah, it's been two years, believe it or not, since that game launched.

46:17.360 --> 46:20.920
But No Man's Sky is going to be getting a new multiplayer mode.

46:20.920 --> 46:25.800
And Hello Games has confirmed that this is happening as part of the Inside Xbox YouTube

46:25.800 --> 46:28.360
show, which we already knew No Man's Sky was coming out for Xbox.

46:28.360 --> 46:31.520
Like, yeah, exclusive window for PlayStation is probably run out.

46:31.720 --> 46:34.880
So the game is going to be coming out on Xbox now on July 24th.

46:35.400 --> 46:39.920
So the director, Sean Murray, said that alongside this Xbox launch, the game is going

46:39.920 --> 46:43.400
to start allowing people to work and fight alongside one another.

46:43.560 --> 46:47.760
So I'm not sure if Jason got that right in the intro or what he was alluding to, but it

46:47.760 --> 46:52.440
sounds like this multiplayer update is coming out the same day as the Xbox version.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.040
It's in July, July.

46:55.040 --> 47:00.400
So even though there was a multiplayer update last year, it was with the little glowing dots.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.600
It's not fable multiplayer.

47:02.600 --> 47:03.920
Yeah, no, it's not really what it is.

47:04.120 --> 47:08.440
So in the press release, you can do the infinite universe with your friends or bump into random travelers.

47:08.680 --> 47:12.880
As you voyage together, friends will help you stay alive or possibly prey on others.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.480
Oh, God, trolls can't wait.

47:15.160 --> 47:20.360
Build bases from tiny shelters to complex colonies that you create as a team and can be seen by the community.

47:20.480 --> 47:23.040
The shelter colony thing was kind of already in the game, to be fair.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.120
I got a call again. Sorry.

47:26.640 --> 47:35.120
Be a pirate or wingman in epic space battles with friends and foes and race exocraft across weird alien terrains and create tracks to share online.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.800
That that bullet right there.

47:37.920 --> 47:43.120
That's the one that made me perk up because I'm like, is this the closest to F-Zero we're going to get?

47:43.280 --> 47:47.000
Because that I like that we're going to get vehicles aren't that fast.

47:47.280 --> 47:48.760
They're like little dune buggy thing.

47:48.760 --> 47:50.680
Not yet, but maybe like the Mako.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.080
You have to mine more.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.120
That's all it has to be.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.280
But that that part sounds really exciting.

47:55.280 --> 47:55.960
So that's pretty cool.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.160
So, yeah.

47:57.160 --> 48:05.040
So what do you think about No Man's Sky still kind of working on the game for keeping, you know, for keep working on it?

48:05.040 --> 48:07.240
I mean, seriously, they got their money.

48:07.400 --> 48:13.240
Yeah, especially in the face of all the negativity out there about the game, like they have really stuck with it.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.760
And I really can't help but give them props either.

48:15.760 --> 48:16.480
I think it's great.

48:17.640 --> 48:19.720
So, I mean, congrats to them for sticking with it.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.160
And maybe maybe it'll work out in their favor.

48:22.160 --> 48:28.840
I mean, I don't know how many people are going to want to visit this game again on Xbox, but I'll go back to it on PlayStation after all the updates are done.

48:28.840 --> 48:37.120
Yeah, there's a there's a loyal crowd on Microsoft's end that I'm sure we'll be curious to check this out, that maybe they feel like they're getting the better version.

48:37.120 --> 48:40.080
I don't know, although PlayStation is getting the same update, so is PC.

48:40.360 --> 48:42.000
But, you know, kind of neat, kind of neat.

48:42.600 --> 48:45.840
Dungeon Buster in chat says, I hope the multiplayer works out for No Man's Sky.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.720
The base building stuff is pretty crazy.

48:47.920 --> 48:51.960
And Dungeon Buster continues, kudos to the team for adding more content this way.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.160
And it really should be noted.

48:53.160 --> 48:57.920
I mean, in case you weren't aware, they've been slowly adding to the game this whole time.

48:58.160 --> 49:05.560
I mean, it's not like every couple of weeks, but they've been putting out these big updates on a fairly regular basis, you know, across these two years.

49:05.800 --> 49:06.760
So kudos to them.

49:06.760 --> 49:09.240
I want to check this out, too, when it comes out.

49:09.600 --> 49:11.800
So I'll probably reroll again.

49:11.800 --> 49:18.360
I guess maybe PC for me, even though I do have the PlayStation 4 version, if I do PC, my streaming set up is better there.

49:18.360 --> 49:21.920
So that's why I tend to get on PC to see what the sales look like.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.080
We'll see. All right, let's move on.

49:24.080 --> 49:26.080
Loki, more big announcements for this week, right?

49:26.120 --> 49:31.400
Yes. So less is less of announcements, more of confirming rumors.

49:31.400 --> 49:41.320
But they did a whole Black Ops 4 presentation that was streamed online talking about the big changes coming to Black Ops.

49:41.880 --> 49:45.680
So Call of Duty this year is not going to have a single player campaign.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.440
Instead, it's going to be multiplayer only.

49:49.160 --> 49:53.440
With that, you're getting three zombie modes or maps or whatever that are going to be in there.

49:53.720 --> 50:02.080
And then they're also going to have this brand new mode that's basically their big battle royale mode.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.600
So that's going to be available as well.

50:04.960 --> 50:20.640
Interesting, though, I know with rumors of this and other, I guess, inside sources had said that they were working on a single player campaign for the game, but apparently due to time constraints, they weren't able to finish it.

50:21.120 --> 50:24.040
And so that was scrapped from the game because of that.

50:25.600 --> 50:33.280
But, you know, some of the other selling points of the game, they're saying this time it's more class based multiplayer.

50:33.360 --> 50:36.240
So they have different classes you can play on that can do different things.

50:36.840 --> 50:41.920
A lot of the wall running and stuff that were in some of the other games are gone.

50:41.920 --> 50:48.880
They say now it's boots on the ground and the zombie modes look kind of interesting.

50:48.880 --> 50:57.640
They had one that was, you know, kind of this gladiatory type thing, which is melee weapons.

50:58.040 --> 51:02.840
Then they had a couple other ones that were, I don't know, just look like your classic zombie fare.

51:03.360 --> 51:09.240
But for me, I'm really disappointed with it because I did play the campaign.

51:09.240 --> 51:17.840
And they would like to say, and I've heard this and a lot of fans of Call of Duty will say this, that no one plays Call of Duty single player.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.560
No one plays the single player campaign.

51:19.560 --> 51:22.000
Everyone's in Call of Duty for the multiplayer.

51:22.960 --> 51:32.240
And that's just wrong, actually, because I've watched other videos talking about this in one of them, which is by a YouTuber that I tend to watch,

51:32.400 --> 51:42.800
Yang Ye, which talked about if you look at these sites like Steam and I want to say there's a PlayStation Trophy site that had the same type of information.

51:42.920 --> 51:51.360
And you look at the trophies that people have in Call of Duty as far as these games, there's about half of the people that play Call of Duty that finished the campaign.

51:52.000 --> 51:58.120
And then only about half as well that have actually prestige, you know, once they've gotten that trophy, the prestige.

51:58.120 --> 52:03.160
So to say that no one plays single player is not really true.

52:03.160 --> 52:05.160
And here's what it comes down to, honestly.

52:05.160 --> 52:11.560
And I know that the fan base wants to, you know, say, oh, well, too bad you don't like it and you're just scrub or whatever.

52:11.960 --> 52:18.000
It comes down to the point that Activision and they've been it's been a numbers game with Activision.

52:18.000 --> 52:27.680
Like look at what they did to Call of Duty Tomorrow Warfare Remastered, where they basically interject, you know, they sold the DLC maps for the game.

52:27.760 --> 52:32.840
Separately, they gated the game behind Infinite Warfare.

52:32.840 --> 52:38.400
You have to buy Infinite Warfare to get the game because no one really wanted to purchase Infinite Warfare.

52:39.400 --> 52:43.400
And then they, you know, stuck in loot boxes into the game.

52:43.400 --> 52:44.920
It's a numbers game for them.

52:45.400 --> 52:53.560
So do they spend money to develop a campaign that might get some people, you know, get a lot of people excited about it and bring it in there?

52:54.440 --> 53:01.920
Or do they save the money in developing the campaign and sure, they're going to lose, you know, quite a bit of sales from it.

53:01.920 --> 53:08.680
But in the end, they make up more money by putting in this battle royale mode and they're able to monetize that more.

53:08.840 --> 53:17.680
And so they're going to make up more money with monetization and loot boxes, because honestly, if you listen to any of their financial numbers, that's where all the fucking money is anyway.

53:18.040 --> 53:21.960
And so that's why they're not seeing people as their customers anymore.

53:21.960 --> 53:28.560
They're seeing them as the numbers and they're playing the numbers to make themselves the most money because they don't want just some of the money.

53:28.560 --> 53:29.560
They want all of the money.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.160
And that's why we're getting this shit.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.760
And unfortunately, I can't support it.

53:34.760 --> 53:44.040
And I haven't been purchasing Call of Duty the last few years anyways, just because I've looked at the single player campaigns and they had some of them haven't been very good.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.080
I did like Black Ops.

53:45.080 --> 53:46.600
That was one of my most favorite customer.

53:46.600 --> 53:53.440
Realize that in the modern warfare stuff, just this infinite warfare was just a little too much like advanced warfare, which was the last one I had picked up.

53:53.440 --> 54:02.760
But, yeah, Loki, a very, very how, how worrying, but very realistic take on what may be going on in the games industry for some companies.

54:02.760 --> 54:05.560
I mean, indie development is certainly still all about the players.

54:05.560 --> 54:06.200
Absolutely.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.600
But very interesting kind of perspective.

54:08.600 --> 54:15.800
You know, I know not everybody always agrees with what you say, but I think you worded that very well where, you know, it seems like some companies, you know, players are numbers.

54:15.880 --> 54:24.680
Activision and EA are big proponents of they think they can get away with, which is weird because I never really feel that for the Blizzard side of Activision.

54:24.680 --> 54:34.280
But then as Activision slowly gets their little tentacles on things, they kind of like, like the whole fact that this is in the Battle.net launcher is kind of one of those like, oh, God, you know.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.080
Well, yeah, and I get it.

54:36.080 --> 54:38.000
And no, I mean, it's smart.

54:38.000 --> 54:44.800
It's smart, but it's like and I get it like, you know, Overwatch is extremely successful with their loot boxes.

54:44.800 --> 54:45.160
Yep.

54:45.160 --> 54:49.440
But to to me, that says it's just it is just cosmetic stuff.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.560
And it's always that's what it's been.

54:51.560 --> 54:52.960
That's what's always going to be.

54:52.960 --> 54:57.960
And I'm fine with that because I don't feel the compulsion, the need to get that stuff.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.640
But some some people might.

55:00.040 --> 55:01.680
But it's Overwatch.

55:01.680 --> 55:02.400
Sorry to cut you off.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.920
But Overwatch is also a very special kind of game.

55:05.920 --> 55:08.040
It is not your typical first person shooter.

55:08.200 --> 55:18.680
You know, and I've said this for years on OLR, Blizzard has this way of Disney-fying popular genres or popular games and making them extremely accessible.

55:18.680 --> 55:37.360
And that is exactly what they did with Overwatch is they took the Team Fortress 2 most obviously slash first person formula, Disney-fied the characters, gave them rich backgrounds and made this game that even people who's bread and butter is World of Warcraft wanted to play because the characters were so strong, you know, that people wanted to get into this universe.

55:37.360 --> 55:46.680
I'm telling you, Loki, when we look back in 50 years on like what were the biggest video games of this decade, Overwatch is going to be towards the top of the list.

55:46.680 --> 55:47.280
Exactly.

55:47.280 --> 55:47.840
No question.

55:47.840 --> 55:48.400
Exactly.

55:48.400 --> 55:53.920
And here's the problem, though, is like when you have these people that they take this out, it's a total EA.

55:53.920 --> 55:56.760
Well, I don't even think it's an EA move because it's an Activision move.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.360
Activision has been doing this forever.

55:59.240 --> 56:10.240
It's an Activision move where they basically say we're removing something that you're paying your $60 for and you're not really we're adding this battle royale and we're innovating.

56:10.240 --> 56:18.120
We're innovating because we removed the single player camping because they would say that's like that's like Apple talking about courage when they got rid of the headphones.

56:19.320 --> 56:19.920
Yeah, exactly.

56:19.920 --> 56:24.360
They want to they say they want to tell a story in a different way through the multiplayer modes.

56:25.360 --> 56:28.800
Bullshit, I'm calling on that because Titanfall did that same shit.

56:28.800 --> 56:32.760
We we all know it's marketing speak and like we all know it's crap.

56:32.760 --> 56:36.000
Like, I hate to say it, Loki, but you are stating the obvious in that way.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.960
Like we know like the fact that Activision is saying, oh, we had the the courage or this is the artistic vision.

56:41.960 --> 56:48.560
Now it's a line of smoke to blow up our ass to explain why, you know, you just wanted all the resources and multiplayer because that's the bread and butter.

56:48.560 --> 56:50.000
That's the money. That's loot boxes.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.040
You don't make money off single player.

56:51.280 --> 56:59.760
The ironic part, though, is before all like first off, the lack of like a single player campaign, that was kind of just a quick mention at the end of the presentation.

57:00.040 --> 57:04.280
And before in the beginning of the presentation, they're talking about like the rich storytelling of Call of Duty.

57:04.280 --> 57:09.840
And they were showing clips from the single player campaigns that are not going to be in this game.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.800
It's like, what?

57:12.640 --> 57:15.040
I don't know. It's just I hope it's good.

57:15.440 --> 57:16.960
My expectations are not high.

57:17.360 --> 57:24.800
Let me ask this question about the battle royale stuff, because that's what our chat is really screaming about in over at live.vognetware.com.

57:25.280 --> 57:32.640
S200Matt says, I hope this royale game movement helps innovate the genre with the additional competition and doesn't just dilute and jump the shark with it.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.160
What do you think about the whole battle royale edition?

57:35.160 --> 57:37.120
I mean, it's not surprising, that's for sure.

57:37.440 --> 57:46.640
But it just to me, it looks like the big like battlefield type games where it's a bigger map, you've got vehicles and that's it.

57:46.840 --> 57:50.400
But, you know, it's not that innovative because battlefield's been doing it forever.

57:50.400 --> 57:53.400
Yeah, I don't I don't hate them for jumping in on that genre.

57:53.400 --> 57:55.800
I mean, it's kind of the thing that people are doing right now.

57:56.000 --> 58:03.480
When Minecraft first came out, every game, like a lot of game friendships, like here's a build your own type of thing or how do we expand on that?

58:03.480 --> 58:06.280
Right. We get all these kind of like Minecraft, cloney things or clone boats.

58:06.280 --> 58:09.760
They're doing that kind of like this like Fortnite stuff where, oh, I'm building barricades and stuff.

58:09.760 --> 58:11.360
And it's like, yeah, I don't know.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.480
Whatever, whatever.

58:12.480 --> 58:13.600
See how it plays out.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.800
They haven't said how many players it supports.

58:16.040 --> 58:20.280
So we don't know how many players online you can do in this battle royale type game.

58:21.640 --> 58:22.520
Let's hope it's good.

58:22.720 --> 58:25.640
Yeah, that's I don't buy into the hype.

58:25.640 --> 58:28.000
Just see if it's good.

58:28.400 --> 58:34.880
All right. Well, another big show event that happened this week, maybe if you aren't in like I find there's kind of like two types of gamers.

58:34.880 --> 58:36.120
There's like the Call of Duty gamers.

58:36.120 --> 58:40.840
And if you're not really into that, maybe this is your team or maybe you like both and that's cool, too.

58:40.960 --> 58:42.080
Or maybe you like neither.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.800
And then I'd wonder what do you what do you play?

58:44.920 --> 58:47.960
But anyway, the other game I want to talk about is Kingdom Hearts three.

58:47.960 --> 58:50.240
That's right. The premium showcase event happened this week.

58:50.240 --> 58:53.760
I didn't I didn't know that because we are invite clearly got lost in the mail.

58:54.680 --> 59:01.080
But anyway, so apparently the members of the press were allowed to talk about the game on May 18th.

59:01.080 --> 59:07.720
So some of the information started coming out and there were two modes in this demo at the event called Olympus and Toy Box.

59:07.920 --> 59:10.080
So they got to actually play a little piece of the game.

59:10.280 --> 59:13.600
You probably saw some Wreck-It Ralph stuff coming out of it.

59:13.800 --> 59:19.200
I don't know if there was a Wreck-It Ralph mode or if Wreck-It Ralph was a summon because it kind of looked like it was more like a summon to me.

59:19.920 --> 59:21.040
And that's what people are saying.

59:21.040 --> 59:24.040
But that's still really cool that there's at least a reference in the game.

59:24.320 --> 59:31.480
But I mean, with all of this kind of showing up right now, doesn't it really seem like it's happening?

59:31.480 --> 59:34.160
Like Kingdom Hearts is going to finally fucking be this year.

59:34.480 --> 59:38.680
Like it really I mean, they said we're going to announce the release date next month.

59:38.680 --> 59:40.440
Well, no, it's going to be E3. No shit.

59:40.440 --> 59:42.120
E3 is next month. I think it's this year.

59:42.480 --> 59:43.240
I hope so.

59:43.240 --> 59:49.680
I mean, if they come out and say April 20 or what would it be, March, when's the fiscal year end?

59:49.680 --> 59:50.200
April, right?

59:50.200 --> 59:50.920
Maybe March.

59:50.920 --> 59:55.680
So if they came out and said March 2019, that wouldn't be the biggest surprise in the world.

59:55.880 --> 01:00:05.640
But at least I think we kind of know that, like, OK, this fiscal year is when it's happening, if not the holiday, which would be a great time, a great time because kids and everything that are going to be like Disney, Disney.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:10.920
But I mean, who's I mean, even though I say that the kids that are like Disney, Disney.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.680
How long ago was Kingdom Hearts two at this point, like ten years ago?

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:23.080
The being that they invited the press out, those kids are adults with their own kids, being that we're at this point in the, you know, press media cycle.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.240
Yeah, my guess is probably around September.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.640
Yeah, I I kind of think that's the case.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.120
I think we're going to hear at E3 that this is really happening.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.920
And so that would mean that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is the game that's going to be bumped back a little.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.720
Yeah, I heard that was like before 2023.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.600
OK, but excuse me.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.600
Tonight's show is going to be a little struggle.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.280
Thanks for being with me.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:49.520
I think that was like a tongue in cheek reference that didn't really make the translation very well.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.080
Like, I think that was one of those self-aware jokes.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:59.560
I don't think they were serious about the 2023 thing, because by the 20 by 2023, the PlayStation five will be here again.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.600
Here I am talking about PlayStation five.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.400
But dude, that's one, two, three, four, five years away.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.360
No game generation has gone on that long.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.840
We're going to have a PlayStation five by then.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.320
So Final Fantasy 7 Remake, it'll be out maybe next year.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.720
It's not to say that Square can't do two big games for holiday, but I don't think they would.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.320
I kind of feel like one is this holiday, one is next holiday.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.000
But also Final Fantasy 7 is episodic.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:30.280
Maybe they would do the first episode before end of fiscal year or next year and then maybe

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:40.000
episode two, like either that holiday or if that's not enough time, maybe, you know, holiday 2019 or Jesus, no, I guess it'd be holiday 2020.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.720
I don't think they would put those two games out that close to each other because they would cannibalize each other.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.400
So I think it would be spread farther.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.480
You think they would cannibalize each other?

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.200
I don't think so.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:48.920
Yeah, probably.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.720
I think both would happen.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.520
Didn't the Kingdom Heart remakes come out not too long around Final Fantasy 15?

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.600
Yeah, but those are remakes, so.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:56.720
I guess.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:04.800
S2100Matt says, some of those kids who've played Kingdom Hearts have as many kids now as Kingdom Hearts has had those Decimal Edition games.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.320
Ain't that the truth?

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.920
I guess that is another thing, too, is that, you know, we knew they were doing this.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:24.520
Square was kind of trying to refresh our memory with those HD remakes and allow new kids to get exposed to the series, even though, again, as a near 40-year-old, I can't explain the fucking plot of Kingdom Hearts.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.440
How is a kid going to understand it?

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:27.920
But whatever.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.120
Sometimes you don't necessarily need a plot.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.840
I mean, whatever.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.160
Tonight in Final Jeopardy, explain the plot.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.920
Explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts in one word.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.400
Go.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:43.920
Stuff.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.680
Keyblade.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:45.600
Pretty.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:46.560
All right.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.160
Anyway, and as S2100Matt says, it's fan service.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.000
There is no plot.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.000
I mean, accurate.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.600
Like, I'm just gonna sit there and button mash and like, ooh, Tron.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.200
Ooh, Disney movies are the best.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.000
I just hope there's easy mode because I am an animation geek.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.360
And then scream it, uh, uh, I can't wait to say Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, scream at Donald for being an idiot.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.360
God damn it, Daffy, shut the fuck up.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.360
I'm Donald.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.360
That's a terrible, that's the worst thing ever.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.360
Can you rename Goofy, I guess you can't, because they're kind of, like, protected.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.360
It would be great if, like, most RPGs, you could rename the characters.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.360
Your name is Asshole.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.360
No, I would rename Donald as Daffy, and that would be funny.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.480
Anyway.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.120
Have we had the crossover Donald Daffy Duck?

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.120
Uh, no, because it's Disney and Warner Brothers.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.120
It's never gonna happen.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.120
It wasn't, like, in a...

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.120
You're thinking, like, Space Jam or something, and that is not, you know.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.120
I know, I was thinking, like, maybe, uh, Who Framed Roger Rabbit or something like that.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120
Mmm, no.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.120
I don't think so.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.120
No.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.120
Good try, though.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.120
Maybe, I don't know.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.120
Oh, actually, folks in chat are saying Roger Rabbit.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120
It did happen.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.120
Alright, well, shit.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.120
Shows how much I know.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.120
What didn't really happen, I guess, I guess Roger Rabbit was a Warner Brothers movie at the end of the day.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.760
Wasn't it?

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.760
Well, it didn't really just happen.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.760
That was when, you know, they were playing nice with each other.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.760
Interesting.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760
Alright.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760
The more you know.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.760
Alright.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.760
Anyway.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760
Let's move on.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.760
Uh, we're gonna do one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:15.760
So, with games being released, you know, for a new life to begin, some lives must end.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.760
Right, Loki?

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.760
Yes, it's the circle of life, and Sony is actually...

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.760
It's the circle of life.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:31.400
Sony is actually acknowledging the fact that the Vita exists, and they're basically letting us know that it exists because they're saying, hey, we're ending production of Vita games.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.400
So, yeah.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.400
Apparently, no more physical Vita games are gonna be released.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:48.400
I'm not sure how long the digital is gonna continue, but they're saying that apparently the final purchase orders will be entered by February 15, 2019.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.400
So, yeah, they're ending it, but that's next year.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.040
Um, but there's not a lot of Vita games coming out.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:05:00.040
Well, at the same time, not to be a bitch, but is anybody really surprised at this news?

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.040
No.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.040
Because there's a part of me that's like, they didn't already end this production.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040
Exactly, yeah.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.040
Like, it's just Sony's support of the Vita has been not good.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.040
No.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:20.240
Which is funny, because I've heard this term a lot, that the Switch is the successor to the Vita, and I kinda like that little tongue-in-cheek jab at a, you know, how

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080
Sony didn't really support the Vita.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:29.080
And in a way, it's kinda sad, because with the PlayStation TV having been a thing, even though it didn't get supported for very long,

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:36.080
like, you kinda had that system where you could play something on the TV and then pick it up and take it on the go.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:44.080
Like, if Sony, granted, it was two separate elements, you had to buy the TV, but if Sony had just kinda taken that like a few steps further and really had that faith

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.080
and really put that kind of marketing into it, like, they could have beaten Nintendo at their own game.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.080
They so could.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:58.920
I mean, it wouldn't, now to be fair, before the chatters yell at me, it wouldn't be as fast as, click, like, pick it up, take, I mean, you would have to like have the cloud save.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.920
But they kinda started to do that with the whole, god, what the fuck did they call it?

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.920
Um, oh my god, we made fun of it.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920
Konami had-

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.920
No, Konami had a different name for it that was like, stupid.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.920
And it was-

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.920
Uh, R Rising or something, god, what was they, somebody in Terrar form or something like that?

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920
I don't remember what it was called.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920
Yes.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760
Stop naming things, Konami.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.760
Transfarency, thank you, transfarency, that's what was, Dark Tetsuya, Gold Star for you.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760
Transfaring.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760
Transfaring.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.760
Get it, cause you're not transferring, you're transfaring.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.760
That's stupid.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:37.760
I hope that's the name of Sony's next handheld, the trans, just kidding, Sony's never gonna make another handheld, but the Sony Transfar.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.760
They might, I don't know.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.760
Probably not.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.760
In Japan, maybe.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:48.760
Alright, well, rest in peace Vita, but again, if you're in Japan, they're gonna still be making Vita games, because they still acknowledge the Vita in Japan.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.600
That's right.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.600
It's still accepted there.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600
Alright.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.600
Uh, let's, uh, let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.600
You guys ready for the classic game of the week?

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.600
Every week we dive into the game involved.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:06.600
In Dark Sakura, she usually jumps in there and finds a game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this video game this week.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.600
But Dark Sakura's on vacation, so when, you know, mom's away, we're gonna play.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.600
So, last week, I took over and gave you SimCity as the classic game of the week.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.600
Look out, y'all.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600
It's Loki's turn.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600
Loki!

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600
No, but you picked a good one.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600
You picked a good one.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600
Yeah, I picked a good one.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:30.600
I, so, well, Rob notes that this is my potential second pick that I, I, I urged him to save his first pick for, like, an anniversary show and convinced Jamie it's a good idea.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600
But anyway, let's not talk about that.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600
Let's talk about tonight's pick.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.600
What did you pick for tonight?

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:44.600
Well, being that we were just talking about Call of Duty and Call of Duty just had a World War II, uh, game come out, I thought it'd be great to choose a game that isn't Call of Duty at all.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:53.600
Um, no, this is actually, um, 2006, this is my favorite game out of both Halo 3 and, well, this is Resistance Fall of Man.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:09.600
So, Resistance Fall of Man was a PlayStation 3, like, launch title, and what was kind of cool about it is it took not only the World War II, like, Call of Duty style gameplay, but it also added, like, kind of some alien elements to it as well.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.600
So, basically, you play this guy, uh, Sergeant Nathan Hale.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:22.600
He is part of this human resistance that's trying to drive out this mysterious alien-like invasion out of the UK, and the...

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.600
I didn't realize the whole beginning of this was narration, so I need to fast-forward to some gameplay here in the clip.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.600
Sorry.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.600
Much better. No, that's alright.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:38.600
Um, yes, and so he, it's the Chimera is what they're called, so these aliens are coming down and trying to take over everything, and it's just a pretty great story-driven game.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:50.600
And so, um, what was kind of cool about it is, you know, with the traditional World War II weapons that you had, you also got alien weapons that you can use, and some of these had alter-, you know, alt-fires on there as well.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:59.600
So, you can do this one weapon that, for example, would launch out a tracking beacon, and you can basically curve bullets around the wall.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:07.600
So, if, like, you know, you tagged one of these enemies with the beacon thing, and the enemy ran behind the wall, the bullets would fall right around the wall to, you know, him.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:13.600
Or they had one that was, um, that would actually go through walls, or you could create a shield with it.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.600
So, lots of cool stuff.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:25.600
But, um, you know, it was actually one of my most favorite games on the PlayStation 3, and, uh, one of the series that, they did make a few additional ones.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.600
They did, uh, Resistance 2 and 3.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:37.600
Um, also, of course, being that this is one of the systems that had motion controls in their controller, the 6-axis at the time, because it wasn't the DualShock 3, if you remember.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:45.600
Uh, the 6-axis, they had motion control support ports, so, like, for example, in multiplayer games, if you got tagged with one of the beacons, you could shake your controller to shake it off.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:51.600
Or, in this one, they would have, like, these, like, facehugger alien things that would try to attack you, and you could shake those off of you with that.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.600
Um, so, they're, like, just little neat things like that.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.600
Um, what else?

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:04.600
Um, multiplayer was kind of fun. They had, you know, offline and online multiplayer for up to 40, uh, players online, which is pretty sweet.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.600
And then, um, you know, lots of different maps to play as.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:14.600
Uh, one of the cool things, though, once Resistance 2 was coming out, they actually offered all those maps for free, which is kind of cool.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:23.600
Um, but yeah, I mean, it was one of these games, I still think this is a game that they should remaster and bring back, because I thought it had a pretty decent storyline.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:31.600
And, you know, out of the two games, you know, Halo 3 and Resistance, I think Resistance was my favorite, because I had played through both of them.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:41.600
But, um, and the other thing that's kind of cool about this is, once you do play through the whole game, you can play through it a second time, and there's actually different alien weapons that are in there as well, so you can play quickly through the game.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.600
So, it kind of urges you to repeat playing through the campaign, uh, which is kind of nice.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:57.600
Something that certain games don't do nowadays, but, um, whatever, it's all a numbers game for these people now.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:04.600
So, yes, Resistance Fall of Man, my pick for Classic Game of the Week. That's it. I keep it short.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.600
Alright, no, that's all good. Sometimes, uh, there isn't a lot to say, but I like it.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:19.600
And, plus, we don't highlight a lot of first-person shooters. I mean, we know that Jamie doesn't play as many of them, but she has, you know, she's talked about her motion sickness and things, so she doesn't get as into those games.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.600
So, it's good that we can spotlight something, I think, a little bit different.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.600
So, I think sometimes you and I are, you know, Jamie, and I'm not, I would never disrespect her when she's not here. I ain't that stupid.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:35.600
But, you know, she has her experiences in gaming, and she has a deep knowledge about all these import games that I could never, like, do, right?

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:44.600
But then, for me, I'm like, oh, old Commodore 64 and PC games. That's my bread and butter, right? So, then I'm able to spotlight those, and then you play some different types of games, like first-person shooters.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.600
So, I'm glad we could spotlight that.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.600
Yep.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.600
Yep. Alright. There it is, your Classic Game of the Week, Resistance Fall of Man.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:12:00.600
Alright, we're gonna take a break, though, and when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Launcher Radio to come, including rapid-fire news, what's coming out in stores, emails, if we have any. I didn't peak.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:08.600
And then some more big news. We have, for what I believe is a surprise closure, kind of coming out of nowhere. So, not all good news, either.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:15.600
So, we're gonna get into that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Your calls, too, when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:22.600
Thank you.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:32.600
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with our 731st episode already in progress for this May 20th of 2018.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:41.600
Loki and I here alone in studio tonight as Dark Sakura is extending her vacation a little bit, but she has, it's understandable, she has a good friend from, like, out of the country, I believe, visiting.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.600
So, you know, you wanna spend every moment with a friend of yours that's-

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.600
When they just bring them along.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:56.600
I actually thought at one point she was going to do that, but I completely understand that, like, seeing San Francisco is probably, like, more on this, her friend's bucket list than go sit in for five hours on OLR.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.600
Yeah.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.600
Three hour show, one hour before and after, you know, it's a lot of Sunday nights, so I totally respect that, it's good.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:09.600
I also wanna give a birthday shout-out, even though I know he doesn't listen to this show, but maybe you all will tweet him and tell him that I was talking shit tonight.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.600
But I wanna wish a very happy birthday, because he's- he already- technically his birthday passed, but his birthday party was today.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:23.600
So, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling, also if you used to listen to Hoard House back in the day, Grandpa, he's had his birthday today.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:33.600
And the theme of his party was, fuck it, I'm 40, which is funny because I'm older than he is, he's not 40, I think today was 38, or this week was maybe 37.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:44.600
He's not 40, but because we call him Grandpa and older stuff, he's just saying, fuck it, I'm 40. He's like the reverse Bobby Blackwell, he doesn't do the 29, he's just, fuck it, I'm 40.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:51.600
So, big happy birthday to Captain Matt over at Starboard Power Coupling from your boos here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.600
Anyway, let's get back into some rapid fire news, Loki.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:06.600
You may remember we talked a little bit about Walmart leaks, Walmart Canada leaks, and some games that were posted on there prior to their announcements that would be assumed at E3, if they were legit.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:14.600
Well, maybe there's a little bit of legitimacy to it, because one of those leaked games was Rage 2, and Bethesda was trolling the shit out of them.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:23.600
And now, they released their gameplay and announcement trailers, so it looks like very Mad Max-ish, as kind of the first Rage game did.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:29.600
And I think there'll be more coming out during the Bethesda conference in probably a few weeks here.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.600
So, um, neat.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:39.600
I got a Battle Royale vibe from it, maybe that's because everybody's doing Battle Royale, but I kinda got a Battle Royale vibe from it.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.600
But maybe that's just the trailer.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.600
Just saying. Looks cool, though.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:56.600
This is interesting. So, you know how they do some of these different speedruns and stuff, where they'll do a length of the past randomizer, where they'll randomize weapons and stuff throughout the different...

01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:02.600
I don't watch enough of those, but I have a friend on Twitter who streams on Twitch who does a lot of Final Fantasy 1 shuffle.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.600
And I always found that fascinating.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.600
Yeah, so it's really cool.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.600
This is gonna be quite the thing to see.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:18.600
I really hope this is something that they run at one of the AGDQ events, either the summer or the regular one.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:26.600
This is a ROM hack that combines The Legend of Zelda, length of the past, and Super Metroid.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:34.600
So, the way this works is basically when you go into a dungeon, you end up actually going into...

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:41.600
It goes back and forth between Super Metroid and Legend of Zelda.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:49.600
And you'll find sometimes Super Metroid power-ups in The Legend of Zelda, so you'll find different things there.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.600
Or you may find some Zelda stuff in Super Metroid.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.600
I like those little crossovers, that's cool.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.600
I just think it sounds really cool.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.600
So, that I am very much looking forward to seeing how that would work.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:08.600
But apparently it's a ROM hack that they've done, and some people have run it, but I need to see this.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.600
It sounds so awesome.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.600
Yeah, cool.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.600
Not cool. If you were looking forward to Shenmue 3, it got delayed.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.600
Well, you know how we feel about delays at this point.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.600
If a delay is what the game needs to be better, then by all means, delay it.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.600
So, the game will be launching in 2019 now. It will not be launching in 2018.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.600
Somebody brought it up earlier when we were talking about Kino Hearts.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.600
So, if you weren't already aware, Shenmue 3 did officially get pushed back.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.600
Deep Silver made the announcement this week updating their release window for 2019,

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:41.600
stating, the extra time will be used to polish the quality of the game even further to the high standards it deserves,

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.600
and release the product in the best possible time frame.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.600
Thank you.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.600
Yeah, you know what? Gamers, we don't do that anymore. We don't get angry when games are pushed back anymore.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:55.600
Because when you don't do that, and you cut corners like that, that's when you lose your single player campaign.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.600
So, thank you Deep Silver for doing what you had to do to ensure that the game is going to be great.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:06.600
So, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC worldwide in 2019.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:12.600
Something you can play a little bit sooner than that is Locke, or Locke Cole, which I forgot he had a full name.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:15.600
If you don't remember that name, he is a character in Final Fantasy 6.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:23.600
Remember, I think people would call him a thief and he'd say treasure hunter, or at least in the English translation of that game.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.600
Anyway, he is going to be a new character in Dissidia.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.600
Gotta be honest, this was a game I couldn't really get into, but maybe I need to give it a second look.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.600
Maybe it's one of those things I'll revisit when it comes down a little bit in price.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:40.600
I was hoping it would be more of a standard fighter, but it was a little weird to me with all the objectives and all these things.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.600
I had a hard time figuring it out.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:49.600
But for those that are into it, cool. Play a lot of it, and now you'll get to play it with Locke, as he is the second download character for this game.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:57.600
Of course, coming from Final Fantasy 6, or 3, if you grew up in the States in the 90s. It was originally Final Fantasy 3.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:05.600
So, yeah, you'll get to play with him, and he joins Terra as one of the people from Final Fantasy 6.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.600
And there's some costumes and some swords, you can see about that as well.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:18.600
Also, they've announced that there will also be four more DLC characters, including a female, a male, a female who was in Dissidia previously, and a male.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:24.600
So all the characters will be from the latter half of the Final Fantasy series. So, hmm, interesting.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.600
Anyway, May 17th is when you can check out Locke in Dissidia.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:34.600
Let's travel around and check out what's coming out a little- actually, May 17th already happened, so you can download them now.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.600
I did not realize that story was like, it's happening today!

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:43.600
Anyway, let's travel around and check out some other stuff you can pick up really soon this week in stores. Loki.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:49.600
Yeah, so starting things out, we have the expansion for Yellow Scrolls Online, Summerset, that's coming out on PC and Mac.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:55.600
We've got the Mega Man Legacy Collection 1 and 2 on the Nintendo Switch.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.600
Runner 3 on PC, Mac, and Switch.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:03.600
Stardew Valley is making its way out to Vita. Oh my god, a Vita game.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.600
Pretty good one, I bet.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.600
State of Decay 2 on PC and Xbox One.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:15.600
Tennis World Tour on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.600
This is cool.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.600
Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, that game we talked about last week, the kind of retro-

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.600
Oh yeah, like the major one?

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.600
That's coming out on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Vita.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.600
Cool.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:35.600
We've got Dylan's Dead Heat Breakers on 3DS, remember that tower defense armadillo game that Nintendo has?

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.600
Yes.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:47.600
And it looks like some, I'm assuming these are remasters, Persona 3 Dancing Moon Night, Persona 4 Dancing All Night, and Persona 5 Dancing Star Night.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:55.600
PlayStation 4 and Vita on 3 and 5, and number 4 is getting just the PlayStation 4 release, and those are all rhythm games.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:11.600
Punch Club on the Switch, and we've got a few more games, looks like 7 Scarlet on the Vita, Dark Souls Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:21.600
Detroit Become Human on PlayStation 4, and last but not least, Sudden Strike 4 European Battlefields Edition on Xbox One.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.600
That's it.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.600
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:35.600
I know they had a big holiday week recently, but I think things are slowing down a little bit, including PlayStation 4.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.600
Excuse me, things are ramping up again, because the holidays have slowed down.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.600
PlayStation 4, in fact, getting a few releases this week.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:45.600
I did not know this, that Persona 3 and Persona 5 dancing games are on their way to the PlayStation 4.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.600
How did I not know that?

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.600
I just mentioned them.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.600
Oh, well, yeah, there you go.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.600
Well, yeah, they're coming out here in the US.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.600
I just, when I saw this earlier, I was like, I didn't even know these games were coming, but there you go.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.600
So they're also released in Japan, same thing as Loki just mentioned for here.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:01.600
The Dark Souls remaster, also making its way to Japan this coming week on May 24th.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:07.600
As well as a game called Mikagame Sumika no Seifuku Katsudo comes out this week.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.600
And Undertale gets its release in Japan, obviously on the PlayStation 4, it's a pretty big deal.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.600
It doesn't stop there, though.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:19.600
We also have the Karu Maruka Circle in regular and limited edition.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.600
And Detroit Become Human gets its Japanese release in parity with the US release.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.600
That is very soon. I'm actually really excited to check that out.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.600
I hope I have the time to do that.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.600
And then I close my list without looking at the Switch or the 3DS.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.600
So bear with me a minute while I bring it back up.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.600
They don't release games on anything but the PlayStation 4 over there.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.600
It's all beta over there.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.600
It's all beta. Actually, you remind me to check to see if there is a beta.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.600
Believe it or not, yes, Undertale on the Vita, the Persona dancing games also on the Vita.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.600
Vita is still super well supported over there.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.600
So those games all out on the Vita.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.600
And let's check out the Switch real quick.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.600
Yeah, the Switch is getting the Rockman Classics 1 and 2, hits Japan this week.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.600
Obviously that is Mega Man here.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.600
And then Rabbit Cross Labyrinth Puzzle Out Stories, also happening on the Switch.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.600
And Urban Trial Playground, also on the Switch this week.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:15.600
As well as a special micro SD card that's branded for Nintendo that is 256 gigs in case you're downloading all this stuff.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.600
As far as the DS goes though, it's a little quieter over there.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:24.600
Nothing to announce. I think that is probably ramping down with the exception of that Luigi game in like 2019.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.600
How about the UK, Loki?

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.600
We've got Space Hulk Deathwing Edition, or Deathwing Enhanced Edition.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.600
That's coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.600
State of Decay 2 on Xbox One.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:43.600
Tennis World Tour on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, the Switch and PC.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.600
Detroit Become Human on PlayStation 4.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:49.600
Dark Souls Remastered on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.600
And that's it.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.600
Alright, we're gonna get to the mailbag.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.600
You guys send us emails and we read them.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.600
Even when you don't send us many emails, we'll still go in there and read them.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:06.600
If you want to send us an email in the future, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send an email.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.600
Our first and only email tonight from Robert M.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:13.600
Hey, you know what, Robert M. always there to email us when none of y'all else will.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.600
So thanks Robert M. who says in the subject line, bats.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.600
And then it's in the email saying,

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:27.600
Just thinking about bats as I tend to do and just wondering besides games that use them as basic enemies,

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.600
such as the Swoopers of Super Mario World and the Bubble Bats of Mega Man,

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.600
what other games have bats as major characters?

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.600
The only ones that come to mind are Sunsoft's Arrow the Acrobat,

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.600
Rogue the Bat from Sonic Adventure 2, I believe,

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.600
and Laylee from Yooka Laylee by Playtronic.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.600
So Robert M. wants us to talk about video game bats.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.600
Driving us batty tonight.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.600
Well, you know the first thing that came to my mind, Robert M.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.600
Batman.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.600
He's technically not a bat.

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.600
Now, man, bat.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.600
He's a man bat.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.600
I'm sorry, that's where my brain went.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.600
I was like Batman because those games weren't bats.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.600
Pokemon, sort of.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.600
Okay, yeah, there's bat-like characters in Pokemon.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.600
I mean, they're not supposed to be technically bats.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.600
They're other bat-like equivalents.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.600
They're bats.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.600
They're bats, yeah.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.600
How about you guys in chat?

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.600
What do you guys know over at live.vognetwork.com?

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.600
What do you guys think?

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:30.600
Because I'm having a hard time thinking about other bat enemies in video games.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.600
Didn't Legend of the Mystical Ninja have some?

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600
Castlevania had a bat.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600
Oh, yeah, Castlevania.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.600
That's a great answer.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.600
That's a great answer.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.600
Castlevania, of course.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.600
Like the first boss.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.600
Like in every Castlevania game, that big vampire bat is always the first boss.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:43.600
Great answer.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600
Or Zelda.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.600
Great answer.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.600
Zelda, that's right.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.600
That's right.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.600
There was a bat monster in Zelda as well.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.600
Adventures of Link.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.600
Let's see.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.600
Go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600
See a Tiberius.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.600
Just Michael Morbius from Spider-Man who crosses with a bat.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:03.600
Dartitsuya says La Mulana has bats, but those are probably lifted from Castlevania.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.600
Good answer there as well.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:15.600
And Tigerclaw links us to the giant bomb wiki who actually has an article on list of bat characters.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.600
So how about that?

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.600
There really is an article.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:22.600
Tigerclaw says, fuck this game.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.600
I have the answer right here.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:29.600
I'm kind of laughing at how funny that is.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.600
They list Batman, by the way.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.600
Just so we're clear, Loki.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.600
They list Batman.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.600
Batman is a bat character in a game.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.600
Let's see.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.600
I'm trying to see if there's any of these.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:43.600
A beautiful Joe had Charles III, a bat creature in that game.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.600
I don't know why they say Conker is a bat.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.600
Why is Conker in this list?

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.600
Conker is not a bat.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:48.600
Demon Hunter?

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.600
Well, the Demon Hunter has a bat in Diablo III.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.600
I guess the Demon Hunter does have a bat pet she can have with her.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.600
So there is that.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.600
Kirby O'Neil, the father of April O'Neil.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.600
I guess was a bat.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.600
Is that a thing that happened in Ninja Turtles?

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:03.600
I had no idea.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.600
So there you go.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.600
Wingnut, also from Ninja Turtles, a character in the TMNT universe.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.600
So there you go.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.600
JD says Barbara the Bat was in Super Smash Brothers.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.600
And JD says this list needs a fact check.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.600
Okay, OLR.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:23.600
For Robert M., you guys need to get the giant bomb wiki updated.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.600
We need an accurate perception of bats in video games.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.600
Thank you for the email.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.600
At first I thought we were talking about baseball bats.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.600
And I was like, okay, well, lots of games with baseball bats.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.600
You would think emails like that drive me crazy.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.600
But I appreciate the emails that are like,

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.600
I had a random fucking thought today, OLR.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.600
And I want to share it with you.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.600
We never do that on this show.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.600
I know. We never get into tangents.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.600
I love it.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.600
if you want to send us an email for a future week.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.600
In the meantime, Loki, why don't we get to it?

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.600
Let's talk about closures. That's unfortunate.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:07.600
Boss Key Games has decided to shut down.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.600
So Boss Key Games, if you're not familiar,

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.600
is Cliff Boot.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.600
I can't talk because I just ate a bunch of salsa

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.600
and my mouth's on fire.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.600
Cliff Bleszinski's software company.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.600
Just do what I do and always say Cliffy B.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.600
Cliffy B. There you go.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.600
Cliffy B's company.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.600
Even though he's older now, so he's Cliff.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.600
Clifford B.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.600
No, I don't think he's Clifford. He's just Cliff.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.600
Just like you don't call me Robert.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.600
Mr. Zinski.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.600
B. Zinski.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.600
He went and formed the company after he left Epic Games.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.600
They were really trying to push out a couple games with it.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.600
One, of course, was Lawbreakers,

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.600
which didn't quite take off.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.600
Of course, then, the last second,

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.600
they tried to come out with a Battle Royale-type game,

01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.600
Radical Heights,

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.600
which also didn't really seem to gain traction.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.600
Unfortunately, because of all this,

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.600
they've decided to just shut it all down.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.600
Radical Heights is going to stay online

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.600
for probably a little bit longer,

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.600
but then that's going to be closed down as well.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.600
As of today, Boss Key Productions is effectively no more.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.600
Four years ago, I set out to make world-class video game studio

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.600
and I hired some of the best talent in the video game industry,

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.600
worked tirelessly to produce quality products,

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.600
and while we had our ups and downs,

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.600
I'd like to think we had fun doing it.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.600
Lawbreakers was a great game

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.600
that unfortunately failed to gain traction,

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.600
and in a last-ditch attempt,

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.600
we scrambled to do our take

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.600
on a huge Battle Royale genre with Radical Heights,

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.600
which was well-received.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.600
However, it was a little too long.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.600
As for today, I'm going to take some time off and reflect.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.600
I need to focus on myself and my family,

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:58.600
as well as my Aussie, Teddy,

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.600
who is slowly fading from us.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.600
Video games will forever be a part of who I am,

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.600
and I hope to make something new again some days.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.600
However, I need to withdraw and take this time.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.600
To those who have supported myself

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.600
and the studio for the last few years,

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.600
thank you from the bottom of my heart

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.600
and everyone who came to work for me.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.600
Please note that the servers for Radical Heights

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.600
will remain up for the near future.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.600
Thanks again, Cliff.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.600
I'm not going to talk shit about Clifford

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.600
because I have nothing but respect for somebody who says,

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.600
you know what, I'm going to take a little time away

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.600
to go work on family stuff and focus on these other things.

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.600
I think that's great, and I wish him well with all that stuff.

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.600
I am a bit surprised, though,

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.600
at how sudden this kind of feels.

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.600
I didn't even...

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.600
Maybe this is part of the problem.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.600
Granted, I don't play these games.

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.600
I didn't even realize Radical Heights was out.

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.600
It just came out.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.600
That's what I thought.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.600
It was in early access or something like that.

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.600
It was right around its infancy.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.600
So it's surprising to me that it's this sudden.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.600
Cliff had to walk away because of family issues.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.600
Again, I respect that.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.600
But the entire studio closing,

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.600
that just seems really big.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.600
But maybe the money, the funding,

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.600
he kind of fesses up to it in there saying

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.600
maybe it was just too little, too late.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.600
Key word there, they couldn't get it out fast enough

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.600
and the money well is dry.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.600
Yeah. It's unfortunate.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.600
Sad, but a reality about games.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.600
It's unfortunate because they were trying to take on popular genres.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.600
They had the whole,

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.600
we're taking on Overwatch with Lawbreakers,

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:31.600
which is a somewhat unique game.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:35.600
But still, it just didn't have the character

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.600
that really brought people to it.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.600
And then Radical Heights,

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.600
it was interesting to see it.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.600
Neat take on the idea,

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.600
but it was just a little too late.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.600
DungeonBuster in chat says

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.600
at live.vognetwork.com,

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.600
if I recall correctly, one of the leads tweeted

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.600
that he learned about the company being closed

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.600
from his 8-year-old daughter who showed him the news online.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.600
She asked him if he was going to be okay now

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.600
that he was losing his job.

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.600
Radical Heights was very prototyped.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.600
They were testing the waters with it.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.600
It was largely unfinished, but playable.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.600
That's a bummer, but you know what?

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.600
That kind of sudden closure news

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.600
is not particularly unique

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:15.600
to the gaming industry.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.600
I learned at a previous employer,

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.600
not my current one, but a previous employer,

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.600
I learned that layoffs were happening

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.600
and there was a financial disclosure

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.600
that happened that morning

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.600
before they brought employees into a meeting.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.600
So we were all pretty nervous

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.600
for a good chunk of the day

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.600
because we knew it was coming.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.600
This isn't something that's unique

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.600
to the games industry,

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.600
but it's not a good look.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.600
But, anyhow.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.600
Well, that's really unfortunate

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.600
for those developers.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.600
I will say, though,

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.600
a lot of other game industry people

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.600
are doing really good to the people there.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.600
Blizzard Careers is out there

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.600
tweeting people right away.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.600
We're looking for people

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.600
because I'm sure they've got some unannounced things

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.600
they're working on.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.600
God, I hope one of them is Diablo IV.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.600
Ooh, I can't wait for Blizzard's take

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.600
on the Battle Royale genre.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.600
Although, I guess they already have Overwatch.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
I don't know if I'm necessarily saying

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.600
they need to bring Battle Royale to Overwatch.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.600
I don't think everybody needs to do Battle Royale.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.600
No, they don't.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.600
I just want them to do Diablo IV

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.600
since it doesn't seem like there's going to be

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.600
another expansion for III at this point.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.600
So there you go.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.600
Let's talk about Super Smash Bros.

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.600
I know a lot of you are waiting for E3

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.600
for just this game.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.600
And I know we don't have a ton of people

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.600
overseas that listen to this show,

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.600
but for those that are over in Japan,

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.600
Super Smash Bros. is going to be playable

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.600
at various events across Japan

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.600
around the same time as E3.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.600
So that's pretty cool.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.600
If you're in Japan and you feel like,

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.600
oh, I want to play the new Smash 2,

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.600
I don't want to have to go all the way

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.600
to the States to do it, the good news is

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.600
that you're going to be able to do that.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.600
So on June 17th at the Rage 2018 Summer,

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.600
you can do that there, or the

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.600
Jisai World Hobby Fair on June 23rd and 24th,

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.600
and the Jump Victory Carnival

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.600
in both Tokyo and Osaka

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.600
on July 16th and July 22nd,

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.600
you will be able to play the game in Japan.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.600
So that's pretty cool.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.600
They're going to unveil it there.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.600
It's obvious that this game is getting its big unveiling

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.600
at E3, and it's going to be playable at E3,

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.600
and Nintendo not really keeping

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.600
it a secret either, because they are going to be

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.600
doing, get this, ticket reservations

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.600
this year.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.600
Oh, fuck that bullshit.

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.600
Finally, a fucking fast pass

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.600
system at E3. Of course, that just means

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.600
all those people are going to be out on the floor,

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.600
and I don't know if they're going to be able to handle that,

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.600
but that's ESA's problem.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.600
Anyway, E3 attendees, Nintendo

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.600
announced, will be able to reserve play slots

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.600
ahead of time for Super Smash Brothers

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.600
with the purpose of having the fans

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.600
get a faster, smoother experience.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.600
You're going to be able to reserve a ticket to play against people

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600
casually for fun, or play

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.600
for glory in a competitive elimination

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.600
match. You will get an

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.600
email from E3 organizers

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.600
by June 5th if you register by

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.600
May 31st with details about

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.600
how to reserve one electronic ticket

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:07.600
for this. This is pretty, so

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.600
official E3, this is through.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.600
Nintendo is ticketing through official E3. That's pretty big.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.600
You have to play the game,

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.600
you have to sign up ahead of time.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600
No on-site registration will be available.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.600
You'll get a ticket as a QR code

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.600
and more information

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.600
at E3.Nintendo.com

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.600
Reservations not taken for any

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.600
other games at Nintendo's booth.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.600
This is only their E ticket

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.600
ride for the year, which is Super Smash Brothers.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.600
How long before they appear on eBay?

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.600
Who knows? Who knows? Yeah, I'm sure

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.600
there's some E3 attendees who have no interest

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.600
in seeing this, but it's

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.600
interesting that they are doing it this way.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.600
The part of me that stood in a line

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.600
for a very long time to see things

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.600
like the DS

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.600
when that was first announced and some of the other like

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.600
I didn't have to stand in line to the Wii.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.600
Thanks for a buddy of mine, who by the way

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.600
well, I shouldn't talk about it.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.600
But anyway, he knows who he is

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.600
and thank you very much for it.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.600
He helped me get to see the Wii with

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.600
getting to skip that line and so forth.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.600
And you know, other

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.600
Nintendo stuff, 3DS

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.600
we stood in a big line for that too, so

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600
it's nice that people are going to be able to kind of like

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600
skip it big time this year to check out

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.600
Super Smash Brothers, and hopefully it runs smooth.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.600
Hopefully it runs smooth, but the fact

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.600
that they're not doing any on-site, that's pretty good.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.600
Because I remember when Sony

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.600
did the VR thing, you had to kind of like go

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.600
run and get a ticket, and it was obviously

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600
a clusterfuck straight to Sony's booth

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.600
that morning, but it worked out

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.600
pretty well. You didn't have to stand around all day

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.600
to get to try VR, so.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.600
Alright, so

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.600
any interest in going to E3, Loki?

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.600
Nope. Yeah, I think they'll take that

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.600
Super Smash Brothers thing on the road here in the

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.600
US too. They're going to be really

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.600
pushing that before the game comes out. It's very clear

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.600
that that is going to be Nintendo's bread and butter for the holidays.

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.600
And how they plan to

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.600
Just put out a demo.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.600
Maybe they will. Who knows?

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.600
Alright, moving on, Loki.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.600
Alright, so this is interesting.

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.600
There's a new Halo game soon.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.600
Coming to arcades.

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.600
Yes, so

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.600
Microsoft announced Halo Fire Team

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.600
Raven. It's a light gun shooter

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.600
game that's coming to arcades.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.600
And which arcades might you ask?

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.600
Dave and Busters, this

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.600
summer.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.600
So check it out. Will the Halo

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.600
arcade game give tickets?

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.600
I don't know. Every frag

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.600
is a ticket, maybe?

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.600
It looks interesting though.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.600
It reminds me of like the

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.600
Glaxion type game.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.600
It almost looks like it's in a booth

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.600
with two big giant screens.

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.600
And that's done by

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.600
Raw Thrills

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.600
and Play Mechanic.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.600
It actually looks exactly like that.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.600
Even the way the guns are set up

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.600
and everything.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.600
Very much like that.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.600
Like a Glaxion game.

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.600
I'll play it.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.600
Do you think Halo 6 is the big E3 announcement for

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.600
Microsoft this year?

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.600
I don't know. I thought it was going to be Gears of War.

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.600
Maybe. And so which game is getting the

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.600
battle royale mode first?

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.600
You know it's coming.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.600
You know it's coming.

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.600
Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.600
it's another one of those railgun shooters.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.600
Which is the only way you can do a Halo arcade game.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.600
I like railgun shooters in arcades.

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.600
Yeah, I like railgun shooters in arcades too.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.600
How's my bread and butter? It would be kind of fun

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.600
though if they had like four of these together and you could

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.600
like frag other people. But I understand that's

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.600
a difficult arcade experience in a lot of

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.600
real estate. Especially in a small

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.600
ass Dave and Busters like the one we have here.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600
Which is, sorry not

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.600
sorry, a joke. The one

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.600
here in town is, it's like the smallest,

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.600
they said it's the smallest one in the entire chain next to

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.600
Times Square. Lucky us. I know, right?

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.600
And even, I went to the one in Times Square

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.600
and I was more impressed with that one.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.600
Sorry not sorry.

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.600
Couldn't they make ours like two story or something

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.600
like that? Multiple stories. You would have thought.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.600
Have like, you know, space.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.600
It's going to be interesting when round one opens up across

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.600
the street next year. How about we just bulldoze the

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.600
whole Sunrise Mall and put a big Dave and Busters

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.600
in there? Watch your words

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.600
because I think that's not to get too much into local

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.600
politics, but I really don't see how that mall stays

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.600
around much longer. It's not. It's

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.600
clearly not and well

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.600
to get into local politics,

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.600
my wife and I would follow

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.600
a local Facebook group around

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.600
here and there's one of the planners for

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.600
the area is in there and they talk about

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600
like different proposals for Sunrise Mall. That thing is

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.600
not staying around very long.

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.600
I went there the other day and like

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.600
half the restaurants are gone out of the food court.

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.600
Shears is closing down soon.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.600
So I mean there's

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.600
nothing anchoring that there. You know

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.600
they might have more success and I will

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.600
tie this to video games. Stay tuned.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.600
They may have more success as an event

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.600
center because they do that tennis thing

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.600
was there like some summers and that was

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.600
like a circus.

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.600
They had like circuses, carnivals. So I bet that place

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.600
would have a lot more success as an event space which

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.600
could include and this is one thing they've been talking

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.600
about that more shopping malls are getting into

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.600
is like e-gaming and e-sports hosting.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.600
That would be very interesting.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.600
It would be neat. Yeah if like the old Sears

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.600
at Sunrise Mall became like an e-sports arena

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.600
that mall might be kind of interesting.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.600
I just

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.600
don't know what they're going to do. Who knows.

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.600
Alright.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.600
Excuse me guys.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.600
Let's move on to a story

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.600
on Star Fox. This is a rumor

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.600
big rumor but as E3

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.600
approaches we're going to have a lot of these so

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.600
bear with us. But what would you all think

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.600
if this were true? Because

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.600
sources say that Retro

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.600
Studios is working on Star Fox

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.600
Racing.

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.600
No. Yeah Retro Studios apparently this is

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.600
their next project.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.600
It's a Star Fox racing game.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.600
And this originally came from Eurogamer

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.600
who has had some leaks in the

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.600
past. Some other bullets

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.600
that have come out about the game. It's not

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.600
like F-Zero.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.600
Star Fox Grand Prix is a tentative title.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.600
It's based on an air wing

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.600
which is how it's not F-Zero.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.600
It's a mix between Star Fox and

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.600
racing. You shoot enemies to move forward

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600
and get combos. You can shoot

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.600
other players too. It's a big

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.600
hub area where you can interact with the Star Fox

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600
characters. Retro

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.600
is considering cameos like Donkey Kong

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.600
maybe 2019

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.600
or 2018. I know.

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.600
They can throw Diddy Kong in there.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.600
Why not? Because you know Diddy

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.600
Kong racing would have been more

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.600
apt as a racing game than

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.600
you know what

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.600
Star Fox racing is. You know

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.600
I would rather see an F-Zero but I

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.600
also understand that I may need to let that go

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600
a little bit. I'm open

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.600
to the idea of a Star Fox racing game

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.600
but it's all about how does it play. Now

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.600
if it's kind of making

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.600
it's niche on like a competitive racing

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.600
game where like the more you destroy other

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.600
people the more you move faster.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.600
It sounds

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.600
a little bit like Wipeout in a way maybe.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.600
There's been games like that I think.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.600
Yeah. So I'm

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.600
open to it and I realize that Mario

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.600
Kart is a huge game

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.600
on the Switch and was great

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.600
for Wii U2. So I think

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600
maybe Nintendo wants to duplicate that success

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.600
without necessarily doing Mario Kart 9

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.600
right now. And do Diddy Kong racing. You don't need

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.600
to add more racing games. Or F-Zero

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.600
Oh yeah F-Zero. Hey yeah

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.600
everybody's asking for F-Zero

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.600
are one of our big racing games

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.600
that we have. Let's make an additional

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.600
racing game that no one's going to have interest

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.600
in instead. Dark Tetsuya says

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.600
there is another rumor that supposedly says

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.600
F-Zero SX for Switch

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.600
but I don't know if I buy it or not.

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.600
You know again now we're getting into rumors

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.600
that are really out there. I would love it if it's true.

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.600
Maybe it's a type of revival

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.600
of F-Zero GX and they're

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.600
going to just kind of like port it to Switch

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.600
and maybe put a few more tracks.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.600
I'd be down. I'd be down. I would.

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.600
You know what if you could like play it online

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.600
smoothly and everything

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.600
like actually I'd be kind of down.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.600
I would check that out.

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.600
You know right now Fast Racing Neo kind of has to

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.600
fill that void. But F-Zero is

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.600
unique in what it is. And Fast Racing has the whole

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.600
like polarizing thing like

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:53.600
Ikaruga kind of does when you race. So it's a little

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.600
bit different than an F-Zero game feels.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.600
But I would be okay

01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.600
if a new F-Zero game is

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.600
like basically a GX remaster

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.600
so they can do it on the cheap. And you know

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.600
that game is I think

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.600
horribly underlooked by a lot of people.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.600
So I'm all for giving it a second chance with a newer

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.600
Nintendo generation.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.600
For sure. Just a couple more

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.600
stories and then we'll probably open up the Skype line

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.600
for a brief bit but I am

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.600
kind of dragging here towards the end. So

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.600
a couple more stories here Loki. Take it away.

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.600
And once again just as I mentioned

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.600
when we were talking to Bobby.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.600
Microsoft slowly has been chipping

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.600
away at PlayStation as far as

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.600
the things it does for

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.600
you know it's community

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.600
and like supporting

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.600
things that people want like backwards compatibility

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.600
or different audio

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.600
modes you know for Dolby Atmos

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.600
or you know 4K

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.600
video

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:47.600
playback in you know

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:49.600
4K Blu-rays and stuff like that.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.600
So now to add on top of that

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.600
you know they came out with

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.600
a new control system specifically

01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.600
for those with

01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.600
people with limited mobility.

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.600
So this new controller

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.600
looks really strange

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.600
but you know with it

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.600
they have different add-ons that you can

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.600
add to allow for all sorts of

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.600
different options for mobility.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.600
So for example if

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.600
you know you can add giant buttons

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.600
you can customize

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.600
it with certain you know mouthpieces

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.600
if you can only use your mouth to

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.600
move stuff or

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.600
I mean they just have so many options

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.600
to basically map stuff out.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.600
You can remap everything.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.600
It looks pretty

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.600
awesome. It's going to be out later this year for $100.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.600
But

01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.600
I mean just a very

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.600
interesting thing to support

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.600
you know which

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.600
probably not a huge large demographic

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.600
of people playing

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.600
you know games but it's

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.600
important though and the fact that they see

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.600
that it's important and

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.600
you know address it is far

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.600
and away better than some other companies.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:59.600
All right. Yeah I love that

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.600
they're like doing this.

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.600
I love that this is like a thing that they're putting out there.

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.600
I'm all about more accessibility and getting more people

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.600
gaming and if that has to be

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.600
Xbox's like niche or whatever to

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.600
really like you know differentiate it from

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.600
what Sony is doing and what others are doing.

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.600
Cool. You know I would hope

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.600
that maybe they're going to set something that Sony

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.600
and Nintendo will want to copy

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.600
and I think

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.600
I think there have been great advocates

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.600
in the gaming industry with companies like

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.600
Ablegamer which by the way

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.600
is who I use my Amazon smile with.

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.600
Just you know a free shout out for Ablegamer

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.600
because I think it's great what they're doing is that they do

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.600
advocate and they do kind of like remind people

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.600
because you know I don't want to give Sony

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.600
shit or Nintendo's shit either because I feel like

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.600
we're more aware of those type of things now

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.600
because like you know Sony the fact that you can

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.600
in the PlayStation 4 operating system you

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.600
can like natively do whatever button swap you want

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.600
so games don't have to put it in themselves

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.600
like that's a step that's progress that lets a few

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.600
more be able to do something they couldn't before

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.600
but this this whole device that Microsoft's

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.600
doing really takes it one step further.

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.600
I think it would be even more awesome if this thing

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.600
were universal and you could use it on any system

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.600
I realize that gets into a little bit

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.600
crazy fan went territory but I mean

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.600
yeah to be fair it is a Microsoft

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.600
controller and Microsoft

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.600
controllers yeah are usually compatible with PC

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.600
so I mean that's

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.600
still pretty good. Yeah that is very good.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.600
Sorry that doesn't support

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.600
Sony systems oh well yeah

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.600
too bad. Do you see yourself

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.600
picking one up I mean I guess there's no

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.600
there's not really a reason for you or me to

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.600
own this and I hope you know again

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.600
to shout out

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.600
Bobby a little bit because the reality is I know you

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.600
podcasters some of you may listen some of

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.600
you may not but for our live folks

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.600
they always you know almost always if they're

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.600
here early enough they hear him for an hour before

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.600
we're on so he kind of got into this a little

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.600
bit talking about you know he doesn't and Bobby

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.600
if I misquote you feel free to correct me as you would

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.600
anyway but like when it comes to speed

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.600
running and things you wouldn't want somebody to be

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.600
like look I can speed run a game because I use this

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.600
controller you don't want this to like be a thing

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.600
that's like you

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.600
know like oh it's a cool new thing

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:59.600
to use this controller because it lets you do games faster

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.600
it lets you like exploit things or whatever

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.600
I don't think that would be the case I

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:05.600
would hope not either but you know

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.600
it's a little different

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.600
when somebody wants to say

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.600
use the dance pad

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.600
to play Mario Brothers

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.600
or something which yes you could do because GameCube

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.600
had a DDR game you know it's a little different

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.600
from the like crazy crossovers

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.600
but something like this that's really for accessibility

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:23.600
kind of hopefully sort of like

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:25.600
stays

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.600
as something for

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.600
that audience to really be able to use

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.600
for them and celebrate you know what I mean

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.600
so alright

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.600
let's see SheHulk

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.600
in chat says the elite controller makes

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.600
gaming much easier a definite

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.600
advantage you know I

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.600
always forget about those elite controllers but they are

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.600
they are something they are very nice pieces

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.600
of hardware I mean I haven't dropped the

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.600
money on one because I just don't do quite enough

01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:51.600
Xbox gaming but the

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.600
more and more PC gaming I do the more

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.600
I think about picking one up and using the Bluetooth to

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.600
use PC too so yeah

01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.600
for sure anyway

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.600
last but not least

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.600
more rumors this is

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.600
about Pokemon I want to ask what you guys think

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.600
so apparently

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.600
the big Pokemon for Nintendo Switch

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.600
some information is coming out about it

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.600
and it's coming from the

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.600
Emily Rogers camp which you know she's

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.600
she's had a lot of you know predictions that have

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.600
come true so I mean take it with

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.600
a grain of salt as you would any rumor but what

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.600
would you guys think if this was true

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.600
Pokemon let's go

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.600
Pikachu and Pokemon let's go

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.600
Eevee so it's not really Gen 8

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:31.600
so I mean this is where this does

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.600
kind of make sense to me because we've heard conflicting

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.600
rumors about a Gen 1 reboot

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.600
and that no the Switch

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.600
Pokemon is going to be Gen 8

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.600
so maybe instead

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.600
of the full fledged Pokemon game

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.600
being this year maybe that is next year

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.600
which would make sense too because the time

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.600
between generations is usually a good 3

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.600
4 years you know it hasn't been that long

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.600
yet since Sun and Moon so maybe

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.600
we're getting a spinoff game

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.600
a la Pokemon Pinball

01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.600
a la Pokemon Mystery Dungeon

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.600
to kind of like hold us over this year

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.600
and give us a Pokemon experience on the

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.600
Switch and it sounds like it could

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.600
be this in the Pokemon let's

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.600
go and that would be what would come

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.600
out and it sounds like it may have some ties

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.600
into Pokemon Go it sounds like

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.600
these games and correct me if I'm wrong guys it sounds like

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.600
these games might be like some type of

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.600
like single player couch playing

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:21.600
Pokemon Go-esque experience

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.600
is what it sounds like can you imagine though

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.600
because I know that these are all cartridge based

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.600
so could we in fact have

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.600
like a device

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.600
that's larger than a game cartridge

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.600
to fit in there that may have like

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.600
GPS built into it or something like that I

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.600
don't think it's literally Pokemon Go

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.600
because that's what Pokemon Go is so

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:41.600
I think that this would be something where

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.600
well I mean you could

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.600
here's the thing Loki

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.600
it could be an ingenious use

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.600
of the Nintendo app to be

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.600
able to use your GPS from your phone

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.600
to geolocate you but like

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600
are we really going to put Nintendo and

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.600
app development and are we going to give

01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:59.600
them that much credit that they know how to do that?

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.600
I'm in the middle of the ocean

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.600
I'm not the big hater you are and I'm not going to give them

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.600
that much credit but you know I could

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.600
see some type of like single player

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.600
experience built around the

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.600
concept of Pokemon Go

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.600
maybe

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.600
where it's a little more action based

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.600
maybe and maybe they

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.600
tie the raids into it somehow and you know

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.600
a little bit of that it's not maybe the same

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.600
classic JRPG experience I mean

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.600
it would be a spinoff game

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.600
Pokemon spinoff games are often

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.600
notable as well right Pokemon

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.600
Snap that was a

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.600
that was a rad game we love that Pokemon Snap

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.600
the Mystery Dungeon games not bad

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.600
I love the pinball games those pinball games are pretty sweet

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.600
so like there's no shame in being a

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.600
Pokemon spinoff game as long as it's you know

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.600
a fun spinoff game. I see the price that Pokemon Snap hasn't come back

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.600
yet with all the selfie

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.600
type you know social media

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.600
stuff I would think that

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.600
that'd be all people would be all over that

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.600
crap yeah for sure

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.600
so there you go that's the latest rumor

01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.600
but honestly guys just wait

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600
until E3 they'll

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.600
tell you what's coming at E3

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.600
alright let's open up the Sky Flight

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.600
I'm going to open this up real quick because I'm kind of dragging

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.600
here at the end of the day Orange Laundrio

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:09.600
all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:11.600
Loki I know there were some stories that didn't

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.600
make the cut tonight did you want to address any of them now

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.600
sure let me

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:17.600
jump in there real fast

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:19.600
sorry to spring that on you

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:21.600
but you should be used to it now

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600
I should be you would think I'd be ready

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.600
Orange Laundrio on Skype if you want to

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.600
give us a call

01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.600
so let's talk a little bit about sales numbers

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.600
Gran Turismo sold 80 million

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.600
copies or they've hit their milestone

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:35.600
there I know I saw

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.600
Grand Theft Auto 5 actually

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.600
hit a pretty large milestone of

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.600
95 million copies sold

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.600
so that's pretty ridiculous

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:45.600
this is kind of cool so you may

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.600
remember there's that whole homebrew or

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.600
hacker thing that you can

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.600
basically mod the Switch now

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.600
so someone has actually taken the interface

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.600
or something that looks very similar to the interface

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.600
of the SNES mini

01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.600
and put it on the Switch I'm so sorry Loki

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.600
to interrupt but can I just say on going back

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.600
a little bit because I wanted to pull this up because I was curious

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.600
how does that sales number for Grand Theft Auto 5

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.600
compare to other video games

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.600
that is more than Wii Sports at this point

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.600
Wii Sports was number 3 now Grand Theft

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:13.600
Auto 5 is number 3 it still

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.600
has not outpaced Minecraft

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.600
and the number 1 best selling game

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.600
ever with 177 million units

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.600
Tetris not too

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.600
surprising there some other ones

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.600
that kind of surprised me I did not realize PUBG

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.600
is already 40 million

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.600
that's crazy

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.600
Mario Kart Wii also did very well

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.600
37 million a lot of those Wii games

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.600
really high up on the list Pokemon Red and

01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.600
Blue at number 9 you can check out the whole list over on

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.600
Wikipedia I know I'm using Wikipedia

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.600
as a source but I figure hey they've got

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.600
to source it to get it on wiki

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.600
so for the most part

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.600
you would assume yeah if I went over there

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.600
and it's like President Cat is the third best

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.600
selling game of all time I'd be like okay maybe not

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.600
maybe somebody went in here and

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.600
talked with a wiki anyway

01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:57.600
Loki I'm sorry to cut you off

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.600
I wanted to get that out there

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.600
yeah so there was that cool

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.600
mod that someone's working on an emulator

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.600
that's basically a virtual console though for

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.600
the Switch so I'm

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.600
down with that

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.600
and then apparently there's some sort of thing

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.600
going on for

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:15.600
Street Fighter 5 where they're basically

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.600
doing a tie in with

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:19.600
Power Rangers

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.600
so that's going to be interesting

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:23.600
um

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.600
I know they've got some Power Rangers

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.600
Legacy Wars it's a mobile game

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:29.600
and so I don't know

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.600
they're going to have like Street Fighter

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.600
characters in there as well I mean that's pretty cool

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:35.600
ah neat

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.600
so let's see what that is all about

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.600
um

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:41.600
what else

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.600
let's see

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.600
I don't know

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.600
that's pretty much it I think

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.600
there isn't a whole lot else for the week

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.600
um

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.600
Taiko no Tatsujin

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.600
there are Switch versions coming out

01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:57.600
um in Japan they're also going to be doing

01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.600
a controller from Hori

01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:01.600
um so that's kind of cool

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:03.600
they're going to have 20 party games in there

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:05.600
and let's see when that's

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:07.600
expected to be out here

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.600
so there's the money sale

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:11.600
besides the load here

01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:13.600
come on

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.600
you can do it

01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:17.600
ah

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:19.600
never mind

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.600
alright that's alright

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.600
oh we have one call wow I was just about to close it

01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.600
and then it lit up so why not

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.600
I don't see this name popping on skype an awful lot

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.600
but let's see how you're on Orange Sounds Radio who's this

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.600
hi this is JD

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.600
hey I don't see you on skype an awful lot even though we get you in studio once in a while

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.600
but it's good to hear from you what's up buddy

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:37.600
um so one of the stories

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:39.600
I saw this week was Ariana Grande

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.600
did a lobbo

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.600
promotion doing um

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:45.600
no tears left to cry

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.600
all lobbo instruments

01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:49.600
you know what I appreciate you bringing that up

01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.600
you're right that's a pretty big deal

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.600
Ariana Grande she's kind of a big deal

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.600
I don't know if you know her

01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:57.600
but uh yeah she's kind of a big deal a pop star

01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:59.600
so for her to be doing this lobbo

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.600
thing is kind of like

01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:03.600
those 3DS commercials with Beyonce

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.600
but I would put that at number one because Beyonce

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.600
is like untouchable

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.600
but Ariana Grande like that's

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.600
pretty solid that's like Nintendo's second biggest

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.600
grab ever probably

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:15.600
right I mean we already know Ariana Grande

01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.600
is a gamer queen because of the Final Fantasy thing

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.600
oh yeah Final Fantasy gamer queen

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.600
absolutely

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.600
so my hope is

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.600
they were playing a bunch of musical instruments

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.600
that were all lobbo things

01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.600
I'm hoping that they will

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.600
release a all musical instrument

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:33.600
lobbo bundle instead of variety

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.600
pack that includes a piano that I'm only

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:37.600
gonna want the piano out of

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:39.600
I must confess I didn't see the commercial

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:41.600
I just saw some of the screenshots on Twitter

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.600
I didn't realize it was a commercial

01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:45.600
I know that they did something I thought

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:47.600
on the late what was it with Seth

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.600
Myers or not Seth Myers

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:51.600
Jimmy Fallon that's right

01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:53.600
they did their thing

01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.600
was there instruments

01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:57.600
in there that we haven't seen yet

01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.600
indicating that there's more to come

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.600
I feel like yes they had like

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:03.600
a drum set and it wasn't just

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.600
all pianos and as far as I know the only one that's

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.600
been released is pianos

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.600
a lot of it looked like they were hacked from other things

01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.600
they had taken some of the parts from

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:13.600
the robot set you know what I really

01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:15.600
would not be surprised I mean labo seems

01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:17.600
to be doing well it was sold out at target

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.600
like and it's I don't I saw it on

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.600
shelf I've seen it around yeah

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.600
but I feel like it's doing well they had it marked down

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.600
at Fry's they had the

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.600
robot kit marked down that's what I saw today

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:29.600
Fry's anyway

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:31.600
cause I got new mics

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:33.600
that I never bothered to hook up but anyway

01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:35.600
so yeah labo I feel like

01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:37.600
is doing well so I mean it would make sense that

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.600
it's probably going to be a volume 3 and a volume 4

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.600
and that musical instruments are

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:43.600
probably one of those upcoming things

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.600
right someone else posted

01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:47.600
a link about the Game of Thrones

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.600
composer playing the theme

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:51.600
on labo like the labo piano

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.600
so like clearly

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.600
at least somebody in Nintendo's marketing

01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:57.600
department is trying to make this happen

01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.600
yeah no I would say you know labo

01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:01.600
it feels like from a pop

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.600
culture standpoint labo's

01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.600
kind of breaking through a little bit so I feel

01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.600
like look we're

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:09.600
seeing this in a way we didn't see the Wii vitality

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:11.600
sensor okay so I feel like

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:13.600
this is something that's probably going to be around for a little bit

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.600
I hope so

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.600
did you ever buy labo did you ever

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:19.600
actually pick it up? no I didn't I just

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:21.600
decided that there was

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.600
I mean the signal to noise ratio wasn't great

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.600
for me I was like if I only want one of the five

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.600
things I'll wait until it's either

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.600
available separately or just not

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:31.600
get it I'm kind of with you but if they do

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:33.600
an all music set that is going

01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.600
to be very tempting with or without the piano

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:37.600
honestly I mean the piano is rad but if they did

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:39.600
like a drum and a guitar

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.600
and like this whole set I'd kind of be

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:43.600
into that I think yeah absolutely

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.600
yeah all right JD anything else on your mind

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.600

close up the skype line for tonight sorry it's a little

01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:15.600
bit shorter of a show but you guys know I'm kind of battling

01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:17.600
this whole allergy thing which you know

01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:19.600
in the years I've been doing this show has never been a problem but here we

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:21.600
are we'll be back next

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:23.600

01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:29.600
o'clock pacific 9 o'clock eastern in the

meantime thank you guys so much for downloading Orange Lawn

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:33.600
Trio and supporting the show if you like what you

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.600
heard here at Orange Lawn Trio please tell a friend or two

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.600
about the show because we are the show where every

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.600
gamer has a voice but only if the voices

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:41.600
are actually here to air

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.600
so yeah a nice five star review on

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:45.600
iTunes goes an awful long way but word of mouth

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.600
is like the absolute best thing you can do

01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:49.600
and that brings me to final

01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:51.600
thoughts my final thought

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:53.600
tonight is rest and liquids

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.600
and hopefully dinner pretty

01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.600
soon I'm ready to

01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:59.600

01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.600

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.600
Loki your final thought

01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:07.600
I'm gonna be playing some Grand Theft Auto 5

I'm gonna be playing they have

01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.600
this new Battle Royale

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:15.600
single player

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:17.600
thing it's a mod that you can

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:19.600

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.600

01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:23.600
