1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,960
In the continuing case of defying expectations, No Man's Sky is getting actual multiplayer

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,680
rather than just light or presence.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
Promises are being kept, which is fair since no timeframes were specified.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,800
This is just one story tonight, stay tuned for the rest starting right now on the show

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,560
where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,040
Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,560
It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight for May the 20th, 2018 with episode number 731

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,160
of our show where we're here to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,680
lifestyle with your hosts here in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, you might know me on

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,360
Twitter at Skie, sadly not here again tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,200
She's continuing her adventures that she kind of started last week.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,960
I think she has a friend from out of the country that is visiting and today they went to lovely

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,460
San Francisco to go frolic and do the San Francisco-y things.

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,960
So I am joined alone here in studio by Loki.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Hello.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Hi Loki, how are you?

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
I'm good.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Good.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
What's new with you?

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
My mouth's on fire now.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Oh, with the food you were eating?

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Yeah, the salsa.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
All I heard you was, it's spicy.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,440
Spicy food is like really good for me right now because, and you guys can probably hear

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,320
it if I seem like a little less peppy than usual.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,920
Like these, this is so weird.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,600
Like I never got allergies in my life.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
And then last year it seemed like a little bit, because I remember talking to a doctor

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,500
and the doctor was like, well, it is possible you can develop allergies later in life.

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,960
But this year, like this last week, like it started, I think it was Monday or Tuesday

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
because I remember tweeting about this, I think it was around Tuesday, because I tried

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
to get a doctor appointment on Tuesday.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
It was really scary.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
I had no voice whatsoever.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,440
And that was kind of scary and humbling for a minute because, you know, I have to use

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,420
my voice to do my job.

37
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,240
Like without my voice, I'm going to be screwed in that regard.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,880
It kind of makes you go like, oh shit.

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
You know?

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,400
And then of course there's this, you know, my hobby that I've had for years.

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,600
You just have to pull a Stephen Hawking's at that point.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I know, right?

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,720
What else would you do?

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,440
So except have a voice to chat or chat to voice, whatever, that sort of thing.

45
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,280
So I mean, it's just like, oh my gosh.

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,160
So anyway, luckily you can tell my voice is improving, but it's like these allergies are

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,400
moving everywhere.

48
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,120
Like one day it'll be my throat, one day it'll be my sinuses, which is what it is today.

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,640
And if you've ever had super congested sinuses, you know, that sinus pressure is no fun to

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
deal with at all.

51
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
So it's kind of what I'm dealing with today.

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,800
And then, you know, it's just some days it's just irritation, you know, so it's just, ugh.

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,960
So I did go to a doctor just, you know, not to be sharing all my business on OLR, but

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,600
they do agree it's probably allergies because here in lovely Sacramento where our show is

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,220
based, it's been a killer year for allergies.

56
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,140
And so I guess mine have just kind of shown themselves and really taken hold and oh my

57
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,260
God, it's, it's awful.

58
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,060
So we're trying over the counter stuff to try to treat it.

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,180
So I don't feel a hundred percent, but at least, you know, at least I'm here and I'm

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,960
able to do this show well enough.

61
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
That's important.

62
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Right?

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Right.

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Yeah.

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
So there you go.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
And it's not strep.

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
That's it.

68
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
It tested me for strep and it's not that.

69
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
So that's good news.

70
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
That's why you can sit here with me because we're confident.

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
It's allergies.

72
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
That's not something as contagious.

73
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,820
You already had allergies anyway.

74
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,220
I probably have allergies now.

75
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
Yeah.

76
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,140
You don't, you never got them as this bad though, right?

77
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
I get allergies.

78
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,060
I get like, especially like a very raspy throat, like earlier this week I had that, you know,

79
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,060
it's just like, I always feel like I have to clear my throat and stuff.

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,500
Brad from Pod Culture asking the tough question saying, could it be Mr. Smoosh?

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,100
Oh, by the way, I should of course introduce our chat room because we do tape live every

82
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,940
Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice geeks network,

83
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,020
geeksnetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

84
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,460
And a quick plug for Bobby who's going to be at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo the

85
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,540
weekend of June 8th in Atlanta.

86
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,880
And he talked about some pretty exciting news and things you can see him do at the expo

87
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
there on the show tonight.

88
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,020
So quick little plug there for Bobby.

89
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,460
I'm going back to the chat though.

90
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,260
Brad from Pod Culture asks, could it be Mr. Smoosh, our cat?

91
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,620
I don't, I wouldn't think so because we've had the cat since November and he doesn't

92
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,940
go outdoors.

93
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,500
And I mean, if I had a cat allergy, I've been around cats my whole life.

94
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,980
I think I would have seen it by now.

95
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,460
I mean, this is the first time we've had an exotic short hair, but I grew up with a Siamese

96
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,460
cat.

97
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,060
And typically I would think shorter hair cats aren't going to be as bad.

98
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,060
Exactly.

99
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,340
And Sanrio is, you know, she was a little, little lion, so she had, you know, really

100
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,340
thick fur.

101
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,340
So I don't think it'd be a cat.

102
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,340
Yeah.

103
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,340
I don't think it's the cow allergies.

104
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,180
I appreciate y'all playing doctor in our chat though.

105
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,180
Everybody's WebMD.

106
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
That's right.

107
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,180
Dr. Google to the rescue.

108
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,700
No, I'm just giving you guys a shit.

109
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,740
Uh, as 200 Matt says, our allergies change every few years.

110
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,440
I never used to be allergic to pollen and dust until recently, recently, my allergies

111
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,820
manifest as headaches now, which is really annoying.

112
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,820
Yeah.

113
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,820
That's, that's, that's true.

114
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
The case.

115
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,500
Uh, and then Siatabiri says, thank you for sticking it out.

116
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Rob Roberts.

117
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,020
Uh, I'm trying my best.

118
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,700
Uh, it may be a little bit shorter of a show tonight though.

119
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,020
I might be able to put in two hours, but we'll see if it's a little shorter tonight.

120
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
That's why.

121
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,140
Um, and Bobby Buckle says, are you sure you're not just allergic to Loki?

122
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,860
Well, I think, I think that would have developed a long time ago.

123
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
Yeah.

124
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,660
Another interesting internet theory from She-Hulk who says, could be the volcano and Ash.

125
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,660
I mean, Hawaii is a, is a very far away.

126
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,620
I mean, Hawaii is what, like a three, four hour flight from here and like only that long,

127
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
isn't it?

128
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,620
I don't remember.

129
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,620
It's been so long since I've been to Hawaii.

130
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,820
I think it's like a four hour flight for the, for the like San Francisco, like a four hour

131
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,820
flight.

132
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,180
So that's almost the time zone changes though.

133
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,180
No, no, no.

134
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,180
It's not cause of time.

135
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
Don't changes.

136
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,700
It's, it's, you know, you're about four hours in the year.

137
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Uh, I don't know.

138
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
It's been, it's been a long time.

139
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,900
Don't me on that, but I feel like it's, it's like far, like Hawaii is probably as far away

140
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,220
as like Orlando, you know, it's a long way away.

141
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,620
So I don't think it's that, but who knows?

142
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
Who knows?

143
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
Anyway.

144
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,180
Five-ish from San Francisco says, uh, Brad from Pod Culture.

145
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Okay.

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
Fair enough.

147
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,620
Uh, as 200 Matt says, get an allergy test.

148
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,620
You know, what's weird.

149
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,380
I tried hinting to my doctor.

150
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,540
That's kind of what I wanted to do.

151
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,920
And I guess maybe my symptoms weren't bad enough, especially because this is the way

152
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
it always happens.

153
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Right.

154
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
And we will get into video games.

155
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,160
We always do, but sometimes talk about ourselves, uh, is that I go to the doctor on Thursday

156
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,280
and of course the symptoms on Thursday were like the best they've been all week.

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,300
So she was able to see that my throat was irritated a little bit, but like, it wasn't

158
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
as bad as it is today.

159
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,240
It wasn't as bad as it is Tuesday.

160
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,400
So she's just like, oh, you're, yeah, you have a little bit of allergies.

161
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,040
I mean, the big baby, I mean, she's not going to say that to me, but you know, it was kind

162
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,960
of like, it wasn't bad enough for her to think like, oh, I should refer him to an allergist.

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,080
So I'm going to have to keep complaining if it's really bad or something.

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,440
I don't know, but I'm going to try to stick it out for at least a little while longer

165
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,400
and see because it could be maybe that I have like a cold symptom or something that's going

166
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,720
through, but then Alan would have got it because he kind of lives here.

167
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,840
So I don't know guys.

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
So confusing.

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,120
Is there a doctor in the house?

170
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
I'm just teasing.

171
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,240
I saw a doctor.

172
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,340
It'll be okay.

173
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,440
But you know how healthcare is here in America.

174
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,840
I have to be, I have to be coughing.

175
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,000
I have to be, you know, really showing more symptoms and probably bleeding or something

176
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,920
to get more expensive tests ordered.

177
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,400
That's that's the way it is, I suppose anyway, or at least prove that these over the counter

178
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
things don't work.

179
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
All right.

180
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,240
As I promised, we do talk about games here at Orange Launch Radio, and there's been quite

181
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,960
a bit going on this week, especially as we are leading up to E3.

182
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Let's start with this.

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,800
This is, this is, I guess this kickoff topic tonight is more of, I guess, maybe a little

184
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,860
bit of a special interest thing, but it does kind of cater to how you buy games and what

185
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
you're able to buy.

186
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
Right, Logie?

187
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
Yeah.

188
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,880
So Valve decided, hey, you know what, we're going to actually do some content moderation

189
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,160
now being that they don't do it for anything else ever.

190
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,140
But now they're apparently they're cracking down on some of these more sexier pornographic

191
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,040
games, basically actually targeting visual novels.

192
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,200
So there's been quite a few different developers of these visual novel titles that have been

193
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,520
getting emails basically stating that, you know, they were going to be removed from the

194
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:11,040
platform because of, you know, erotic material in those games.

195
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,860
But it sounds like that they have backtracked on that a little bit.

196
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,980
So apparently, Mega Gamer, Honeypot and Loopy Soft have now said that they've received emails

197
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,700
from Valve saying that they're going to be rereviewed for content and they'll be informed

198
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,020
that there's any specific concerns.

199
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,100
So that's kind of good.

200
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,820
But I find it ironic that this is what they come down on, you know, this like, oh my God,

201
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,180
there's, you know, anime breasts in a fucking game versus, oh my God, there's a bunch of

202
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,780
broken ass shit that people are exploiting this platform to try to get online.

203
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,400
That no big deal because we get paid, but oh my God, the titties, please don't show

204
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
those titties.

205
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,520
The ultra violent things they can get through.

206
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
No problem.

207
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,200
But that that speaks to a larger issue in this country.

208
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
We all know that.

209
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,040
Yeah, they had one that Hatred had been one of those titles that they removed for violence.

210
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,980
But then eventually they just went ahead and put it back on there.

211
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,840
So it was just, you know, huh?

212
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,720
I just I mean, it's it's kind of like you said, though, like it's it's just boobs.

213
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,840
Like, why can't they just put a warning or something like that on there?

214
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,940
Why can't they just put it all games on the floor, you know, make it so that you have

215
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,320
to be 18 or older to purchase it, which isn't it?

216
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,360
I mean, granted, I I've always kind of hated, which, you know, well, those those age gates

217
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
aren't very hard to get around.

218
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
You just lie about your birthday.

219
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
But don't you have to have like be 18 to buy games on steam anyway?

220
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Maybe not.

221
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,240
I mean, I would think so, because you have to have a credit card, but you could have

222
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
a steam.

223
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
Yeah, I guess that's really hard.

224
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Steam points card.

225
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Allow them.

226
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,640
So you have to have a credit card on file or something like that.

227
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Yeah.

228
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,320
Something in your name or something, something to get the more intense stuff and certainly

229
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,480
like a warning or who gives a fuck because it's just fucking drawn boobs.

230
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,240
I mean, well, I mean, let's put it this way.

231
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,120
If you're if you're below the age of 18 and you're on the platform and you're attempting

232
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,360
to purchase sexy whatever game and you're not allowed to do that.

233
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,740
Oh, my God.

234
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,900
It's not like you don't have access to the whole Internet where there's just pornography

235
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,660
literally everywhere.

236
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,060
That's true that you can access parents really freely and still need to watch what their

237
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,280
kids are doing and actually use steam, especially if like, you know, little Timmy.

238
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,000
Who is, you know, maybe only 14 years old is going to have a steam account because grandma

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,840
buys him steam port point cards for Christmas.

240
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,400
And the parents probably want to make sure that like porty games don't go on it.

241
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,720
But shouldn't it be very easy for the parents to be able to see receipts and what they don't

242
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
they have?

243
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,180
I'm assuming since this would be like any other platform that's out there when they

244
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,840
have parental controls on steam to be able to prevent those types of games from even

245
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
showing up in searches.

246
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,280
I have to be honest, I've never really used that stuff because I don't have kids.

247
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't have kids that buy games either on my steam account because it's just me buying

248
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,880
games on my steam.

249
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,440
No one's buying games on my steam account.

250
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,920
Well, I was just gonna say your kids are going to get older soon enough.

251
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,720
So have you thought about any of this type of stuff or are you just going to kind of

252
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,200
try to control all that?

253
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,080
Nah, I'm not going to block anything.

254
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,360
Who cares?

255
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
It's just titties.

256
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll just say, I'll just tell them this, okay, it's like, listen, these games are here to

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,360
try to sell you anime titties.

258
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,560
They're not that great.

259
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,280
If you're looking to see anime titties, you can just don't pay for fucking pornography.

260
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Yes, not even like good boobs.

261
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
Don't pay for pornography.

262
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
That's the lesson that needs to be learned there.

263
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,840
They're not even like good boobs.

264
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
They're not even tittle-lating.

265
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,080
Anyway, let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

266
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,240
Some help from folks that have actually seen some of these things in steam.

267
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,880
MXC says some steam games do have age gates before you go to the store page, although

268
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
Kaiju-do, you know how to get around it.

269
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,140
I tell them I was born in 1923, I can get into anything.

270
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,780
Let's see, MXC does say, steam accounts do have family libraries you can set up, as in

271
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,340
hiding certain games, restricting, etc.

272
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,500
Yeah, I was gonna say, like, there has to be, I mean, that whole type of stuff is customary

273
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
now.

274
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I'd be very surprised if that wasn't in there.

275
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,980
And if the issue is, oh, well then my child is gonna find a way to get around it, if they're

276
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,500
smart enough to find a way to get around your age gating or whatever, they know where the

277
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,740
porn is on the internet.

278
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,260
I mean, come on.

279
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,460
Bobby Black Wolf says, notice that Valve only cares about anime titties.

280
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,620
3D model titties like in The Witcher 3 are not in trouble.

281
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,860
If some of those anime visual novels were 3D models, they probably would be fine.

282
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,900
That's a good counterpoint.

283
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
There are some-

284
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,500
Which doesn't make any goddamn sense.

285
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,860
Is it because, like, again, I haven't played these games, but is it because the anime characters

286
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,780
are portrayed as young girls?

287
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,500
So it gets in that really, like, yucky area of kiddie porn, which I agree is gross.

288
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Let's just put it this way.

289
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,380
Okay, so I have my Steam store page up here right now, and as I'm scrolling down, I have

290
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,700
under, you know, the under $10 page has a bunch of the Super Dimension Neptunia stuff,

291
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,980
which all has anime chicks on the front.

292
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,280
Scroll down even a little bit further, and I've got this game called RabiRibi, which

293
00:12:52,280 --> 00:13:01,380
has, you know, scantily clad, young looking anime chicks in it as well.

294
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,500
I mean, I don't know.

295
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,220
I was just about to ask, like, where's the anime dicks, though?

296
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,980
And MXC with a good point in our chat saying, some of the visual novels do feature young,

297
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,380
in quotes, looking girls.

298
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,700
However, coming out on top, a gay dating sim about college men was also targeted.

299
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,420
Was- I can't keep my gay dating sims straight.

300
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,500
But is coming out on top, is that, like, sexually explicit?

301
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,340
Didn't it have a version on Steam that took the really gross stuff- well, I say gross,

302
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,820
but, you know, Tumblr type stuff out?

303
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,060
I thought that's how it worked.

304
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,180
Not that I expect you to know, but I- somebody in chat hopefully does.

305
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,580
There's too many games to keep track of.

306
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,060
I remember one of those popular gay dating sims, and I think it was that one, had, like,

307
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,340
a watered down Steam version that came out where they removed, like, the most explicit,

308
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,860
like, jizz on my face type of scenes that were, like, in the original, if I remember

309
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
correctly.

310
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,540
You know, I have- honestly, I've never played those games.

311
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,420
Like, if I want porn, just go to Tumblr.

312
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,980
Or the new one that we've talked about on this show, you know where all the porn is

313
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
at now?

314
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,580
Like, it's, like, it's Twitter.

315
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,540
Like, all the fucking porn is going to Twitter.

316
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,960
I don't know, like, where that is, but we've talked about this on a previous episode because

317
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,540
you get really annoyed because you just happen to have a lot of gay male friends who heart

318
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,620
stuff and then your feed just fills up with dudes in underwear.

319
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,220
Listen, this is what I- okay, listen.

320
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,500
Which is not your preferred thing.

321
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,860
Wait, and then I'll have a problem- it's really a problem with Twitter, and it's anything

322
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,300
that basically, oh, this person liked this thing.

323
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,940
I don't care what you liked, okay?

324
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

325
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,460
Liking is good if you want to let that person know you liked the thing, or you want to bookmark

326
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,780
it for later so that you can go back to it and it's easily able to find.

327
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,500
That's why I did, like, I- there was a really cool animation that I saw that gave me a great

328
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,780
idea for, like, a game idea, so I was like, okay, I'm gonna like that so that I can go

329
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,660
back to my like list and find this thing that I'm looking for.

330
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,340
So, you know, that's what I use it for, but like, I get it, you find that guy attractive,

331
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,780
but dude, I can only block so many gay men on my, you know, Twitter feed.

332
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,300
And before you start to look over the whole day.

333
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,220
It's not that I am, like, anti-gay or anything, it's like, I browse Twitter at work and I

334
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,900
don't want that, just like, oh, hey.

335
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,100
Loki, it's happening to me.

336
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,140
Believe it or not, I'm friends with some straight people, and the same thing's happening to

337
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
me.

338
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,340
I'm getting Beaver on my feed, which I'm- I try very hard not to be one of those gay

339
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,460
guys that's like, ew, vagina.

340
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,860
But you know, I'm just like, okay, I didn't really need to see this, this is not the content

341
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,260
I signed up for today.

342
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:37,620
Well, yeah, like, I've got a few people on my feed that enjoy, you know, very attractive

343
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,220
cosplay women in there as well.

344
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,620
And that also is something I can't just have popping up on my screen if I'm browsing Twitter.

345
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,100
But you know what most people are gonna tell you, stop using Twitter at work and do your

346
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
work.

347
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,540
See, Twitter's blocked at my work, so I only have my phone if I'm gonna check Twitter.

348
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,180
So luckily, that's, you know, pretty easy to hide, but still, I'm like, the hearted

349
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,900
post feed, that really fucking annoys me.

350
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,260
The only way to get around it that I found, I can do it on my PC if I use TweetDeck.

351
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,580
You go to like TweetDeck.Twitter.com or something like that, and it will show you, you can set

352
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,300
up different custom feeds, but like your normal feed will not have any of that shit in it.

353
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,860
So it's like the third party stuff is the only way to get around, like, the forced like

354
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,860
stuff.

355
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,260
But I heard that that might be changing in the coming weeks, that like Twitter's gonna

356
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,820
clamp down on the third party stuff.

357
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,900
Of course they wanna market that shit, so whatever, I mean, it is what it is.

358
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,420
I just kinda, I just block people now.

359
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,620
I mean, that's all I have to do.

360
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,260
And I mean, whatever.

361
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
It's fine.

362
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,420
It's not like I'm gonna follow those people anyways.

363
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
That's it, yeah.

364
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,020
Kaijuto in chat says, I respect my followers on Twitter.

365
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,660
I never fav nude pics.

366
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
I see.

367
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
Same thing.

368
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,940
And like, I would keep it real.

369
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,020
Sometimes I've been at home, and I'm looking at Twitter late at night, and you know, some

370
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,420
very attractive male is lying on his bed in his jockstrap, and I'm like, that is a fine

371
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,100
looking specimen of a man.

372
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,260
And like, I wanna click the heart to give that guy that validation he's seeking, but

373
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,220
I don't do it out of respect for people like Loki and everybody else who follows me, because

374
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,140
I'm like, okay, if I heart this post, everybody's gonna know you're a perv.

375
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,900
Like, I don't, but I feel bad.

376
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,340
I'm like, I wanna give my friends posting nudes validation, but I can't do it.

377
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,460
That's why they should have something separate where you can do it.

378
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,540
Or you just have to roll a separate account, and I think that's something that Bobby Blackwell's

379
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,820
getting to in our chat, saying, don't be horny on maim.

380
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,460
And that's what other people are doing, is that people are making, I keep wanting to

381
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,540
say, rolling alt accounts.

382
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,660
It's a World of Warcraft character.

383
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,580
So you have your real World of Warcraft character Twitter account.

384
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,140
I'm rolling the pervert class now?

385
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,740
Yeah, then you have your Goldshirean Warcraft character on the Moonguard server.

386
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,220
And that's actually, that's what I do see some people doing, not a lot, but I do have

387
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
friends that do that.

388
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,280
They have a, they have a, but they will follow me still on their alt.

389
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,700
And like, I'm not interested in posting naked photographs of myself on the internet.

390
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,540
I have nothing against people that do.

391
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,100
I think that's cool if you have that type of like self-esteem to be able to do that,

392
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,940
but like, it's also one of those things where I can look at it and go, you know, not for

393
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
me.

394
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,260
And especially having the increased visibility of doing this show, my career and so forth.

395
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,240
Nudes of me on the internet, probably not the best idea, right?

396
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,100
So like, I have no interest in rolling an alt account to post, but maybe to view, maybe.

397
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,300
Anyway, where were we?

398
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,020
Anime titties turned into a Twitter talk.

399
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,020
Does Steam need to ban Twitter?

400
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,580
I think they need to focus their selves on other things, honestly.

401
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,900
I mean, I don't know what the, from what I, because I remember hearing a story about this.

402
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,100
And so it was, I think another, it was like a Watchsaw group or something that like went

403
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
after these types of games.

404
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,180
And that's what kind of brought attention to the Steam about it.

405
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:06,460
But I mean, really, they need to just focus more on these games that, you know, the whole

406
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,540
getting rid of the whole, the green light thing and stuff.

407
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,540
Terrible idea.

408
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,540
Because now anything's on there and literally all sorts of bullshit garbage is on Steam

409
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
now.

410
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,540
It's ridiculous.

411
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,540
All right.

412
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,980
And then I'm looking in chat, Fifth Dreams saying, I just had this conversation on Twitter

413
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,020
last night and this morning, a musician I follow click like on a lady and you could

414
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
see her butt.

415
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,180
I wonder out loud if people know we can sometimes see those likes.

416
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,860
Well, remember that infamous case that happened with Senator Ted Cruz?

417
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,860
Yeah.

418
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,780
His account liked some porny thing and it became a meme overnight.

419
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,900
And now you still see that come up.

420
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
That lady in the glasses.

421
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
What the fuck was that?

422
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,100
I don't remember what was going on, but the lady in the glasses biting your finger because

423
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,340
she's like looking at something sexy going on, like, you know, that infamous still from

424
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,340
that.

425
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,820
Like that is probably the most well-known story about that happening was when that account,

426
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,040
whether it was him or an intern or whatever it was, it certainly was not a great look

427
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,600
for a professional, you know, politician, no matter how you feel about politics.

428
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,960
Let's see.

429
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,400
Also in chat, S.J.

430
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,760
O'Connor-Matt says, I have the same problem.

431
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,920
I keep seeing people favoriting borderline, not safe for work, furry stuff.

432
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,840
I have no problem or issue with friends having their, that be their interest, but I really

433
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,760
don't want to see a sexualized fan drawing of Isabel from Animal Crossing on my feed.

434
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,880
I also just block it now.

435
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:37,760
Hey, why don't I show you where you can put those bells?

436
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,800
She's just trying to pay off her mortgage.

437
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:50,160
The things Tom Nook makes people do are very, very dark.

438
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,520
I love that multiple people in chat are starting to put no in all caps, not just one person,

439
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,440
but like multiple people on a row.

440
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:07,080
No, stop, desist, end, cease.

441
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,640
Vidpower says, I did not need to know about Isabel porn.

442
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
A blame S.J.

443
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
O'Connor-Matt.

444
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
It was his idea.

445
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
It's a thing.

446
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
There's the Internet.

447
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Of course, there's porn of it.

448
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,120
Oh, my God.

449
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Let's see.

450
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,920
And then J.D. saying, there's a reason why there's a difference between like and retweet.

451
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Amen.

452
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,760
Like, why can't it just be if I want people to know I like it, I'll retweet it.

453
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
And I do.

454
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,520
Actually, you know what I really love?

455
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,960
I love the quote retweet thing because I know that people will block retweets because I

456
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
do that.

457
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Like, I didn't do this in the beginning, but pretty much after I had about 500 people I

458
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,680
was following, whenever I follow somebody new on Twitter, I instantly shut off their

459
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,960
retweets.

460
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,320
I don't care who it is.

461
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,480
I don't want to see retweets.

462
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,080
I want to see the content that the people I'm following are posting.

463
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,200
That's how I'm able to follow a thousand people, not with any regularity or whatever.

464
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,820
But you know, I try to keep tabs on, you know, whatever.

465
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,960
So I instantly disable retweets like all the time.

466
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,200
But if you quote a tweet, it goes around that.

467
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
So if there's something where I'm like, oh, no, I want people to say see this like, oh,

468
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,300
there's this great new Maxine Waters video you have to see of her shutting some bitch

469
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
down in Washington.

470
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,040
I'm going to quote tweet it so that you have to see it type of thing.

471
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,000
That's how you get around the retweet thing.

472
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,880
But it's so funny that you could turn off retweets, but it doesn't turn off the heart

473
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
thing.

474
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,460
Well, yeah, it doesn't make any sense either that you're just going to see what people

475
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
like anyways.

476
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
And what's the point?

477
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,760
What's the difference between a retwee and the like?

478
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,960
I mean, you're going to see it anyways.

479
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Yeah.

480
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
I don't know.

481
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
So anyway, where were we?

482
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
Steam.

483
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Yes.

484
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Yes.

485
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Steam.

486
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
How far have we gotten away from that?

487
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,400
I guess the only thing I wanted to add on the Steam front, back on the original topic

488
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,400
before we went to Animal Crossing porn, I wanted to say about the fact that doesn't

489
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,560
Steam sell movies?

490
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,040
Is that still a thing that Steam's doing is selling?

491
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,680
So don't they sell R rated movies?

492
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
I don't know.

493
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,240
I haven't actually looked at what kind of movies they sell.

494
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,040
I know I have just one one movie that I have that whole movie, the indie game.

495
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,880
I was kind of like the first one that went up there.

496
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
Still haven't watched it to this day.

497
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,840
I did watch it for when I went to our innovation lab rotation thing because I was prework prerequisite

498
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
for what we're doing.

499
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,960
Literally had nothing to do with what we were doing at all.

500
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,680
So I mean, that was nice that they had me watch it, but it was a good documentary.

501
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:35,320
I really enjoyed it, but yeah, I had no bearing whatsoever on what we were doing, but it was

502
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
still good.

503
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,760
It's weird because I've watched a lot of video game documentaries.

504
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Just not that one.

505
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,480
It is really good.

506
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
I know.

507
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I don't.

508
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
I'm not trying to be a hater.

509
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,760
I just, for whatever reason, I just never get around to watching it.

510
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,960
Probably because it is in my Steam library and not on Netflix.

511
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,240
It's not something I think about watching, especially at my computer.

512
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,960
Well, it's good too because it's like three games that I've, well okay, I haven't really

513
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
played.

514
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,560
Real quick, S200 Matt says they have 1,088 movies on Steam and MXC confirms they do sell

515
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
R-rated movies.

516
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,920
So I would assume at least one of those R-rated movies has boobs, maybe even a dong or a beav

517
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,120
because you can get away with showing like a little bit of that in an R-rated movie,

518
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
right?

519
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Maybe from like a distance, you know?

520
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,680
So if you, like up close genitals, probably NC-17, but like from a distance.

521
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
I don't know.

522
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,800
We got away with a lot with Borat.

523
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:31,120
Well, uh, Shape of Water, her lady self was on full display, full frontal display, and

524
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,040
that was an R-rated movie.

525
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,480
And then, what was the, I mean, spoiler alert, but what have I really spoiled?

526
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,360
What's the other one?

527
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,880
The other character that he played as well that was in Borat.

528
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
I know what you're talking about.

530
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
I don't remember his name.

531
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,720
But there was, I'm also thinking that movie with, okay, God, you all are going to judge

532
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,840
me so hard.

533
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,120
Who plays Magneto in X-Men now?

534
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
And he was in that movie where he did a full frontal, but it was like for like two seconds.

535
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Michael something.

536
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,680
I don't remember.

537
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Somebody in chat will know.

538
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
I don't know.

539
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Anyway.

540
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Oh, and Sia Tabiri in chat says Bruno.

541
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Bruno, yes.

542
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Oh, yeah.

543
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Forgetting Sarah Marshall on that.

544
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Thank you.

545
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Fassbender.

546
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
That's it.

547
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Fassbender.

548
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Michael Fassbender.

549
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Assassin's Creed!

550
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,840
Because I remember joking about, is he going to show us his sword in Assassin's Creed?

551
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,520
So, but anyway.

552
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,640
And then pretty much half the movies you and McGregor has been in.

553
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,680
Anyway, this isn't a nudity in film chat, I promise.

554
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,720
Tiger Claw in chat says, did you guys see the trailer for the Happy Time murders?

555
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,880
I'm sure there will be plenty of boobage, be it Muppet boobage.

556
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Yeah.

557
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Yeah.

558
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,160
Alan sat me down and made me watch that.

559
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,360
That's a total like Meet the Feebles.

560
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,920
That's exactly where my head went to.

561
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm like, didn't they do this called Meet the Feebles?

562
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,280
And like the 90 and Meet the Feebles was not very good.

563
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
It was terrible.

564
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,480
But it didn't have Melissa McCarthy or Joe McHale.

565
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,420
So these really like funny, funny.

566
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
It does look funny.

567
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,400
Like, Alan's like, we're gonna go see this day one.

568
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,560
And so I'm like, even though I never go to movies, I'm like, okay, if it'll make my husband

569
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,680
happy, I'll go, you know, I'm kind of looking at it going, this looks ridiculous, but he,

570
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,520
he will make me go to the most random comedies.

571
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,840
What was the last one we saw?

572
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
This is the end.

573
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
That was hilarious.

574
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,360
It was it was have funny moments.

575
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,040
That's what I'll get funny moments and funny parts.

576
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
It was funny.

577
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I liked it.

578
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
All right.

579
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Anyway.

580
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Oh, wow.

581
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Okay.

582
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,860
JD says this has the actual Jim Henson company behind it, or it sounds like it, which is

583
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
a change.

584
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Wow.

585
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
Sun or whatever.

586
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,860
It's they're allowing that.

587
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
Yeah.

588
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,160
They're the ones doing the puppets.

589
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,480
I'm kind of shocked to hear that.

590
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,800
My how times have changed.

591
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
All right.

592
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,100
My how the topic has changed.

593
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,000
So I think we need to shift gears here before we get into the rest of the news.

594
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
Talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

595
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,680
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

596
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,380
I didn't play a whole ton, but I did buy a lot of things.

597
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,680
So I mean, there's that.

598
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,560
So there's like all sorts of sales going on.

599
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,920
I went to that we were looking.

600
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,560
My son wanted me to get that Mario and Rabbids kingdom battle thing.

601
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,920
So we ended up finding that half off at Fry's because it was their thirty third anniversary.

602
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,720
So they had a bunch of things that were half off.

603
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,440
With that, though, Fry's also had their DualShock 4's half off.

604
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,120
So I got them for thirty bucks instead of like seventy dollars per controller.

605
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,760
And because my kids had kind of destroyed a couple of my DualShock controllers, I went

606
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,740
ahead and picked up two new ones to go along with it.

607
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,400
So now we have four, which is awesome.

608
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:35,920
And then I also picked up yesterday a completely different sale at GameStop.

609
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:45,040
They're doing their pro elite, some sale thing, and they had Skyrim VR for half off.

610
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,080
So, of course, I've been holding out and getting Skyrim VR.

611
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,040
So I had to pick that up as well.

612
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,660
So I can't wait to play that.

613
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,420
And then, you know, they've been doing flash sales on the PlayStation Network.

614
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,480
So they had Titanfall 2, like the Gold Edition or whatever like that for five bucks.

615
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,120
So I was like, hell yes, I will pick that up for five dollars.

616
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,120
There's some other like PlayStation VR games that I picked up.

617
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,520
So, yeah, lots of stuff to play.

618
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,760
Didn't play a whole lot of that.

619
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,400
I did play just the kind of the same type of stuff that I've been playing.

620
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:24,240
So lots of Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme still playing a little bit more of Mario Odyssey.

621
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,640
And then, of course, on the front of Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme, I was also playing

622
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,640
Statmania.

623
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,400
I did get my replacement J-packs for my arcade cabinet and for eventually when I convert

624
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,680
the machine into a Statmania machine.

625
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,480
So I have those now for that.

626
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,880
And then what else did I play?

627
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,240
Lots of Pokemon Go because I had a field trip and we went down to like the Sacramento Zoo

628
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,520
area. So that whole William Lamb Park stuff, tons of PokeStops everywhere.

629
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,600
So I did that.

630
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,200
And then also, I guess it's like a I don't know if it's a farm for like some sort of like

631
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,000
weird frog alligator thing.

632
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,680
I don't know what it is, but there was a ton of them around there.

633
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,440
So I got that. And then I played through that event that they had on Saturday.

634
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:19,960
Got my Charizard upgraded with the new Dragon Power thing.

635
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,080
Sadly, did not get any shinies because the shiny Charizard looks fucking awesome.

636
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,800
Um, and then what else?

637
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,320
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

638
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,560
All right. My gaming week.

639
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm sorry. One more thing, bitch.

640
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,800
Sorry. No, I wanted to get into this because I tweeted about this on Twitter quite a bit.

641
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,760
My gaming week is like super short this week because I'm still working on my project.

642
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,320
So I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto five because I haven't played Grand Theft Auto five

643
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,480
on PC very much.

644
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,520
And I'm like, you know what?

645
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,800
I keep watching people play Grand Theft Auto five stuff.

646
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,200
I'm just going to go ahead and do that.

647
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,760
So, um, I went ahead and tried to do that and my password didn't work.

648
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,960
And I'm like, well, that's weird.

649
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,360
And I'm like, did I change my password and just forget what it was?

650
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,320
Like, I don't understand.

651
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,600
So I tried resetting it through their service or whatever, and their service is broken.

652
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,960
It doesn't send emails out at all.

653
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,640
So I was like, OK, well, what the fuck?

654
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,200
So I ended up having to log back in or create a new account and relink it to my stuff.

655
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,240
And that worked.

656
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,320
And it was weird because I was able to keep the same name.

657
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,160
But at the same time, I'd already sent a ticket to Rockstar to get that back.

658
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,240
So they finally like reset the password for me after confirming my email address.

659
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,880
And then I went and logged back in and it was tied to some the PC account was tied to

660
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,960
some Russian guy.

661
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,120
And I was like, what the fuck is this?

662
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,840
And so because I never played on PC, at least online, I played on console.

663
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,920
And so I'm like, what the fuck is this shit?

664
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,480
Because someone even using my account to play like Grand Theft Auto online on PC, it's not

665
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,280
like they're stealing anything from me because I never played on PC.

666
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,720
So I don't know what would be the purpose of that other than not having to buy the game.

667
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,440
So I was like, yeah, I was in like some Ukrainian clans or whatever on there and Cruz.

668
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,120
And so I was like, OK, well, I reset the password already.

669
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,920
So that's done. I'm unlinking all this stuff.

670
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,080
I'm deleting this. Now I have a level 14 character that's in Grand Theft Auto that I

671
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,520
don't know who it is, but it's mine now, which I thought was funny.

672
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,400
Jokes on them. Steal my account.

673
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,800
I was steal your shit. Wow.

674
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,720
So somebody got in your account. That's crazy.

675
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,000
I don't even know how, because like it was weird, though, because like I hadn't been

676
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,520
that long since they played because I played once I got those computers and I've had

677
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,800
this computer for almost a year.

678
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,640
So I don't know.

679
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,400
I was weird, but man, I mean, it's not like they were going to steal anything from me

680
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,920
because I had nothing on that account.

681
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,960
So I don't know what the purpose was, but they're going to be upset that their

682
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,040
character's gone. They're only level 14 anyways, so whatever.

683
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,720
All right. So that was just my little adventure.

684
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,040
And then like after trying getting that all resolved and trying to play it, it's like,

685
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,480
oh, I got downloaded like 10 gigs of updates.

686
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,040
And so that's the worst when the game like you want to sit down and play a game and

687
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,560
it's like, oh, I've got to download like 10 gigs of updates before I even tried to

688
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,160
reset my password. It downloaded updates and installed them.

689
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,320
So I'm like, OK, so we're done updating now.

690
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,240
So I go back in there after I logged in, it's like, oh, hey, we got another like five

691
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,360
gigs of updates now. Fuck.

692
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,240
So I didn't end up getting the playground the thought of five this week, but I will

693
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,640
this week. On somebody else's account.

694
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,080
All right. Have fun with that.

695
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,200
All right. Finally, my new week, I also did the Pokemon event on Saturday, as many of

696
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,720
you are talking about in chat, and I hope this doesn't sound like bragging or anything

697
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,200
because I know some people have mixed luck on that event and that sucks.

698
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,400
But I did get five shiny Charmanders, which you asshole.

699
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,440
And I got five. Well, I mean, we we went to the capital when everybody was like, don't

700
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,800
go to the capital. It's gonna be fucking nuts down there because we had this big bike

701
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,040
race called Amgem that was happening downtown.

702
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,040
And then there was graduations going on both at the Golden One Center and at the

703
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,240
Memorial Auditorium, which I realize means the two big places to have graduations here.

704
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,400
And then there was something else. It was like everything that could be happening in

705
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,960
Sacramento was going on this weekend. So they're like, don't go downtown.

706
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,040
But I was like, I have guaranteed parking at Alan's work, you know, not to tell all his

707
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,720
business, but he works a reasonable distance from the capital so I can park at his work.

708
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,040
No problem. And walk.

709
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,040
And that's what we did. And, you know, the capital had a few Pokemon players, but it was

710
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,600
like probably a quarter of what we usually see at the community days because I think the

711
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,560
news scared everybody off.

712
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,280
But there was still a lot of Charmanders to be found.

713
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,720
And we just kept catching over and over and over again.

714
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,760
And I would say we were getting probably one about every 30 minutes.

715
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,880
So finally, when we got the third, I say we, it was me and my buddy John, who I used to

716
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,000
live with a long time ago.

717
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,720
He's like, he was not like a big gamer back in the day.

718
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,360
I don't remember if he was ever on this show, but I lived with him for a while.

719
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,520
This is a long time ago, guys.

720
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,560
This was when, for those of you that have been with OLR a long time, this was when we

721
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,680
were simulcasting the show on Justin TV, which, yes, I know a lot of you would like us

722
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,760
to go back to and we're talking about it.

723
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,400
That's all I can say with Twitch now, obviously.

724
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,280
But when we had Justin TV, the simulcast there, remember that that garage studio that

725
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,720
had the lights and everything, that was me and John's house.

726
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,920
OK, so John was not like a huge gamer, although he was really rad because he always

727
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,600
supported this show and the fact that we kind of took over the house every Sunday night.

728
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,760
So but he he's he's like more into Pokemon Go than I am.

729
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,280
Like we have a competition about who can get more gyms, gym badges.

730
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,480
I think 569 gym badges.

731
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,640
This bitch has like 630 gym badges.

732
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,880
It's like he's visited that many unique gyms around the area.

733
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,200
It's pretty crazy. Anyway, so but John's great.

734
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,160
He wouldn't hear this anyway.

735
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,160
But so him and I went out.

736
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,360
We were technically Shane, who you all know him, I'm sure from Ranger Pride and all that.

737
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,400
He was there, too.

738
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,600
But Shane gets and I'm sure you all know this.

739
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,640
He gets in the zone when it comes to shiny hunting.

740
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,440
So if we're not moving fast enough for him, he goes off and does his own thing.

741
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,480
So within like 20, not even 20 minutes, 15 minutes, that's what happened.

742
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,840
John and I were lagging too far behind and he went off to go catch more jar manners.

743
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,800
So we weren't able to catch up with it until the end of the day.

744
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,800
So anyway, John and I were kind of both like catching about one every 30 minutes.

745
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,440
So finally, about the time we got to 90 minutes in and we had three, we were like, OK, well,

746
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,160
like three, that's kind of the goal.

747
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,600
Like if you get one, you're content.

748
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,160
If you get three, you're great because you can have one for each evolution.

749
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,720
Right. And even one of the shinies I caught appraised as a wonder or highest appraisal.

750
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,840
So it's my first shiny wonder.

751
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,680
And it was it was probably like level twenty nine or something also.

752
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,560
So like I think I caught a good Charmander.

753
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,920
We're good. So I got my little black dragon Charmander.

754
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,080
I'm good. So we kind of took it easy at that point.

755
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,720
You know, we went over to Starbucks, just would catch whatever shows up on the Starbucks,

756
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,400
got a drink, took it easy.

757
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,320
Then we walked back and caught a couple more shinies on the way back.

758
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,280
So we had a nice kind of like easy day.

759
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,680
So I hope you guys had a good Charmander experience, those of you that went out and did

760
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,760
it. If you didn't catch a shiny, I can sympathize again.

761
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,360
I'm not trying to rub it in. You know what I think they should do.

762
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,720
Here's what I think they should do.

763
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,520
And those of you that may be a little more frustrated at community day, maybe you'd

764
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,720
agree with me on this. They have that questing system in Pokemon Go.

765
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,840
Why don't they just make it during community day?

766
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,880
Like if you catch fifty Charmanders or you complete twelve quests, which are all I

767
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,240
catch three Charmanders or whatever.

768
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,120
If you if you do the questing, you get a guaranteed shiny spawn.

769
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
Wouldn't that be nice?

770
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,520
And then, you know, you could at least get one if you put a little effort into it.

771
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,840
Yeah, it's kind of like the theory from MMOs.

772
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,000
I see Warcraft, I see Final Fantasy 14 doing this.

773
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,480
If you do the boss enough times, the boss drops an item or the boss drops points.

774
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,720
So you can at least get some sort of reward, even if the thing you want is noise

775
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,360
dropping. That I think would be a nice I'd be very happy with that.

776
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,360
Even to somebody who did very well this community day, I'd be very happy with a

777
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,480
system like that. So anyway, we'll see.

778
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,520
I'm finally just now looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

779
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,840
S2100 Matt says, I got three shinies.

780
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,320
I got nothing until the last hour and then I got all three.

781
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,000
I was sweating and not happy about it during it.

782
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,520
It doesn't help that it was pouring in NYC and the map was messed up with a lot of

783
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,720
weather boosted Pokemon.

784
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,440
Well, I mean, it probably worsened my allergies and here I am today.

785
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,680
So there you go. All right.

786
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,280
So besides Pokemon Go, which I talked about plenty enough, I played Blaster Master

787
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,320
Zero this week because I was just looking through stuff on Switch.

788
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,440
I almost got Hyrule Warriors, but I was like, I haven't had a lot of time.

789
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Yeah, I thought about I saw that the sort of like, am I really going to do I want to

790
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,680
drop 60 bucks on this?

791
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,560
I mean, well, I if I can, which I know Nintendo games never go on sale, but if

792
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,800
maybe like Amazon Prime still has the deal, maybe I'll get it through that or

793
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,320
something to excuse me, guys, maybe I'll get it there at some point.

794
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,080
But yeah, 60 bucks.

795
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,240
Yeah, it's always like 60 dollars.

796
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,520
Take a risk. Will I really play this game or not?

797
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
But I think I will probably end up getting it.

798
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,880
But I was like, what do I want to play?

799
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,720
And I was like, you know, I love this Blaster Master Zero game and there's all

800
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,200
these DLC characters I've barely touched.

801
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,600
So I went in and played that for a little while.

802
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,680
That was my good little like decompression game earlier this week.

803
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,080
So anyway, hopefully I'll get to play more games this week.

804
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,720
I still need to go binge spend money on Pinball Arcade because like you guys

805
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,760
that news last week, I'm sad that all those tables are going away.

806
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,200
But I think, Loki, I think I'm going to double dip on PC if for nothing else.

807
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,640
The fact that I can stream some of them and just kind of have them in my steam

808
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,240
library because like PC, that's always going to be there, right?

809
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,720
Yeah. PlayStation three, PlayStation four.

810
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,720
You know, if PlayStation five, I can't believe I just brought up PlayStation

811
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
five on this podcast, but here we are.

812
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,800
If PlayStation five isn't backwards compatible again, I wouldn't.

813
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,480
I wouldn't guarantee anything.

814
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,960
I don't think it's ever going to.

815
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,400
I'm not going to guarantee it either.

816
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,480
And like honestly, like when it comes down to the next gen systems, whatever

817
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,920
that's going to be, I'm probably going to go Xbox this time again, because

818
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,440
honestly, it's like I like the first party games.

819
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,600
But when it comes to some of these other games that I tend to play more, which are

820
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,040
like, you know, Skyrim and stuff like that, you know, the Bethesda games, look

821
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,960
who's supporting modding a lot better.

822
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,720
Yeah. I mean, like they have like these whole beyond Skyrim things, you know,

823
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,640
that giant mod that they're talking about and stuff.

824
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,440
They have the first part of that available on the Xbox.

825
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,560
You can you can download that mod on the Xbox.

826
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,200
Can't do that shit on PlayStation four.

827
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,720
So, yeah, I mean, I think take the stance

828
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,680
of someone that actually seems to be listening to their user base.

829
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,120
JD in our chat at live.vognetwork.com

830
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,400
points out Nintendo games do go on sale.

831
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,280
The eShop has an on sale section, for instance.

832
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,280
I should have. Well, I should have clarified.

833
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,280
I meant like first party Nintendo games rarely go on sale.

834
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,600
I am aware that the indie stuff, they are pretty good.

835
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
And that's a good way to like feature the indie stuff to just like on Steam.

836
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,000
Now, and to be fair, I know that sometimes you have like the gold coins

837
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
you can trade in for deals.

838
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,160
I'm not talking about one cent per coin, but like you can buy

839
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,480
like a 40 percent off coupon.

840
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,720
They do those types of things.

841
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,400
Maybe Black Friday, they'll have a sale.

842
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
But Nintendo first party sales are pretty rare.

843
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,600
Well, I don't.

844
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,640
Maybe the Wii U was a little more generous because the Wii U was struggling

845
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,160
a little bit, but I think like, no, even the Wii U wasn't very.

846
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,640
Yeah, you know. Yeah.

847
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,320
So, you know,

848
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,440
anyway, just like I think,

849
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,600
JD, nothing that's going to be on sale, like in the next couple months,

850
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,040
like Black Friday would probably be the first time a game like that.

851
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,160
Weird stance to take, though, like I get it.

852
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,600
And I guess, you know, with the switch, it's still early in its lifespan.

853
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,680
But I mean, they did the whole Nintendo select stuff with the Wii U.

854
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,040
So maybe they'll do that with the switch.

855
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,320
So they'll re-release them for 20 bucks or something like that.

856
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,400
But I mean, even first party companies on all the other platforms,

857
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,720
you know, they discount their stuff.

858
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,880
I just don't understand

859
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,520
why they're so stingy with their titles.

860
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,360
Like, I get it. They're, you know, these games are masterpieces.

861
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,720
Yeah, no one is arguing that.

862
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,800
But they're arguing that, you know, hey,

863
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,880
maybe charging $60 for a game that came out four years ago.

864
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,560
Not a great idea. You know, I don't know.

865
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,400
To register participation for this week's

866
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,640
episode of Orange Island Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase cover.

867
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,640
All right. Well, let's you know what?

868
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,920
We're talking about game sales.

869
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,000
What a great transition into our first topic tonight.

870
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,240
Let's get this gaming news.

871
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
I'll just quickly do some housekeeping.

872
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,080
No shows off plan in the immediate future.

873
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,320
We will be out the weekend of June 24th.

874
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,920
I think the day is as I'm going to be out of town on a trip.

875
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,720
But you can look forward to our 16th anniversary special the week before that.

876
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,120
I say there's not going to be anything special about the show.

877
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,160
Maybe we'll try to get a guest or two.

878
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
But that will be on June 17th.

879
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,400
We'll be celebrating 16 years doing this old enough to drive this show is.

880
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,720
But, you know, it's one of those things where I'm like, I'm actually like

881
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,840
not to get too sappy, but I'm I'm really proud that we've had the drive to just

882
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,200
fucking stick with it this long, like 16 years is a long time to do anything.

883
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,840
It's amazing. It's pretty amazing.

884
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,960
Anyway, that's the one little toot our own horn.

885
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,200
I will do we'll do more of that in June.

886
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,800
But yeah, so and of course, follow us on Twitter.

887
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,760
Twitter dot com slash all our and Facebook, Facebook dot com slash Orange

888
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,640
Lounge Radio. OK, now we can do gaming news about sales.

889
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,480
Yes, Logie. So this is actually unfortunate.

890
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,080
But Best Buy, they've canceled their Gamers Club and they haven't even really made a big

891
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:22,520
announcement. But apparently Gamers Club unlocked was that service that you could get

892
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,160
20 percent discounts on new games.

893
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,320
You pay like a one time fee each year and you get those wonderful discounts.

894
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:36,400
Well, there was apparently rumors that the service had been canceled.

895
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,920
And it's been confirmed now, speaking with some Best Buy employees, that there was an

896
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,640
internal memo saying that the service ended on May 17th.

897
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:52,720
They haven't given a reason why it was ended, but apparently, you know, they're going to

898
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,040
honor the subscriptions for as long as they have left.

899
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,280
But you're not going to be able to renew that subscription going forward.

900
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:06,000
So that's unfortunate because I know a lot of people use that for preordering games, but

901
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,600
maybe it just wasn't profitable for them.

902
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,600
Yeah. And I know some people that swear by that as opposed to Amazon Prime.

903
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,760
So that's a little bit shocking because that Gamers Club is also giving you discounts on

904
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,680
Amiibo and that stuff, which the Prime thing doesn't do.

905
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,000
So this is a little bit.

906
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,760
Well, I mean, it is and it isn't shocking, you know, because they probably were losing a

907
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,480
bit of money on it and retail's kind of hurting as it is.

908
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,440
So maybe this is something they had to do.

909
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,240
Maybe they're going to think about a way to try to discount games from the top for

910
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,600
everybody, as opposed to just having to sign into this program to make it a little more

911
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,360
appealing that like, hey, we do cheaper games even if you don't have our subscription.

912
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,600
I obviously you probably go, Rob, that makes mathematically no sense.

913
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,480
Obviously, I'm talking about not as deep of a discount, but maybe, you know, a couple

914
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,160
bucks. Well, not that they promote GameStop or anything, but I know they have their

915
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,160
because I was looking at it this week, their used game.

916
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,000
I think they have this now elite thing you can buy, which is slightly more expensive than

917
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,040
just the fifteen dollars a year.

918
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,840
And you get 20 percent off their used games versus just the 10 percent off that you

919
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,960
normally get, which isn't a great deal.

920
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,880
But I mean, you could if you were looking to purchase, you know, quite a few games like

921
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,400
I was thinking to purchase, you know, quite different games or quite a few games on the

922
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,440
switch and other platforms.

923
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,440
I was like, well, you know, I could probably make up that difference, that cost to pay

924
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,840
for that with the savings I would get from purchasing those games.

925
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,440
So I was like, it might be worth it in that sense, but I don't know, maybe not something

926
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,880
I'd pay for every year.

927
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,800
So some of the comments from our chat, some surprise actually at this news, fifth dream

928
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,080
says, whoa, shit, they canceled it.

929
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,440
So many people are going to be pissed.

930
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,080
Tiger class says maybe because nobody took advantage of it.

931
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,640
Nobody ever talks about this gamers club.

932
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,040
I know people that used it.

933
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,600
I mean, I think more people are using the Amazon Prime thing, but that's not to say I

934
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,960
don't certainly know people using the Best Buy thing because somebody else points out in

935
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,040
chat, you could double dip on it and get the points and so forth.

936
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,120
And JD said that you can double dip and get points and the discount.

937
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,840
And that's what kind of sells it for some people.

938
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,720
So, yeah, you kind of have to wonder, like, was it really profitable for Best Buy or was

939
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,840
it, you know, they're taking a step back.

940
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Fifth dream with another perspective here says game companies have been fighting back

941
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,760
to Sony and others have been stopping Amazon from offering presales on their games because

942
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,280
of that discount, I'm sure.

943
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,840
Very, very interesting.

944
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,600
And Brad from Pod Culture says, I used it a lot.

945
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,320
Lego Dimensions alone saved me the cost.

946
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,320
Yeah. If you buy a lot of those add ons and so forth, for sure.

947
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,080
For sure. So many times I've been so tempted to buy Lego Dimensions every time like I'll

948
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,360
see it. It could be dirt cheap, like 20 bucks.

949
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,840
And I'm like, I know if I buy that, I'm not going to play that game.

950
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,440
Yeah, I know I'm going to buy that.

951
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,080
I'm like, ooh, I'm not going to play the game.

952
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm like, there's no way I'm buying this game.

953
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,200
It's a fun game, though.

954
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,640
That being said, though, I have so many of the characters.

955
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,800
I really appreciate that they didn't put out a new version every year.

956
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,680
Seriously, though, if you are into Lego Dimensions and want to pick up some of those

957
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,840
things before they go away, Dollar Store has them for two dollars a pack and they're

958
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,160
still selling them and like best like GameStop and Target and Walmart for 20 bucks a

959
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,960
piece for those little things.

960
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,440
Two dollars. I have a desk drawer full of them.

961
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,320
All right. Let's move on to another story.

962
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,480
This is another big story from this week talking about the game No Man's Sky.

963
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,120
Yeah, it's been two years, believe it or not, since that game launched.

964
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,920
But No Man's Sky is going to be getting a new multiplayer mode.

965
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,800
And Hello Games has confirmed that this is happening as part of the Inside Xbox YouTube

966
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,360
show, which we already knew No Man's Sky was coming out for Xbox.

967
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,520
Like, yeah, exclusive window for PlayStation is probably run out.

968
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,880
So the game is going to be coming out on Xbox now on July 24th.

969
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,920
So the director, Sean Murray, said that alongside this Xbox launch, the game is going

970
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,400
to start allowing people to work and fight alongside one another.

971
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,760
So I'm not sure if Jason got that right in the intro or what he was alluding to, but it

972
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,440
sounds like this multiplayer update is coming out the same day as the Xbox version.

973
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,040
It's in July, July.

974
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,400
So even though there was a multiplayer update last year, it was with the little glowing dots.

975
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,600
It's not fable multiplayer.

976
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,920
Yeah, no, it's not really what it is.

977
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,440
So in the press release, you can do the infinite universe with your friends or bump into random travelers.

978
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,880
As you voyage together, friends will help you stay alive or possibly prey on others.

979
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,480
Oh, God, trolls can't wait.

980
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,360
Build bases from tiny shelters to complex colonies that you create as a team and can be seen by the community.

981
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,040
The shelter colony thing was kind of already in the game, to be fair.

982
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,120
I got a call again. Sorry.

983
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:35,120
Be a pirate or wingman in epic space battles with friends and foes and race exocraft across weird alien terrains and create tracks to share online.

984
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,800
That that bullet right there.

985
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,120
That's the one that made me perk up because I'm like, is this the closest to F-Zero we're going to get?

986
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,000
Because that I like that we're going to get vehicles aren't that fast.

987
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,760
They're like little dune buggy thing.

988
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,680
Not yet, but maybe like the Mako.

989
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,080
You have to mine more.

990
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,120
That's all it has to be.

991
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,280
But that that part sounds really exciting.

992
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:55,960
So that's pretty cool.

993
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,160
So, yeah.

994
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:05,040
So what do you think about No Man's Sky still kind of working on the game for keeping, you know, for keep working on it?

995
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,240
I mean, seriously, they got their money.

996
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:13,240
Yeah, especially in the face of all the negativity out there about the game, like they have really stuck with it.

997
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,760
And I really can't help but give them props either.

998
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,480
I think it's great.

999
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,720
So, I mean, congrats to them for sticking with it.

1000
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,160
And maybe maybe it'll work out in their favor.

1001
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:28,840
I mean, I don't know how many people are going to want to visit this game again on Xbox, but I'll go back to it on PlayStation after all the updates are done.

1002
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:37,120
Yeah, there's a there's a loyal crowd on Microsoft's end that I'm sure we'll be curious to check this out, that maybe they feel like they're getting the better version.

1003
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,080
I don't know, although PlayStation is getting the same update, so is PC.

1004
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,000
But, you know, kind of neat, kind of neat.

1005
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,840
Dungeon Buster in chat says, I hope the multiplayer works out for No Man's Sky.

1006
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,720
The base building stuff is pretty crazy.

1007
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,960
And Dungeon Buster continues, kudos to the team for adding more content this way.

1008
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,160
And it really should be noted.

1009
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,920
I mean, in case you weren't aware, they've been slowly adding to the game this whole time.

1010
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:05,560
I mean, it's not like every couple of weeks, but they've been putting out these big updates on a fairly regular basis, you know, across these two years.

1011
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,760
So kudos to them.

1012
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,240
I want to check this out, too, when it comes out.

1013
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,800
So I'll probably reroll again.

1014
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:18,360
I guess maybe PC for me, even though I do have the PlayStation 4 version, if I do PC, my streaming set up is better there.

1015
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,920
So that's why I tend to get on PC to see what the sales look like.

1016
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,080
We'll see. All right, let's move on.

1017
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,080
Loki, more big announcements for this week, right?

1018
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,400
Yes. So less is less of announcements, more of confirming rumors.

1019
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:41,320
But they did a whole Black Ops 4 presentation that was streamed online talking about the big changes coming to Black Ops.

1020
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,680
So Call of Duty this year is not going to have a single player campaign.

1021
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,440
Instead, it's going to be multiplayer only.

1022
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,440
With that, you're getting three zombie modes or maps or whatever that are going to be in there.

1023
00:49:53,720 --> 00:50:02,080
And then they're also going to have this brand new mode that's basically their big battle royale mode.

1024
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,600
So that's going to be available as well.

1025
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:20,640
Interesting, though, I know with rumors of this and other, I guess, inside sources had said that they were working on a single player campaign for the game, but apparently due to time constraints, they weren't able to finish it.

1026
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,040
And so that was scrapped from the game because of that.

1027
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:33,280
But, you know, some of the other selling points of the game, they're saying this time it's more class based multiplayer.

1028
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,240
So they have different classes you can play on that can do different things.

1029
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,920
A lot of the wall running and stuff that were in some of the other games are gone.

1030
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,880
They say now it's boots on the ground and the zombie modes look kind of interesting.

1031
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:57,640
They had one that was, you know, kind of this gladiatory type thing, which is melee weapons.

1032
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,840
Then they had a couple other ones that were, I don't know, just look like your classic zombie fare.

1033
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:09,240
But for me, I'm really disappointed with it because I did play the campaign.

1034
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:17,840
And they would like to say, and I've heard this and a lot of fans of Call of Duty will say this, that no one plays Call of Duty single player.

1035
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,560
No one plays the single player campaign.

1036
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,000
Everyone's in Call of Duty for the multiplayer.

1037
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:32,240
And that's just wrong, actually, because I've watched other videos talking about this in one of them, which is by a YouTuber that I tend to watch,

1038
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:42,800
Yang Ye, which talked about if you look at these sites like Steam and I want to say there's a PlayStation Trophy site that had the same type of information.

1039
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:51,360
And you look at the trophies that people have in Call of Duty as far as these games, there's about half of the people that play Call of Duty that finished the campaign.

1040
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,120
And then only about half as well that have actually prestige, you know, once they've gotten that trophy, the prestige.

1041
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,160
So to say that no one plays single player is not really true.

1042
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,160
And here's what it comes down to, honestly.

1043
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:11,560
And I know that the fan base wants to, you know, say, oh, well, too bad you don't like it and you're just scrub or whatever.

1044
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:18,000
It comes down to the point that Activision and they've been it's been a numbers game with Activision.

1045
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:27,680
Like look at what they did to Call of Duty Tomorrow Warfare Remastered, where they basically interject, you know, they sold the DLC maps for the game.

1046
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,840
Separately, they gated the game behind Infinite Warfare.

1047
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:38,400
You have to buy Infinite Warfare to get the game because no one really wanted to purchase Infinite Warfare.

1048
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,400
And then they, you know, stuck in loot boxes into the game.

1049
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,920
It's a numbers game for them.

1050
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:53,560
So do they spend money to develop a campaign that might get some people, you know, get a lot of people excited about it and bring it in there?

1051
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:01,920
Or do they save the money in developing the campaign and sure, they're going to lose, you know, quite a bit of sales from it.

1052
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,680
But in the end, they make up more money by putting in this battle royale mode and they're able to monetize that more.

1053
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:17,680
And so they're going to make up more money with monetization and loot boxes, because honestly, if you listen to any of their financial numbers, that's where all the fucking money is anyway.

1054
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,960
And so that's why they're not seeing people as their customers anymore.

1055
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,560
They're seeing them as the numbers and they're playing the numbers to make themselves the most money because they don't want just some of the money.

1056
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,560
They want all of the money.

1057
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,160
And that's why we're getting this shit.

1058
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,760
And unfortunately, I can't support it.

1059
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:44,040
And I haven't been purchasing Call of Duty the last few years anyways, just because I've looked at the single player campaigns and they had some of them haven't been very good.

1060
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,080
I did like Black Ops.

1061
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,600
That was one of my most favorite customer.

1062
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:53,440
Realize that in the modern warfare stuff, just this infinite warfare was just a little too much like advanced warfare, which was the last one I had picked up.

1063
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:02,760
But, yeah, Loki, a very, very how, how worrying, but very realistic take on what may be going on in the games industry for some companies.

1064
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,560
I mean, indie development is certainly still all about the players.

1065
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,200
Absolutely.

1066
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,600
But very interesting kind of perspective.

1067
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:15,800
You know, I know not everybody always agrees with what you say, but I think you worded that very well where, you know, it seems like some companies, you know, players are numbers.

1068
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:24,680
Activision and EA are big proponents of they think they can get away with, which is weird because I never really feel that for the Blizzard side of Activision.

1069
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:34,280
But then as Activision slowly gets their little tentacles on things, they kind of like, like the whole fact that this is in the Battle.net launcher is kind of one of those like, oh, God, you know.

1070
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,080
Well, yeah, and I get it.

1071
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,000
And no, I mean, it's smart.

1072
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,800
It's smart, but it's like and I get it like, you know, Overwatch is extremely successful with their loot boxes.

1073
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,160
Yep.

1074
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,440
But to to me, that says it's just it is just cosmetic stuff.

1075
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,560
And it's always that's what it's been.

1076
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,960
That's what's always going to be.

1077
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,960
And I'm fine with that because I don't feel the compulsion, the need to get that stuff.

1078
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,640
But some some people might.

1079
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,680
But it's Overwatch.

1080
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,400
Sorry to cut you off.

1081
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,920
But Overwatch is also a very special kind of game.

1082
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,040
It is not your typical first person shooter.

1083
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:18,680
You know, and I've said this for years on OLR, Blizzard has this way of Disney-fying popular genres or popular games and making them extremely accessible.

1084
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:37,360
And that is exactly what they did with Overwatch is they took the Team Fortress 2 most obviously slash first person formula, Disney-fied the characters, gave them rich backgrounds and made this game that even people who's bread and butter is World of Warcraft wanted to play because the characters were so strong, you know, that people wanted to get into this universe.

1085
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:46,680
I'm telling you, Loki, when we look back in 50 years on like what were the biggest video games of this decade, Overwatch is going to be towards the top of the list.

1086
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,280
Exactly.

1087
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:47,840
No question.

1088
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,400
Exactly.

1089
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,920
And here's the problem, though, is like when you have these people that they take this out, it's a total EA.

1090
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,760
Well, I don't even think it's an EA move because it's an Activision move.

1091
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,360
Activision has been doing this forever.

1092
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:10,240
It's an Activision move where they basically say we're removing something that you're paying your $60 for and you're not really we're adding this battle royale and we're innovating.

1093
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:18,120
We're innovating because we removed the single player camping because they would say that's like that's like Apple talking about courage when they got rid of the headphones.

1094
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:19,920
Yeah, exactly.

1095
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,360
They want to they say they want to tell a story in a different way through the multiplayer modes.

1096
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,800
Bullshit, I'm calling on that because Titanfall did that same shit.

1097
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,760
We we all know it's marketing speak and like we all know it's crap.

1098
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,000
Like, I hate to say it, Loki, but you are stating the obvious in that way.

1099
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,960
Like we know like the fact that Activision is saying, oh, we had the the courage or this is the artistic vision.

1100
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:48,560
Now it's a line of smoke to blow up our ass to explain why, you know, you just wanted all the resources and multiplayer because that's the bread and butter.

1101
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,000
That's the money. That's loot boxes.

1102
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,040
You don't make money off single player.

1103
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:59,760
The ironic part, though, is before all like first off, the lack of like a single player campaign, that was kind of just a quick mention at the end of the presentation.

1104
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,280
And before in the beginning of the presentation, they're talking about like the rich storytelling of Call of Duty.

1105
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,840
And they were showing clips from the single player campaigns that are not going to be in this game.

1106
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,800
It's like, what?

1107
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,040
I don't know. It's just I hope it's good.

1108
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,960
My expectations are not high.

1109
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:24,800
Let me ask this question about the battle royale stuff, because that's what our chat is really screaming about in over at live.vognetware.com.

1110
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:32,640
S200Matt says, I hope this royale game movement helps innovate the genre with the additional competition and doesn't just dilute and jump the shark with it.

1111
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,160
What do you think about the whole battle royale edition?

1112
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,120
I mean, it's not surprising, that's for sure.

1113
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:46,640
But it just to me, it looks like the big like battlefield type games where it's a bigger map, you've got vehicles and that's it.

1114
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,400
But, you know, it's not that innovative because battlefield's been doing it forever.

1115
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,400
Yeah, I don't I don't hate them for jumping in on that genre.

1116
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,800
I mean, it's kind of the thing that people are doing right now.

1117
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,480
When Minecraft first came out, every game, like a lot of game friendships, like here's a build your own type of thing or how do we expand on that?

1118
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,280
Right. We get all these kind of like Minecraft, cloney things or clone boats.

1119
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,760
They're doing that kind of like this like Fortnite stuff where, oh, I'm building barricades and stuff.

1120
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,360
And it's like, yeah, I don't know.

1121
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,480
Whatever, whatever.

1122
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,600
See how it plays out.

1123
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,800
They haven't said how many players it supports.

1124
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,280
So we don't know how many players online you can do in this battle royale type game.

1125
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,520
Let's hope it's good.

1126
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,640
Yeah, that's I don't buy into the hype.

1127
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,000
Just see if it's good.

1128
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,880
All right. Well, another big show event that happened this week, maybe if you aren't in like I find there's kind of like two types of gamers.

1129
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,120
There's like the Call of Duty gamers.

1130
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,840
And if you're not really into that, maybe this is your team or maybe you like both and that's cool, too.

1131
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,080
Or maybe you like neither.

1132
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,800
And then I'd wonder what do you what do you play?

1133
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,960
But anyway, the other game I want to talk about is Kingdom Hearts three.

1134
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,240
That's right. The premium showcase event happened this week.

1135
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,760
I didn't I didn't know that because we are invite clearly got lost in the mail.

1136
00:58:54,680 --> 00:59:01,080
But anyway, so apparently the members of the press were allowed to talk about the game on May 18th.

1137
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:07,720
So some of the information started coming out and there were two modes in this demo at the event called Olympus and Toy Box.

1138
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,080
So they got to actually play a little piece of the game.

1139
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,600
You probably saw some Wreck-It Ralph stuff coming out of it.

1140
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,200
I don't know if there was a Wreck-It Ralph mode or if Wreck-It Ralph was a summon because it kind of looked like it was more like a summon to me.

1141
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,040
And that's what people are saying.

1142
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,040
But that's still really cool that there's at least a reference in the game.

1143
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:31,480
But I mean, with all of this kind of showing up right now, doesn't it really seem like it's happening?

1144
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,160
Like Kingdom Hearts is going to finally fucking be this year.

1145
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,680
Like it really I mean, they said we're going to announce the release date next month.

1146
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,440
Well, no, it's going to be E3. No shit.

1147
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,120
E3 is next month. I think it's this year.

1148
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,240
I hope so.

1149
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:49,680
I mean, if they come out and say April 20 or what would it be, March, when's the fiscal year end?

1150
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,200
April, right?

1151
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:50,920
Maybe March.

1152
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,680
So if they came out and said March 2019, that wouldn't be the biggest surprise in the world.

1153
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:05,640
But at least I think we kind of know that, like, OK, this fiscal year is when it's happening, if not the holiday, which would be a great time, a great time because kids and everything that are going to be like Disney, Disney.

1154
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,920
But I mean, who's I mean, even though I say that the kids that are like Disney, Disney.

1155
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,680
How long ago was Kingdom Hearts two at this point, like ten years ago?

1156
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:23,080
The being that they invited the press out, those kids are adults with their own kids, being that we're at this point in the, you know, press media cycle.

1157
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,240
Yeah, my guess is probably around September.

1158
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,640
Yeah, I I kind of think that's the case.

1159
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,120
I think we're going to hear at E3 that this is really happening.

1160
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,920
And so that would mean that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is the game that's going to be bumped back a little.

1161
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,720
Yeah, I heard that was like before 2023.

1162
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,600
OK, but excuse me.

1163
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,600
Tonight's show is going to be a little struggle.

1164
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,280
Thanks for being with me.

1165
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:49,520
I think that was like a tongue in cheek reference that didn't really make the translation very well.

1166
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,080
Like, I think that was one of those self-aware jokes.

1167
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:59,560
I don't think they were serious about the 2023 thing, because by the 20 by 2023, the PlayStation five will be here again.

1168
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,600
Here I am talking about PlayStation five.

1169
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,400
But dude, that's one, two, three, four, five years away.

1170
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,360
No game generation has gone on that long.

1171
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,840
We're going to have a PlayStation five by then.

1172
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,320
So Final Fantasy 7 Remake, it'll be out maybe next year.

1173
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,720
It's not to say that Square can't do two big games for holiday, but I don't think they would.

1174
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,320
I kind of feel like one is this holiday, one is next holiday.

1175
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,000
But also Final Fantasy 7 is episodic.

1176
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:30,280
Maybe they would do the first episode before end of fiscal year or next year and then maybe

1177
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:40,000
episode two, like either that holiday or if that's not enough time, maybe, you know, holiday 2019 or Jesus, no, I guess it'd be holiday 2020.

1178
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,720
I don't think they would put those two games out that close to each other because they would cannibalize each other.

1179
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,400
So I think it would be spread farther.

1180
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,480
You think they would cannibalize each other?

1181
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,200
I don't think so.

1182
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:48,920
Yeah, probably.

1183
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,720
I think both would happen.

1184
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,520
Didn't the Kingdom Heart remakes come out not too long around Final Fantasy 15?

1185
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,600
Yeah, but those are remakes, so.

1186
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1187
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,720
I guess.

1188
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:04,800
S2100Matt says, some of those kids who've played Kingdom Hearts have as many kids now as Kingdom Hearts has had those Decimal Edition games.

1189
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,320
Ain't that the truth?

1190
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,920
I guess that is another thing, too, is that, you know, we knew they were doing this.

1191
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:24,520
Square was kind of trying to refresh our memory with those HD remakes and allow new kids to get exposed to the series, even though, again, as a near 40-year-old, I can't explain the fucking plot of Kingdom Hearts.

1192
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,440
How is a kid going to understand it?

1193
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,920
But whatever.

1194
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,120
Sometimes you don't necessarily need a plot.

1195
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,840
I mean, whatever.

1196
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,160
Tonight in Final Jeopardy, explain the plot.

1197
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,920
Explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts in one word.

1198
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,400
Go.

1199
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:43,920
Stuff.

1200
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,680
Keyblade.

1201
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:45,600
Pretty.

1202
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:46,560
All right.

1203
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,160
Anyway, and as S2100Matt says, it's fan service.

1204
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,000
There is no plot.

1205
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,000
I mean, accurate.

1206
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,600
Like, I'm just gonna sit there and button mash and like, ooh, Tron.

1207
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,200
Ooh, Disney movies are the best.

1208
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,000
I just hope there's easy mode because I am an animation geek.

1209
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,360
And then scream it, uh, uh, I can't wait to say Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, scream at Donald for being an idiot.

1210
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,360
God damn it, Daffy, shut the fuck up.

1211
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,360
I'm Donald.

1212
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,360
That's a terrible, that's the worst thing ever.

1213
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,360
Can you rename Goofy, I guess you can't, because they're kind of, like, protected.

1214
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,360
It would be great if, like, most RPGs, you could rename the characters.

1215
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,360
Your name is Asshole.

1216
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,360
No, I would rename Donald as Daffy, and that would be funny.

1217
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,480
Anyway.

1218
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,120
Have we had the crossover Donald Daffy Duck?

1219
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,120
Uh, no, because it's Disney and Warner Brothers.

1220
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,120
It's never gonna happen.

1221
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,120
It wasn't, like, in a...

1222
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,120
You're thinking, like, Space Jam or something, and that is not, you know.

1223
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,120
I know, I was thinking, like, maybe, uh, Who Framed Roger Rabbit or something like that.

1224
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,120
Mmm, no.

1225
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,120
I don't think so.

1226
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,120
No.

1227
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,120
Good try, though.

1228
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,120
Maybe, I don't know.

1229
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,120
Oh, actually, folks in chat are saying Roger Rabbit.

1230
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,120
It did happen.

1231
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,120
Alright, well, shit.

1232
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,120
Shows how much I know.

1233
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,120
What didn't really happen, I guess, I guess Roger Rabbit was a Warner Brothers movie at the end of the day.

1234
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,760
Wasn't it?

1235
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,760
Well, it didn't really just happen.

1236
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,760
That was when, you know, they were playing nice with each other.

1237
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,760
Interesting.

1238
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,760
Alright.

1239
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,760
The more you know.

1240
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,760
Alright.

1241
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:05,760
Anyway.

1242
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,760
Let's move on.

1243
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,760
Uh, we're gonna do one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.

1244
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,760
So, with games being released, you know, for a new life to begin, some lives must end.

1245
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,760
Right, Loki?

1246
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Yes, it's the circle of life, and Sony is actually...

1247
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,760
It's the circle of life.

1248
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:31,400
Sony is actually acknowledging the fact that the Vita exists, and they're basically letting us know that it exists because they're saying, hey, we're ending production of Vita games.

1249
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
So, yeah.

1250
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,400
Apparently, no more physical Vita games are gonna be released.

1251
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:48,400
I'm not sure how long the digital is gonna continue, but they're saying that apparently the final purchase orders will be entered by February 15, 2019.

1252
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,400
So, yeah, they're ending it, but that's next year.

1253
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,040
Um, but there's not a lot of Vita games coming out.

1254
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:00,040
Well, at the same time, not to be a bitch, but is anybody really surprised at this news?

1255
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,040
No.

1256
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,040
Because there's a part of me that's like, they didn't already end this production.

1257
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,040
Exactly, yeah.

1258
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,040
Like, it's just Sony's support of the Vita has been not good.

1259
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,040
No.

1260
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:20,240
Which is funny, because I've heard this term a lot, that the Switch is the successor to the Vita, and I kinda like that little tongue-in-cheek jab at a, you know, how

1261
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,080
Sony didn't really support the Vita.

1262
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:29,080
And in a way, it's kinda sad, because with the PlayStation TV having been a thing, even though it didn't get supported for very long,

1263
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:36,080
like, you kinda had that system where you could play something on the TV and then pick it up and take it on the go.

1264
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:44,080
Like, if Sony, granted, it was two separate elements, you had to buy the TV, but if Sony had just kinda taken that like a few steps further and really had that faith

1265
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:48,080
and really put that kind of marketing into it, like, they could have beaten Nintendo at their own game.

1266
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,080
They so could.

1267
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:58,920
I mean, it wouldn't, now to be fair, before the chatters yell at me, it wouldn't be as fast as, click, like, pick it up, take, I mean, you would have to like have the cloud save.

1268
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,920
But they kinda started to do that with the whole, god, what the fuck did they call it?

1269
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,920
Um, oh my god, we made fun of it.

1270
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,920
Konami had-

1271
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,920
No, Konami had a different name for it that was like, stupid.

1272
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,920
And it was-

1273
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,920
Uh, R Rising or something, god, what was they, somebody in Terrar form or something like that?

1274
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,920
I don't remember what it was called.

1275
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,920
Yes.

1276
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,760
Stop naming things, Konami.

1277
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,760
Transfarency, thank you, transfarency, that's what was, Dark Tetsuya, Gold Star for you.

1278
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,760
Transfaring.

1279
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,760
Transfaring.

1280
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,760
Get it, cause you're not transferring, you're transfaring.

1281
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
That's stupid.

1282
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:37,760
I hope that's the name of Sony's next handheld, the trans, just kidding, Sony's never gonna make another handheld, but the Sony Transfar.

1283
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,760
They might, I don't know.

1284
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,760
Probably not.

1285
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,760
In Japan, maybe.

1286
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:48,760
Alright, well, rest in peace Vita, but again, if you're in Japan, they're gonna still be making Vita games, because they still acknowledge the Vita in Japan.

1287
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,600
That's right.

1288
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,600
It's still accepted there.

1289
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,600
Alright.

1290
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,600
Uh, let's, uh, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1291
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,600
You guys ready for the classic game of the week?

1292
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,600
Every week we dive into the game involved.

1293
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:06,600
In Dark Sakura, she usually jumps in there and finds a game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this video game this week.

1294
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:11,600
But Dark Sakura's on vacation, so when, you know, mom's away, we're gonna play.

1295
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:16,600
So, last week, I took over and gave you SimCity as the classic game of the week.

1296
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,600
Look out, y'all.

1297
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,600
It's Loki's turn.

1298
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,600
Loki!

1299
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,600
No, but you picked a good one.

1300
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,600
You picked a good one.

1301
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,600
Yeah, I picked a good one.

1302
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:30,600
I, so, well, Rob notes that this is my potential second pick that I, I, I urged him to save his first pick for, like, an anniversary show and convinced Jamie it's a good idea.

1303
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,600
But anyway, let's not talk about that.

1304
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,600
Let's talk about tonight's pick.

1305
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,600
What did you pick for tonight?

1306
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:44,600
Well, being that we were just talking about Call of Duty and Call of Duty just had a World War II, uh, game come out, I thought it'd be great to choose a game that isn't Call of Duty at all.

1307
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:53,600
Um, no, this is actually, um, 2006, this is my favorite game out of both Halo 3 and, well, this is Resistance Fall of Man.

1308
01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:09,600
So, Resistance Fall of Man was a PlayStation 3, like, launch title, and what was kind of cool about it is it took not only the World War II, like, Call of Duty style gameplay, but it also added, like, kind of some alien elements to it as well.

1309
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,600
So, basically, you play this guy, uh, Sergeant Nathan Hale.

1310
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:22,600
He is part of this human resistance that's trying to drive out this mysterious alien-like invasion out of the UK, and the...

1311
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:26,600
I didn't realize the whole beginning of this was narration, so I need to fast-forward to some gameplay here in the clip.

1312
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,600
Sorry.

1313
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,600
Much better. No, that's alright.

1314
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:38,600
Um, yes, and so he, it's the Chimera is what they're called, so these aliens are coming down and trying to take over everything, and it's just a pretty great story-driven game.

1315
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:50,600
And so, um, what was kind of cool about it is, you know, with the traditional World War II weapons that you had, you also got alien weapons that you can use, and some of these had alter-, you know, alt-fires on there as well.

1316
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:59,600
So, you can do this one weapon that, for example, would launch out a tracking beacon, and you can basically curve bullets around the wall.

1317
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:07,600
So, if, like, you know, you tagged one of these enemies with the beacon thing, and the enemy ran behind the wall, the bullets would fall right around the wall to, you know, him.

1318
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,600
Or they had one that was, um, that would actually go through walls, or you could create a shield with it.

1319
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
So, lots of cool stuff.

1320
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:25,600
But, um, you know, it was actually one of my most favorite games on the PlayStation 3, and, uh, one of the series that, they did make a few additional ones.

1321
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,600
They did, uh, Resistance 2 and 3.

1322
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:37,600
Um, also, of course, being that this is one of the systems that had motion controls in their controller, the 6-axis at the time, because it wasn't the DualShock 3, if you remember.

1323
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:45,600
Uh, the 6-axis, they had motion control support ports, so, like, for example, in multiplayer games, if you got tagged with one of the beacons, you could shake your controller to shake it off.

1324
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,600
Or, in this one, they would have, like, these, like, facehugger alien things that would try to attack you, and you could shake those off of you with that.

1325
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,600
Um, so, they're, like, just little neat things like that.

1326
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,600
Um, what else?

1327
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:04,600
Um, multiplayer was kind of fun. They had, you know, offline and online multiplayer for up to 40, uh, players online, which is pretty sweet.

1328
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,600
And then, um, you know, lots of different maps to play as.

1329
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:14,600
Uh, one of the cool things, though, once Resistance 2 was coming out, they actually offered all those maps for free, which is kind of cool.

1330
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:23,600
Um, but yeah, I mean, it was one of these games, I still think this is a game that they should remaster and bring back, because I thought it had a pretty decent storyline.

1331
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:31,600
And, you know, out of the two games, you know, Halo 3 and Resistance, I think Resistance was my favorite, because I had played through both of them.

1332
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:41,600
But, um, and the other thing that's kind of cool about this is, once you do play through the whole game, you can play through it a second time, and there's actually different alien weapons that are in there as well, so you can play quickly through the game.

1333
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:47,600
So, it kind of urges you to repeat playing through the campaign, uh, which is kind of nice.

1334
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:57,600
Something that certain games don't do nowadays, but, um, whatever, it's all a numbers game for these people now.

1335
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:04,600
So, yes, Resistance Fall of Man, my pick for Classic Game of the Week. That's it. I keep it short.

1336
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,600
Alright, no, that's all good. Sometimes, uh, there isn't a lot to say, but I like it.

1337
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:19,600
And, plus, we don't highlight a lot of first-person shooters. I mean, we know that Jamie doesn't play as many of them, but she has, you know, she's talked about her motion sickness and things, so she doesn't get as into those games.

1338
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,600
So, it's good that we can spotlight something, I think, a little bit different.

1339
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:28,600
So, I think sometimes you and I are, you know, Jamie, and I'm not, I would never disrespect her when she's not here. I ain't that stupid.

1340
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:35,600
But, you know, she has her experiences in gaming, and she has a deep knowledge about all these import games that I could never, like, do, right?

1341
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:44,600
But then, for me, I'm like, oh, old Commodore 64 and PC games. That's my bread and butter, right? So, then I'm able to spotlight those, and then you play some different types of games, like first-person shooters.

1342
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
So, I'm glad we could spotlight that.

1343
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,600
Yep.

1344
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,600
Yep. Alright. There it is, your Classic Game of the Week, Resistance Fall of Man.

1345
01:11:50,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Alright, we're gonna take a break, though, and when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Launcher Radio to come, including rapid-fire news, what's coming out in stores, emails, if we have any. I didn't peak.

1346
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:08,600
And then some more big news. We have, for what I believe is a surprise closure, kind of coming out of nowhere. So, not all good news, either.

1347
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:15,600
So, we're gonna get into that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Your calls, too, when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1348
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:22,600
Thank you.

1349
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:32,600
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with our 731st episode already in progress for this May 20th of 2018.

1350
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:41,600
Loki and I here alone in studio tonight as Dark Sakura is extending her vacation a little bit, but she has, it's understandable, she has a good friend from, like, out of the country, I believe, visiting.

1351
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,600
So, you know, you wanna spend every moment with a friend of yours that's-

1352
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,600
When they just bring them along.

1353
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:56,600
I actually thought at one point she was going to do that, but I completely understand that, like, seeing San Francisco is probably, like, more on this, her friend's bucket list than go sit in for five hours on OLR.

1354
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,600
Yeah.

1355
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:02,600
Three hour show, one hour before and after, you know, it's a lot of Sunday nights, so I totally respect that, it's good.

1356
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:09,600
I also wanna give a birthday shout-out, even though I know he doesn't listen to this show, but maybe you all will tweet him and tell him that I was talking shit tonight.

1357
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,600
But I wanna wish a very happy birthday, because he's- he already- technically his birthday passed, but his birthday party was today.

1358
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:23,600
So, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling, also if you used to listen to Hoard House back in the day, Grandpa, he's had his birthday today.

1359
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:33,600
And the theme of his party was, fuck it, I'm 40, which is funny because I'm older than he is, he's not 40, I think today was 38, or this week was maybe 37.

1360
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:44,600
He's not 40, but because we call him Grandpa and older stuff, he's just saying, fuck it, I'm 40. He's like the reverse Bobby Blackwell, he doesn't do the 29, he's just, fuck it, I'm 40.

1361
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:51,600
So, big happy birthday to Captain Matt over at Starboard Power Coupling from your boos here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1362
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,600
Anyway, let's get back into some rapid fire news, Loki.

1363
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:06,600
You may remember we talked a little bit about Walmart leaks, Walmart Canada leaks, and some games that were posted on there prior to their announcements that would be assumed at E3, if they were legit.

1364
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:14,600
Well, maybe there's a little bit of legitimacy to it, because one of those leaked games was Rage 2, and Bethesda was trolling the shit out of them.

1365
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:23,600
And now, they released their gameplay and announcement trailers, so it looks like very Mad Max-ish, as kind of the first Rage game did.

1366
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:29,600
And I think there'll be more coming out during the Bethesda conference in probably a few weeks here.

1367
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,600
So, um, neat.

1368
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:39,600
I got a Battle Royale vibe from it, maybe that's because everybody's doing Battle Royale, but I kinda got a Battle Royale vibe from it.

1369
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,600
But maybe that's just the trailer.

1370
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,600
Just saying. Looks cool, though.

1371
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:56,600
This is interesting. So, you know how they do some of these different speedruns and stuff, where they'll do a length of the past randomizer, where they'll randomize weapons and stuff throughout the different...

1372
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:02,600
I don't watch enough of those, but I have a friend on Twitter who streams on Twitch who does a lot of Final Fantasy 1 shuffle.

1373
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,600
And I always found that fascinating.

1374
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,600
Yeah, so it's really cool.

1375
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,600
This is gonna be quite the thing to see.

1376
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:18,600
I really hope this is something that they run at one of the AGDQ events, either the summer or the regular one.

1377
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:26,600
This is a ROM hack that combines The Legend of Zelda, length of the past, and Super Metroid.

1378
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:34,600
So, the way this works is basically when you go into a dungeon, you end up actually going into...

1379
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:41,600
It goes back and forth between Super Metroid and Legend of Zelda.

1380
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:49,600
And you'll find sometimes Super Metroid power-ups in The Legend of Zelda, so you'll find different things there.

1381
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,600
Or you may find some Zelda stuff in Super Metroid.

1382
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,600
I like those little crossovers, that's cool.

1383
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,600
I just think it sounds really cool.

1384
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,600
So, that I am very much looking forward to seeing how that would work.

1385
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:08,600
But apparently it's a ROM hack that they've done, and some people have run it, but I need to see this.

1386
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,600
It sounds so awesome.

1387
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,600
Yeah, cool.

1388
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,600
Not cool. If you were looking forward to Shenmue 3, it got delayed.

1389
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,600
Well, you know how we feel about delays at this point.

1390
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,600
If a delay is what the game needs to be better, then by all means, delay it.

1391
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,600
So, the game will be launching in 2019 now. It will not be launching in 2018.

1392
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,600
Somebody brought it up earlier when we were talking about Kino Hearts.

1393
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,600
So, if you weren't already aware, Shenmue 3 did officially get pushed back.

1394
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,600
Deep Silver made the announcement this week updating their release window for 2019,

1395
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:41,600
stating, the extra time will be used to polish the quality of the game even further to the high standards it deserves,

1396
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,600
and release the product in the best possible time frame.

1397
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
Thank you.

1398
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,600
Yeah, you know what? Gamers, we don't do that anymore. We don't get angry when games are pushed back anymore.

1399
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:55,600
Because when you don't do that, and you cut corners like that, that's when you lose your single player campaign.

1400
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,600
So, thank you Deep Silver for doing what you had to do to ensure that the game is going to be great.

1401
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:06,600
So, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC worldwide in 2019.

1402
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:12,600
Something you can play a little bit sooner than that is Locke, or Locke Cole, which I forgot he had a full name.

1403
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,600
If you don't remember that name, he is a character in Final Fantasy 6.

1404
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:23,600
Remember, I think people would call him a thief and he'd say treasure hunter, or at least in the English translation of that game.

1405
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,600
Anyway, he is going to be a new character in Dissidia.

1406
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:31,600
Gotta be honest, this was a game I couldn't really get into, but maybe I need to give it a second look.

1407
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,600
Maybe it's one of those things I'll revisit when it comes down a little bit in price.

1408
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:40,600
I was hoping it would be more of a standard fighter, but it was a little weird to me with all the objectives and all these things.

1409
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,600
I had a hard time figuring it out.

1410
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:49,600
But for those that are into it, cool. Play a lot of it, and now you'll get to play it with Locke, as he is the second download character for this game.

1411
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:57,600
Of course, coming from Final Fantasy 6, or 3, if you grew up in the States in the 90s. It was originally Final Fantasy 3.

1412
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:05,600
So, yeah, you'll get to play with him, and he joins Terra as one of the people from Final Fantasy 6.

1413
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,600
And there's some costumes and some swords, you can see about that as well.

1414
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:18,600
Also, they've announced that there will also be four more DLC characters, including a female, a male, a female who was in Dissidia previously, and a male.

1415
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:24,600
So all the characters will be from the latter half of the Final Fantasy series. So, hmm, interesting.

1416
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,600
Anyway, May 17th is when you can check out Locke in Dissidia.

1417
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:34,600
Let's travel around and check out what's coming out a little- actually, May 17th already happened, so you can download them now.

1418
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,600
I did not realize that story was like, it's happening today!

1419
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:43,600
Anyway, let's travel around and check out some other stuff you can pick up really soon this week in stores. Loki.

1420
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,600
Yeah, so starting things out, we have the expansion for Yellow Scrolls Online, Summerset, that's coming out on PC and Mac.

1421
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:55,600
We've got the Mega Man Legacy Collection 1 and 2 on the Nintendo Switch.

1422
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,600
Runner 3 on PC, Mac, and Switch.

1423
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:03,600
Stardew Valley is making its way out to Vita. Oh my god, a Vita game.

1424
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,600
Pretty good one, I bet.

1425
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,600
State of Decay 2 on PC and Xbox One.

1426
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:15,600
Tennis World Tour on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1427
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,600
This is cool.

1428
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,600
Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, that game we talked about last week, the kind of retro-

1429
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,600
Oh yeah, like the major one?

1430
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,600
That's coming out on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Vita.

1431
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,600
Cool.

1432
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:35,600
We've got Dylan's Dead Heat Breakers on 3DS, remember that tower defense armadillo game that Nintendo has?

1433
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,600
Yes.

1434
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:47,600
And it looks like some, I'm assuming these are remasters, Persona 3 Dancing Moon Night, Persona 4 Dancing All Night, and Persona 5 Dancing Star Night.

1435
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:55,600
PlayStation 4 and Vita on 3 and 5, and number 4 is getting just the PlayStation 4 release, and those are all rhythm games.

1436
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:11,600
Punch Club on the Switch, and we've got a few more games, looks like 7 Scarlet on the Vita, Dark Souls Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1437
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:21,600
Detroit Become Human on PlayStation 4, and last but not least, Sudden Strike 4 European Battlefields Edition on Xbox One.

1438
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,600
That's it.

1439
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,600
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.

1440
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:35,600
I know they had a big holiday week recently, but I think things are slowing down a little bit, including PlayStation 4.

1441
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,600
Excuse me, things are ramping up again, because the holidays have slowed down.

1442
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,600
PlayStation 4, in fact, getting a few releases this week.

1443
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:45,600
I did not know this, that Persona 3 and Persona 5 dancing games are on their way to the PlayStation 4.

1444
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,600
How did I not know that?

1445
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,600
I just mentioned them.

1446
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,600
Oh, well, yeah, there you go.

1447
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,600
Well, yeah, they're coming out here in the US.

1448
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,600
I just, when I saw this earlier, I was like, I didn't even know these games were coming, but there you go.

1449
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,600
So they're also released in Japan, same thing as Loki just mentioned for here.

1450
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,600
The Dark Souls remaster, also making its way to Japan this coming week on May 24th.

1451
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:07,600
As well as a game called Mikagame Sumika no Seifuku Katsudo comes out this week.

1452
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,600
And Undertale gets its release in Japan, obviously on the PlayStation 4, it's a pretty big deal.

1453
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,600
It doesn't stop there, though.

1454
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:19,600
We also have the Karu Maruka Circle in regular and limited edition.

1455
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,600
And Detroit Become Human gets its Japanese release in parity with the US release.

1456
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,600
That is very soon. I'm actually really excited to check that out.

1457
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,600
I hope I have the time to do that.

1458
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,600
And then I close my list without looking at the Switch or the 3DS.

1459
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,600
So bear with me a minute while I bring it back up.

1460
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,600
They don't release games on anything but the PlayStation 4 over there.

1461
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,600
It's all beta over there.

1462
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,600
It's all beta. Actually, you remind me to check to see if there is a beta.

1463
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:48,600
Believe it or not, yes, Undertale on the Vita, the Persona dancing games also on the Vita.

1464
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,600
Vita is still super well supported over there.

1465
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,600
So those games all out on the Vita.

1466
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
And let's check out the Switch real quick.

1467
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,600
Yeah, the Switch is getting the Rockman Classics 1 and 2, hits Japan this week.

1468
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,600
Obviously that is Mega Man here.

1469
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,600
And then Rabbit Cross Labyrinth Puzzle Out Stories, also happening on the Switch.

1470
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,600
And Urban Trial Playground, also on the Switch this week.

1471
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:15,600
As well as a special micro SD card that's branded for Nintendo that is 256 gigs in case you're downloading all this stuff.

1472
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,600
As far as the DS goes though, it's a little quieter over there.

1473
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:24,600
Nothing to announce. I think that is probably ramping down with the exception of that Luigi game in like 2019.

1474
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,600
How about the UK, Loki?

1475
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:31,600
We've got Space Hulk Deathwing Edition, or Deathwing Enhanced Edition.

1476
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,600
That's coming out on PlayStation 4.

1477
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,600
State of Decay 2 on Xbox One.

1478
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:43,600
Tennis World Tour on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, the Switch and PC.

1479
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,600
Detroit Become Human on PlayStation 4.

1480
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,600
Dark Souls Remastered on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

1481
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,600
And that's it.

1482
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,600
Alright, we're gonna get to the mailbag.

1483
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,600
You guys send us emails and we read them.

1484
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,600
Even when you don't send us many emails, we'll still go in there and read them.

1485
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,600
If you want to send us an email in the future, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send an email.

1486
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,600
Our first and only email tonight from Robert M.

1487
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,600
Hey, you know what, Robert M. always there to email us when none of y'all else will.

1488
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,600
So thanks Robert M. who says in the subject line, bats.

1489
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,600
And then it's in the email saying,

1490
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:27,600
Just thinking about bats as I tend to do and just wondering besides games that use them as basic enemies,

1491
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,600
such as the Swoopers of Super Mario World and the Bubble Bats of Mega Man,

1492
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,600
what other games have bats as major characters?

1493
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:40,600
The only ones that come to mind are Sunsoft's Arrow the Acrobat,

1494
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Rogue the Bat from Sonic Adventure 2, I believe,

1495
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,600
and Laylee from Yooka Laylee by Playtronic.

1496
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,600
So Robert M. wants us to talk about video game bats.

1497
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,600
Driving us batty tonight.

1498
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,600
Well, you know the first thing that came to my mind, Robert M.

1499
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,600
Batman.

1500
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,600
He's technically not a bat.

1501
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,600
Now, man, bat.

1502
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,600
He's a man bat.

1503
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,600
I'm sorry, that's where my brain went.

1504
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,600
I was like Batman because those games weren't bats.

1505
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,600
Pokemon, sort of.

1506
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,600
Okay, yeah, there's bat-like characters in Pokemon.

1507
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,600
I mean, they're not supposed to be technically bats.

1508
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,600
They're other bat-like equivalents.

1509
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,600
They're bats.

1510
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,600
They're bats, yeah.

1511
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,600
How about you guys in chat?

1512
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,600
What do you guys know over at live.vognetwork.com?

1513
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,600
What do you guys think?

1514
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:30,600
Because I'm having a hard time thinking about other bat enemies in video games.

1515
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,600
Didn't Legend of the Mystical Ninja have some?

1516
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,600
Castlevania had a bat.

1517
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,600
Oh, yeah, Castlevania.

1518
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,600
That's a great answer.

1519
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,600
That's a great answer.

1520
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,600
Castlevania, of course.

1521
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,600
Like the first boss.

1522
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,600
Like in every Castlevania game, that big vampire bat is always the first boss.

1523
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,600
Great answer.

1524
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,600
Or Zelda.

1525
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,600
Great answer.

1526
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,600
Zelda, that's right.

1527
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,600
That's right.

1528
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,600
There was a bat monster in Zelda as well.

1529
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,600
Adventures of Link.

1530
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,600
Let's see.

1531
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,600
Go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1532
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,600
See a Tiberius.

1533
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,600
Just Michael Morbius from Spider-Man who crosses with a bat.

1534
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:03,600
Dartitsuya says La Mulana has bats, but those are probably lifted from Castlevania.

1535
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
Good answer there as well.

1536
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:15,600
And Tigerclaw links us to the giant bomb wiki who actually has an article on list of bat characters.

1537
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,600
So how about that?

1538
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,600
There really is an article.

1539
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,600
Tigerclaw says, fuck this game.

1540
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:26,600
I have the answer right here.

1541
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,600
I'm kind of laughing at how funny that is.

1542
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,600
They list Batman, by the way.

1543
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,600
Just so we're clear, Loki.

1544
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,600
They list Batman.

1545
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,600
Batman is a bat character in a game.

1546
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,600
Let's see.

1547
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,600
I'm trying to see if there's any of these.

1548
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,600
A beautiful Joe had Charles III, a bat creature in that game.

1549
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,600
I don't know why they say Conker is a bat.

1550
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,600
Why is Conker in this list?

1551
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,600
Conker is not a bat.

1552
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,600
Demon Hunter?

1553
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,600
Well, the Demon Hunter has a bat in Diablo III.

1554
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,600
I guess the Demon Hunter does have a bat pet she can have with her.

1555
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,600
So there is that.

1556
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,600
Kirby O'Neil, the father of April O'Neil.

1557
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,600
I guess was a bat.

1558
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,600
Is that a thing that happened in Ninja Turtles?

1559
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,600
I had no idea.

1560
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,600
So there you go.

1561
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,600
Wingnut, also from Ninja Turtles, a character in the TMNT universe.

1562
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,600
So there you go.

1563
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,600
JD says Barbara the Bat was in Super Smash Brothers.

1564
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,600
And JD says this list needs a fact check.

1565
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,600
Okay, OLR.

1566
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,600
For Robert M., you guys need to get the giant bomb wiki updated.

1567
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:28,600
We need an accurate perception of bats in video games.

1568
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,600
Thank you for the email.

1569

1570
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,600
At first I thought we were talking about baseball bats.

1571
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,600
And I was like, okay, well, lots of games with baseball bats.

1572
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,600
You would think emails like that drive me crazy.

1573
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,600
But I appreciate the emails that are like,

1574
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,600
I had a random fucking thought today, OLR.

1575
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,600
And I want to share it with you.

1576
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,600
We never do that on this show.

1577
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,600
I know. We never get into tangents.

1578
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,600
I love it.

1579
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1580
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,600
if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1581
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,600
In the meantime, Loki, why don't we get to it?

1582
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,600
Let's talk about closures. That's unfortunate.

1583
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,600
Boss Key Games has decided to shut down.

1584
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,600
So Boss Key Games, if you're not familiar,

1585
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,600
is Cliff Boot.

1586
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,600
I can't talk because I just ate a bunch of salsa

1587
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,600
and my mouth's on fire.

1588
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,600
Cliff Bleszinski's software company.

1589
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,600
Just do what I do and always say Cliffy B.

1590
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,600
Cliffy B. There you go.

1591
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,600
Cliffy B's company.

1592
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,600
Even though he's older now, so he's Cliff.

1593
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,600
Clifford B.

1594
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,600
No, I don't think he's Clifford. He's just Cliff.

1595
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,600
Just like you don't call me Robert.

1596
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,600
Mr. Zinski.

1597
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,600
B. Zinski.

1598
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,600
He went and formed the company after he left Epic Games.

1599
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:48,600
They were really trying to push out a couple games with it.

1600
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,600
One, of course, was Lawbreakers,

1601
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,600
which didn't quite take off.

1602
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,600
Of course, then, the last second,

1603
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,600
they tried to come out with a Battle Royale-type game,

1604
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,600
Radical Heights,

1605
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,600
which also didn't really seem to gain traction.

1606
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,600
Unfortunately, because of all this,

1607
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,600
they've decided to just shut it all down.

1608
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,600
Radical Heights is going to stay online

1609
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,600
for probably a little bit longer,

1610
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,600
but then that's going to be closed down as well.

1611
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,600
As of today, Boss Key Productions is effectively no more.

1612
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,600
Four years ago, I set out to make world-class video game studio

1613
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,600
and I hired some of the best talent in the video game industry,

1614
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,600
worked tirelessly to produce quality products,

1615
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,600
and while we had our ups and downs,

1616
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,600
I'd like to think we had fun doing it.

1617
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,600
Lawbreakers was a great game

1618
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,600
that unfortunately failed to gain traction,

1619
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,600
and in a last-ditch attempt,

1620
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,600
we scrambled to do our take

1621
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,600
on a huge Battle Royale genre with Radical Heights,

1622
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,600
which was well-received.

1623
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,600
However, it was a little too long.

1624
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,600
As for today, I'm going to take some time off and reflect.

1625
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,600
I need to focus on myself and my family,

1626
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:58,600
as well as my Aussie, Teddy,

1627
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,600
who is slowly fading from us.

1628
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,600
Video games will forever be a part of who I am,

1629
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,600
and I hope to make something new again some days.

1630
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,600
However, I need to withdraw and take this time.

1631
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,600
To those who have supported myself

1632
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,600
and the studio for the last few years,

1633
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,600
thank you from the bottom of my heart

1634
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,600
and everyone who came to work for me.

1635
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,600
Please note that the servers for Radical Heights

1636
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,600
will remain up for the near future.

1637
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,600
Thanks again, Cliff.

1638
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,600
I'm not going to talk shit about Clifford

1639
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,600
because I have nothing but respect for somebody who says,

1640
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,600
you know what, I'm going to take a little time away

1641
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,600
to go work on family stuff and focus on these other things.

1642
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,600
I think that's great, and I wish him well with all that stuff.

1643
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,600
I am a bit surprised, though,

1644
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,600
at how sudden this kind of feels.

1645
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,600
I didn't even...

1646
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,600
Maybe this is part of the problem.

1647
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,600
Granted, I don't play these games.

1648
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,600
I didn't even realize Radical Heights was out.

1649
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,600
It just came out.

1650
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,600
That's what I thought.

1651
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,600
It was in early access or something like that.

1652
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,600
It was right around its infancy.

1653
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,600
So it's surprising to me that it's this sudden.

1654
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,600
Cliff had to walk away because of family issues.

1655
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,600
Again, I respect that.

1656
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,600
But the entire studio closing,

1657
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,600
that just seems really big.

1658
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,600
But maybe the money, the funding,

1659
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,600
he kind of fesses up to it in there saying

1660
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,600
maybe it was just too little, too late.

1661
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,600
Key word there, they couldn't get it out fast enough

1662
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,600
and the money well is dry.

1663
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,600
Yeah. It's unfortunate.

1664
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,600
Sad, but a reality about games.

1665
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,600
It's unfortunate because they were trying to take on popular genres.

1666
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,600
They had the whole,

1667
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,600
we're taking on Overwatch with Lawbreakers,

1668
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,600
which is a somewhat unique game.

1669
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,600
But still, it just didn't have the character

1670
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,600
that really brought people to it.

1671
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,600
And then Radical Heights,

1672
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,600
it was interesting to see it.

1673
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,600
Neat take on the idea,

1674
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,600
but it was just a little too late.

1675
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,600
DungeonBuster in chat says

1676
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,600
at live.vognetwork.com,

1677
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,600
if I recall correctly, one of the leads tweeted

1678
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,600
that he learned about the company being closed

1679
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,600
from his 8-year-old daughter who showed him the news online.

1680
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,600
She asked him if he was going to be okay now

1681
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,600
that he was losing his job.

1682
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,600
Radical Heights was very prototyped.

1683
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,600
They were testing the waters with it.

1684
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,600
It was largely unfinished, but playable.

1685
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,600
That's a bummer, but you know what?

1686
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,600
That kind of sudden closure news

1687
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,600
is not particularly unique

1688
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,600
to the gaming industry.

1689
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,600
I learned at a previous employer,

1690
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,600
not my current one, but a previous employer,

1691
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,600
I learned that layoffs were happening

1692
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,600
and there was a financial disclosure

1693
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,600
that happened that morning

1694
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,600
before they brought employees into a meeting.

1695
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,600
So we were all pretty nervous

1696
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,600
for a good chunk of the day

1697
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,600
because we knew it was coming.

1698
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,600
This isn't something that's unique

1699
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,600
to the games industry,

1700
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,600
but it's not a good look.

1701
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,600
But, anyhow.

1702
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,600
Well, that's really unfortunate

1703
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,600
for those developers.

1704
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,600
I will say, though,

1705
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,600
a lot of other game industry people

1706
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,600
are doing really good to the people there.

1707
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,600
Blizzard Careers is out there

1708
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,600
tweeting people right away.

1709
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,600
We're looking for people

1710
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,600
because I'm sure they've got some unannounced things

1711
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,600
they're working on.

1712
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,600
God, I hope one of them is Diablo IV.

1713
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,600
Ooh, I can't wait for Blizzard's take

1714
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,600
on the Battle Royale genre.

1715
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,600
Although, I guess they already have Overwatch.

1716
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,600
I don't know if I'm necessarily saying

1717
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,600
they need to bring Battle Royale to Overwatch.

1718
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,600
I don't think everybody needs to do Battle Royale.

1719
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,600
No, they don't.

1720
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,600
I just want them to do Diablo IV

1721
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,600
since it doesn't seem like there's going to be

1722
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,600
another expansion for III at this point.

1723
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,600
So there you go.

1724
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,600
Let's talk about Super Smash Bros.

1725
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,600
I know a lot of you are waiting for E3

1726
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,600
for just this game.

1727
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,600
And I know we don't have a ton of people

1728
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,600
overseas that listen to this show,

1729
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,600
but for those that are over in Japan,

1730
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,600
Super Smash Bros. is going to be playable

1731
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,600
at various events across Japan

1732
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,600
around the same time as E3.

1733
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,600
So that's pretty cool.

1734
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,600
If you're in Japan and you feel like,

1735
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,600
oh, I want to play the new Smash 2,

1736
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,600
I don't want to have to go all the way

1737
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,600
to the States to do it, the good news is

1738
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,600
that you're going to be able to do that.

1739
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,600
So on June 17th at the Rage 2018 Summer,

1740
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,600
you can do that there, or the

1741
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,600
Jisai World Hobby Fair on June 23rd and 24th,

1742
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,600
and the Jump Victory Carnival

1743
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,600
in both Tokyo and Osaka

1744
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,600
on July 16th and July 22nd,

1745
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,600
you will be able to play the game in Japan.

1746
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,600
So that's pretty cool.

1747
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,600
They're going to unveil it there.

1748
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,600
It's obvious that this game is getting its big unveiling

1749
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,600
at E3, and it's going to be playable at E3,

1750
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,600
and Nintendo not really keeping

1751
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,600
it a secret either, because they are going to be

1752
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,600
doing, get this, ticket reservations

1753
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,600
this year.

1754
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Oh, fuck that bullshit.

1755
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,600
Finally, a fucking fast pass

1756
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,600
system at E3. Of course, that just means

1757
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,600
all those people are going to be out on the floor,

1758
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,600
and I don't know if they're going to be able to handle that,

1759
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,600
but that's ESA's problem.

1760
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,600
Anyway, E3 attendees, Nintendo

1761
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,600
announced, will be able to reserve play slots

1762
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,600
ahead of time for Super Smash Brothers

1763
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,600
with the purpose of having the fans

1764
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,600
get a faster, smoother experience.

1765
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,600
You're going to be able to reserve a ticket to play against people

1766
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,600
casually for fun, or play

1767
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,600
for glory in a competitive elimination

1768
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,600
match. You will get an

1769
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,600
email from E3 organizers

1770
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,600
by June 5th if you register by

1771
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,600
May 31st with details about

1772
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,600
how to reserve one electronic ticket

1773
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,600
for this. This is pretty, so

1774
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,600
official E3, this is through.

1775
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,600
Nintendo is ticketing through official E3. That's pretty big.

1776
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,600
You have to play the game,

1777
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,600
you have to sign up ahead of time.

1778
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,600
No on-site registration will be available.

1779
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,600
You'll get a ticket as a QR code

1780
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,600
and more information

1781
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,600
at E3.Nintendo.com

1782
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,600
Reservations not taken for any

1783
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,600
other games at Nintendo's booth.

1784
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,600
This is only their E ticket

1785
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,600
ride for the year, which is Super Smash Brothers.

1786
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,600
How long before they appear on eBay?

1787
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,600
Who knows? Who knows? Yeah, I'm sure

1788
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,600
there's some E3 attendees who have no interest

1789
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,600
in seeing this, but it's

1790
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,600
interesting that they are doing it this way.

1791
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,600
The part of me that stood in a line

1792
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,600
for a very long time to see things

1793
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,600
like the DS

1794
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,600
when that was first announced and some of the other like

1795
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,600
I didn't have to stand in line to the Wii.

1796
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,600
Thanks for a buddy of mine, who by the way

1797
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,600
well, I shouldn't talk about it.

1798
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,600
But anyway, he knows who he is

1799
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,600
and thank you very much for it.

1800
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,600
He helped me get to see the Wii with

1801
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,600
getting to skip that line and so forth.

1802
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,600
And you know, other

1803
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,600
Nintendo stuff, 3DS

1804
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,600
we stood in a big line for that too, so

1805
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,600
it's nice that people are going to be able to kind of like

1806
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,600
skip it big time this year to check out

1807
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,600
Super Smash Brothers, and hopefully it runs smooth.

1808
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,600
Hopefully it runs smooth, but the fact

1809
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,600
that they're not doing any on-site, that's pretty good.

1810
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,600
Because I remember when Sony

1811
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,600
did the VR thing, you had to kind of like go

1812
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,600
run and get a ticket, and it was obviously

1813
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,600
a clusterfuck straight to Sony's booth

1814
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,600
that morning, but it worked out

1815
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,600
pretty well. You didn't have to stand around all day

1816
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,600
to get to try VR, so.

1817
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,600
Alright, so

1818
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,600
any interest in going to E3, Loki?

1819
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,600
Nope. Yeah, I think they'll take that

1820
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,600
Super Smash Brothers thing on the road here in the

1821
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,600
US too. They're going to be really

1822
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,600
pushing that before the game comes out. It's very clear

1823
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,600
that that is going to be Nintendo's bread and butter for the holidays.

1824
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,600
And how they plan to

1825
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,600
Just put out a demo.

1826
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,600
Maybe they will. Who knows?

1827
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,600
Alright, moving on, Loki.

1828
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,600
Alright, so this is interesting.

1829
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,600
There's a new Halo game soon.

1830
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,600
Coming to arcades.

1831
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,600
Yes, so

1832
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,600
Microsoft announced Halo Fire Team

1833
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,600
Raven. It's a light gun shooter

1834
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,600
game that's coming to arcades.

1835
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,600
And which arcades might you ask?

1836
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,600
Dave and Busters, this

1837
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,600
summer.

1838
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,600
So check it out. Will the Halo

1839
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,600
arcade game give tickets?

1840
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,600
I don't know. Every frag

1841
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,600
is a ticket, maybe?

1842
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,600
It looks interesting though.

1843
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,600
It reminds me of like the

1844
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,600
Glaxion type game.

1845
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,600
It almost looks like it's in a booth

1846
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,600
with two big giant screens.

1847
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,600
And that's done by

1848
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,600
Raw Thrills

1849
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,600
and Play Mechanic.

1850
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,600
It actually looks exactly like that.

1851
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,600
Even the way the guns are set up

1852
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,600
and everything.

1853
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,600
Very much like that.

1854
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,600
Like a Glaxion game.

1855
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,600
I'll play it.

1856
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,600
Do you think Halo 6 is the big E3 announcement for

1857
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,600
Microsoft this year?

1858
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,600
I don't know. I thought it was going to be Gears of War.

1859
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,600
Maybe. And so which game is getting the

1860
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,600
battle royale mode first?

1861
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,600
You know it's coming.

1862
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,600
You know it's coming.

1863
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,600
Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

1864
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,600
it's another one of those railgun shooters.

1865
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,600
Which is the only way you can do a Halo arcade game.

1866
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,600
I like railgun shooters in arcades.

1867
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,600
Yeah, I like railgun shooters in arcades too.

1868
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,600
How's my bread and butter? It would be kind of fun

1869
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,600
though if they had like four of these together and you could

1870
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,600
like frag other people. But I understand that's

1871
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,600
a difficult arcade experience in a lot of

1872
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,600
real estate. Especially in a small

1873
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,600
ass Dave and Busters like the one we have here.

1874
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,600
Which is, sorry not

1875
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,600
sorry, a joke. The one

1876
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,600
here in town is, it's like the smallest,

1877
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,600
they said it's the smallest one in the entire chain next to

1878
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,600
Times Square. Lucky us. I know, right?

1879
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,600
And even, I went to the one in Times Square

1880
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,600
and I was more impressed with that one.

1881
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,600
Sorry not sorry.

1882
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,600
Couldn't they make ours like two story or something

1883
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,600
like that? Multiple stories. You would have thought.

1884
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,600
Have like, you know, space.

1885
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,600
It's going to be interesting when round one opens up across

1886
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,600
the street next year. How about we just bulldoze the

1887
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,600
whole Sunrise Mall and put a big Dave and Busters

1888
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,600
in there? Watch your words

1889
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,600
because I think that's not to get too much into local

1890
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,600
politics, but I really don't see how that mall stays

1891
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,600
around much longer. It's not. It's

1892
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,600
clearly not and well

1893
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,600
to get into local politics,

1894
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,600
my wife and I would follow

1895
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,600
a local Facebook group around

1896
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,600
here and there's one of the planners for

1897
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,600
the area is in there and they talk about

1898
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,600
like different proposals for Sunrise Mall. That thing is

1899
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,600
not staying around very long.

1900
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,600
I went there the other day and like

1901
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,600
half the restaurants are gone out of the food court.

1902
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,600
Shears is closing down soon.

1903
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,600
So I mean there's

1904
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,600
nothing anchoring that there. You know

1905
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,600
they might have more success and I will

1906
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,600
tie this to video games. Stay tuned.

1907
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,600
They may have more success as an event

1908
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,600
center because they do that tennis thing

1909
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,600
was there like some summers and that was

1910
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,600
like a circus.

1911
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,600
They had like circuses, carnivals. So I bet that place

1912
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,600
would have a lot more success as an event space which

1913
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,600
could include and this is one thing they've been talking

1914
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,600
about that more shopping malls are getting into

1915
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,600
is like e-gaming and e-sports hosting.

1916
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,600
That would be very interesting.

1917
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,600
It would be neat. Yeah if like the old Sears

1918
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,600
at Sunrise Mall became like an e-sports arena

1919
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,600
that mall might be kind of interesting.

1920
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,600
I just

1921
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,600
don't know what they're going to do. Who knows.

1922
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,600
Alright.

1923
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,600
Excuse me guys.

1924
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,600
Let's move on to a story

1925
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,600
on Star Fox. This is a rumor

1926
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,600
big rumor but as E3

1927
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,600
approaches we're going to have a lot of these so

1928
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,600
bear with us. But what would you all think

1929
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,600
if this were true? Because

1930
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,600
sources say that Retro

1931
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,600
Studios is working on Star Fox

1932
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,600
Racing.

1933
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,600
No. Yeah Retro Studios apparently this is

1934
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,600
their next project.

1935
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,600
It's a Star Fox racing game.

1936
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,600
And this originally came from Eurogamer

1937
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,600
who has had some leaks in the

1938
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,600
past. Some other bullets

1939
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,600
that have come out about the game. It's not

1940
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,600
like F-Zero.

1941
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,600
Star Fox Grand Prix is a tentative title.

1942
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,600
It's based on an air wing

1943
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,600
which is how it's not F-Zero.

1944
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,600
It's a mix between Star Fox and

1945
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,600
racing. You shoot enemies to move forward

1946
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,600
and get combos. You can shoot

1947
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,600
other players too. It's a big

1948
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,600
hub area where you can interact with the Star Fox

1949
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,600
characters. Retro

1950
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,600
is considering cameos like Donkey Kong

1951
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,600
maybe 2019

1952
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,600
or 2018. I know.

1953
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,600
They can throw Diddy Kong in there.

1954
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,600
Why not? Because you know Diddy

1955
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,600
Kong racing would have been more

1956
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,600
apt as a racing game than

1957
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,600
you know what

1958
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,600
Star Fox racing is. You know

1959
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,600
I would rather see an F-Zero but I

1960
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,600
also understand that I may need to let that go

1961
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,600
a little bit. I'm open

1962
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,600
to the idea of a Star Fox racing game

1963
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,600
but it's all about how does it play. Now

1964
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,600
if it's kind of making

1965
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,600
it's niche on like a competitive racing

1966
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,600
game where like the more you destroy other

1967
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,600
people the more you move faster.

1968
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,600
It sounds

1969
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,600
a little bit like Wipeout in a way maybe.

1970
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,600
There's been games like that I think.

1971
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,600
Yeah. So I'm

1972
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,600
open to it and I realize that Mario

1973
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,600
Kart is a huge game

1974
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,600
on the Switch and was great

1975
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,600
for Wii U2. So I think

1976
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,600
maybe Nintendo wants to duplicate that success

1977
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,600
without necessarily doing Mario Kart 9

1978
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,600
right now. And do Diddy Kong racing. You don't need

1979
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,600
to add more racing games. Or F-Zero

1980
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,600
Oh yeah F-Zero. Hey yeah

1981
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,600
everybody's asking for F-Zero

1982
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,600
are one of our big racing games

1983
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,600
that we have. Let's make an additional

1984
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,600
racing game that no one's going to have interest

1985
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,600
in instead. Dark Tetsuya says

1986
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,600
there is another rumor that supposedly says

1987
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,600
F-Zero SX for Switch

1988
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,600
but I don't know if I buy it or not.

1989
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,600
You know again now we're getting into rumors

1990
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,600
that are really out there. I would love it if it's true.

1991
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,600
Maybe it's a type of revival

1992
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,600
of F-Zero GX and they're

1993
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,600
going to just kind of like port it to Switch

1994
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,600
and maybe put a few more tracks.

1995
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,600
I'd be down. I'd be down. I would.

1996
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,600
You know what if you could like play it online

1997
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,600
smoothly and everything

1998
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,600
like actually I'd be kind of down.

1999
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,600
I would check that out.

2000
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,600
You know right now Fast Racing Neo kind of has to

2001
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,600
fill that void. But F-Zero is

2002
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,600
unique in what it is. And Fast Racing has the whole

2003
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,600
like polarizing thing like

2004
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,600
Ikaruga kind of does when you race. So it's a little

2005
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,600
bit different than an F-Zero game feels.

2006
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,600
But I would be okay

2007
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,600
if a new F-Zero game is

2008
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,600
like basically a GX remaster

2009
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,600
so they can do it on the cheap. And you know

2010
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,600
that game is I think

2011
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,600
horribly underlooked by a lot of people.

2012
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,600
So I'm all for giving it a second chance with a newer

2013
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,600
Nintendo generation.

2014
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,600
For sure. Just a couple more

2015
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,600
stories and then we'll probably open up the Skype line

2016
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,600
for a brief bit but I am

2017
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,600
kind of dragging here towards the end. So

2018
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,600
a couple more stories here Loki. Take it away.

2019
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,600
And once again just as I mentioned

2020
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,600
when we were talking to Bobby.

2021
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,600
Microsoft slowly has been chipping

2022
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,600
away at PlayStation as far as

2023
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,600
the things it does for

2024
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,600
you know it's community

2025
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,600
and like supporting

2026
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,600
things that people want like backwards compatibility

2027
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,600
or different audio

2028
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,600
modes you know for Dolby Atmos

2029
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:43,600
or you know 4K

2030
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,600
video

2031
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,600
playback in you know

2032
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,600
4K Blu-rays and stuff like that.

2033
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,600
So now to add on top of that

2034
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,600
you know they came out with

2035
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,600
a new control system specifically

2036
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,600
for those with

2037
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,600
people with limited mobility.

2038
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,600
So this new controller

2039
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,600
looks really strange

2040
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,600
but you know with it

2041
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,600
they have different add-ons that you can

2042
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,600
add to allow for all sorts of

2043
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,600
different options for mobility.

2044
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,600
So for example if

2045
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,600
you know you can add giant buttons

2046
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,600
you can customize

2047
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,600
it with certain you know mouthpieces

2048
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,600
if you can only use your mouth to

2049
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,600
move stuff or

2050
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,600
I mean they just have so many options

2051
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,600
to basically map stuff out.

2052
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,600
You can remap everything.

2053
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,600
It looks pretty

2054
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,600
awesome. It's going to be out later this year for $100.

2055
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,600
But

2056
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,600
I mean just a very

2057
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,600
interesting thing to support

2058
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,600
you know which

2059
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,600
probably not a huge large demographic

2060
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,600
of people playing

2061
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,600
you know games but it's

2062
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,600
important though and the fact that they see

2063
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,600
that it's important and

2064
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,600
you know address it is far

2065
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,600
and away better than some other companies.

2066
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,600
All right. Yeah I love that

2067
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,600
they're like doing this.

2068
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,600
I love that this is like a thing that they're putting out there.

2069
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,600
I'm all about more accessibility and getting more people

2070
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,600
gaming and if that has to be

2071
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,600
Xbox's like niche or whatever to

2072
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,600
really like you know differentiate it from

2073
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,600
what Sony is doing and what others are doing.

2074
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,600
Cool. You know I would hope

2075
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,600
that maybe they're going to set something that Sony

2076
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,600
and Nintendo will want to copy

2077
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,600
and I think

2078
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,600
I think there have been great advocates

2079
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,600
in the gaming industry with companies like

2080
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,600
Ablegamer which by the way

2081
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,600
is who I use my Amazon smile with.

2082
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,600
Just you know a free shout out for Ablegamer

2083
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,600
because I think it's great what they're doing is that they do

2084
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,600
advocate and they do kind of like remind people

2085
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,600
because you know I don't want to give Sony

2086
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,600
shit or Nintendo's shit either because I feel like

2087
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,600
we're more aware of those type of things now

2088
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,600
because like you know Sony the fact that you can

2089
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,600
in the PlayStation 4 operating system you

2090
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,600
can like natively do whatever button swap you want

2091
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,600
so games don't have to put it in themselves

2092
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,600
like that's a step that's progress that lets a few

2093
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,600
more be able to do something they couldn't before

2094
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,600
but this this whole device that Microsoft's

2095
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,600
doing really takes it one step further.

2096
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,600
I think it would be even more awesome if this thing

2097
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,600
were universal and you could use it on any system

2098
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,600
I realize that gets into a little bit

2099
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,600
crazy fan went territory but I mean

2100
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,600
yeah to be fair it is a Microsoft

2101
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,600
controller and Microsoft

2102
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,600
controllers yeah are usually compatible with PC

2103
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,600
so I mean that's

2104
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,600
still pretty good. Yeah that is very good.

2105
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,600
Sorry that doesn't support

2106
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,600
Sony systems oh well yeah

2107
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,600
too bad. Do you see yourself

2108
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,600
picking one up I mean I guess there's no

2109
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,600
there's not really a reason for you or me to

2110
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,600
own this and I hope you know again

2111
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,600
to shout out

2112
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,600
Bobby a little bit because the reality is I know you

2113
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,600
podcasters some of you may listen some of

2114
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,600
you may not but for our live folks

2115
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,600
they always you know almost always if they're

2116
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,600
here early enough they hear him for an hour before

2117
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,600
we're on so he kind of got into this a little

2118
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,600
bit talking about you know he doesn't and Bobby

2119
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,600
if I misquote you feel free to correct me as you would

2120
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,600
anyway but like when it comes to speed

2121
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,600
running and things you wouldn't want somebody to be

2122
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,600
like look I can speed run a game because I use this

2123
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,600
controller you don't want this to like be a thing

2124
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,600
that's like you

2125
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,600
know like oh it's a cool new thing

2126
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,600
to use this controller because it lets you do games faster

2127
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,600
it lets you like exploit things or whatever

2128
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,600
I don't think that would be the case I

2129
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,600
would hope not either but you know

2130
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,600
it's a little different

2131
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,600
when somebody wants to say

2132
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,600
use the dance pad

2133
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,600
to play Mario Brothers

2134
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,600
or something which yes you could do because GameCube

2135
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,600
had a DDR game you know it's a little different

2136
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,600
from the like crazy crossovers

2137
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,600
but something like this that's really for accessibility

2138
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,600
kind of hopefully sort of like

2139
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,600
stays

2140
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,600
as something for

2141
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,600
that audience to really be able to use

2142
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,600
for them and celebrate you know what I mean

2143
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,600
so alright

2144
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,600
let's see SheHulk

2145
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,600
in chat says the elite controller makes

2146
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,600
gaming much easier a definite

2147
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,600
advantage you know I

2148
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,600
always forget about those elite controllers but they are

2149
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,600
they are something they are very nice pieces

2150
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,600
of hardware I mean I haven't dropped the

2151
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,600
money on one because I just don't do quite enough

2152
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,600
Xbox gaming but the

2153
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,600
more and more PC gaming I do the more

2154
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,600
I think about picking one up and using the Bluetooth to

2155
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,600
use PC too so yeah

2156
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,600
for sure anyway

2157
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,600
last but not least

2158
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,600
more rumors this is

2159
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,600
about Pokemon I want to ask what you guys think

2160
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,600
so apparently

2161
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,600
the big Pokemon for Nintendo Switch

2162
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,600
some information is coming out about it

2163
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,600
and it's coming from the

2164
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,600
Emily Rogers camp which you know she's

2165
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,600
she's had a lot of you know predictions that have

2166
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,600
come true so I mean take it with

2167
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,600
a grain of salt as you would any rumor but what

2168
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,600
would you guys think if this was true

2169
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,600
Pokemon let's go

2170
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,600
Pikachu and Pokemon let's go

2171
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,600
Eevee so it's not really Gen 8

2172
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,600
so I mean this is where this does

2173
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,600
kind of make sense to me because we've heard conflicting

2174
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,600
rumors about a Gen 1 reboot

2175
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,600
and that no the Switch

2176
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,600
Pokemon is going to be Gen 8

2177
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,600
so maybe instead

2178
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,600
of the full fledged Pokemon game

2179
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,600
being this year maybe that is next year

2180
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,600
which would make sense too because the time

2181
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,600
between generations is usually a good 3

2182
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,600
4 years you know it hasn't been that long

2183
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,600
yet since Sun and Moon so maybe

2184
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,600
we're getting a spinoff game

2185
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,600
a la Pokemon Pinball

2186
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,600
a la Pokemon Mystery Dungeon

2187
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,600
to kind of like hold us over this year

2188
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,600
and give us a Pokemon experience on the

2189
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,600
Switch and it sounds like it could

2190
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,600
be this in the Pokemon let's

2191
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,600
go and that would be what would come

2192
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,600
out and it sounds like it may have some ties

2193
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,600
into Pokemon Go it sounds like

2194
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,600
these games and correct me if I'm wrong guys it sounds like

2195
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,600
these games might be like some type of

2196
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,600
like single player couch playing

2197
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,600
Pokemon Go-esque experience

2198
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,600
is what it sounds like can you imagine though

2199
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,600
because I know that these are all cartridge based

2200
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,600
so could we in fact have

2201
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,600
like a device

2202
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,600
that's larger than a game cartridge

2203
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,600
to fit in there that may have like

2204
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,600
GPS built into it or something like that I

2205
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,600
don't think it's literally Pokemon Go

2206
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,600
because that's what Pokemon Go is so

2207
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,600
I think that this would be something where

2208
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,600
well I mean you could

2209
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,600
here's the thing Loki

2210
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,600
it could be an ingenious use

2211
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,600
of the Nintendo app to be

2212
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,600
able to use your GPS from your phone

2213
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,600
to geolocate you but like

2214
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,600
are we really going to put Nintendo and

2215
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,600
app development and are we going to give

2216
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,600
them that much credit that they know how to do that?

2217
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,600
I'm in the middle of the ocean

2218
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,600
I'm not the big hater you are and I'm not going to give them

2219
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,600
that much credit but you know I could

2220
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,600
see some type of like single player

2221
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,600
experience built around the

2222
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,600
concept of Pokemon Go

2223
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,600
maybe

2224
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,600
where it's a little more action based

2225
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:17,600
maybe and maybe they

2226
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:19,600
tie the raids into it somehow and you know

2227
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,600
a little bit of that it's not maybe the same

2228
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,600
classic JRPG experience I mean

2229
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,600
it would be a spinoff game

2230
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,600
Pokemon spinoff games are often

2231
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,600
notable as well right Pokemon

2232
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,600
Snap that was a

2233
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,600
that was a rad game we love that Pokemon Snap

2234
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,600
the Mystery Dungeon games not bad

2235
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,600
I love the pinball games those pinball games are pretty sweet

2236
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,600
so like there's no shame in being a

2237
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,600
Pokemon spinoff game as long as it's you know

2238
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,600
a fun spinoff game. I see the price that Pokemon Snap hasn't come back

2239
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,600
yet with all the selfie

2240
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,600
type you know social media

2241
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,600
stuff I would think that

2242
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,600
that'd be all people would be all over that

2243
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,600
crap yeah for sure

2244
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,600
so there you go that's the latest rumor

2245
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,600
but honestly guys just wait

2246
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,600
until E3 they'll

2247
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,600
tell you what's coming at E3

2248
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:03,600
alright let's open up the Sky Flight

2249
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,600
I'm going to open this up real quick because I'm kind of dragging

2250
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,600
here at the end of the day Orange Laundrio

2251
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,600
all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call

2252
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,600
Loki I know there were some stories that didn't

2253
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,600
make the cut tonight did you want to address any of them now

2254
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:15,600
sure let me

2255
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:17,600
jump in there real fast

2256
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,600
sorry to spring that on you

2257
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:21,600
but you should be used to it now

2258
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,600
I should be you would think I'd be ready

2261
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,600
so let's talk a little bit about sales numbers

2262
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,600
Gran Turismo sold 80 million

2263
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:33,600
copies or they've hit their milestone

2264
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,600
there I know I saw

2265
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,600
Grand Theft Auto 5 actually

2266
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:39,600
hit a pretty large milestone of

2267
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,600
95 million copies sold

2268
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,600
so that's pretty ridiculous

2269
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:45,600
this is kind of cool so you may

2270
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,600
remember there's that whole homebrew or

2271
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,600
hacker thing that you can

2272
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,600
basically mod the Switch now

2273
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:53,600
so someone has actually taken the interface

2274
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,600
or something that looks very similar to the interface

2275
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:57,600
of the SNES mini

2276
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,600
and put it on the Switch I'm so sorry Loki

2277
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,600
to interrupt but can I just say on going back

2278
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,600
a little bit because I wanted to pull this up because I was curious

2279
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,600
how does that sales number for Grand Theft Auto 5

2280
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,600
compare to other video games

2281
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:09,600
that is more than Wii Sports at this point

2282
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,600
Wii Sports was number 3 now Grand Theft

2283
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,600
Auto 5 is number 3 it still

2284
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,600
has not outpaced Minecraft

2285
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,600
and the number 1 best selling game

2286
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,600
ever with 177 million units

2287
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,600
Tetris not too

2288
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,600
surprising there some other ones

2289
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,600
that kind of surprised me I did not realize PUBG

2290
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,600
is already 40 million

2291
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,600
that's crazy

2292
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,600
Mario Kart Wii also did very well

2293
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:33,600
37 million a lot of those Wii games

2294
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,600
really high up on the list Pokemon Red and

2295
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:37,600
Blue at number 9 you can check out the whole list over on

2296
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,600
Wikipedia I know I'm using Wikipedia

2297
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,600
as a source but I figure hey they've got

2298
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,600
to source it to get it on wiki

2299
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,600
so for the most part

2300
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,600
you would assume yeah if I went over there

2301
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,600
and it's like President Cat is the third best

2302
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,600
selling game of all time I'd be like okay maybe not

2303
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,600
maybe somebody went in here and

2304
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,600
talked with a wiki anyway

2305
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,600
Loki I'm sorry to cut you off

2306
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,600
I wanted to get that out there

2307
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,600
yeah so there was that cool

2308
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,600
mod that someone's working on an emulator

2309
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,600
that's basically a virtual console though for

2310
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:07,600
the Switch so I'm

2311
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,600
down with that

2312
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,600
and then apparently there's some sort of thing

2313
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,600
going on for

2314
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,600
Street Fighter 5 where they're basically

2315
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,600
doing a tie in with

2316
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,600
Power Rangers

2317
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,600
so that's going to be interesting

2318
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,600
um

2319
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,600
I know they've got some Power Rangers

2320
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,600
Legacy Wars it's a mobile game

2321
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:29,600
and so I don't know

2322
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,600
they're going to have like Street Fighter

2323
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,600
characters in there as well I mean that's pretty cool

2324
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,600
ah neat

2325
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,600
so let's see what that is all about

2326
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,600
um

2327
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,600
what else

2328
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,600
let's see

2329
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,600
I don't know

2330
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,600
that's pretty much it I think

2331
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,600
there isn't a whole lot else for the week

2332
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,600
um

2333
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,600
Taiko no Tatsujin

2334
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,600
there are Switch versions coming out

2335
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,600
um in Japan they're also going to be doing

2336
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,600
a controller from Hori

2337
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,600
um so that's kind of cool

2338
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,600
they're going to have 20 party games in there

2339
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:05,600
and let's see when that's

2340
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,600
expected to be out here

2341
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:09,600
so there's the money sale

2342
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,600
besides the load here

2343
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,600
come on

2344
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,600
you can do it

2345
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:17,600
ah

2346
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,600
never mind

2347
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,600
alright that's alright

2348
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,600
oh we have one call wow I was just about to close it

2349
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:25,600
and then it lit up so why not

2350
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,600
I don't see this name popping on skype an awful lot

2351
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:29,600
but let's see how you're on Orange Sounds Radio who's this

2352
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,600
hi this is JD

2353
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:33,600
hey I don't see you on skype an awful lot even though we get you in studio once in a while

2354
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,600
but it's good to hear from you what's up buddy

2355
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,600
um so one of the stories

2356
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:39,600
I saw this week was Ariana Grande

2357
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,600
did a lobbo

2358
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,600
promotion doing um

2359
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:45,600
no tears left to cry

2360
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:47,600
all lobbo instruments

2361
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,600
you know what I appreciate you bringing that up

2362
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,600
you're right that's a pretty big deal

2363
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,600
Ariana Grande she's kind of a big deal

2364
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,600
I don't know if you know her

2365
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,600
but uh yeah she's kind of a big deal a pop star

2366
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,600
so for her to be doing this lobbo

2367
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:01,600
thing is kind of like

2368
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,600
those 3DS commercials with Beyonce

2369
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,600
but I would put that at number one because Beyonce

2370
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,600
is like untouchable

2371
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,600
but Ariana Grande like that's

2372
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,600
pretty solid that's like Nintendo's second biggest

2373
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,600
grab ever probably

2374
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:15,600
right I mean we already know Ariana Grande

2375
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:17,600
is a gamer queen because of the Final Fantasy thing

2376
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:19,600
oh yeah Final Fantasy gamer queen

2377
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:21,600
absolutely

2378
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:23,600
so my hope is

2379
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,600
they were playing a bunch of musical instruments

2380
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:27,600
that were all lobbo things

2381
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,600
I'm hoping that they will

2382
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,600
release a all musical instrument

2383
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:33,600
lobbo bundle instead of variety

2384
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,600
pack that includes a piano that I'm only

2385
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,600
gonna want the piano out of

2386
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:39,600
I must confess I didn't see the commercial

2387
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,600
I just saw some of the screenshots on Twitter

2388
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,600
I didn't realize it was a commercial

2389
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:45,600
I know that they did something I thought

2390
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,600
on the late what was it with Seth

2391
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,600
Myers or not Seth Myers

2392
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:51,600
Jimmy Fallon that's right

2393
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,600
they did their thing

2394
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,600
was there instruments

2395
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:57,600
in there that we haven't seen yet

2396
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,600
indicating that there's more to come

2397
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,600
I feel like yes they had like

2398
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,600
a drum set and it wasn't just

2399
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,600
all pianos and as far as I know the only one that's

2400
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,600
been released is pianos

2401
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,600
a lot of it looked like they were hacked from other things

2402
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:11,600
they had taken some of the parts from

2403
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,600
the robot set you know what I really

2404
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:15,600
would not be surprised I mean labo seems

2405
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:17,600
to be doing well it was sold out at target

2406
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,600
like and it's I don't I saw it on

2407
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,600
shelf I've seen it around yeah

2408
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,600
but I feel like it's doing well they had it marked down

2409
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,600
at Fry's they had the

2410
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:27,600
robot kit marked down that's what I saw today

2411
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,600
Fry's anyway

2412
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:31,600
cause I got new mics

2413
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,600
that I never bothered to hook up but anyway

2414
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,600
so yeah labo I feel like

2415
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,600
is doing well so I mean it would make sense that

2416
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,600
it's probably going to be a volume 3 and a volume 4

2417
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,600
and that musical instruments are

2418
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:43,600
probably one of those upcoming things

2419
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:45,600
right someone else posted

2420
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:47,600
a link about the Game of Thrones

2421
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:49,600
composer playing the theme

2422
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:51,600
on labo like the labo piano

2423
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,600
so like clearly

2424
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,600
at least somebody in Nintendo's marketing

2425
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,600
department is trying to make this happen

2426
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,600
yeah no I would say you know labo

2427
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:01,600
it feels like from a pop

2428
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:03,600
culture standpoint labo's

2429
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,600
kind of breaking through a little bit so I feel

2430
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:07,600
like look we're

2431
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,600
seeing this in a way we didn't see the Wii vitality

2432
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,600
sensor okay so I feel like

2433
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:13,600
this is something that's probably going to be around for a little bit

2434
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:15,600
I hope so

2435
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,600
did you ever buy labo did you ever

2436
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,600
actually pick it up? no I didn't I just

2437
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,600
decided that there was

2438
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,600
I mean the signal to noise ratio wasn't great

2439
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,600
for me I was like if I only want one of the five

2440
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,600
things I'll wait until it's either

2441
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:29,600
available separately or just not

2442
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,600
get it I'm kind of with you but if they do

2443
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:33,600
an all music set that is going

2444
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,600
to be very tempting with or without the piano

2445
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,600
honestly I mean the piano is rad but if they did

2446

Trio and supporting the show if you like what you

2474
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,600
heard here at Orange Lawn Trio please tell a friend or two

2475
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,600
about the show because we are the show where every

2476
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:39,600
gamer has a voice but only if the voices

2477
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:41,600
are actually here to air

2478
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:43,600
so yeah a nice five star review on

2479
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:45,600
iTunes goes an awful long way but word of mouth

2480
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,600
is like the absolute best thing you can do

2481
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:49,600
and that brings me to final

2482
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:51,600
thoughts my final thought

2483
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,600
tonight is rest and liquids

2484
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,600

2485
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,600

2486
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:59,600

2487
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,600
I get a break from my project tomorrow too

01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:03,600
so I'm gonna try to play some games and stuff

2489
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,600

2490
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:07,600
I'm gonna be playing some Grand Theft Auto 5

single player

2495
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:17,600

2497
