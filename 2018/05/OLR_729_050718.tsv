7000	14000	Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	What game spans 6 platforms, 4 consoles, 3 generations, and is now 17 years old?
18000	23000	Treasure's gift that keeps on giving is Ikaruga, slated for release on the Nintendo Switch later this month.
23000	27000	Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, May the 6th of 2018 with episode number 729 of our show.
45000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E.
49000	54000	But joining me by my side as she always is, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	56000	Miss Vangie.
56000	58000	You must be getting prepared for DragCon.
58000	60000	I am. I'm hunting her down.
60000	68000	Well, you know what's funny? The things we do to do Orange Lounge Radio live with you all, Miss Vangie is here in town tonight with Monet X Change.
68000	69000	I know.
69000	71000	And we're here, we're stuck doing this gig.
71000	74000	I wanted to see Miss Vangie, but no.
74000	76000	You guys are worth it. We love you guys.
77000	86000	And plus, I don't know, not that I get claustrophobic, but sometimes those shows can be, especially when it's a really popular queen like those two are.
86000	88000	I always pay for the balcony.
88000	92000	Oh yeah, that is true, but just like too many people, you know what I mean?
92000	93000	Yeah.
93000	100000	Anyway, say hello. We are happy to share our space here with Techmaster Loki as we do every week. Hello, Loki.
100000	104000	Hello, and speaking of popular queens, we can't watch American Idol anymore, unfortunately.
104000	107000	Oh, I know. I know, right? Cancelled. American Idol is cancelled.
107000	109000	It's basically, yeah. It's dead to me now.
109000	114000	That was some bullshit last week, wasn't it? Which, you know, well, it's not really a spoiler alert at this point, right?
114000	120000	So Ada Vox, who was clearly the winner of that competition, no longer there because America, the wrong people are watching that show.
120000	123000	Who cares? No one listens to American Idol artists anyways.
123000	129000	It's true. Can you tell me who won The Voice or who won any of like the last five seasons?
129000	134000	I couldn't tell you who's even on The Voice. I don't even know.
134000	140000	I know, I know. Those singing shows, there's too many of them. It was different when it was only American Idol, right?
140000	145000	It was different when that was it and there was nothing like it and it's like, oh my God, Paula Abdul, I haven't seen her in forever, right?
145000	147000	It was different then, but now it's like, okay.
147000	151000	But it's even now, it's like, it's not even necessarily the person that wins American Idol.
151000	157000	It's like, if you're like in that top 12, you pretty much have potential to just start your own thing anyways.
157000	163000	It's kind of these, you know, like Kelly Pickler and shit. Everybody has a fucking album now.
163000	169000	And what's funny is that that actually ties into Drag Race and a lot of what they say about RuPaul's Drag Race too is it's like,
169000	173000	it's not about what you do during the competition. It's about what you do after the competition.
173000	179000	You know, once you are on that show, like look at somebody like Miss Vanjie, which I wouldn't expect that everybody out there knows,
179000	184000	but if you don't know Miss Vanjie, she was the first contestant eliminated this season,
184000	189000	but she had such a memorable exit that like there's memes about her all over the internet now.
189000	195000	And like people who have no fucking clue what Drag Race is are doing these Miss Vanjie type of memes.
195000	198000	So like, you know, for her, she's already won.
198000	203000	And you know, they'll just have her, have her back, you know, in the future, like Caesar or something.
203000	205000	Like, oh yeah, we helped her launch her career.
205000	209000	I want them to do RuPaul's Drag Race Losers.
209000	210000	Yeah, well, well.
210000	213000	And do everyone who had been the first eliminated queen.
213000	219000	She'll be on, she'll be on season 11 cause RuPaul was spotted like going to some opening or some gala thing.
219000	222000	And RuPaul had a necklace on that said Vanjie in gold.
222000	227000	So it's like, you know, like, you know that we, the world ain't seen the last of those cookies.
227000	231000	Do they ever do like an all stars type thing in Drag Race where they bring back? Okay.
231000	233000	They just finished the third season.
233000	237000	They do, but the third season was, was rough. Too, too many twists.
237000	240000	They tried to do too many twists to make it different and it really suffered as a result.
240000	241000	So anyway.
241000	242000	I'm sorry, Shangela.
242000	247000	If you want to hear more about Drag Race, I urge you to look up reading is fundamental on iTunes.
247000	252000	But for now we are here to talk about video games and let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.
252000	258000	We'll get into our news and all that and our gaming weeks later on.
258000	260000	I should also introduce the chat room. That's important.
260000	266000	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
266000	272000	But Bobby enjoying the last week of his two week vacation right now, and he'll be back next week.
272000	274000	But we are live with our chat.
274000	282000	And if you are listening live, you can go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com where everybody's talking about American Idol right now.
282000	287000	I should also mention that Becky told me Julian named his first horse in Breath of the Wild Vangie.
287000	289000	So it is gaming related.
289000	295000	And I had my Minecraft. Not only did I have my Minecraft world named Vangie, but I had my Minecraft world recently named Proportionizing.
296000	298000	Proportionizing!
298000	302000	Which, by the way, spoiler alert, Proportionizing was a really good seed, actually.
302000	307000	So speaking of like horses, OK, I am very disappointed.
307000	309000	I don't get to reach out. That's OK. That's fine.
309000	311000	You know, they can wait. They can wait.
311000	317000	They can wait. I am so surprised that we haven't gotten an epic horse game yet on consoles.
317000	320000	I mean, you know, Derby's Owners Club, Derby Owners Club.
320000	323000	Like, why? Why don't we have a Derby Owners Club on consoles?
323000	324000	That's a great question.
324000	326000	Final Furlong is the horse humping game.
326000	331000	That is the, yeah. And if you don't, like, you'd have to, like, Google it, look up a picture of Final Furlong.
331000	335000	But, like, the machine was like you could actually, like, ride the horse.
335000	338000	But, like, there's a certain way you could be riding that thing where it looks like you're fucking it.
338000	341000	Like, that game was kind of questionable.
341000	343000	It's not just fucking. It's skull fucking.
343000	348000	Anyway, now can I do some chat comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
349000	353000	Kaijuto is an Idol fan saying, American Idol is the shit. I don't get the haters.
353000	356000	It's always good if you like listening to great voices.
356000	360000	If you watch it just for lame ass judge lines and all the drama stuff, then you'll burn out on it fast.
360000	362000	It was relevant once.
362000	367000	It's, well, the thing, well, I think the thing is, you know, I will agree with Kaijuto to a point.
367000	372000	The season when that show was over was when it was about Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj fighting.
372000	375000	And it became more about that than it did about the singers.
375000	377000	And that was the season it was over.
377000	379000	Some would argue it was before or after that.
379000	383000	But I would say, you know, to a point, Kaijuto, I do agree with you.
383000	389000	sg100matt in chat says, I stopped paying attention to American Idol after season 3, which was like forever ago at this point.
389000	395000	Anyway, back to games. sg100matt also says, Derby Owners Club was serious business back in the day.
395000	399000	Well, that was always like a fun thing to do between games of DDR and other stuff that we were playing.
399000	403000	It's hilarious. It was a great game because I didn't understand what the hell was going on.
404000	411000	You just want to get the card, your card that printed out with your horse's name on it, and you just want to play the game because it's stupid.
411000	416000	How do you, for listeners who may have never heard of Derby Owners Club, how do we explain it?
416000	419000	Because, I mean, it's been like 10 years. Do they still have it at Dave & Buster's places?
419000	424000	I don't know. But, Matt, you go to an arcade and you see this, like, cabinet that is like a room.
424000	430000	It is a giant room with, like, several consoles and you're basically watching, like, horse racing.
430000	434000	But you create a horse and they have, like, this whole gameplay that you play on your screen.
434000	440000	And then you, I guess, raise the horse and stuff and then you race it and you improve its stats based on that.
440000	446000	And then once you get your stats high enough, you breed your horse with other horses to make even better horses.
446000	449000	But you get cards that print out and you can name them.
449000	453000	Like Initial D. Just the exact same system. Exactly the same system, yes.
453000	457000	And it was fantastic. And we really need that again because it's just stupid.
457000	464000	I remember that Dark Sakura had a book. She would bring it. She would, here's my book of horses. Which horsies am I going to race today?
464000	471000	I still have the book. It's somewhere in my house. I found it not too long ago because, remember, my good one for the long time was Magical Sound.
471000	477000	Oh. And you had Palateri. I thought that was your horse. It was Palateri. Maybe. I think it was.
477000	483000	But we had to spell it the special way. Like P-A-L-A-T-E-R-I. Palateri.
484000	490000	A character limit? No, like a bad word in it somehow. You know how game filters can be weird.
490000	495000	Anyway, S2-100-MAT actually linked to the Wikipedia article. Or you could read more about that. I suppose that's a place to start.
495000	500000	And as S2-100-MAT continues, Derby Owners Club is 10 years old. It could be Classic Game of the Week at some point.
500000	504000	If I felt like it. Dropping a little hint there to Dark Sakura.
504000	507000	That means that in 10 years, another 10 years, I'll finally remember to do it.
507000	509000	That's a good one to do for like an anniversary show.
509000	513000	Can you imagine a Derby Owners Club with today's technology? It would look fucking amazing.
513000	519000	Yeah, I'd be all about Derby Owners Club on Switch. It's Sega's game, right? Isn't it Sega's game?
519000	521000	I thought, was it Sega or Konami?
521000	523000	No, it wasn't Konami. I'm almost positive it was Sega.
523000	524000	I think it's Sega.
524000	525000	Probably a Sega thing.
525000	526000	It was.
526000	529000	Sega did like to take a lot of risks in the arcade market.
529000	536000	They do. They had a lot of over-the-top shit. Oh yeah? It was an in-house Sega thing. It was Sega's AM3 department that did that game.
536000	537000	So, there you go.
537000	545000	Alright, let's get into what we were going to talk about at the top of the show tonight. Although I'm all for a Derby Owners Club tangent.
545000	550000	Let's talk about classic video games coming back all over again in style.
550000	555000	And I bring this up because I think it's kind of neat. And I also know we have some collectors in the house.
555000	560000	You know, I don't know about you guys in our chat, but I know Dark Sakura. We always talk about the Vault collection.
560000	565000	She's got quite the collection. I'll never forget the game that came with the Dish. And I was like, why?
565000	568000	Why not, right? You still have the Dish game?
568000	570000	That was the Cardcaptor Sakura game for Dreamcast.
570000	573000	That's right, that's right. I can never remember what it was, but yes.
573000	577000	And then of course, Loki is an owner of an arcade machine.
577000	578000	So that's a little bit of a collection as well.
578000	579000	Dose arcade machines, actually.
579000	582000	Dude, really? What? What happened? You had another one.
582000	587000	Well, no, I have an arcade machine. Remember, I had an arcade cabinet at one time. I have the candy cab.
587000	592000	Oh, okay, okay. You have like a... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. That's like basically a main thing at this point, right?
592000	597000	Yeah, it doesn't really work right now. My JPEG died, so I have to get a new one of those.
597000	601000	Okay. Well, anyhow, Capcom is the subject of this story.
601000	608000	It's going to be re-releasing cartridge versions of Mega Man 2 and Mega Man X.
608000	613000	So these two classic Mega Man games are going to get cartridge re-releases.
613000	620000	They're going to be limited runs. They're going to cost you $100 apiece, which, I mean, was more than they cost back in the day.
620000	626000	But, I mean, I don't know if it's inflation, if it's because, I mean, if you look at this Mega Man X cartridge, it's pretty sweet.
626000	631000	It's in like the blue casing, and I know the Mega Man 2 has something similar. It's a pretty rad looking little thing.
631000	634000	It doesn't look like it did back in the day. Like, I love that see-through cartridge.
634000	640000	I gotta be curious if the ROM is also modified, too. They have like that 30th anniversary Mega Man type thing in it.
640000	649000	Don't know. I don't know if they've said that. But anyway, but of course this makes people wonder, like, would you be able to even play these in cartridge form?
649000	652000	Like, how many people still have a working Nintendo?
652000	659000	Probably a lot, being with all the retro, what is it, the retro consoles.
659000	666000	I guess so. Those are kind of, those machines are basically, they dump the ROM and they emulate it right on the spot.
666000	671000	That's basically what those machines do. But I feel you, I feel you. You could use those to play games.
671000	678000	And dark soccer is like me. You're special in that regard because you guys collect stuff.
678000	681000	You have like four Nintendos, right? Or something like that?
681000	683000	Something like that. A couple of them in the box.
683000	690000	Yeah. So anyhow, I Am 8-Bit, I believe is the production house that is helping out with this effort.
690000	694000	And I Am 8-Bit is going to try to sweeten the pot since it is a high value there.
694000	700000	They're going to package the game with instruction books. How about that? The return of an instruction booklet. Isn't that nice?
700000	702000	Better for that kind of price.
702000	710000	Cost boxing as well. And 1,000 random buyers get the glow in the dark versions of the cartridge. That's pretty rad.
710000	717000	Oh, I see. Oh, that blue cartridge is the random one. So most people are going to get the regular gray one.
717000	720000	Whereas the NES one is that kind of light blue.
720000	724000	I don't even think that's great. It's more of like a white. Yeah, it looks lighter than the normal cartridge.
724000	725000	And you know what?
725000	729000	Something I wouldn't wear to a wedding. Or something I would wear to a wedding because I can't wear it here.
729000	732000	You would probably still though buy an original for less than that.
732000	734000	That's true. That's true.
734000	736000	And then you'd have an original.
736000	738000	Well that's why it's a collector's item.
738000	741000	It's for people with too much money who don't want to go hunting.
741000	746000	So 8,500 copies are going to be available in total and that includes the 1,000 blue ones.
746000	748000	They're supposed to start shipping in September of this year.
748000	751000	So you guys are kind of already getting into it a little bit.
751000	757000	Is that, well wait a minute. What's the point of these if I can walk into a used game store and possibly find one of these on cartridge?
757000	762000	Although I would think these games in particular are probably a little harder to find because they are so popular.
762000	765000	Yeah, it's a collector's item is what it is.
765000	767000	Do you think it's worth it?
767000	772000	It's not unreasonable considering some of the other collector's things I've seen.
772000	777000	I mean look at all these collector's editions that they have from modern games. They have like a stupid statue with it and stuff.
777000	780000	And those don't come with instruction booklets for the most part.
780000	788000	Yeah, it's ridiculous. I wouldn't buy it because I'm not collecting Nintendo or Super Nintendo games.
788000	791000	But if I was a collector, yeah, I might be interested in it.
791000	795000	It's a neat idea. Props to them for trying something different.
795000	796000	Right.
796000	800000	And hey, if it works out then you can put out more stuff.
800000	803000	Let me look at our chat over at live.vog.network.com.
804000	809000	Mr. 200 Matt says $100. I mean if I was a serious Mega Man fan and collector I would dig in.
809000	814000	But I have the games on so many platforms now. Legacy Collections, SNES Mini, etc.
814000	819000	So maybe the fact that this game has kind of been re-released to death.
819000	823000	Maybe this is not the type of thing that a collector would be getting at this point.
823000	825000	It would have been cool if it was a new Mega Man game.
825000	832000	Like a new Mega Man X type game or that would have been like Mega Man 12 or something like that.
832000	837000	And then release an NES version as well as it on modern platforms. That would have been pretty awesome.
837000	838000	Right, right.
838000	843000	That's a little asking for much, but I don't know. That would have been cool.
843000	848000	I guess I've seen things that have been even more ridiculous for way more money.
848000	851000	So I don't think it's unreasonable.
851000	857000	Let's see. Brad from Pod Culture says saw SNES Mini at Target today. Didn't have the $80 to spare.
857000	860000	That's true. We've got to remember these collector's items and the money that goes with it.
860000	862000	That's a luxury to many people.
862000	868000	Dungeon Buster says I wish Breath of the Wild or Bayonetta 2 came with manuals and stickers too.
868000	870000	Those empty Switch cases need some filler.
870000	873000	Well that's probably a whole other topic for another episode.
873000	878000	But yeah, obviously the way games are distributed and stuff have really changed.
878000	880000	Well, even a lot of the Switch cases...
880000	885000	I have my Switch case and I just take the cartridge out and pop it in the case that comes with it.
886000	888000	The cartridge holder in the case.
891000	896000	It would be nice to have those extra instructions because I think I was looking at...
896000	898000	I was trying to find the instructions for something.
898000	902000	Oh yeah, I think Mario Odyssey or something like that.
902000	905000	I was trying to find out if there were some motion controls you had to do.
905000	907000	I'm like, why are you doing these motion controls?
907000	910000	There's got to be a way that can do these moves without motion controls.
910000	912000	And unfortunately there was not.
913000	916000	Let's see, Dark Tetsuya brings up something that happened in the past saying,
916000	921000	I know they did something similar before with the limited re-release of Street Fighter 2 on SNES.
921000	925000	Yeah, so this is maybe something that I Am 8-Bit is exploring doing more often.
925000	931000	Maybe this is something that's being successful enough that it's warranting to do more releases like this.
931000	934000	I don't know, what if they did something that's really close to your heart?
934000	941000	Dark Sakura, how would you feel if these I Am 8-Bit wanted to do a Guardian Legend re-release that came with a dish?
943000	945000	I have an original.
945000	948000	Okay, so no need for any of these like remakes?
948000	951000	No, not really, besides that no one would bring it out with a dish.
951000	960000	What's something that you think is, or if there is, do you think there's something that might be really hard to find retro that maybe this would be like an answer to?
960000	964000	Do you think there's anything out there where maybe it's not so easy to find a retro copy of that?
964000	965000	Radiant Silver Gun?
965000	970000	So something that's like, I guess like Suikoden comes to mind too.
970000	974000	Like even though they've kind of, you know, you can get that in like the PlayStation 3 backwards.
974000	986000	I'm still trying to find a relatively, I'd say $50 range copy of Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn.
986000	990000	Or Robit Mondu, which I still really want that game.
990000	994000	Ninja Gaiden Trilogy on Super Nintendo, you guys still have that right?
994000	995000	In the box, with manual.
995000	999000	Yeah, but that would be one where it's like, those are hard. You can't just walk into a used game store and find it.
999000	1002000	Someone must have given me $450 bucks for it, it can be yours.
1002000	1003000	Because that's what it's worth, right?
1003000	1004000	Yeah.
1004000	1006000	Crazy, crazy.
1006000	1012000	Let's see, Dartitsia in chat says, there's also that US release of Holy Diver. I think Famicom carts of that are still pretty expensive.
1012000	1023000	I'm sure, you know, we'll see maybe more and more homebrew stuff that shows up with these types of things, which it seems like, you know, as some of the patents and copyrights of this cartridge technology.
1023000	1028000	And just the fact that the technology is more and more easily, like, you know, obtainable by regular people like you and me.
1028000	1032000	I think we might see more, like, homebrew that shows up in these types of cartridges.
1032000	1034000	Anyway.
1034000	1041000	Alright, well, I just wanted to see what you guys thought of this, and if it was something that you think would be a valuable addition to your collection.
1041000	1047000	But it sounds like maybe the original, the OG, is still the best to get at the end of the day.
1047000	1053000	Anyway, if you guys have additional thoughts on that, you can always email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1053000	1058000	In the meantime, I think we're going to get into how was your gaming week, and we're going to start with Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?
1058000	1062000	I am, I played stuff. I actually did things.
1062000	1075000	What I did is I played the Kirby game, finally, because JD loaned it to me, and I was really actually pleased to finally give a chance to play it.
1075000	1081000	I got through the whole first stage, you know, the first whatever world it is, and had a really good time. It's super fun.
1081000	1085000	It's not, like, terribly difficult, but I wasn't really expecting it to be.
1085000	1095000	I also picked up two games. I finally actually put in to buy a reproduction game for Dan, because we've had zero luck finding it.
1095000	1102000	So I picked up Ninja 5-0 for Dan, or as it was, Ninja Cop. He hasn't played it yet, but he's also been really busy.
1102000	1116000	And then I picked up Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner for Sega Saturn, which I am going to need translations to be able to play it, but I wanted it. The price was right.
1116000	1136000	And other than that, I've been playing, what's the game, Idol Poring. I've been playing some Pokemon Go, and I've been playing, I've actually gotten back into Bejeweled, honestly enough, which it's like my mindless, I need to relax game.
1136000	1147000	So that's what I'm playing, and I've given up on that Bust-A-Move, Puzzle Bobble, buy tickets to continue game, because it just turned into shit.
1147000	1157000	It's got modes in there that I don't like, and, oh no, not that one, PEGGLE. It was PEGGLE. I want the old PEGGLE back, and it doesn't work on iOS 11, so I have a sad face over that.
1157000	1178000	And then a lot of pinball, because we've got the getaway and we're playing it. I will go ahead and say this, on Friday, May 18th, if you are in Northern California, come to the Golden State Pinball Expo in Lodi. It will be amazing, it will be fun, and you can play the same getaway that I keep cussing at. And that's it.
1178000	1180000	Did they pay for that commercial?
1180000	1183000	No. I want people to yell at it too, because it's a bitch.
1184000	1186000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1186000	1198000	It was good, I played lots of Dance Dance Revolution still, and then I also played a bit more of Super Mario Odyssey, so I finally just made it to the Metro Kingdom.
1199000	1223000	Because unlike my son, who's already beat the game, and now he told me today that he unlocked the dark side of the moon, I've been just collecting as many moons in each of the levels as I can as I go through it, so it's been progressing a little bit slower, but more of a completionist in that sense, I guess.
1223000	1238000	Then what else? I've been kind of trying to figure out what I want to get for the Switch, actually, because I was staring at the lineup of games that they had at GameStop today, and honestly, I don't know, it doesn't seem like there's much out there.
1238000	1245000	I mean, I know there's a lot of indie games that are on the platform, but not a lot of them really kind of say, hey, buy me.
1245000	1255000	I don't know, it's just kind of hard to decide what I want to get, so I haven't gotten anything other than the three games that I have now.
1255000	1266000	What else did I play? I played a little bit of PlayStation VR, because we had some guests over, so we got that back out again, so more Job Simulator.
1266000	1271000	Is the PlayStation VR kind of like the Wii U was, where it's your party system?
1271000	1280000	Well, yeah, it's more of a lot of people that haven't played VR games, so two kids that were over, they hadn't played VR games, and they've been really wanting to play VR games.
1280000	1290000	That's interesting, though, because I think, sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I think a lot of people have been apprehensive about VR, because only the person with the VR headset on can really experience the VR.
1291000	1307000	Not necessarily, yeah, you can have it on TV. The one game we played, and I tried to see, my youngest son wants to play the VR games, but since a lot of the games we have are the early VR games, they're not entirely the best when it comes to setting things up.
1308000	1317000	For example, I tried the one kid that came over, he wanted to play Superhot, because he's watched a lot of YouTube videos of people playing Superhot, and he wanted to try that out.
1317000	1323000	So I popped in Superhot, but I couldn't get it to go back to the first level, and I had no fucking clue on how to do anything.
1323000	1331000	I'm like, how do I get this back to the first level in this thing? Is that even possible? Because it didn't seem possible, there was no fucking menu anywhere.
1331000	1346000	So I was like, I don't know what the fuck to do with this, so we ended up moving on to something else, and then it came to Job Simulator, which Job Simulator, they have you kind of calibrate the system a little bit, but then you have to raise and lower the floor to make it so that the height feels right to you.
1346000	1354000	The problem is they don't really have anything to kind of give you context to the height. There's a grid on the floor, but you can't tell how big that grid's supposed to be.
1355000	1363000	Here's a counter that's supposed to be waist high or something, so get this so that it looks like the counter is waist high to you, and then be okay.
1363000	1372000	Because the first time I did it, it was way too low. It looked like he was a baby trying to reach stuff, and it was just way too low, so we had to recalibrate again, and it was way too high.
1372000	1380000	And it was a pain in the ass, because I just want to play the game, and I have to keep calibrating this bullshit until I get it right.
1380000	1388000	And trying to do that with a kid, trying to get them to calibrate it, it's a fucking pain in the ass. So they need to do it much better in other games.
1388000	1393000	But they had fun anyways, once we finally got it calibrated after the third or fourth time.
1393000	1405000	And I assume that's just because that's an earlier VR game, now they probably have better solutions for that. I don't know, I just wish it would be patched better or something like that.
1406000	1419000	But yeah, I think the other game we played too was the PlayStation VR, it was the Playroom VR.
1419000	1428000	So that free game that they have with all the robots and stuff, the Sony stuff. So what's kind of cool about that one is they have stuff that multiple people can play at the same time.
1428000	1438000	So they had one where my son was this giant monster thing, and he had to chase after other robots, which were us.
1438000	1446000	And so we had controllers that were controlling those. But the problem is, it was giving him instructions on his headset, and I couldn't see what those instructions were.
1446000	1456000	And because he's only four and can't read, it made it hard for him to play that. I'm like, well, I know from the trailer that it had the kid roaring, so why don't you try roaring?
1456000	1467000	Because I think that's maybe what you're supposed to do. And it was hilarious, because all it did is it voice-changed his roar to sound like the chipmunks or something like that.
1467000	1479000	It's like, Roar! Roar! It was ridiculous. But I don't know what he was supposed to do, because the instructions were only on his screen, and like I said, he couldn't read it, so fuck if I know.
1479000	1481000	But he had fun anyways.
1481000	1486000	Okay, that's good. Kids like that dumb stuff too, or it's like voice-changing and all that silly stuff.
1486000	1494000	Yeah, I mean, it's just hard to... they need to... UI is a big thing. UI and calibration is like a must.
1494000	1502000	People developing these games need to understand that this has to be perfect in order to be able to play the game well.
1502000	1509000	I don't know, I just don't think that some of these games were there. But that's like launch games, so newer stuff I'm sure is better now.
1509000	1510000	Fair enough.
1510000	1517000	And then of course, Pokemon Go, I've been playing a little bit of that, and I don't know, that's about it.
1517000	1524000	Sia Tabiri in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the young Simba voice, the roar, just can't wait to be king.
1524000	1533000	It's pretty much, like it was funny because he was talking, and it's super high-pitched, and I'm like, I don't know what the point of that is, but it was silly.
1533000	1537000	And he also, he wants me to get the Labo stuff, like we were looking at it again.
1537000	1538000	Oh boy.
1538000	1544000	And I'm like, there are so many things against why I should do this. One, they want the robot ones.
1544000	1545000	They're gonna break it.
1545000	1554000	They want the robot one, the robot one's $80. And I'm like, I know, if I buy this, you're gonna play it a couple times, and you're gonna get bored with it immediately.
1554000	1556000	And then they're gonna throw a tantrum and smash it.
1556000	1559000	They're not gonna throw a tantrum and smash it, but it's gonna be some crap that's...
1559000	1561000	Sorry, your wife is gonna throw a tantrum and smash it.
1561000	1565000	It's gonna be some crap that's gonna be sitting in a room somewhere because it's fucking huge.
1565000	1569000	So I'm like, I don't, I can't see this as being...
1569000	1580000	That's been holding me back too. Now, I don't have the whole kid factor, but you know, I like creation type of games, and you know, in theory, I like Labo, except I still don't get like, where's the game?
1580000	1582000	But anyway, that's all there's to it.
1582000	1586000	It's a Nintendo move. It's the tech demo, let's sell it as a game.
1586000	1595000	You know what, I like it in the way that I like Legos, and it's cool. I'm not gonna like knock Labo. It's just, it's not for me because I need to have less shit in this house, not more shit.
1595000	1602000	And that's exactly the problem. Like, you know, even Alan was teasing me because we saw it in the store the other day. He's like, oh, you want to get the Nintendo Labo, get the piano?
1602000	1607000	And I'm like, really? You really want me to bring that in the house? You really want another thing that we gotta find a place for in the house?
1607000	1613000	I mean, it's neat, but it's just like, I don't see myself playing that, or even my kids playing that long term.
1613000	1618000	I'm like, there's no way. First off, they won't build it. It'll be me building that thing.
1618000	1625000	And second, it'll be me building that thing and them going, is it done yet? I want to play! Why is it taking so long?
1625000	1630000	It's like, so it's gonna be that. And then they're gonna play it, and they're gonna have fun with it.
1630000	1634000	And then they're gonna fight over who gets to play it. And then they're gonna play it for a while.
1634000	1638000	And then they're gonna be bored with it. And then it's gonna be, you know, they'll do it for a few days.
1638000	1642000	And they'll be like, hey, you wanna play the robot game? And they'll be like, no, that's boring.
1642000	1646000	So it's just 80 bucks.
1646000	1650000	Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dart Tetsuya says,
1650000	1654000	yeah, you wouldn't believe all the videos that have come out with people making stuff with some of the kits.
1654000	1658000	I will say that much. Are they doing hacks? Like IKEA hacks?
1658000	1665000	No, you can actually program your own things. So they have a toolbox or lab mode or something like that
1665000	1669000	where you can build your own things out of it.
1669000	1673000	And, I mean, some of it's kind of cool, I guess.
1673000	1679000	But I don't know what the, I don't know how much utility there is there other than playing with that for a little bit.
1679000	1685000	I just don't think it's, it's not like a Mario Maker or something like that where you're gonna play the game
1685000	1689000	and you're gonna get a lot of use out of it. And there's a lot more, you know, playability with it.
1689000	1695000	I think a lot of these things, it is, well, like even with a variety pack, there's not a lot of playability there.
1695000	1699000	I mean, you can do music stuff. I mean, sure, with the piano thing.
1699000	1703000	But it's not something that's gonna be, you're gonna get burnt out on it really fast.
1703000	1708000	If I had a kid who was like musically inclined, I would totally snatch that Labo thing up.
1708000	1715000	Actually, and I think I've said this about Labo before, like Labo would have been the thing I wanted when I was like 9 or 10.
1715000	1719000	That would have been amazing. Because, you know, I was into music, I was into Legos, I'm into video games.
1719000	1724000	It's a perfect marriage of all those things. So, like, Labo is for me just like a little late.
1724000	1729000	But anyway. My gaming week. Types of video games I've been playing this week.
1729000	1733000	So, of course, I've been playing Pokemon Go because I love my Pokemon Go.
1733000	1738000	And I finally got Mew in Pokemon Go. So, I think that's kind of like a landmark thing is I finally got Mew.
1738000	1743000	I kind of took my time with the quest. Like, I know a lot of people got that a long time ago.
1743000	1748000	But I was like, you know, they're not gonna push anything new. Like, it's not like they're gonna come out with Celebi next week.
1748000	1751000	You know, it's gonna take some time before they put out, you know, more quests.
1751000	1759000	So, I'll just kind of take my time and that way I don't kind of burn myself out trying to chase down like, you know, 10 ghost types or 400 Magikarp candies or, you know, all the stuff.
1759000	1767000	Although the events they've been doing, they've been doing a lot more like regular events in Pokemon Go that have, I think, really helped just kind of keep that game more interesting.
1767000	1769000	So, that's pretty cool.
1769000	1775000	And I'm getting EX raid passes all of a sudden. Like, I have an EX raid pass for Monday and I have another one for the Monday after.
1775000	1782000	So, that was weird because I wasn't getting any before and now I'm getting like EX raid passes. It just sucks that they're on Monday, but I'll make it work.
1782000	1784000	Are they like local or are they just like...
1784000	1787000	They're by my work. So, they're not like here, but they're local to my work.
1787000	1795000	And it makes sense because I've been known to at lunch. I'll go and walk around a park and if there's like a Magikarp or, you know, a one star, two star on the gym, I'll do it.
1795000	1798000	And that's how I've gotten these raid passes. So, you know, that's kind of a thing.
1798000	1800000	So, I'm still playing Pokemon Go and...
1800000	1802000	Let's see, what else have I been playing?
1802000	1806000	Honestly, when it comes to like other games, just a little bit of Minecraft.
1806000	1810000	Don't worry, Loki. I haven't been leaving you out. I'm waiting for Bobby to get back so he can get into that realms thing.
1810000	1812000	So, I'm trying not to burn myself out of Minecraft.
1812000	1815000	So, for the most part, I've put that on hold, but I did play that a little bit.
1815000	1820000	I've been playing... Like, the game I just suddenly like got obsessed with all over again is Diablo 3.
1820000	1822000	I've been playing a ton of Diablo 3.
1823000	1827000	And I know, like, this was a game I was probably talking about a year or two ago that I was playing a lot.
1827000	1829000	And it's just kind of one of those things where something clicked on.
1829000	1833000	And just something about that real like zen way, you just kind of sit there and kill, kill, kill, die.
1833000	1836000	I'm playing a wizard, so it's all like pew, pew laser beams.
1836000	1838000	So, I just melt things with my little lasers like...
1838000	1841000	You know, and everything like dies and I get loot.
1841000	1846000	And there's just something very satisfying about murdering hell demons and getting loot.
1846000	1847000	So, I've been playing a lot of it.
1847000	1850000	Like, to put it in perspective, I think during last week...
1850000	1853000	I've probably been playing a little bit up to last week's show, but I wasn't level 70 yet.
1853000	1856000	I'm already paragon 230 now.
1857000	1861000	So, I've been playing a little bit and I'm already up through like being able to do like a greater 45,
1861000	1863000	which is like equivalent of a Torment 10.
1863000	1867000	Which is, you know, it's not the best, but it's, you know, I've been investing a little time in it.
1867000	1869000	And then here's another random one.
1869000	1871000	Maybe Jamie will appreciate this, I don't know.
1871000	1874000	But on the Xbox One, you know, they give away the free games with gold.
1874000	1879000	One of the things they're giving away this month is the Streets of Rage collection on the 360.
1879000	1881000	You know who doesn't have an Xbox One?
1881000	1882000	Uh, you.
1882000	1884000	But Streets of Rage.
1884000	1886000	I already have cartridges.
1886000	1890000	Yeah, so I had a feeling that was gonna be you as you're like, oh, I already got...
1890000	1892000	I actually have a bare knuckle.
1892000	1893000	Do you?
1893000	1894000	Yeah.
1894000	1895000	Nice. The collection's cool.
1895000	1896000	So, I played a little bit.
1896000	1901000	I played a little Streets of Rage 1 and I think I made it up through like the second boss.
1901000	1902000	And then I was like, okay.
1902000	1905000	I remember these old beat-em-up games were the shit in the 90s.
1905000	1907000	Now they feel really repetitive.
1907000	1908000	Kind of sucks.
1908000	1909000	Yeah.
1909000	1910000	Like, I don't know.
1910000	1911000	Even the Ninja Turtles arcade game.
1911000	1914000	Like, it's awesome for like a little bit.
1914000	1916000	And then you're like, God, this is really repetitive.
1916000	1922000	Because you're missing the dark pizza-filled, you know, smell-filled rooms.
1922000	1923000	Maybe.
1923000	1924000	Maybe, yeah.
1924000	1927000	Where you were kind of limited on one quarter into 15 minutes for your pizza to be ready.
1927000	1928000	That's what I'm saying.
1928000	1929000	That's what I'm saying.
1929000	1932000	Like, I remember and I don't know maybe if it's just different nowadays.
1932000	1936000	But like, I remember like pizza and like arcades and stuff like that were like very dark.
1936000	1938000	Like, Chuck E. Cheese is like fucking bright now.
1938000	1942000	I remember it being like some dark-ass, you know, arcade.
1942000	1945000	The Chuck E. Cheese's that I went to had like darker rooms.
1945000	1948000	But most of the like big areas were kind of lit.
1948000	1957000	But I mean, when for me all up until like my late teens, we had an Aladdin's castle that had carpeted walls.
1957000	1959000	And it was dark.
1959000	1961000	And it had a smoking section.
1961000	1965000	So, there would be the occasional cigarette burn on the machine.
1965000	1968000	And it was dark and wonderful.
1968000	1972000	And then of course playing, you know, on roller skates at the roller rink too.
1972000	1977000	Because like I said, I still can't play Frogger without being on roller skates to this day.
1977000	1978000	Love it.
1978000	1981000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1981000	1985000	Agdeft with the clarification there saying, Streets of Rage is actually 360.
1985000	1986000	Yeah, right.
1986000	1988000	I should have been more clear with that.
1988000	1992000	Even though I'm playing it on Xbox One, it is free through Games with Gold.
1992000	1994000	And it is a 360, like the vintage collection.
1994000	1995000	I also don't want to pay.
1995000	2000000	Well, but if you're already paying for Games with Gold, which if you want to play Xbox online, you get anyway.
2000000	2003000	Then you get Streets of Rage for that.
2003000	2008000	You know, for what I could pay for Games with Gold, that could be a few tacos.
2008000	2011000	It could be tacos. It is taco money.
2011000	2012000	Tacos are amazing.
2012000	2013000	Tacos are great.
2013000	2015000	I love tacos.
2015000	2017000	Let's see, also in chat.
2017000	2019000	Sia Tabiri talking about Pokemon Go saying,
2019000	2022000	For the longest time I thought Mr. Mime was pronounced Mr. Mime.
2022000	2026000	Because it seemed weird that they'd have that word be the English pronunciation.
2026000	2028000	You know how I knew it was Mr. Mime?
2028000	2029000	The cartoon.
2029000	2032000	Because all those little fuckers say their names over and over.
2032000	2033000	Mr. Mime!
2033000	2034000	Mr. Mime!
2034000	2037000	Except, is that his name?
2037000	2040000	No, that's not his name on the Japanese one.
2040000	2041000	Oh, did he get a different name in Japan?
2041000	2042000	Yeah.
2042000	2043000	Yeah.
2043000	2044000	It's Barriered.
2044000	2046000	Ah, there you go. That's why.
2046000	2048000	So, yeah.
2048000	2052000	Only a very small handful of them kept their Japanese name.
2052000	2053000	Like Pikachu?
2053000	2054000	Yeah.
2054000	2056000	Which, by the way, not on the show world tonight,
2056000	2061000	but did you hear that random story about how Pikachu supposedly had another evolution in the game?
2061000	2063000	It was like Gorochu or something like that?
2063000	2065000	It was supposed to be like an evolved Raichu.
2065000	2067000	Gorochu, does it get like six arms?
2067000	2070000	No, but it gets buff and it was supposed to, like I think,
2070000	2073000	don't quote me on this guys, but I think it was something about it had horns and little vampire teeth.
2073000	2075000	Which sounds really adorable.
2075000	2076000	But, um, yeah.
2076000	2079000	And it would have been, it could have been, I guess they took it out for balance reasons,
2079000	2082000	but I'm thinking, like, Raichu's really not that powerful?
2082000	2087000	No one uses Raichu, and it sucks that the Pikachus are so fucking hard to catch in the first place.
2087000	2090000	It's like, you're fucking useless, stupid Pikachu.
2090000	2093000	I don't know, why are you so hard to catch?
2093000	2095000	Poor Pikachu. Alright, anyway. But he's cute.
2095000	2097000	Anyway, I guess that's really it for my gaming week.
2097000	2099000	So, let's get into some housekeeping.
2100000	2103000	We will not be here towards the end of June,
2103000	2107000	although we will be having our 16th anniversary show.
2107000	2109000	We're really old, you guys.
2109000	2112000	We're going to be having our 16th anniversary show on June 17th.
2112000	2116000	The best reward for 16 years hard working, a week off.
2116000	2118000	So we won't be here on June 24th.
2118000	2121000	Speaking of weeks off, Dark Soccer's not going to be here next week.
2121000	2122000	Yeah.
2122000	2124000	But for a really good reason. You're ditching us for Drag Queens.
2124000	2125000	I'm going to Drag Con.
2125000	2126000	Yeah, not Dragun Con.
2126000	2128000	No, Drag Con.
2128000	2130000	Where there will be cosplay.
2130000	2132000	There will be queens.
2132000	2136000	My pal Aria Snark from Shaking and Crying is going to be there with you, so that will be fun.
2136000	2142000	And if anyone wants to find me, I will be at the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence booth
2142000	2145000	on Friday in the afternoon, like sometime after 3 something.
2145000	2146000	Cool.
2146000	2150000	And around the same time, actually 2 I think, on Saturday.
2150000	2151000	Awesome.
2151000	2153000	So I will be there working the table with the sisters.
2153000	2155000	I will be working it.
2155000	2159000	Well, speaking of Dragun Con, since we're leading from drag to Dragun Con,
2159000	2163000	I can confirm that I will be at Dragun Con this Labor Day.
2163000	2167000	So, and I'm on the website and everything, which is really nice.
2167000	2171000	So very, very happy and excited to be working with the podcasting track again.
2171000	2174000	I probably won't know my schedule till less than a month before,
2174000	2177000	but as soon as I know what panels I'll be on, I'll be sure to let you guys all know.
2177000	2180000	So check that out in Atlanta this Labor Day.
2180000	2183000	If you can't catch Jamie in LA this week.
2183000	2185000	I'll also be at Disneyland if anyone happens to be there.
2185000	2187000	Are you offering to ride Space Mountain with the listeners?
2187000	2188000	No.
2188000	2189000	Okay.
2189000	2192000	Only if they give me the front seat.
2192000	2193000	Okay.
2193000	2196000	I mean, if someone wants to buy me a churro, I won't say no.
2196000	2200000	They have some good churros. Don't they have all the special stuff at Disney now?
2200000	2205000	The last time I was at Disneyland, they had the golden churros,
2205000	2207000	which are like the gold sugar.
2207000	2210000	The only one that I really want to try is the carrot cake churro,
2210000	2212000	which is, I think, in Frontierland.
2212000	2217000	Except the cream cheese frosting that comes with it has fucking raisins in it.
2217000	2220000	And raisins are disgusting and vile and they're...
2220000	2222000	Didn't we have this discussion before?
2222000	2224000	They're vile little liars.
2224000	2225000	All right.
2225000	2227000	Ruiners of cookies.
2227000	2232000	Let's get into some ruiners of gaming news here at Orange Lounge Radio,
2232000	2235000	together with you guys in our chat at live.vogue.com.
2235000	2237000	What's going on in gaming news this week? Loki.
2237000	2241000	So the FTC basically are giving Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony
2241000	2244000	a 30-day window to change their warranty language
2244000	2247000	to let consumers know that they can make repairs
2247000	2251000	or use third-party replacement products without voiding those warranties.
2251000	2255000	So you may remember, we talked about this a few weeks ago,
2255000	2259000	how they said in a press release that there are certain languages
2259000	2264000	in these warranty or end-user license agreements that were basically illegal,
2264000	2266000	but no one was really kind of enforcing that.
2266000	2269000	So now they're kind of coming down on them.
2269000	2271000	So basically this kind of includes a lot of things like,
2271000	2274000	you know, you may see those stickers on your console
2274000	2278000	where it says, warranty void if removed or damaged.
2278000	2281000	I know I had to deal with that with my 360s
2281000	2283000	because they would have that, you know,
2283000	2287000	oh hey, you can't open your 360 up to do anything.
2287000	2293000	But now they have to basically allow them that they can't have those.
2293000	2296000	Because it won't void the warranty if there's something done to it.
2296000	2298000	And also they have to have the right to repair,
2298000	2303000	which allows people to take them to a third-party location to have them repaired.
2303000	2307000	Also they were saying that they've also sent letters out to
2307000	2310000	HTC, Asus, and Hyundai as well.
2310000	2315000	But yeah, so it'd be interesting to see how that kind of,
2315000	2320000	I'm sure it's just going to be some fixes to their, you know,
2320000	2324000	warranty jargon or whatever.
2324000	2328000	Yeah, this is an interesting little change because of like everything
2328000	2331000	that's kind of, you know, trickled down from that original little thing
2331000	2333000	that they kind of yelled at Nintendo about, right?
2333000	2334000	Yeah.
2334000	2338000	So, I mean, it's good that you have other people, you know,
2338000	2341000	being able to fix those consoles and stuff.
2341000	2343000	I mean, I used to just ignore it anyways.
2343000	2346000	Or even better is you'd find a way to take the warranty sticker off
2346000	2347000	and then put it back on.
2347000	2348000	Put it back on.
2348000	2351000	I just get it a little bit hot, or it's like steaming open the envelope.
2351000	2352000	Yeah, something like that, yeah.
2352000	2357000	So, you know, it's, I don't know.
2357000	2359000	I think if you're taking it someplace to get it repaired,
2359000	2360000	it's like, well, fuck it.
2360000	2362000	They're not going to, you know,
2362000	2365000	why are you taking it someplace to get it repaired third-party
2365000	2367000	if the original company's not going to fix it?
2367000	2370000	I seem to remember back in the day,
2370000	2373000	with the earlier Sony consoles and maybe even Nintendo stuff,
2373000	2377000	you had your official authorized repair people.
2377000	2378000	Yeah, they don't do that anymore.
2378000	2380000	It's more, you have to, like, send that stuff in to them.
2380000	2381000	Oh, well.
2381000	2384000	Showing my age.
2384000	2385000	I don't know.
2385000	2386000	Okay.
2386000	2388000	I mean, good.
2388000	2392000	I think anybody should be able to repair that stuff, you know.
2392000	2394000	They shouldn't, your warranty shouldn't be voided,
2394000	2397000	especially for even, like, using third-party devices,
2397000	2399000	like third-party products because, I mean,
2399000	2402000	we had this whole, just recently, the whole thing with the third-party docks.
2402000	2404000	Right, that's like what I was talking about with the third-party docks
2404000	2406000	and, like, they were, like, fucking up consoles
2406000	2411000	and one of them came down really hard on Nintendo about that whole thing.
2411000	2414000	Yeah, it's like, there's no reason that should be fucking up your console.
2414000	2415000	Yeah.
2415000	2419000	You should get a little bit of choice into how to repair that stuff,
2419000	2422000	although I understand that they don't want people to go in there and just, you know, like...
2422000	2425000	Well, they don't want people modifying their device and they also, like...
2425000	2427000	They don't want to have to pay for your fuck-up.
2427000	2428000	Yeah, basically.
2428000	2429000	I get that.
2429000	2431000	I get that, but, you know, come on.
2431000	2432000	Yeah.
2432000	2435000	Well, moving on to a different story about Nintendo.
2435000	2441000	Let's talk about reading since Dark Sakura is going to DragCon this week.
2441000	2443000	You want to talk about reading? Let's talk about reading.
2443000	2444000	No.
2444000	2446000	The library is open.
2446000	2448000	Let's actually talk about reading
2448000	2452000	because Nintendo is pairing up with publisher Random House
2452000	2455000	for some books that are based on Nintendo characters.
2455000	2459000	These are books that are going to be coming in January of 2019 per Nintendo.
2459000	2463000	The books, the first two of which entered the marketplace in early January,
2463000	2467000	are based on Nintendo characters and worlds, including Super Mario,
2467000	2470000	The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and Animal Crossing.
2470000	2472000	So earlier this year in January,
2472000	2476000	Random House actually started two full-color official sticker books
2476000	2478000	based on Super Mario and Legend of Zelda.
2478000	2481000	So there's, like, the Super Mario official sticker book
2481000	2483000	and The Legend of Zelda official sticker book.
2483000	2485000	These are both $12.99.
2485000	2489000	This summer, Mario Time and Link's Book of Adventure are coming out.
2489000	2492000	There's going to also be a Splatoon official sticker book,
2492000	2495000	and, yeah, this is all sorts of fun things coming out.
2495000	2497000	So I'm not sure. It's weird that it's like,
2497000	2499000	okay, they're talking about there's books that are already out,
2499000	2502000	but then I guess there's also this team-up that's happening in 2019.
2502000	2505000	I don't know if that means we're going beyond stickers
2505000	2507000	and getting into, like, actual, like,
2507000	2511000	that's what it kind of reads like to me that we're actually, pun intended,
2511000	2514000	that we're actually getting into, like, books based on characters.
2514000	2517000	You know, like, maybe, like, a Dr. Seuss novel
2517000	2519000	but starring Mario type of thing.
2520000	2522000	Um...
2523000	2524000	Yeah.
2525000	2526000	Not a fan?
2526000	2531000	No. I mean, I know they do, like, a lot of the licensed stuff, but, you know.
2532000	2535000	I don't want to read about Mario. I'd rather play Mario.
2535000	2540000	Okay, my brain instantly goes to, and I know some of y'all remember this,
2540000	2543000	but those Worlds of Power books from when,
2543000	2545000	God, it was probably, like, the late 80s, early 90s,
2545000	2551000	when they turned, like, Castlevania 2, Ninja Gaiden,
2552000	2554000	was Contra a book too? I don't remember.
2554000	2557000	No, it was Mega Man. One of the Mega Mans was a book too.
2557000	2562000	They turned a bunch of old, like, video games from Nintendo, like, into books,
2562000	2564000	and they were, like, young adult novels.
2564000	2566000	Like, they were the types of things that, like,
2566000	2569000	you know, they were maybe, like, 100 pages in slightly bigger font,
2569000	2572000	but, you know, for an 11-year-old, it was, you know,
2572000	2574000	it was summertime reading for that.
2574000	2576000	I distinctly remember those books.
2576000	2581000	Blaster Master, that was a big one, because the Blaster Master one,
2581000	2584000	even though the books were not really, like,
2584000	2587000	nobody involved with the official games were involved with those books,
2587000	2592000	I think there was something about the people who made Blaster Master
2592000	2597000	actually incorporated something from that book into Blaster Master canon later on.
2597000	2599000	It was kind of a big deal. So, do you remember those?
2599000	2600000	Am I the only one that remembers these?
2600000	2602000	No, but I do remember something that's kind of random,
2602000	2605000	is I remember that they had some Nintendo scratchers,
2605000	2608000	not, like, you know, lottery tickets, but they're for kids,
2608000	2611000	where you play a little game where you had to, like, kind of,
2611000	2613000	it was kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure type thing,
2613000	2615000	but you had to scratch off the little spots,
2615000	2619000	and it would let you know if you, like, got killed or whatever.
2619000	2621000	I don't remember. But I remember they had some-
2621000	2622000	You were eaten by a grew.
2622000	2625000	It was, like, I think the original Mario Brothers,
2625000	2627000	not, like, the new, you know, like, Super Mario Brothers.
2627000	2630000	I remember, though. I do remember having those.
2630000	2632000	Yes. They were, like, little maze cards, right?
2632000	2633000	Yeah.
2633000	2634000	Yeah, I remember those.
2634000	2635000	Yeah.
2635000	2636000	That was the thing.
2636000	2638000	I don't know what they were, but, like, I sort of remember that.
2638000	2640000	Let's see. D'Artizia says,
2640000	2642000	I remember seeing pictures of the scratch cards,
2642000	2644000	and also Metal Gear had a book, I think, in that series.
2644000	2645000	Yes, it did.
2645000	2647000	Metal Gear absolutely had a book.
2647000	2648000	And it wasn't bad.
2648000	2651000	At least my 11-year-old self thought it wasn't bad.
2651000	2653000	Now, if I probably went back and read it now,
2653000	2655000	I'd probably be like, this is trash.
2655000	2656000	I'm gonna go looking for it.
2656000	2657000	Are you gonna-
2657000	2662000	I wanna say that the complete text is available online.
2662000	2665000	Oh, yeah, the PDF is out there, but hold on.
2665000	2668000	There's actually a Metal Gear Solid novel.
2668000	2669000	Not Metal Gear Solid.
2669000	2672000	I know, I'm looking for the old book.
2672000	2673000	Worlds of Power.
2673000	2674000	I'm almost positive it was called that.
2674000	2676000	It was, like, Blaster Master was one.
2676000	2678000	Anyway, Kaijiro in chat says,
2678000	2681000	I'm gonna start a new trend on Twitch with those sticker books.
2681000	2683000	It's gonna be called Let's Read.
2683000	2686000	I actually have a friend who does a lot of that on his channel.
2686000	2688000	Holy shit, they went 43 bucks for this.
2688000	2689000	For those books?
2689000	2691000	For the Metal Gear one.
2691000	2692000	Dang.
2692000	2693000	July 1st, 1990.
2693000	2695000	It wasn't that good.
2695000	2697000	There's the Blaster Master book.
2697000	2698000	There's a Ninja Gaiden book.
2698000	2699000	Yep, I remember these.
2699000	2700000	I'm just looking at the list of them.
2700000	2701000	I had them all.
2701000	2702000	You could get them at the grocery store.
2702000	2705000	Like, it was the same people that did the steamy romance novels.
2705000	2708000	It's just that, you know, it was like a young adult thing.
2708000	2710000	Dude, I actually more want the Ninja Gaiden one.
2710000	2713000	Do you remember when the grocery stores would sell steamy romance novels?
2713000	2714000	They still do.
2714000	2715000	Do they still do?
2715000	2717000	They're just over in the, like, magazine section.
2717000	2719000	See, the magazine section isn't, like, prominent anymore.
2719000	2721000	It's, like, hidden away with, like, because who buys magazines?
2721000	2724000	Ooh, okay, so I can get the Ninja Gaiden one for $5.94.
2724000	2727000	But yeah, they still have trashy novels.
2727000	2728000	That's all that's there.
2728000	2730000	Trashy novels and, like, magazines that no one's read.
2730000	2731000	I didn't think trashy novels were, like, still a thing.
2731000	2732000	Oh god, they are.
2732000	2733000	Yeah.
2733000	2734000	Okay.
2734000	2735000	How do you know all this?
2735000	2736000	It's in good condition.
2736000	2737000	I know because I look at those.
2737000	2738000	I'm like, those are dumb.
2738000	2739000	Who would buy that?
2739000	2740000	And then I look at the magazines.
2740000	2741000	Those are also dumb.
2741000	2742000	Who would buy those?
2742000	2743000	And then I go purchase, like, what else is on the aisle?
2746000	2747000	No, it's not candy.
2747000	2748000	It's, like, it's cleaning supplies.
2748000	2752000	Like, it's, I need to go get some dishwasher pods.
2752000	2755000	Okay, like, if I'm at Rite Aid or something, there's always, like, the, like, OK magazine.
2755000	2758000	And, like, all the, all the ridiculous shit.
2758000	2761000	Like, I don't know who is buying, like, Inquirer and Weekly.
2761000	2763000	I don't even think Weekly World News is around anymore.
2763000	2764000	But other stuff like it.
2764000	2766000	Oh, I love Weekly World News.
2766000	2769000	Like, this is, like, the complete, it's always, like, some horrible picture of Hillary Clinton.
2769000	2772000	And it's, like, Killory did this this week.
2772000	2776000	You know, it's, like, totally, like, like, all these, like, just straight up, like, made-up shit.
2776000	2778000	That's, like, on these magazines.
2778000	2782000	Or, you know, Cher given six months to live.
2782000	2785000	And, like, this really horrible picture of Cher or something like that.
2785000	2787000	Like, I'm like, who buys this garbage?
2787000	2793000	So, VG Museum that hosts the Castlevania dungeon has the Simon's Quest book as PDF.
2793000	2794000	Oh, okay.
2794000	2796000	I'm sorry, as a Word version of plain text.
2796000	2797000	Interesting.
2797000	2801000	I wouldn't think that's legal, but maybe after so many years, maybe it's public domain at some point?
2801000	2802000	No.
2802000	2804000	Well, I'm saving it because I'm going to read it.
2804000	2808000	Yeah, literary stuff shouldn't go into the public domain after just 30 years.
2808000	2810000	I mean, it's not even quite been 30 years, so.
2810000	2814000	It's probably illegal, but they're probably just not selling those books anymore.
2814000	2816000	So, no harm, no foul, I suppose.
2816000	2818000	I'm sure they stopped selling those a long time ago.
2818000	2823000	Well, anyway, if you want to get some new books, you'll be able to get Random House doing some Nintendo books in the near future.
2823000	2826000	You know, it does kind of make sense, though, before we go to the next story.
2826000	2834000	It does kind of make sense because Nintendo's kind of like ramping up with this whole, you know, we thought they were never going to let the rights away to make a movie again.
2834000	2836000	Well, they're going to be making a movie.
2836000	2839000	They're going to be doing this theme park stuff that's, you know, coming to Universal Studios.
2839000	2850000	So, maybe Nintendo is kind of learning to let go of some of the licensing a little bit and not keeping it so close to their chest, realizing that they're not going to do it all, so they might as well let somebody do it that, you know, puts Mario.
2850000	2852000	I mean, Mario is like fucking Mickey Mouse at this point.
2852000	2853000	Right?
2853000	2855000	Like, everybody knows who fucking Mario is.
2855000	2857000	Anyway.
2857000	2859000	Moving on, some more stories.
2859000	2860000	Dark Sakura.
2860000	2862000	You'll have to tear yourself away from your new book.
2862000	2864000	Oh, I just linked it in the chatroom.
2864000	2870000	At any rate, though, we had talked before a few weeks ago about the World Video Game Hall of Fame.
2870000	2872000	They had their nominees.
2872000	2882000	Well, now they have decided which ones are going to be the final four as it is.
2882000	2888000	It's going to be John Madden Football, Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy VII, and Space War.
2888000	2895000	And these are, of course, were all selected from a player's choice ballot and then an advisory board.
2895000	2904000	So, you know, to be accepted, they have to be iconic and have stood the test of time and must have worldwide appeal.
2904000	2908000	So, I guess I could see John Madden Football.
2908000	2910000	I mean, the original John Madden Football.
2910000	2911000	Yeah.
2911000	2914000	Tomb Raider, yeah, I'd give it that too.
2914000	2917000	It is franchise spawning, you know, and is still going today.
2917000	2921000	Final Fantasy VII, got the fan following.
2921000	2923000	Still a decent game.
2923000	2925000	And Sephiroth's hair.
2925000	2927000	And Space War, pretty classic.
2927000	2935000	So, of course, you know, you might not have played it if you were not around in 1962.
2935000	2936000	I don't know.
2936000	2939000	I cannot say that I was around in 1962 to play that game.
2939000	2946000	Although, actually, it was the original one that was the 1962, but it did go, you know, and spread as it went through.
2946000	2958000	And then Computer Space was the first mass market version as distributed by Nolan Bushnell.
2958000	2959000	So, there you go.
2959000	2960000	All right.
2960000	2962000	Very cool.
2962000	2965000	Do you think the right selections were made?
2965000	2967000	Yeah.
2967000	2973000	I remember talking about this before when the nominees were out, because DDR was on the list of nominees.
2973000	2975000	And I was like, I don't think that one's going to get picked.
2975000	2977000	It's not the year.
2977000	2978000	Now's not the time.
2978000	2980000	Now is not your year, DDR.
2980000	2983000	I mean, there's logic behind them.
2983000	2988000	And I'm glad that, you know, something that was more of a pioneering game like Space War,
2988000	2989000	was included this time.
2989000	2990000	Yeah, for sure.
2990000	2991000	Yeah.
2991000	2992000	Makes sense.
2992000	2993000	All right.
2993000	2994000	Let's move on.
2994000	2995000	Loki.
2995000	2998000	So, this week, they had a new trailer for Red Dead Redemption 2.
2998000	3001000	And along with that, there's some press outlets that have been kind of talking about the game,
3001000	3006000	since they got a 45-minute demo of Red Dead Redemption 2 at Rockstar North.
3006000	3012000	So, they were talking about some of what they saw, because, I guess, they wasn't playable,
3012000	3014000	but they got the watch through.
3014000	3019000	So, with it, I guess the game is going to have the honor system returning back from the original game.
3019000	3026000	So, depending on how you interact with people in the game, it will affect on how other people will, you know, see you,
3026000	3029000	whether you're evil or good and that type of stuff.
3029000	3033000	They talked about how there's, you know, different ways you can handle situations.
3033000	3039000	So, like, one instance, they were saying how there was, you know, a lot of people in the game,
3039000	3047000	one instance, they were saying how there was a fishing camp that you can loot and then the fishermen catch you.
3047000	3053000	And so, you can either, you know, give everything back, you can threaten them, or you can kill them.
3053000	3056000	And those are your kind of options there.
3056000	3064000	They said that, you know, the game, of course, they're trying to, they're saying that they're not trying to outdo them,
3065000	3070000	any other company, or, like, when you, since there's a lot of different open world games now,
3070000	3074000	like Zelda and Assassin's Creed, Far Cry 5 and that type of stuff.
3074000	3079000	So, they're basically trying to outdo themselves, which is great because I consider, you know,
3079000	3083000	Rockstar Games one of the best open world game companies out there.
3083000	3086000	And then one thing they did not show, though, was multiplayer.
3086000	3090000	So, I guess we're going to have to wait for E3 to see some of that.
3090000	3094000	But they did announce during the trailer when the game's scheduled to come out,
3094000	3098000	which is October 26th on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
3098000	3101000	No word on PC yet, which is kind of disappointing.
3101000	3106000	I would love it on PC, but usually with the last few games, PC comes later.
3107000	3109000	So, we'll just wait.
3110000	3114000	Yeah, because aren't they, like, worried about rampant piracy on PC and all that stuff?
3114000	3117000	I don't know if that's really the case any, I mean, sure, I guess,
3117000	3120000	but, like, I think they don't really necessarily care anymore
3120000	3123000	because a lot of that's not necessarily made on the game's sales anymore.
3123000	3126000	It's made on, you know, the online currency,
3126000	3129000	so I don't really think that it's such an issue anymore.
3129000	3131000	So, do you think that maybe they should just make Red Dead Free?
3133000	3135000	No, it's definitely worth money.
3135000	3139000	And unlike, you know, some games that just have the online component,
3139000	3143000	I mean, it is a solid single player campaign,
3143000	3149000	so I would definitely say it's worth the $60 at least.
3149000	3152000	I mean, the original game was fantastic,
3152000	3156000	so I have no doubts that it's going to be a great game.
3158000	3163000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with vognetwork.com,
3163000	3165000	use the passphrase BANKER.
3166000	3170000	Yeah, even I'm curious to check it out, but you know how it goes.
3170000	3176000	Yes, I know. How much time we played Grand Theft Auto 5.
3176000	3178000	Why am I being attacked?
3178000	3180000	You brought it up.
3181000	3184000	Dungeonbuster in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
3184000	3189000	the poster for Red Dead Redemption 2 makes the main character look a bit like Charles Bronson.
3189000	3192000	I would play an open world Western as Charles Bronson.
3194000	3197000	It's not Bronson, but remember they tried to do a,
3198000	3205000	what was it, it was a Dirty Harry game, but that never ended up happening.
3206000	3210000	I remember that was like E3 2006 or something like that.
3212000	3216000	Alright, well moving on to patent court, patent trolls,
3216000	3218000	well not really, I don't know if you'd call this a troll though.
3218000	3221000	I mean, we have stories on the show all the time about trolls,
3221000	3223000	but this one is going to be kind of...
3223000	3224000	A reach maybe?
3224000	3226000	It's a little bit open to interpretation I think.
3226000	3232000	So let's talk about this one because Nintendo is apparently being sued,
3232000	3235000	or taken to court by Gamevice.
3235000	3241000	This is a company that made the WikiPad and some Snap-on controllers for mobile devices.
3241000	3246000	So you know how like there's no official controller for like Apple phones or for Android,
3246000	3248000	you know there's no official controller.
3248000	3252000	So these are folks that make little devices that kind of like cling to your phone
3252000	3255000	and become controllers that basically will work with games and stuff.
3255000	3261000	So basically they say that the Nintendo Switch violates the patents on attachable handheld gamepads
3261000	3263000	and the related accessories.
3263000	3266000	Gamevice is requesting a cease and desist order against Nintendo,
3266000	3270000	meaning the Switch would be halted for its imports into the US.
3270000	3273000	Nintendo has declined to comment on the investigation,
3273000	3275000	and we'll see what Gamevice has to say soon.
3275000	3277000	It's going to get thrown out.
3277000	3283000	As should be noted, Gamevice sued Nintendo already in August for violating the WikiPad patents.
3283000	3286000	It dropped it in October.
3286000	3287000	So...
3287000	3288000	This is going to get thrown out.
3288000	3289000	You think so?
3289000	3290000	I think so.
3290000	3292000	Well, and here's the thing is that usually we say troll
3292000	3295000	because usually these are coming from companies that aren't actively using patents.
3295000	3300000	Like they're just sitting on these things they've acquired that just sit in a storage thing somewhere.
3300000	3304000	Whereas now, okay, at least you can say this company, Gamevice,
3304000	3308000	they've been making things that snap onto devices,
3308000	3311000	but does the Switch really infringe on that?
3311000	3312000	That's the question.
3312000	3313000	I don't think so.
3313000	3316000	I think one thing that the Switch does too, you have to remember,
3316000	3320000	is that those devices, they latch onto multiple things too.
3320000	3321000	Wouldn't that be kind of a big...
3321000	3324000	Like that's a big difference because you can take those things,
3324000	3326000	you can use them individually,
3326000	3328000	which is another kind of distinction,
3328000	3330000	is that they're not like...
3330000	3332000	You can use them individually and that's one way.
3332000	3333000	You can put them on the dog ears, that's another way.
3333000	3335000	Or you can put them on the tablet and that's another way.
3335000	3339000	So they're not used for one function, they're used for multiple functions,
3339000	3341000	and being on the tablet is just one of them.
3341000	3345000	But then again, I'm not going to claim to be a lawyer when it comes to patents,
3345000	3346000	so I don't fucking know.
3346000	3349000	But it just seems like this is different enough to me.
3349000	3350000	And they're not the only company that's had...
3350000	3352000	I mean, I'm sure that...
3352000	3356000	I think Nintendo has copyrights or trademarks or whatever
3356000	3359000	on certain aspects of their controller anyways.
3359000	3360000	That's true.
3360000	3363000	It's like, you want to play that type of game?
3363000	3367000	I'm sure they could sue you over some sort of patent issue or whatever,
3367000	3368000	but I don't...
3368000	3370000	Is Gamefy still making these things? I don't even know.
3370000	3375000	I mean, the problem with the third-party controllers for phones
3375000	3378000	is that since there is no standard, a lot of them are garbage
3378000	3380000	because they only work with certain games.
3380000	3382000	It does look like garbage too.
3382000	3386000	And the other big difference is that the Switch is an integral part
3386000	3388000	of the function of the device,
3388000	3391000	whereas this is a peripheral.
3391000	3394000	The Nintendo system is a flat-out system.
3394000	3395000	That's a good point.
3395000	3397000	I'm wondering also, too, being that each controller,
3397000	3399000	each half can be used as its own controller,
3399000	3402000	if that's also different enough as well.
3402000	3404000	It would be interesting to see.
3404000	3405000	I don't know.
3405000	3406000	I think they can...
3406000	3408000	I mean, sure, you can try.
3409000	3411000	Just don't think they're going to win.
3413000	3414000	Well, we'll see what happens.
3414000	3417000	Maybe they'll be trying to settle out a court or something.
3417000	3420000	ASCII in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
3420000	3422000	another company trying to get rich quick.
3422000	3425000	They were never going to do anything with their old technology anyway.
3425000	3428000	Well, to be fair, they have put out these...
3428000	3430000	Unlike other patent trolls we see,
3430000	3433000	they have put out a device that works for cell phones.
3433000	3435000	I don't know if it's sold very well.
3435000	3437000	I mean, I haven't heard of it before,
3437000	3439000	so maybe they need to recoup some of those costs.
3439000	3440000	I don't know.
3440000	3444000	But that is why I was a little hesitant to flat-out call it a troll
3444000	3447000	because when it's trolls, like these companies,
3447000	3451000	they make their income off of suing people.
3451000	3454000	This company, you know, you could argue, well...
3454000	3456000	They're trying to supplement their income by suing.
3456000	3458000	Yes, exactly.
3458000	3459000	Perfect.
3459000	3462000	SEO 100 Matt does point out they do have a legit website.
3462000	3464000	Their products are sold in mass chains.
3464000	3466000	So this is a little different, a little different.
3466000	3468000	Sia Tabiri in chat says,
3468000	3470000	didn't Apple basically get patents on the home button
3470000	3473000	and multi-touch functionality at some point
3473000	3475000	and then eventually it was, oh yeah, no,
3475000	3478000	that's too vague to actually enforce.
3478000	3482000	The trademark copyright stuff in this country is so...
3482000	3484000	It doesn't work.
3484000	3486000	You're taking rules that were written
3486000	3488000	before technology existed.
3488000	3492000	It's allegedly violations of the tariff act of 1930.
3492000	3495000	Because 1930 knew what the fucking internet
3495000	3497000	or like video games and all that stuff was going to do.
3497000	3500000	Plus I think there's been subsequent cases since then
3500000	3504000	that have shown that certain aspects of those prior laws
3504000	3506000	are now considered irrelevant
3506000	3509000	and completely have no basis in modern society.
3509000	3512000	And plus as travel gets faster,
3512000	3515000	as the internet makes the world more and more global,
3515000	3518000	I mean, we've seen where like other countries
3518000	3520000	will just straight up rip shit off
3520000	3523000	and there's no price to pay because they're not in the US.
3523000	3525000	So that further complicates...
3525000	3527000	Looking at you, China.
3527000	3529000	Well, yeah, I mean, but interestingly enough about China,
3529000	3531000	you know, there has been talk about, you know,
3531000	3535000	not that I really want to get into politics discussion here on the show,
3535000	3538000	but there has been talk about China has been kind of called out
3538000	3540000	for this on a political level
3540000	3543000	and has agreed to some extent to work on it.
3543000	3545000	And we'll kind of leave it at that. We don't know what that means.
3545000	3548000	But at least it means something that they kind of acknowledged it.
3548000	3550000	Something.
3550000	3553000	Anyway, that's more than we've had for, you know, years.
3553000	3556000	Anyway, Dr. Suyin Chat says,
3556000	3558000	I mean, I could almost see where they're coming from,
3558000	3561000	but agree the trademark laws need serious updating and revising.
3561000	3563000	As Dr. Suyin Chat says,
3563000	3566000	it's going to take a lot to fix the patent copyright trademark laws in this country.
3566000	3568000	It needs to happen, no question.
3568000	3570000	Well, I think one of the right moves that they're making, though,
3570000	3573000	is that, and I think this was a very recent Supreme Court thing,
3573000	3576000	is that they basically said that you can no longer pick and choose
3576000	3578000	where to file these patent lawsuits.
3578000	3580000	You know, like all of these patents,
3580000	3582000	like a big majority of these patent lawsuits
3582000	3584000	were all being filed in one town in Texas
3584000	3587000	because it had like the friendliest court, you know,
3587000	3590000	if you will, to like some of the rules that the patent trolls try to go by.
3590000	3593000	Well, the Supreme Court has basically shut that down and said,
3593000	3597000	no, you have to file in a place where you do business, basically.
3597000	3600000	And that makes logical sense.
3600000	3604000	I can't see that being a Republican or Democrat issue.
3604000	3607000	I mean, I don't know, I haven't read really that far into it,
3607000	3610000	but I can't see where that is controversial to say,
3610000	3613000	you need to file it in a place where you exist.
3613000	3615000	You know what I mean?
3615000	3617000	I think that's a good first step.
3617000	3620000	So we just need more stuff like that.
3620000	3623000	Anyway, let's move on before I get too far into politics.
3623000	3626000	Let's talk about gaming politics, DarkSakura.
3626000	3629000	Oh, you know I get fired up on that.
3629000	3634000	But, well, you know, we had been talking about,
3634000	3636000	well, this isn't really political.
3636000	3639000	It's more of a reaction, I think, to the politics.
3639000	3643000	But Destiny 2 is doing something to revamp the loot box system
3643000	3648000	by coming out with something called a prismatic matrix.
3648000	3652000	So the way it'll work is that you'll get ten Eververse items
3652000	3654000	from season three each week that it's active,
3654000	3658000	but they also will knock out things that you've already received
3658000	3660000	so that you get something unique every time.
3660000	3665000	And if you activate one ten times, you will get every item.
3665000	3669000	So you can earn those things too.
3669000	3672000	You can pay for them with in-game currency.
3673000	3679000	Previous activations will also knock things off of the rewards list
3679000	3683000	so that you're guaranteed to get something different each time.
3683000	3685000	Seems like it's an improvement.
3685000	3688000	The whole catch, though, with this is that...
3688000	3690000	There's still loot boxes.
3690000	3692000	Right, you get one a week.
3692000	3697000	So if you want more, it's 200 silvers, which is $2.
3697000	3701000	So you can get more if you feel like paying for it,
3701000	3705000	but, you know, you got to pay for it.
3705000	3708000	Or you could be patient. Patience!
3708000	3709000	Patience.
3709000	3710000	Have some.
3710000	3712000	All right, let's move on.
3712000	3715000	We're just a couple more stories away from our classic game of the week.
3715000	3716000	But first, Loki.
3716000	3719000	Yes, unfortunately, not some great news,
3719000	3725000	but one very popular YouTube personality, John TotalBiscuitBain,
3725000	3727000	he came out...
3727000	3732000	He's been fighting bowel cancer for several years now.
3732000	3734000	And so he posted something...
3734000	3740000	Or I should say his PR had posted something on his official Reddit
3740000	3742000	talking about his current situation.
3742000	3744000	So I'm just going to read some of this real quick
3744000	3747000	because it kind of sums up the whole problem.
3747000	3749000	So when I went into a hospital a week or so ago,
3749000	3751000	it was accompanied by the news that
3751000	3754000	a conventional chemotherapy's effectiveness has been exhausted.
3754000	3757000	My body has now become resistant to all forms,
3757000	3759000	according to my oncologist.
3759000	3762000	46 chemo treatments, 138 days plugged into the pump.
3762000	3765000	Let nobody ever say I wasn't stubborn.
3765000	3768000	Unfortunately, this was followed up by a couple days later
3768000	3769000	with some more bad news.
3769000	3773000	My liver is failing and its effectiveness has lowered past to the point
3773000	3777000	where clinical trials I had been offered would take me on.
3777000	3781000	Yes, apparently there are things that are too dangerous for even the terminal.
3781000	3784000	Obviously, we're going to keep looking for other trials,
3784000	3790000	but I'm currently coming to terms with the fact that I don't have long left.
3790000	3794000	And right now, at any rate, there's literally nothing I can do about it
3794000	3797000	other than trying to manage pain as best as I can,
3797000	3800000	stay hydrated as possible to ease the pressure on my liver.
3800000	3804000	And then with that, he basically said,
3804000	3808000	it's now a case of, what do I do with the time I have left?
3808000	3809000	Why am I telling you?
3809000	3812000	Because you're a viewer of my content and this is relevant to you.
3812000	3814000	So what he's basically said he's going to do,
3814000	3817000	he's going to stop doing the games critic bit.
3817000	3820000	He's going to keep doing his co-optional podcast
3820000	3826000	and just basically hoping that after, it's just a matter of time.
3826000	3829000	He's basically, he knows he's going to die
3829000	3834000	and it's just about being comfortable and spending time with family and everything.
3834000	3837000	He's hoping that his wife takes over with the channel
3837000	3838000	and everything once he's done,
3838000	3841000	but he's trying to provide for them at the same time.
3841000	3842000	It's unfortunate.
3842000	3847000	I mean, he's been very prominent in the whole gaming industry
3847000	3851000	and it's sad to see that this has happened
3851000	3854000	because at one point, it had gone in the remission
3854000	3856000	and he was doing better, but it just came back.
3856000	3860000	Yeah. I mean, I haven't always seen eye to eye on some of his opinions,
3860000	3862000	but some of them I have agreed with
3862000	3864000	and now is not really the time for that sort of debate.
3864000	3873000	Cancer fucking sucks and I hope he can be as comfortable as possible
3873000	3877000	and get everything that can be done off that bucket list that he wants to do.
3877000	3880000	I have such respect for the fact that he does want to keep doing that podcast
3880000	3882000	right up to the very end because I would like to think,
3882000	3884000	heaven forbid, I would probably be the same way
3884000	3888000	that you would wheel me in here on Sunday nights if you had to
3888000	3893000	and that hopefully Alan or somebody would just be the one to push the buttons
3893000	3900000	or one of you guys, I don't know, but I would like to think that I could be that,
3900000	3903000	I don't know the word I'm looking for, I could be that dedicated, I guess,
3903000	3905000	in the face of something so scary.
3905000	3910000	So props to him and our thoughts with him
3910000	3913000	and the folks that are going to keep it going over there.
3913000	3919000	And yeah, some nice, hearty, fuck cancer, cancer sucks.
3919000	3920000	Yeah, pretty much.
3920000	3921000	Pretty much.
3921000	3931000	You know, I think it's a somber reminder of, you know, that not to make this about me,
3931000	3932000	but I guess I'm going to.
3932000	3934000	But you all remember, I'm coming up on 10 years.
3934000	3937000	So 10 years ago, remember when I was like really sick
3937000	3940000	and I had that scare with pancreatic cancer, but it turns out it was pancreatitis?
3940000	3942000	That's what my granny died of.
3942000	3945000	And it's some scary shit, you know.
3945000	3950000	And so 10 years ago, you know, I used to be very much that person that was like,
3950000	3953000	oh my God, when I turn 30, it's over.
3953000	3957000	I'm going to die single and alone because I'm turning 30.
3957000	3959000	Well, there's like even all sorts of things.
3959000	3962000	Like, for example, there is this woman that posts,
3962000	3966000	she does a lot of YouTube videos as well, and she posts a lot on shitty robots,
3966000	3969000	which is she makes a bunch of shitty robots because that's what she does.
3969000	3973000	She said she had like a swollen eye for like a few months and it ends up,
3973000	3978000	it's a brain tumor. Thankfully, it's not cancerous, but it's still a brain tumor.
3978000	3981000	And so it's like, you know, get your shit checked out.
3981000	3984000	I mean, like you never know. And that's kind of the thing, too,
3984000	3988000	is like that was one of the things that John would like to, you know,
3988000	3991000	kind of emphasize out there is like, get your shit checked out, you know,
3991000	3992000	go see a doctor.
3992000	3996000	Well, one of the YouTubers I was following for a while, Haven Games,
3996000	4000000	who did the World of Warcraft, you know, how to get outside the bounds
4000000	4002000	and everything, which is, you know, one of my favorite things to do.
4003000	4007000	He died at 26 of epithelial sarcoma.
4007000	4011000	Yeah. So I didn't really get to finish my thoughts.
4011000	4016000	No, no, no, it's fine. We all have stories, but just, you know,
4016000	4020000	to hear that I had a condition that did not have a 100 percent survival rate
4020000	4023000	was very much like a very like sobering moment.
4023000	4026000	And it like it changed my perspective on a lot of things,
4026000	4029000	because from that point on, it was like I get to be 30.
4029000	4032000	Like, yay, I'm going to be 30. And you know what?
4032000	4036000	I met Alan when I was 31 and things have turned out okay.
4036000	4038000	And now I'm looking at 40 in the face.
4038000	4041000	And even though there's still kind of that part of me that's like,
4041000	4046000	um, you know, here I, here comes 40. There's still that I, but come on,
4046000	4048000	come on, you had to have experienced some of this too.
4048000	4049000	You know what I'm talking about, right?
4049000	4054000	And that's not like I'm walking around every day going, Oh, maybe 40.
4054000	4057000	But I'm kind of, you know, there are some of those answers like, Oh, 40.
4057000	4059000	I don't feel so bad about it because I keep getting carded.
4059000	4063000	Shouldn't I have a bigger savings account if I'm going to be 40?
4063000	4066000	It's those types of things. But I'm like, I'm, I'm again,
4066000	4069000	I'm trying to be like, you know what? Like, cool.
4069000	4074000	Like I'm going to be 40, but I don't feel 40. And that's cool.
4074000	4079000	Like I don't want to be all the like 40 is the new 20 or like Molly Shannon
4079000	4081000	on Saturday Night Live when she's playing that one character going,
4081000	4086000	and I'm 50. Yeah. But that's kind of how I feel.
4086000	4090000	I'm like, okay, cool. 40. And don't even wait until like your, you know,
4090000	4095000	our age to start checking. I mean, John Bain's 33. Yeah. So I mean, yeah,
4095000	4099000	it can just speak with, I mean, check it. Don't let,
4099000	4104000	talk to your doctor, check your balls, check your titties. Like, you know,
4104000	4108000	don't be afraid of weird things. Get your vaccines.
4108000	4111000	Yeah. Get your vaccines and all that stuff. Well,
4111000	4114000	I mean is one thing with all the health issues that members of my family have
4114000	4119000	had. That was why I've been so adamant about blood tests and making sure I
4119000	4121000	take care of myself and doing all these things.
4121000	4126000	It is never too early to start look to start preparing for the inevitable.
4128000	4131000	Get a 401k if your work offers one.
4131000	4136000	I had a discussion recently with somebody about like what would happen in the
4136000	4140000	role I would play if this person should pass away unexpectedly. And it was,
4141000	4144000	you know, and somebody my age and it's, it was a very kind of like,
4144000	4146000	this is morbid. I don't like talking about it. But at the same time,
4146000	4147000	I was like,
4147000	4150000	this is extremely responsible of you to be thinking of these sorts of things and
4150000	4152000	setting up for, you know,
4152000	4156000	what may happen to a child in these types of scenarios. You know, I'm like,
4156000	4159000	I kind of like, even though I really don't like talking about it,
4159000	4162000	I kind of like greatly respect it sort of thing. So anyway,
4162000	4164000	and then I'm getting yelled at, not yelled at,
4164000	4167000	but I'm getting a dirty eyes from some of our chatters right now in the chat
4167000	4171000	over at live.vognetware.com. Brad from Geek Spin goes, fuck you, Rob.
4171000	4173000	I'm staring at 50, but ends it with a smiley face.
4173000	4176000	So anyways, that's totally serious. Tiger class says, Rob Roberts,
4176000	4181000	I'm 45 and I feel fine. You know what? And I'm 39 and I feel just fine too.
4181000	4184000	It's not just saying just because other people are dying of things doesn't mean
4184000	4186000	you're going to be dying of things,
4186000	4189000	but it never hurts to check that stuff out so that if there is an issue,
4189000	4190000	you can catch it early.
4190000	4193000	And it's also a reminder to like be thankful for the time you do have,
4193000	4195000	you know, and realize that, you know,
4195000	4204000	tomorrow, tomorrow a meteor could hit like the dinosaurs got disintegrated.
4204000	4208000	It might suddenly one day it could be you one day.
4208000	4212000	It just might be like, I don't feel so good. And that's it. All right.
4212000	4215000	Anyway, you know, and that was funny because you just made it.
4215000	4219000	I know. Don't. I just, I'm just thinking of Dennis Leary now. Okay.
4219000	4222000	I'm not. All right. One day you get it or you don't.
4222000	4227000	A man actually nudges his poodle off the 30th story and it lands on you and
4227000	4232000	you're dead death by poodle. Anyway. Uh, anyway, I don't,
4232000	4236000	I didn't mean for the show to go that deep, but you know, I think, um,
4236000	4239000	you know, when we hear these, what was that in? Was it, was it,
4239000	4243000	no, it wasn't pushing daisies. It was six feet under six.
4243000	4246000	No, the one where she dies from, um,
4246000	4251000	a toilet seat hitting her from it was either an airplane or like space.
4252000	4256000	Oh, uh, dead like me. Dead like me. Yes. Yes. Oh, that show was so good.
4256000	4261000	Oh, that show was so good. That was the very first episode. Wasn't it? Yes.
4261000	4264000	That's how she does. That's how she does. All right. All right. Anyway,
4264000	4266000	a gold star for Sia Tiberi who called it out. It was a,
4266000	4269000	and clarifying it was a toilet seat from mirror.
4272000	4276000	All right. Anyhow, uh, let's go on to one more story here.
4276000	4280000	Let's, let's change the tone a little bit and get into a story about,
4280000	4282000	Ikaruga because guess what y'all,
4282000	4287000	Ikaruga is confirmed that it is coming out for the Nintendo switch.
4287000	4290000	I know where's radiant silver gun. We've had some rumors.
4290000	4294000	We've had some scuttlebutt when it comes to things like Ikaruga,
4294000	4297000	but it is confirmed it is coming out actually a little sooner rather than
4297000	4300000	later. It's coming out May 29th. So that's pretty exciting.
4300000	4304000	Uh, Ikaruga is coming out on the switch and let's see,
4304000	4307000	my original site for all the details. Was it working?
4307000	4312000	So I want to get, uh, uh, vertical mode. Thank you.
4312000	4314000	I wanted to confirm that cause I thought I had read that,
4314000	4316000	that they were going to do vertical mode in it. So that is confirmed.
4316000	4320000	Vertical mode is happening, right? Yep. Yay.
4320000	4323000	That's a great thing. Why you know shooters need that.
4323000	4325000	I have like a dock though, like for the switch.
4325000	4330000	I wonder if that will actually hold it in vertical mode. Um,
4330000	4334000	I don't think so. I mean you wouldn't want to play on your,
4334000	4336000	I mean if it docks then you wouldn't want to play on your team.
4336000	4339000	Well, no, no, it's, it's just a holder. Like it's meant cause,
4339000	4342000	cause my son is using it and he wanted to charge at the same time and you
4342000	4347000	can't, it sucks ass. So you can't, you know, use that.
4347000	4349000	It might go either way. But anyway,
4349000	4352000	this is obviously not the first time they've released Ikaruga,
4352000	4354000	but I think it's been a little while.
4354000	4356000	Like I know there was the Xbox 360 version.
4356000	4358000	I know it's been a little while since they've released it. So, um,
4358000	4363000	I just want a radiant silver gun release that I don't have to pay 250 bucks
4363000	4367000	for. Well, maybe if this does well, treasure treasure,
4367000	4372000	our will consider doing more treasure. Never does it in this game is done.
4372000	4377000	Well, can we get an Ikaruga to electric boogaloo? Sure. Sure.
4377000	4380000	Um, I don't know. Again, it's probably one of those things where it's like,
4380000	4382000	maybe if it sells well, they'll go back to the dry board. But then again,
4382000	4385000	you're right. It's like they always release Ikaruga and it always sells well
4385000	4386000	and they never do a new one.
4386000	4389000	So maybe they're just going to milk the classics for all it's worth,
4389000	4391000	which we're going to talk about SNK later in the show.
4391000	4396000	That's a Nintendo way. At least Nintendo makes some really good new games.
4396000	4399000	Come on. Come on. All right. Let's talk about some really good old games.
4400000	4402000	Oops. Oh my God. I played the wrong theme song.
4403000	4406000	And we're not talking about games anyway. All right. That's right.
4406000	4410000	So, uh, that was a fault start because we're really going to get into the
4410000	4413000	classic peripheral of the month. Once a month,
4413000	4416000	the dark soccer dives into the gaming vault and says, Hey, you know what?
4417000	4420000	Sometimes it's not about the game you play, but how you're playing.
4420000	4423000	Sometimes you need a controller that's as big as your fucking head.
4423000	4426000	So it's the classic. Oh, is it steel battalion? No. Yeah.
4426000	4428000	That was a good guess though, wasn't it? All right.
4428000	4431000	Here it is. The classic peripheral of the month. Dark soccer.
4431000	4436000	Which pick for us? It's the XC one AP. I have never heard of this.
4436000	4438000	You haven't really. It looks like a Metroid.
4439000	4442000	Kind of. It does. So I just picked a Moosham music in the background because
4442000	4445000	it's a, uh, a Genesis controller. Well, it's for,
4445000	4448000	it's for anything on the sake of the, that era.
4449000	4452000	You play with it. Well, just the first time I heard of it,
4452000	4455000	it was while they were playing Mooshah. So I picked Mooshah music.
4455000	4458000	I should probably do Mooshah as a classic game at some point if I haven't
4458000	4462000	already. Someone tell me if I've done Mooshah or something yet. Anyway,
4462000	4467000	it's by a company called Dempa and it was created for the,
4467000	4470000	the Sega mega drive. Cause this only came out in Japan.
4470000	4475000	It's also compatible with the Sega CD and the 32 X. Um,
4476000	4480000	and it also works on some of the Japanese computers out there.
4481000	4483000	It only came out in Japan. Um,
4483000	4487000	and it was released in 1989, uh,
4487000	4492000	with full analog capability before probably almost a
4492000	4496000	decade before analog itself became mainstream.
4497000	4501000	So, um, it retailed for, um,
4502000	4505000	well actually at its first release,
4505000	4509000	it was 13,800 yen. The real lease was 9,800 yen.
4510000	4512000	If you were to look on eBay right now,
4512000	4516000	you probably not find one of these for less than $250. Just saying.
4517000	4522000	Um, it has 10 buttons on it, including six buttons and four switches.
4522000	4526000	Um, four shoulder buttons. It was also one of the first, uh,
4527000	4531000	I would say major controllers that featured multiple, um, shoulder buttons.
4531000	4532000	Um,
4532000	4537000	it had an analog thumb stick and an analog slider that you could also rotate
4537000	4539000	the slider so it could go back and forth.
4539000	4543000	So it could technically become a throttle or another analog access.
4544000	4548000	Um, the buttons, you know, as I said, that six of, um, sorry,
4548000	4551000	that four of those 10 buttons or switches, um,
4551000	4554000	they will work with computers for controller, uh,
4554000	4556000	for changing some of the controller support.
4556000	4560000	And there were turbo switches, some that just weren't needed, um,
4560000	4564000	and a switch to put the controller into a digital mode that allowed it to be
4564000	4568000	compatible with all the, all the games on each systems, um,
4568000	4572000	except for ones that, uh, don't support joysticks. Um,
4573000	4578000	it also was meant to try to simulate some of the controls for games like
4579000	4584000	Afterburner 2 that ran on the, the Sega, is it Sega 10 or Sega X board?
4584000	4589000	Um, and then, like I said, it was re-released in 1994.
4589000	4594000	It is, uh, compatible with, um, a good number of games,
4594000	4601000	but on the Mega Drive it has, it's best, um, released for Afterburner 2, um,
4601000	4606000	Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP2, Fastest One Galaxy Force 2,
4606000	4609000	and Musha Aleste Full Metal Fighter Eleanor.
4609000	4613000	Mega CD would be Afterburner 3, Night Striker, and Starblade.
4613000	4616000	And 32X Afterburner complete in Space Harrier.
4618000	4622000	Which, by the way, the chat is confirming you did Musha in episode 621.
4622000	4624000	See, I'm sure I did it at some point.
4624000	4626000	You Wiki people are amazing.
4626000	4629000	I probably did Truxtun 2 at some point, you know.
4629000	4630000	Yeah.
4630000	4634000	And Robo Aleste and some of the other fucking games.
4634000	4640000	Um, but anyway, it also, the whole point of it having an analog thumbstick,
4640000	4645000	it actually predated the Nintendo 64 by about six years.
4645000	4651000	So, I mean, just coming to think about what a phenomenal piece of, uh, hardware peripheral this was,
4651000	4659000	you know, and it actually seems to, in some cases, been the, um, the, uh, inspiration for the Saturn 3D control pad.
4659000	4666000	Um, which, of course, then turned into the 3D control pad being the basis for the Dreamcast controller.
4666000	4671000	Which then was the inspiration for the Xbox controller, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
4671000	4673000	Um, this thing is fucking huge, though.
4673000	4681000	It is, like, I'll try to find it for the chat room, but it's probably, the circular aspect of it is probably
4681000	4690000	another centimeter large, centimeter to two centimeters larger in diameter than the Sega, um, Saturn's, uh, 3D control stick.
4690000	4692000	So, and it's supposed to be pretty heavy.
4692000	4694000	I would love to get my hands on one.
4694000	4701000	Dan said he had a chance, like, 20 years ago to get his hands on one and passed it up and regrets it.
4701000	4708000	So, someone finds me one for a hundred bucks. We'll talk. But, yeah.
4708000	4713000	Alright. There it is, your classic peripheral of the month.
4713000	4717000	XE1 AP by Dempa.
4717000	4719000	Alright. But you don't have one.
4719000	4722000	Sadly, I do not. I am not so fortunate.
4722000	4724000	They're a little cost prohibitive, it sounds like.
4724000	4726000	Yeah, they, they, they ain't cheap.
4726000	4732000	Yeah. Uh, SG100Matt saying, I'm looking at this and I've never seen or heard of this before. It looks ridiculous.
4732000	4736000	Well, Dark Soccer is here to educate you on all the ridiculous things.
4736000	4739000	It is pretty ridiculous, but the shit that it does.
4739000	4742000	I would like to see a size comparison with that and the Duke.
4742000	4744000	Oh, the original Xbox controller?
4744000	4750000	I found a picture of it with a six button, um, uh, Mega Drive controller, so I'll post that in the chat.
4750000	4754000	It does look kind of cool, though. Like, I can see why you picked it. It's, it's, like, super unique.
4754000	4760000	You know what I mean? Like, you don't, like, even if you were to compare it to the Duke or whatever, like, it's just, the way it is is very unique.
4760000	4762000	So, um, I like it.
4762000	4768000	Alright, anyhow, uh, we're gonna take a break, but when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
4768000	4771000	Uh, so we're gonna take a break and we'll be back, so stay tuned, y'all.
4777000	4786000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight, episode number 729, already in progress for this May the 6th of 2018.
4786000	4796000	I hope everybody had a good May the 4th and, uh, a fun Cinco de Mayo as well, even though I understand we kind of blow that holiday a little bit out of proportion here in the U.S.
4796000	4798000	But, you know, hopefully, uh, hopefully you still had a good day.
4798000	4803000	Uh, and certainly the Star Wars, uh, thing is, it's, like, I'm hearing that more and more often every year.
4803000	4807000	We actually did a little thing in my work this year around May the 4th. I thought it was really cute.
4807000	4813000	Uh, we got to wear, like, Star Wars shirts to work, which usually you don't get to wear a t-shirt to work, so it was, like, kind of, you know, fun stuff.
4814000	4819000	Uh, and then in chat they're saying Revenge of the 5th, yes, I've heard that too. Revenge of the 6th, I've heard it that way too, but...
4819000	4824000	I, I don't like the whole, um, like, cultural insensitivity aspect of it.
4824000	4825000	Of what?
4825000	4827000	Of the Cinco de Mayo thing.
4827000	4828000	Oh, of Cinco de Mayo?
4828000	4829000	Going back to that.
4829000	4833000	But there was a guy who had a giant taco on his head and it was so extra, I loved it.
4833000	4838000	Yeah, I mean, if you're, if you're gonna, if you're gonna go extra, be committed to your art.
4838000	4843000	He wore, like, a Hawaiian style shirt, except it was tacos and burritos. I kind of want a dress made out of that.
4843000	4845000	That's, you know, whatever.
4845000	4849000	I'm looking, I've been looking for fabric that's tacos and burritos to make a dress like that.
4849000	4853000	Act Deft in our, Act Deft in chat says, I really don't mind Cinco de Mayo at all.
4853000	4864000	You know, we, we kind of talked about that before. Remember how there was a lot of outrage on the tumblers of the net and so forth about the Mario in the, you know, mariachi type of costume?
4864000	4872000	And it was like, you know, is that appropriating Mexican culture? But you talk to most Mexicans and they're like, it's cool. Like, you know, put it out there.
4872000	4875000	Your costume DLC is not my culture.
4876000	4881000	It really is, though, an American phenomenon, this whole thing that everything is appropriation.
4881000	4886000	I'm a firm believer that you can have cultural appreciation.
4886000	4892000	Appropriation comes in when you start making money off of the disenfranchised population.
4892000	4893000	Right.
4893000	4895000	So just know the difference.
4895000	4897000	I think a lot of it's social media, too.
4897000	4899000	Like, it's just so easy to call out on social media.
4899000	4902000	And that's why, that's why I just don't, I don't, I don't like to get involved.
4902000	4907000	I still like to go back to karma at the end of the day and like, don't, don't call out unless you're ready to get called out.
4907000	4916000	So anyway, S2100 Matt in chat says, I'm a big Star Wars fan as much as the next, but I'm a little bah humbug on the May the 4th stuff.
4916000	4918000	It just feels so forced. Was that a pun?
4918000	4921000	But whatever, if you want to have fun with Star Wars that day, then go for it.
4921000	4924000	Tiger Klein chat says, when will there be a Marvel day?
4924000	4927000	You get, you get Marvel movies like four times a year now.
4927000	4929000	There's like superhero day, not that long ago.
4929000	4930000	That's right.
4930000	4933000	Anyway, okay, let's move on you guys.
4933000	4938000	Let's get back into some video games and what's going on rapidly with some rapid fire news.
4938000	4939000	Loki.
4939000	4940000	All right.
4940000	4944000	So you may remember Val's been adding different controller support to Steam.
4945000	4952000	So now one of the controllers that's also available for Steam use is a Switch Pro controller.
4952000	4958000	So you can actually select that in your controller settings and I guess you'll see screen prompts that match the Switch.
4958000	4960000	So that's pretty cool.
4960000	4965000	You can even kind of adjust what those are and stuff.
4965000	4970000	But I like how that actually maps everything to the correct buttons.
4971000	4976000	And then along with this, this is kind of a cool little free game as well.
4976000	4978000	I believe it's free.
4978000	4983000	So you may remember there was a game not too long ago called Surgeon Simulator,
4983000	4990000	which was, you know, kind of this physics based, you know, hard to control game that you had to perform surgery.
4990000	4992000	Surgery in quotes, of course.
4993000	5001000	Well, now there is a new game that's come out based on the London Dare 41 theme.
5001000	5008000	And it's by, I guess, the developer, Swavgav.
5008000	5010000	At least that's the page.
5010000	5015000	So swav, S-W-A-V dash G-A-V dot itch dot IO.
5015000	5017000	And the game's called Check, Please.
5017000	5021000	Basically, you're supposed to be going on a date.
5021000	5027000	And so you have to do date like things, but you have to use your hands are controlled with the mouse.
5027000	5035000	So you use the mouse to move your hand, you know, left click to hold and grab up and grab items and then right to rotate the hand.
5035000	5040000	So very similar to kind of like the whole Surgeon Simulator thing.
5040000	5042000	But it's fun and it is free.
5042000	5045000	So go check it out.
5045000	5046000	It looks very silly.
5046000	5047000	All right.
5047000	5053000	Some comments in chat on the things Loki was talking about, going back to the Switch controller on Steam, which I'm a fan of that.
5053000	5058000	You know, I'm a fan of more stuff in my house being able to be used on more things.
5058000	5059000	I'm all for that.
5059000	5063000	Well, it's great, like especially when you have like Steam games like, oh, hey, I got to do a multiplayer game.
5063000	5067000	Like I only have two PlayStation 4 controllers or one Xbox 360 controller.
5067000	5074000	It's like I want to do four players on like a game on my PC, plug into my TV and then just, hey, I've got all these controllers that work with it now.
5074000	5075000	OK, I like that.
5075000	5076000	That's a good good thought.
5076000	5083000	But over in chat at live.vognetwork.com, darktetsuya says, when will Steam add support for the XE1?
5083000	5087000	He says he's half joking, but I'm sure something on Steam could support it.
5087000	5088000	You never know.
5088000	5095000	I'm sure that with the right peripheral to be able to plug in Sega, was it Mega Drive?
5095000	5097000	Mega Drive, Sega CD and 32X.
5097000	5100000	So with the right peripheral, we'll port that to USB.
5100000	5103000	I'm sure Joy to Key, you can make anything possible.
5103000	5104000	That's right.
5104000	5107000	Kaijuto talking about the game that you were mentioning there, Logi.
5107000	5110000	Kaijuto wants to know, is this a jack off game?
5110000	5111000	No.
5111000	5113000	Well, Kaijuto, anything can be if you really want it to be.
5113000	5114000	It's not a jack off game.
5114000	5124000	It is you're having a fine, you're having a date in a restaurant and you have to like feed your date meatballs and like pay the check and stuff like that.
5124000	5125000	And it's really goofy.
5125000	5127000	You feed your date the balls.
5127000	5131000	You shove those sweaty balls.
5131000	5137000	Sia Tabiri mentions the jack off box party pack.
5137000	5138000	Alright, you guys are so mature.
5138000	5140000	I'm sure they have plenty of those games on Steam.
5140000	5141000	You guys are so fucking mature.
5141000	5144000	Alright, let's talk about Minecraft.
5144000	5146000	How about you guys get your minds out of the gutter?
5146000	5149000	We talk about a kids game called Minecraft.
5149000	5151000	Minecraft is getting another patch.
5151000	5154000	It's called the Aquatic Update, the Life Aquatic in Minecraft.
5154000	5159000	It's actually going to be the final update for the last gen versions of the game.
5159000	5163000	So if you're still playing on 360, PlayStation Vita is considered last gen.
5163000	5164000	Wii U, last gen.
5164000	5167000	These things are so last gen.
5167000	5171000	And only apparently 5% of Minecraft players are even playing on these systems.
5171000	5172000	So guess what?
5172000	5173000	This is it.
5173000	5175000	The Aquatic Update is it.
5175000	5180000	Microsoft will be focusing their efforts on improving the versions of the game where more players are active.
5180000	5190000	So this of course would be the PlayStation 4 version as well as the hybrid Minecraft version that's on Switch, Windows 10, all the other places basically.
5190000	5199000	So the patch not yet available on Switch, but I guess Microsoft still is going to be doing the Better Together update for that platform.
5199000	5201000	I guess that's not all quite there yet.
5201000	5203000	Yeah, so once they have that I guess they're going to do both of those.
5203000	5206000	Yes, and so then it will be updated with the Aquatic stuff.
5206000	5208000	I don't see a date for Aquatic though.
5208000	5209000	Will it be the Life Aquatic?
5209000	5210000	I just said that.
5210000	5212000	I think it's soon.
5212000	5214000	Honestly, I thought it was already out.
5214000	5215000	It might already be out.
5215000	5216000	It might have just already been out.
5216000	5217000	Let's see.
5217000	5222000	Let's see if we can find out when it is here.
5222000	5224000	Apparently this is coming to Java Edition too.
5224000	5225000	Will it have Aquaria in it?
5225000	5228000	Yeah, the Java Edition usually gets everything as well.
5228000	5231000	It's just that those are separate kind of ecosystems now.
5231000	5236000	Which is funny because Kaijuto says are they going to stop or are they still updating the Java?
5236000	5237000	So yeah, they are.
5237000	5238000	Yeah, they are.
5238000	5243000	It's just because now they have the console version which is basically Windows 10 and everything else.
5243000	5247000	And then they have the Java version which is separate.
5247000	5251000	It doesn't say when that's going to be updated yet.
5251000	5254000	I want my 4K patch and all that stuff.
5254000	5256000	I want to play my blocky game in 4K.
5256000	5258000	Good old games.
5258000	5264000	Good old games is going to be giving away the Witcher Enhanced Edition if you sign up for the newsletter.
5265000	5266000	So that's all you got to do.
5266000	5267000	You got to sell your email address to them.
5267000	5271000	So sign up for the newsletter by creating a GOG account and doing this whole link thing.
5271000	5273000	And then you get the Witcher Enhanced Edition.
5273000	5275000	Please note, this is not The Witcher 3.
5275000	5278000	It's the original Witcher game but it's still an updated version of that game.
5278000	5280000	And you know, if you want the background story and all that.
5280000	5281000	It's a free game.
5281000	5284000	And I know some of you raging here love your free games.
5284000	5286000	So there's a way to get that.
5286000	5288000	So yeah, check that out.
5288000	5291000	The dialogue in this game was rewritten, rerecorded.
5291000	5292000	The inventory was changed.
5292000	5295000	So it's still a little dated by today's standards.
5295000	5297000	But it's free.
5297000	5298000	It's fucking free.
5298000	5299000	So don't complain about it.
5299000	5303000	Also, you get a Gwent card keg with this.
5303000	5307000	Which is, if I'm not mistaken, like The Witcher to Hearthstone sort of thing.
5307000	5308000	Right?
5308000	5309000	Like it's their trading card game.
5309000	5311000	So you can also get that.
5311000	5312000	Check that out.
5312000	5313000	Dark Sakura.
5313000	5316000	Well, you know we all like our Luminess.
5316000	5318000	And there is a date for Luminess Remastered.
5318000	5319000	Yay!
5319000	5320000	It's June 26th.
5320000	5321000	My birthday!
5321000	5322000	Happy birthday, Rob!
5322000	5324000	That's a great birthday present.
5324000	5329000	Even though it was supposed to be out in May, I'll still take the time to get it right.
5329000	5331000	And of course it's on Switch.
5331000	5332000	Yay!
5332000	5336000	Also, there is the Neo Geo Mini.
5336000	5340000	I hope it has better emulation than the last attempts to do one of these.
5340000	5345000	But it has, it looks like it's got controllers.
5345000	5347000	It's got the full size controller as well.
5348000	5354000	And I'm just trying to see, scroll through some of these images, but they don't seem to be working.
5354000	5361000	It's supposed to have 40 built in games, including 5 of the King of the Fighters titles and 3 of the Metal Slug games.
5361000	5366000	And, um, I don't know.
5366000	5369000	Do they have a, I see one picture that looks like an arcade cabinet.
5369000	5370000	It looks like a mini cabinet.
5370000	5371000	That's pretty awesome.
5371000	5374000	I mean, if it comes with a mini cab, that'd be even better.
5374000	5379000	I would think that's going to make the price of that thing go up if it's a little cabinet.
5379000	5382000	But again, it also depends on the emulation.
5382000	5383000	Yeah.
5383000	5385000	Because the previous ones had some shit emulation.
5385000	5386000	So that is the actual console.
5386000	5393000	So it says, yeah, the console has a, it has like a built in joystick with a three and a half inch screen.
5393000	5399000	But then it also has output to HDMI and auxiliary video and stuff.
5399000	5401000	Cool.
5402000	5405000	RageNator wants to point out about one of those stories I talked about.
5405000	5408000	I've had The Witcher on GOG for free for ages now.
5408000	5410000	I'm on those freebies.
5410000	5411000	Of course, of course.
5411000	5415000	Well, for those that missed out, here's, here's, here's another chance, I guess.
5415000	5417000	Uh, so yeah.
5417000	5420000	I want to know what that price the Neo Geo is though.
5420000	5421000	I'm tempted.
5421000	5422000	It has Fatal Fury special.
5422000	5423000	That's all I need.
5423000	5425000	Which I have that on a real Neo Geo.
5425000	5428000	I know, but I don't, I don't Jamie.
5428000	5430000	Do you want to borrow a Neo Geo CD?
5430000	5431000	Maybe.
5431000	5434000	And so you can wait with five hours of loading time between every stage?
5434000	5435000	Do some streaming.
5435000	5440000	If only you could play Neo Geo games on a certain arcade cabinet that's in this room.
5440000	5441000	Oh, wait.
5441000	5442000	Yes, you can.
5442000	5447000	Or, or they're, they're all, all these games are on the switch with the ACA and the PS4 as well.
5447000	5448000	So probably Xbox one too.
5448000	5450000	I just don't stay on top of all that stuff.
5450000	5457000	Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out something you can buy a little bit sooner, uh, than, um, this Neo Geo mini.
5457000	5459000	Uh, what's coming out this week in the U S Loki?
5459000	5471000	Uh, we have Conan exiles on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one pillars of eternity to dead fire on windows, Mac, and Linux, uh, Steins gate zero on PC.
5471000	5478000	We have a game called laser league on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, battle chasers.
5478000	5479000	Uh, oh, I'm sorry.
5479000	5480000	That's actually next week.
5480000	5483000	So yes, laser league will be the last thing for the week.
5483000	5484000	That's it.
5484000	5485000	Very short.
5485000	5486000	All right.
5486000	5491000	Let's go to the PlayStation four and check out some of the releases there.
5491000	5496000	Although I know that, uh, the golden week sale is going on on a PlayStation.
5496000	5500000	So, uh, I think in Japan, uh, it's probably gonna be a little slower this week.
5500000	5502000	Uh, I think that's why we've seen some releases slowing down.
5502000	5512000	In fact, actually, as I look at the PlayStation four releases in Japan this week, the next big release that I see is Caligula overdose on the 17th.
5512000	5515000	So I think this week is probably going to be a little more quiet.
5515000	5520000	Um, yeah, in fact, as I'm looking at the, uh, switch releases, there's really nothing of note there either.
5520000	5524000	So I think things are pretty quiet in Japan this week with the, uh, various holidays.
5524000	5526000	Uh, nothing on the 3DS either.
5526000	5528000	So it's, it's just, it's just a little slow right now.
5528000	5530000	So we'll head on over to Europe.
5530000	5531000	Dark sakura.
5531000	5534000	We have only a handful of things on May 8th.
5534000	5539000	We have, uh, pillars of eternity two dead fire for PC.
5539000	5544000	Um, Conan exiles on May 8th as well for Xbox and PlayStation.
5544000	5548000	And super chariot for switch on the 11th.
5548000	5549000	All right.
5549000	5556000	Well, now we can take a trip into our mailbag and I can play the theme song that I accidentally played early earlier.
5556000	5557000	It was a preview.
5557000	5558000	It was a sneak peek.
5558000	5567000	Uh, anyway, uh, every week dark sakura dives into the mailbag at participate at orange launch radio.com and takes a peek at what y'all have to say.
5567000	5568000	Dark Sakura.
5568000	5570000	I got a very concerning one.
5570000	5574000	This is super important bulletin and it's by yyr.
5574000	5577000	So, um, here it is.
5577000	5579000	Super multitasking broke sales records.
5579000	5581000	I hope it's what it deserves.
5581000	5584000	Tacos are fantastic.
5584000	5585000	Thank you.
5585000	5587000	A brand new title of his new game.
5587000	5593000	The sequel to pixel shit.
5593000	5597000	Pixel shits to tacos are fantastic.
5597000	5599000	Dude, make this happen, please.
5599000	5603000	I think yyr might be done with making our dream games come true for a while.
5603000	5606000	Cause you guys aren't coming through and making him a billionaire on steam.
5606000	5608000	What's wrong with y'all pick up asking.
5608000	5610000	I can only purchase the game once.
5610000	5611000	I know.
5611000	5613000	I know you can purchase it as gifts for other people.
5613000	5614000	I could.
5614000	5615000	It's true gift.
5615000	5625000	You know, you know why I think yyr sent that email because didn't we say on last week's show, like every listener should send us an email and what we got one email.
5625000	5627000	We have another one from Rachel here.
5627000	5628000	Well, that's how many listeners we have.
5628000	5636000	I guess the number two gaming podcast in town, two emails.
5636000	5638000	I'll give, I'll give that a number one.
5638000	5641000	Cause we don't have a wall or write names on.
5641000	5644000	We had names and we had to be taking those names.
5644000	5646000	I mean, people have to be there to take the names.
5646000	5647000	That's right.
5647000	5648000	I'm going to kick ass and take.
5648000	5649000	All right, Jamie, come on.
5649000	5651000	What's the next, next email.
5651000	5652000	Hi all.
5652000	5653000	It's Reaganator yet again.
5653000	5655000	I have some good news for you three and for chat.
5655000	5670000	If you care to remember last week, I called in to mention that a buddy of mine from high school responded to my venting on my tech woes, dead TV and PC video card by saying that he offered, dude, I understand you're excited about the video card, but this has nothing to do with gaming news.
5670000	5671000	Just saying.
5671000	5673000	Is there a question or anything in it?
5673000	5674000	I'm going to keep reading.
5674000	5675000	All right.
5675000	5678000	Um, he offered to send me his little video card.
5678000	5681000	Well, shipment for me came on Wednesday and it was no video card.
5681000	5684000	It was a 40 inch, 10 ADP Visio smart TV.
5684000	5685000	Oh shit.
5685000	5687000	Seemingly brand spanking you too.
5687000	5690000	Naturally I was confused and I confirmed with him.
5690000	5691000	Apparently it was no mistake.
5691000	5694000	He and his wife sent it intentionally saying happy birthday or something.
5694000	5695000	Or something.
5695000	5696000	That's a nice friend.
5696000	5697000	That is a good friend.
5698000	5706000	Anyways, regarding the video card, the extra money that I requested for my SSD payee, all $50 of it, finally came on Thursday and it was deposited Friday.
5706000	5713000	Luckily I found a video card that I could afford on Amazon, an MSI Geforce GT710 for $44.95 plus tax.
5713000	5718000	That card, as far as I know, is marginally better than the Geforce GT610 that came with my PC.
5718000	5722000	I ordered it and I should have it on Friday.
5723000	5727000	All that being said, I should be back to PC gaming in less than a week.
5727000	5731000	In the meantime, I'm going nuts watching TV and playing games on the 360.
5731000	5734000	I tell you, the picture on this TV is absolutely gorgeous.
5734000	5736000	Any better and my eyes would orgasm.
5736000	5738000	The anime titties are as big as your face.
5738000	5742000	This email was brought to you by Kenmore East, once a bulldog, always a bulldog.
5742000	5743000	What does that mean?
5743000	5744000	There's no question?
5744000	5745000	No.
5745000	5748000	It's like, I'm glad for you.
5748000	5751000	Yeah, no, it's a rad present.
5751000	5753000	It is a really rad present.
5753000	5755000	Enjoy your jumbo anime titties.
5757000	5759000	But still, a little relevancy.
5761000	5762000	Relevancy.
5762000	5763000	It was a follow up to a call, whatever.
5763000	5764000	Okay.
5764000	5765000	That's it?
5765000	5766000	That's it.
5766000	5767000	What?
5767000	5769000	I want a relevant email.
5769000	5778000	Tacos are great and you've got a great friend, but we want stuff related to what we are talking about on the show or how awesome I am.
5778000	5782000	Unless that really was a game announcement from YYR, in which case, you know.
5782000	5783000	Okay, then I'll take it.
5785000	5789000	YYR has a pass with the occasional short email because his emails are fucking novels.
5789000	5793000	And plus, I believe there's like family stuff going on and all that.
5793000	5796000	So, YYR wants to take a break from game development.
5796000	5797000	He's fucking earned it.
5797000	5799000	Anyway, let's see.
5799000	5806000	Let's move on then while we await more emails that participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5807000	5812000	Send our soccer an email and tell her what anime titties you like to see on your 50 inch TV.
5812000	5814000	Speaking of anime titties, I've been like on the fence of purchasing Gal...
5814000	5816000	I like the first Galgun game.
5816000	5819000	It's ridiculous, but I thought about purchasing the second one.
5819000	5820000	It's on the Switch, though.
5820000	5822000	That would not be a Switch appropriate game, unfortunately.
5822000	5827000	You know, I understand that some games, like, people kind of look at it and go, Jesus Christ, really?
5827000	5828000	Is this really needed?
5828000	5832000	But sometimes, like, it's like Dark Soccer said about the hat, right?
5832000	5835000	Sometimes, if you're going to go extra, be fucking extra.
5835000	5836000	You know?
5836000	5838000	Be as extra as you can fucking be.
5838000	5840000	And that's why I love Bayonetta.
5840000	5845000	Like, if Galgun came with, like, boob attachments for the, you know, D-pad, that would be extra.
5845000	5847000	You have a pheromone gun. You have to shoot your pheromones at them.
5847000	5851000	And didn't they just re-release... God, they just re-released it on PS4.
5851000	5852000	Is this week or next?
5852000	5859000	It's like that side-scroller with the totally unrealistic, like, cartoon babes with the gigantic titties.
5859000	5860000	What, the Queen's...
5860000	5861000	Which one?
5861000	5862000	Dragon's something... Damn it.
5862000	5864000	Oh, I know what you mean. Yeah, yeah.
5864000	5868000	It was some frickin' PlayStation 3 and, like, Vita or PSP game.
5868000	5869000	No, that one's actually really...
5869000	5870000	Dragon's Crown. Thank you, MXC.
5870000	5873000	Dragon's Crown's a great game. It's a really, like...
5873000	5875000	I know it's a good game, but not very...
5875000	5876000	It's...
5876000	5878000	It just needs proportionizing.
5878000	5881000	It just needs a little bit of that.
5883000	5886000	Yeah, no, that's... I know, that's the gag of the season.
5886000	5888000	It's actually a good game.
5889000	5892000	How many references can I drop in one minute?
5892000	5895000	All right. Anyway, let's move on to some more news.
5896000	5897000	Loki.
5898000	5899000	All right.
5899000	5901000	So, um...
5902000	5905000	Apparently, there's, um...
5905000	5909000	We talked about how there's been hackers with PUBG that have gotten into...
5909000	5910000	Or is it PUBG or Fortnite?
5910000	5913000	One of the two got in the big trouble with, um...
5913000	5914000	You know, creating hacks and stuff.
5914000	5919000	Well, now, apparently, Overwatch hackers are getting arrested and fined as well.
5919000	5925000	So, South Korea has a new law that is targeting hackers.
5925000	5932000	And apparently, with this new law, 13 Overwatch cheaters have been arrested now.
5932000	5939000	And apparently, they're saying that one of the 13 has received two years of probation from the government.
5939000	5948000	And if he violates it, he'll see jail time, as well as the others have been fined around 10 million won, which is about $10,000.
5949000	5951000	Will this finally end cheating?
5951000	5952000	Nope.
5952000	5953000	Please.
5953000	5958000	I'm just surprised you can, like, go to jail and get fined for that, like...
5958000	5964000	Well, I mean, of course, when you're, like, fucking with the game, like, that much, like, I kind of get it.
5964000	5965000	But it's, like, I feel like...
5965000	5966000	I feel like that would never...
5966000	5968000	Like, that sort of punishment would never happen here.
5969000	5971000	Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I've missed something.
5971000	5973000	But I just feel like there's so many, uh...
5973000	5974000	Yeah, it's...
5974000	5976000	You're never gonna end cheating.
5976000	5977000	Yeah.
5977000	5979000	You can certainly make an example out of people that get caught.
5979000	5980000	And I think that's what happens here.
5980000	5983000	Apparently, the law has a maximum fine of $50,000.
5983000	5985000	And a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
5985000	5986000	Wow.
5986000	5989000	Kaijuto in chat says, cheating online, but jail time?
5989000	5990000	Come on, now.
5990000	5992000	I'm all for the death penalty when it comes...
5992000	5993000	No, I'm kidding. I'm not.
5993000	5994000	But...
5996000	5997000	Yeah, I just, um...
5999000	6003000	I am a little surprised, but at the same time, like, when are people gonna fucking stop?
6005000	6006000	I don't know.
6006000	6007000	Alright.
6007000	6009000	Let's talk about Miis.
6009000	6011000	Let's talk about Miis.
6011000	6014000	But M-I-I would be the thing I want to talk about.
6014000	6019000	Which, I want to talk about making Mii characters in a web browser.
6019000	6022000	Apparently, this is something that you're gonna be able to do soon.
6022000	6024000	Even though Miitomo is...
6024000	6026000	Like, there's only so much time left with Miitomo.
6026000	6027000	The 9th.
6027000	6028000	That's...
6028000	6029000	That's like Tuesday!
6029000	6030000	Yeah.
6030000	6031000	Oh my gosh, that's kinda sad.
6031000	6034000	I've been trying to use up all of those tickets I get.
6034000	6035000	Yeah?
6035000	6038000	But, and you really, you're not gonna be able to, like, get anything for it, right?
6038000	6042000	You just kinda, like, the whole game's gonna get flushed in the toilet and that's that, right?
6042000	6043000	As far as I can tell.
6043000	6049000	Kind of a bummer that you can't, like, download or archive anything or there isn't some type of, like, Miitomo archive.
6049000	6050000	I... I don't know.
6050000	6051000	Why don't they just let it exist, right?
6051000	6054000	I took pictures of all of my Mii characters that I made.
6054000	6055000	Well, that's good.
6055000	6057000	Get all the screenshots that you can now.
6057000	6063000	Well, I guess what's happening soon is that Mii characters are going to be available for you to actually edit online.
6063000	6068000	The story is not coming up for me for some reason, so I don't know... I don't remember all the details.
6068000	6073000	I did read something about... Oh, finally! Just as I say that, it pops up on my screen there. Thank you.
6073000	6074000	As if by magic.
6074000	6076000	Jesus. It's like complaining works.
6076000	6079000	Excuse me, internet. Can I speak to your manager?
6079000	6081000	Alright, there it is. Anyway.
6081000	6083000	Alright, so here's the thing.
6083000	6087000	So, when it comes to Miis, you can create and edit your Mii characters in a web browser.
6087000	6090000	There's gonna be maintenance, though, when Miitomo is terminated.
6091000	6097000	So, if you link your Nintendo account to Miitomo, you can use the Mii characters from Miitomo on your Nintendo account.
6097000	6098000	So, that's something.
6098000	6101000	I've already linked mine an age ago, so that's good.
6101000	6102000	Awesome.
6102000	6105000	So, with the end of the Miitomo service, you can't make things on Miitomo anymore,
6105000	6111000	but they're gonna add a feature in late May where you can edit the Mii characters via your web browser of choice,
6111000	6114000	if it'll work, unlike this relic of a computer that I'm using now.
6114000	6119000	So, the system migration maintenance will be happening in late May 2018.
6119000	6121000	So, during that period, you can't really do anything with your Miis,
6121000	6124000	but once that's done, you can make Miis online,
6124000	6130000	and I'm sure people will be sharing all the hilarious creations that they've made within the Mii Broadcaster.
6130000	6132000	So, there you go.
6132000	6135000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
6135000	6145000	Well, there is a series of retail gaming stores in Nebraska called Gamers,
6145000	6152000	and all three of their stores closed as of Thursday, May 3rd,
6152000	6160000	with one of the reasons being that there were employees who yelled at customers and used racial slurs while working.
6160000	6168000	They also listed a lack of good employees, and a few things about declining sales and unreasonable landlords.
6168000	6176000	However, the employees themselves have spoken up, said that there was quite another thing going on with them.
6176000	6187000	That basically, that the company was only paying minimum wage, that they also offered no benefits,
6187000	6193000	had employees working overtime for no pay, high turnover, terrible management,
6193000	6201000	and even making them go to meetings on their day off with no pay, which is all illegal.
6201000	6212000	So, they're apparently still operating as a store, but I guess only online, so that's still pretty crappy.
6212000	6218000	I mean, every single one of those employees under those circumstances should have actually taken it to their state labor board,
6218000	6223000	but people don't think to do stuff like that, and that's why companies like this get away with it.
6223000	6232000	So, I don't know. I'm pretty glad that if that really is the truth that a company so unstable is closing their shop,
6232000	6239000	and I hope that they go out of business or get intensely sued, but there's not really too much else I can say about that.
6239000	6245000	I don't think this is a customer I sold to, but the name sounds familiar, Gamers.
6245000	6253000	Because honestly, the independent game stores, there's not a ton of them out there.
6253000	6264000	Well, honestly enough, really the big chains are taking it over, but I'd like to support independent game stores,
6264000	6268000	but I don't support this kind of attitude.
6268000	6270000	Well, it's just bad business all around.
6270000	6275000	It really is. So, do you have anything more for us?
6275000	6278000	At least not on that.
6278000	6284000	Anyways, I guess we could talk a little bit about Nintendo.
6284000	6291000	And you know, one of the things we keep wondering with Nintendo is like, so we've got this system, the Switch and stuff,
6291000	6298000	why do they keep making 3DS games still? When is the 3DS going to basically be over?
6298000	6306000	And the reason for that, they claim, is because Nintendo is basically going to keep making games for the 3DS
6306000	6310000	until the Switch becomes a one-per-person system.
6310000	6317000	So, with the Switch, I think that's a nice idea, but the fact that it's a console system, though,
6317000	6321000	you're going to have multiplayer support on that. It's not like a 3DS.
6321000	6327000	But you're saying, consumers purchased the 3DS system in numbers we expected last fiscal year,
6327000	6330000	or the numbers we expected last fiscal year.
6330000	6337000	It had an ample supply of ample software lineup at the price point that makes the system affordable,
6337000	6340000	especially for parents looking to buy for their kids.
6340000	6345000	We expect the demand to continue this fiscal year as well, which is through March 2019.
6345000	6347000	So we will continue to sell the product.
6347000	6351000	Given that Nintendo Switch is a home gaming system that can be taken on the go,
6351000	6358000	this situation may change if it grows from being a one-per-household system to a one-per-person system.
6358000	6360000	Well, take it out back and fucking shoot it already.
6360000	6366000	Well, the problem is, though, it's a $300 system. The 3DS was never a $300 system,
6366000	6370000	so it's hard to say, well, you better buy a Switch for each person in the house.
6370000	6374000	Oh, and hey, you want to play those games? Well, you better buy a game for each person.
6374000	6377000	That's the problem. You made a system that's a home console system,
6377000	6381000	and you're shocked that people aren't buying it like a portable system.
6381000	6386000	Look, this is honestly just a line they're using because they're not planning on selling the 3DS yet.
6386000	6391000	They can't. They've got that Luigi game that's already slated for next year, the Luigi's Mansion remake.
6391000	6395000	So they're not going to say anything about stopping to sell the 3DS for a long time.
6395000	6400000	And honestly, even if they were to say, like, we're going to actively stop making new 3DS games or whatever,
6400000	6403000	which is probably not something they would say, you'd just probably have to figure it out,
6403000	6409000	they're still going to sell the consoles themselves for at least another probably two years after that
6409000	6415000	because there is, and I see in chat that there's still fans of the 3DS.
6415000	6419000	Of course, the 3DS and the DS, which you can play on your 3DS,
6419000	6424000	has such a rich back catalog that, of course, they're going to sell systems.
6424000	6427000	Like, what if your system breaks and you want a new one and all this other stuff?
6427000	6433000	So, I mean, there's still reasons to get 3DS, but it's more like that active development
6433000	6436000	and using resources on making new big games and stuff.
6436000	6439000	It's like, okay, let it go. We can let it go now.
6439000	6443000	Put them on great Switch games and maybe you will sell a million Switches.
6443000	6447000	Yeah. Or, I mean, they have sold a million Switches, but you know what I mean.
6447000	6451000	That's my figurative million. One for every person or whatever it is.
6451000	6456000	So, Tigerclaw does point out in chat, plus the 3DS Fitch in your pocket, not the Switch,
6456000	6458000	until Nintendo does the Switch Mini.
6458000	6462000	Well, there will be another version of the Switch. Absolutely.
6462000	6467000	Why wouldn't there be? There's almost always been another version of the console.
6467000	6472000	Like, even the Wii sort of had one where they took the internet out and all that stuff. Remember that?
6472000	6474000	Yeah, that was a very good version of the console.
6474000	6475000	Have we had another Wii U?
6475000	6479000	Well, but the Wii U kind of, they wanted to get rid of that pretty quick.
6479000	6483000	But, like, the Nintendo had the top loader, the Super Nintendo had a redo,
6483000	6486000	the Nintendo 64, they kind of did, like, the Pikachu version.
6486000	6487000	Yeah, 3DS, the DS.
6487000	6490000	3DS, DS, Game Boy, those are always going through remakes and stuff.
6490000	6498000	So, I mean, they will do a Switch XL or XS or something to get more people to use them.
6498000	6501000	A Switch and you'll poke it, if that's what they want.
6501000	6506000	Asky in chat says, what do you think the recent hack on the Switch will affect the sales of the Switch?
6506000	6511000	Do you think it will become another Dreamcast? Awesome platform, but was flawed by piracy early on.
6511000	6519000	Here's what they're going to do, Asky, I think, is that maybe you can't stop the old systems and this stuff,
6519000	6521000	but they can put their foot down with the new systems.
6521000	6526000	I don't think they can, because they're going to have to go with a whole other processor if that's the case,
6526000	6529000	because it's the taker chip that is the problem.
6529000	6535000	So, unless Nvidia has a way around that, I don't think they're going to change it.
6535000	6539000	Right now, though, there's nothing to say that it's going to be piracy,
6539000	6545000	because the problem was that they don't have access to the keys yet to be able to decode the software.
6545000	6548000	The best they're going to be able to do is load homebrew on there.
6548000	6554000	Rama in chat says, here's the thing, drop the Switch to $199 and it will be one console per person per household.
6554000	6557000	Until then, viva la 3DS.
6557000	6559000	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
6559000	6564000	That's true, I guess that price, but I could see the price maybe coming down.
6564000	6567000	I even have a problem, though, with the games being $60 at that point,
6567000	6572000	because if you're saying that you want it one per person, then you're going to buy one game per person.
6572000	6576000	I mean, it's just, I don't know.
6576000	6580000	All right, one more story for you guys before we get to calls, and this has to do with a music game.
6580000	6584000	Why not kind of end the official news segment tonight with news on a music game,
6584000	6587000	and ask to do with harmonics and Rock Band, which, yes, it's still going.
6587000	6589000	And actually, Rock Band is bringing it back.
6589000	6590000	We also talked about RBM.
6590000	6592000	Hey, be quiet.
6592000	6594000	Shut up.
6594000	6596000	Normally, don't talk about it too much.
6596000	6599000	Shut up, autoplay Twitch thing, don't do that.
6599000	6605000	Anyway, that was part of the livestream where harmonics was about to announce that the Rock Band network would be coming back.
6605000	6609000	The Rock Band network was unveiled about ten years ago, I think,
6609000	6613000	and it allowed folks to basically put their own tracks into Rock Band, including for sale.
6613000	6615000	I mean, it did have to go through quality review and stuff,
6615000	6621000	but it basically unleashed the Rock Band tools to smaller bands and indie bands that wanted to be in Rock Band.
6621000	6627000	Now, Rock Band network is going to be coming back for Rock Band 4 on the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One.
6627000	6632000	There never did end up being a Rock Band 4 on PC, because that crowdfunding didn't quite work out.
6632000	6637000	However, due to the royalty agreements, your purchases can't move over.
6637000	6642000	So, womp womp on that, you will have to start over if you had a lot of the Rock Band network stuff.
6642000	6647000	Harmonics is prioritizing songs that were the most popular before on Rock Band network,
6647000	6649000	and is also taking requests via an online forum.
6649000	6653000	So, that's kind of neat that, like, this thing that they shut down is now coming back.
6653000	6655000	So, pretty cool.
6656000	6657000	And Orange, right in chat, says,
6657000	6659000	Oh, I didn't hear about this. Cool to hear.
6659000	6662000	Yeah, they announced it on Tuesday during a livestream that Harmonics did.
6662000	6664000	So, it is happening.
6664000	6667000	I don't know if I caught the when it's happening, but it's something that they're working on.
6667000	6669000	So, pretty cool.
6669000	6671000	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.
6671000	6676000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1877 Game OLR if you want to do it the old school way,
6676000	6678000	but I don't remember the last time we got a phone call.
6678000	6681000	It's all Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6681000	6686000	If you would like to Skype us and talk about anything that maybe we've talked about so far tonight,
6686000	6688000	or have yet to talk about.
6688000	6691000	Until then, I don't know if we have any last minute stories or other things to bring up,
6691000	6694000	but, Loki, any last minute stories?
6694000	6696000	If you have any discussion, maybe if you don't want to call,
6696000	6699000	but you just have a discussion question or something you want to ask us,
6699000	6701000	go ahead and throw it out in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6702000	6707000	It's a small mention, but I guess that the Oculus Go, I think, has been released.
6707000	6711000	Oh, yeah, the whole Facebook event unveiled this, right?
6711000	6713000	The Oculus without a computer, basically, right?
6713000	6715000	Yeah, so that's available.
6715000	6721000	The only issue with that is you have to have a phone that you can connect to their store with, which is stupors.
6721000	6722000	Of course, of course.
6722000	6723000	Well, they want you to buy things.
6723000	6730000	Well, why, but yeah, but if I have a phone, then why would I want the Oculus Go, because I could just plug in...
6730000	6735000	Well, why would you get the other thing, the other Samsung thing that everybody's getting...
6735000	6736000	The Gear VR?
6736000	6737000	Yeah, the Gear VR.
6737000	6738000	Or like the...
6738000	6740000	We have one, and I've used it once.
6740000	6742000	It's kind of a novelty thing.
6742000	6744000	I gave mine away a couple weeks ago.
6744000	6747000	The experiences just aren't there for that, you know?
6747000	6752000	I mean, at least with PlayStation VR, you've got quite a few games at this point that exist in there.
6752000	6756000	Same thing with, you know, HTC Vive and Oculus on PC and so forth.
6756000	6762000	So, SSU100Matt points out the Gear VR is pretty much the Oculus Go.
6762000	6763000	Yeah.
6763000	6764000	Yeah.
6764000	6768000	AskianChat points out, I just bought a cat. That's important, right?
6768000	6770000	Fuck yes, cats are always important.
6770000	6771000	We love animals.
6771000	6772000	Cats are always relevant.
6772000	6773000	Cats are always relevant.
6773000	6778000	And I suppose, if you're a dog person, I suppose puppies, especially if it's Corgi.
6778000	6781000	If it's Corgi, it's like priority.
6781000	6783000	So, yes.
6783000	6785000	Puppies and kitties are very important.
6785000	6788000	You know what? I would say pretty much any.
6788000	6795000	If you wanted to get a ferret, that is also noteworthy, especially if you're breaking the law and it's illegal in your state.
6795000	6798000	Would you like to call and tell us how you're breaking the law?
6798000	6799000	Orange Launch Radio.
6799000	6801000	All one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
6801000	6805000	Anything else to talk about here at the end?
6805000	6808000	Sadly, no. It's been a slow Newsweek.
6808000	6809000	It is really slow.
6809000	6812000	Well, A, you have the holiday week going on in Japan.
6812000	6815000	So, you know, that's shutting a lot of things down right now.
6815000	6819000	B, you have E3 is just around the corner.
6819000	6822000	So, you know, that's something to do.
6822000	6825000	It's just also slow as far as releases go, too.
6825000	6828000	May is usually, April and May are really slow.
6828000	6832000	I mean, actually anything up until September is going to be kind of slow.
6832000	6833000	June picked a little bit.
6833000	6837000	I feel like we usually get one or two big releases around Memorial Day.
6837000	6839000	So people can play during the long weekend.
6839000	6840000	I don't think anything is really coming out.
6840000	6841000	Kids getting out of school.
6841000	6846000	Switch, I know they've got the remaster of Hyrule Warriors,
6846000	6848000	which I may end up picking up.
6848000	6849000	I'm not sure yet.
6849000	6851000	That might be fun.
6851000	6855000	So we're getting some questions in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
6855000	6856000	which we'll certainly take those.
6856000	6858000	We can do an Ask Orange Lounge or something.
6858000	6860000	I'm kind of like an informal Ask Orange Lounge.
6860000	6863000	Asky wants to know, did anyone buy Donkey Kong?
6863000	6866000	And She-Hulk clarifying Donkey Kong for the Switch.
6866000	6870000	I looked at it, but I don't want to pay $60 for that game.
6871000	6878000	I played the Wii U version, and unpopular opinion, I didn't care for it.
6878000	6884000	For me, it didn't really capture the magic of the Super Nintendo Donkey Kong Country games.
6884000	6888000	I don't know if I'm just as big on Donkey Kong as a franchise.
6888000	6891000	But cool for the people that are into it.
6891000	6894000	And maybe I need to give it a second look.
6894000	6897000	This happens with games sometimes, you guys.
6897000	6900000	The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, eh, I'm not feeling it.
6900000	6905000	But after I learned some more things about the franchise and how Cinematica was,
6905000	6906000	I went back and played it later.
6906000	6909000	And now the original trilogy is one of my favorite things that's ever been done in gaming.
6909000	6916000	So I don't want to damn a thing like Donkey Kong forever.
6917000	6921000	Anyway, actdeftinchat points out $60 is worth it.
6921000	6924000	It's good, but I already have the Wii U version.
6924000	6926000	I don't really want to double dip this one.
6926000	6929000	Captain Toad, though, gonna buy that one for sure.
6929000	6931000	I know a lot of people are fans of Captain Toad.
6931000	6935000	Actdeft pointing out we had the Octo expansion coming in July, probably.
6935000	6936000	The whole Splatoon thing.
6936000	6939000	Which, by the way, Raphael vs. Leonardo happened this weekend.
6939000	6941000	Raphael won.
6941000	6943000	But not based on popularity.
6943000	6946000	If it had been straight a popularity vote, Leonardo would have won.
6946000	6947000	But Raphael's still better anyway.
6947000	6950000	But the Raphael players were more skilled at the end of the day winning more of the battles.
6950000	6951000	So how about that?
6951000	6952000	Even though I didn't play.
6952000	6956000	But of course I saw the Twitters. I saw all the Tweets about it, of course.
6956000	6959000	Alright, let's take a call that is coming in.
6959000	6961000	Hi, you're on Orange On Radio. Who's this?
6961000	6963000	Hey, what's going on? My name's Rama.
6963000	6965000	Hey, Rama. Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?
6965000	6968000	Not much. I just got here from a convention.
6968000	6971000	Our convention season has just kicked off with a bang.
6971000	6975000	That's true. What might be a slow time for video games becomes a really fast time.
6975000	6979000	Like when the movies start coming out because that's more when people can get weekends away.
6979000	6981000	It sounds like you had a really good time at this convention.
6981000	6982000	A lot of good stuff.
6982000	6987000	Yeah, this is one of the few times where I was actually calm.
6987000	6991000	Not calm, but relaxed, chill. I just had a good time.
6991000	6998000	I got a little stressed, but thankfully my podcast staff was able to help me push through and get things done.
6998000	7000000	Overall, I was just having a good time.
7000000	7003000	Good. And what was the name of the con?
7003000	7012000	Zenkai Con. It's an anime, sci-fi, themed convention, mishmash of everything in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
7012000	7016000	Oh, that's not far from where I spent some time in Pennsylvania a few years ago.
7016000	7018000	Oh, yeah. I remember you mentioning that.
7018000	7021000	Yeah. So that's cool. I'm glad you had a good time at the convention.
7021000	7026000	And I'm sure people can hear more about it on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday live at VOG.
7026000	7033000	Definitely. We're all still recovering from it because it was just fun from start to finish.
7033000	7040000	We got there early, did a little touristy thing and then just kind of rested and then just went to the whole nine yards.
7040000	7045000	Awesome. I look forward to hearing more about it. Anything gaming to bring up here on OLR?
7045000	7050000	Well, this year they had another convention covering running the game room.
7050000	7058000	So it was mostly console gaming. They had a setup for Rock Band 3, or Rock Band 4. I don't know which one it was.
7058000	7065000	And they also had a PS2 arcade DDR setup, as I like to call it.
7065000	7067000	Oh, okay. Cool.
7067000	7069000	Yeah, but the main issue was...
7069000	7074000	Sorry, did they gut an arcade machine and put a PS2 in it? Because I have friends that have a machine like that.
7074000	7078000	Or did they just do a PS2 with the really fancy dance pads?
7078000	7083000	Yeah, PS2 with two large arcade dance pads that were uncalibrated the whole weekend.
7083000	7084000	Oh, Jesus.
7084000	7092000	Yeah, the staff was told, but evidently nothing was done about it. So I sort of avoided the game room.
7092000	7102000	Because here's the thing about the game room. If you're going to go, the best time to go is within the first 20 minutes of it opening and in the last 20 minutes of it closing.
7102000	7106000	Before it smells like funk.
7106000	7110000	That's putting it lightly.
7110000	7116000	No, I know. I know. That's exactly how it goes. Or the cool thing is, you know, with MAGFest, it's a 24-hour gaming room.
7116000	7122000	So it's like you kind of go at 3 in the morning. Although, God, even then, even then, it's still...
7122000	7130000	It can be pretty crowded on Friday, Saturday night. DragonCon, I think if you go around 5 or 6 in the morning, DragonCon, you can pretty much walk up and play what you want.
7130000	7141000	That's what I'm going to do for MAGFest next year. I'm just going to do my thing, pass out, wake up around 3, 3, 4 o'clock, go downstairs, play some Street Fighter, find some breakfast, and just go about my day.
7141000	7153000	Yeah. No, I hear you. I hear that. I think that might be my strategy at future cons is to just go to bed early like the true old man I am and then get up really early while other people are staying up late.
7153000	7156000	There you go. There you go.
7157000	7167000	Alright. Well, I'm sorry, I'm reading chat while I'm talking to you. Rama, I don't know if there's anything else you wanted to share or if that's it.
7167000	7175000	Oh, that's basically it because I called in because I was like, well, I figured everybody else would call in, but let me jump in, talk to you guys, kind of get things going.
7175000	7182000	Maybe after I get off the phone, more people will start calling in, you know, because I put that challenge out like several years ago, you know?
7182000	7189000	You never know. It's just some weeks are slower than others. It's all good. Is there something on TV tonight? Walking Dead back? I don't know.
7189000	7190000	American Idol.
7190000	7191000	Oh, nobody's watching that.
7191000	7192000	I know.
7192000	7198000	Anyway. Alright, Rama, I'm gonna let you go, but look forward to anime jam session this week. Take care.
7198000	7199000	Thank you. Take care, bro.
7199000	7200000	Bye.
7200000	7208000	Alright, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype. Otherwise, we might be wrapping things up here pretty soon, and that's okay.
7208000	7214000	You know, again, those weeks rolling up to E3 are gonna be a little bit slower.
7214000	7218000	Sadly, none of us going to E3, but I don't know if any of you guys are going.
7218000	7220000	I don't know if I'm sad about that.
7221000	7228000	E3's just changed, and it's just not really the same show that it was. What was the first year we all went? Was it 2004? Must have been.
7228000	7235000	Because this show started 2002, and I feel like, yeah, we went three times, right? All of us went three times before.
7235000	7241000	2006 was the big we year, the year that I called the Paris Hilton year. That was where it was like out of fucking control.
7241000	7245000	And that was our third year going, right? We all went those first three years.
7245000	7246000	Yeah, I went in 2000.
7246000	7247000	Yeah.
7247000	7252000	No, last year I went was 2009 or 10.
7252000	7259000	Well, I went again a few more times. When they went back to the convention center, I went back, I feel like I was there in 2014 was like the last year I went.
7259000	7263000	It wasn't that long ago. I think it was 2014 was the last year I went.
7263000	7265000	It was 2009.
7265000	7270000	We did the interactive coverage. Remember when you could submit questions, and we would try to find the answers for you?
7270000	7271000	Yeah.
7271000	7282000	I did that with Bobby one year, and I think it was the second year. I think the first year he did it, and I went to pick him up, and I did the Ouya booth because it was outside. You didn't need a badge to get in.
7282000	7283000	Yeah.
7283000	7286000	But otherwise he had to do everything. Was it the Ouya? I feel like it was Ouya.
7286000	7287000	Yes, Ouya was outside.
7288000	7301000	But then the problem was, and the reason why we never did the interactive coverage again was that it was like the reason why E3 is not the show it used to be is explained by the fact that the interactive coverage doesn't really work anymore.
7301000	7309000	Because nobody wants to answer a question that's off the script. And if you want to see the script, just go watch YouTube or Twitch. It's all right there.
7309000	7312000	And nobody wants to talk about anything that's off script.
7312000	7313000	Unless it's an indie developer.
7314000	7319000	Unless it's an indie developer, which is kind of rare to see. Well, I don't know. Now that some of the bigger names are dropping out at E3.
7319000	7322000	Do they still have like the indie booth?
7322000	7333000	Sure. And that was my favorite booth. That was my favorite booth at E3 because those are the people that would talk and let you ask anything you want, but those weren't the questions we were getting because people didn't know about those games.
7333000	7334000	Yeah.
7334000	7341000	Which I don't blame the people asking the questions. It didn't work. It's unfortunate.
7341000	7347000	Dartosuya says Kensha Hall. Well, that was the really cool indie place those first three years.
7347000	7349000	That's where you see all sorts of weird shit.
7349000	7351000	Kensha Hall turned into a parking lot later on. I don't even know.
7351000	7358000	Actually, come to think of it, didn't they just remodel the convention center? Like if you're going to DragCon, Jamie, isn't it going to be different?
7358000	7362000	Because, funny enough, DragCon is at the same place that they're doing E3, right?
7362000	7363000	Yeah.
7363000	7365000	They use one of the halls, the West Hall or the North Hall.
7365000	7367000	I think they expanded into one of the larger ones.
7367000	7375000	Yeah, but the funny thing is that's the same place that they're going to have E3 and I think they remodeled the convention center, if I'm not mistaken, or at least that was in the cards.
7375000	7376000	Us.
7376000	7384000	I know that area around it has changed significantly since our early E3s. You know, now they have the whole LA Live shit.
7384000	7390000	Like the last year I did go to E3, I was like, wow, there's like restaurants down here and fancy hotels and all that good stuff.
7391000	7396000	Sia Tabiri says it's in South Hall. Okay, well South Hall is where they always had Nintendo and all that stuff.
7397000	7404000	Bonds006 says, how was the room booking bad for MAGFest? I had a room booked last September and it was very easy.
7404000	7410000	I think you got lucky, my friend. A lot of people had a lot of problems booking rooms for MAGFest.
7412000	7417000	But hopefully this year they'll get that shit sorted out. Although I have to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll go back to MAGFest.
7417000	7425000	Nothing against the con, or the people. I certainly enjoy myself, but some of y'all know I switched jobs a couple years ago.
7425000	7429000	And with it, I took a big hit and the amount of time off I get a year.
7429000	7432000	So I have to pick and choose my conventions a little more carefully, that's all.
7435000	7439000	Well you guys, I guess that's probably going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
7439000	7441000	If you do want to interact with our host, you can always send us an email.
7441000	7446000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or you can send us a tweet at OLR.
7446000	7454000	If you would like to also leave us a nice five star review on a place like iTunes, we'd really appreciate that wherever you found this podcast.
7454000	7460000	Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can't air those voices if they're not here.
7460000	7462000	So help us spread the word, we would really appreciate that.
7462000	7467000	You can also join us on Twitter at OLR. We also have a Discord and you can always chat with us through Discord.
7468000	7473000	We do get some of our stories from Discord, so a big thank you to those on Discord sharing info with us throughout the week.
7473000	7478000	That's VOG Network dot com slash Discord. VOG Network dot com slash Discord.
7478000	7481000	With that, I think we will go around the room and give everybody's final thoughts.
7481000	7485000	I know it's a little bit shorter tonight, but probably just again the slower news week, these things are going to happen.
7485000	7488000	So, Loki, final thought for you tonight?
7488000	7492000	Final thought is my wife keeps texting me that my kids are sick.
7492000	7493000	Oh no.
7493000	7497000	Yes, apparently there's lots of screaming and yelling and sitting on the potty, so.
7497000	7498000	That means you're going to be sick.
7498000	7499000	I hope not.
7499000	7500000	All right.
7500000	7506000	My final thought tonight is that Alan went shopping during the show and he brought back Oreos.
7506000	7514000	So last week we had Cherry Coke Oreos, which weren't bad. I really liked them, but they have Pop Rocks in them, so it was a little weird.
7514000	7517000	But it gives that kind of carbon-y, you know, like a carbonated beverage would have.
7517000	7518000	It was okay.
7518000	7524000	This week he has brought us pina colada, which I guess is a new thing they're doing, and kettle corn.
7524000	7528000	And I'm really curious about kettle corn, but I feel like it's not going to make a very good Oreo.
7528000	7530000	I would like to try.
7530000	7532000	Yeah, we'll do that right after the show.
7532000	7537000	The coconut Oreos are good because they just have regular coconuts, so I'm sure pina colada is going to be fine.
7537000	7539000	It's just coconut with pineapple dust or something.
7539000	7541000	Do you like pina coladas?
7541000	7542000	Let's put pineapple on the pizza.
7542000	7544000	Anyway, that's my final thought.
7544000	7547000	Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought.
7547000	7553000	I'm disappointed in my chicken strips today, and I think I'm going to go get a taco on the way home.
7553000	7555000	Mmm, tacos.
7555000	7557000	Like, one taco.
7557000	7560000	Alright, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.
7560000	7563000	Thanks to you guys so much for tuning in, and we hope you all have a great week.
7563000	7565000	We'll see you in seven days, at least Loki and I will.
7565000	7568000	Dark Sakura, have a ton of fun at Dragon Con. We'll see you in two weeks.
7568000	7569000	Dragon Con.
7569000	7570000	Drag Con.
7570000	7571000	Yes.
7571000	7574000	Drag on the con.
7574000	7575000	Drag that con.
7575000	7576000	Drag on and go to the con.
7576000	7577000	I will.
7577000	7578000	Forget it.
7578000	7579000	We're out of here.
