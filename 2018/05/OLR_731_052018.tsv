0	17960	In the continuing case of defying expectations, No Man's Sky is getting actual multiplayer
17960	19680	rather than just light or presence.
19680	22720	Promises are being kept, which is fair since no timeframes were specified.
22720	25800	This is just one story tonight, stay tuned for the rest starting right now on the show
25800	31560	where every gamer has a voice.
31560	36040	Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36040	43560	It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight for May the 20th, 2018 with episode number 731
43560	47160	of our show where we're here to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer
47160	51680	lifestyle with your hosts here in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, you might know me on
51680	57360	Twitter at Skie, sadly not here again tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
57360	60200	She's continuing her adventures that she kind of started last week.
60200	63960	I think she has a friend from out of the country that is visiting and today they went to lovely
63960	68460	San Francisco to go frolic and do the San Francisco-y things.
68460	71960	So I am joined alone here in studio by Loki.
71960	72960	Hello.
72960	73960	Hi Loki, how are you?
73960	74960	I'm good.
74960	75960	Good.
75960	76960	What's new with you?
76960	77960	My mouth's on fire now.
77960	78960	Oh, with the food you were eating?
78960	79960	Yeah, the salsa.
79960	80960	All I heard you was, it's spicy.
81240	84440	Spicy food is like really good for me right now because, and you guys can probably hear
84440	87320	it if I seem like a little less peppy than usual.
87320	88920	Like these, this is so weird.
88920	91600	Like I never got allergies in my life.
91600	94880	And then last year it seemed like a little bit, because I remember talking to a doctor
94880	98500	and the doctor was like, well, it is possible you can develop allergies later in life.
98500	102960	But this year, like this last week, like it started, I think it was Monday or Tuesday
102960	105360	because I remember tweeting about this, I think it was around Tuesday, because I tried
105360	106360	to get a doctor appointment on Tuesday.
106360	107360	It was really scary.
107360	109920	I had no voice whatsoever.
109920	114440	And that was kind of scary and humbling for a minute because, you know, I have to use
114440	116420	my voice to do my job.
116420	119240	Like without my voice, I'm going to be screwed in that regard.
119240	120880	It kind of makes you go like, oh shit.
120880	121880	You know?
121880	123400	And then of course there's this, you know, my hobby that I've had for years.
123400	125600	You just have to pull a Stephen Hawking's at that point.
125600	126600	I know, right?
126600	127720	What else would you do?
127720	132440	So except have a voice to chat or chat to voice, whatever, that sort of thing.
132440	134280	So I mean, it's just like, oh my gosh.
134280	138160	So anyway, luckily you can tell my voice is improving, but it's like these allergies are
138160	139400	moving everywhere.
139400	143120	Like one day it'll be my throat, one day it'll be my sinuses, which is what it is today.
143120	146640	And if you've ever had super congested sinuses, you know, that sinus pressure is no fun to
146640	147640	deal with at all.
147640	149360	So it's kind of what I'm dealing with today.
149360	153800	And then, you know, it's just some days it's just irritation, you know, so it's just, ugh.
153800	158960	So I did go to a doctor just, you know, not to be sharing all my business on OLR, but
158960	163600	they do agree it's probably allergies because here in lovely Sacramento where our show is
163600	166220	based, it's been a killer year for allergies.
166220	170140	And so I guess mine have just kind of shown themselves and really taken hold and oh my
170140	172260	God, it's, it's awful.
172260	176060	So we're trying over the counter stuff to try to treat it.
176060	180180	So I don't feel a hundred percent, but at least, you know, at least I'm here and I'm
180180	181960	able to do this show well enough.
181960	182960	That's important.
182960	183960	Right?
183960	184960	Right.
184960	185960	Yeah.
185960	186960	So there you go.
186960	187960	And it's not strep.
187960	188960	That's it.
188960	189960	It tested me for strep and it's not that.
189960	190960	So that's good news.
190960	191960	That's why you can sit here with me because we're confident.
191960	192960	It's allergies.
192960	193960	That's not something as contagious.
193960	195820	You already had allergies anyway.
195820	197220	I probably have allergies now.
197220	198220	Yeah.
198220	200140	You don't, you never got them as this bad though, right?
200140	201140	I get allergies.
201140	207060	I get like, especially like a very raspy throat, like earlier this week I had that, you know,
207060	210060	it's just like, I always feel like I have to clear my throat and stuff.
210060	213500	Brad from Pod Culture asking the tough question saying, could it be Mr. Smoosh?
213500	217100	Oh, by the way, I should of course introduce our chat room because we do tape live every
217100	220940	Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice geeks network,
220940	225020	geeksnetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
225020	228460	And a quick plug for Bobby who's going to be at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo the
228460	230540	weekend of June 8th in Atlanta.
230540	233880	And he talked about some pretty exciting news and things you can see him do at the expo
233880	234880	there on the show tonight.
234880	237020	So quick little plug there for Bobby.
237020	238460	I'm going back to the chat though.
238460	241260	Brad from Pod Culture asks, could it be Mr. Smoosh, our cat?
241260	244620	I don't, I wouldn't think so because we've had the cat since November and he doesn't
244620	245940	go outdoors.
245940	249500	And I mean, if I had a cat allergy, I've been around cats my whole life.
249500	250980	I think I would have seen it by now.
250980	254460	I mean, this is the first time we've had an exotic short hair, but I grew up with a Siamese
254460	255460	cat.
255460	258060	And typically I would think shorter hair cats aren't going to be as bad.
258060	259060	Exactly.
259060	262340	And Sanrio is, you know, she was a little, little lion, so she had, you know, really
262340	263340	thick fur.
263340	264340	So I don't think it'd be a cat.
264340	265340	Yeah.
265340	266340	I don't think it's the cow allergies.
266340	269180	I appreciate y'all playing doctor in our chat though.
269180	270180	Everybody's WebMD.
270180	271180	That's right.
271180	272180	Dr. Google to the rescue.
272180	273700	No, I'm just giving you guys a shit.
273700	276740	Uh, as 200 Matt says, our allergies change every few years.
276740	280440	I never used to be allergic to pollen and dust until recently, recently, my allergies
280440	282820	manifest as headaches now, which is really annoying.
282820	283820	Yeah.
283820	284820	That's, that's, that's true.
284820	285820	The case.
285820	287500	Uh, and then Siatabiri says, thank you for sticking it out.
287500	288500	Rob Roberts.
288500	290020	Uh, I'm trying my best.
290020	292700	Uh, it may be a little bit shorter of a show tonight though.
292700	296020	I might be able to put in two hours, but we'll see if it's a little shorter tonight.
296020	297020	That's why.
297020	300140	Um, and Bobby Buckle says, are you sure you're not just allergic to Loki?
300140	302860	Well, I think, I think that would have developed a long time ago.
302860	303860	Yeah.
303860	308660	Another interesting internet theory from She-Hulk who says, could be the volcano and Ash.
308660	311660	I mean, Hawaii is a, is a very far away.
311660	317620	I mean, Hawaii is what, like a three, four hour flight from here and like only that long,
317620	318620	isn't it?
318620	319620	I don't remember.
319620	320620	It's been so long since I've been to Hawaii.
320620	323820	I think it's like a four hour flight for the, for the like San Francisco, like a four hour
323820	324820	flight.
324820	327180	So that's almost the time zone changes though.
327180	328180	No, no, no.
328180	329180	It's not cause of time.
329180	330180	Don't changes.
330180	331700	It's, it's, you know, you're about four hours in the year.
331700	332700	Uh, I don't know.
332700	333700	It's been, it's been a long time.
333740	337900	Don't me on that, but I feel like it's, it's like far, like Hawaii is probably as far away
337900	343220	as like Orlando, you know, it's a long way away.
343220	345620	So I don't think it's that, but who knows?
345620	346620	Who knows?
346620	347620	Anyway.
347620	350180	Five-ish from San Francisco says, uh, Brad from Pod Culture.
350180	351180	Okay.
351180	352180	Fair enough.
352180	353620	Uh, as 200 Matt says, get an allergy test.
353620	354620	You know, what's weird.
354620	356380	I tried hinting to my doctor.
356380	358540	That's kind of what I wanted to do.
358540	361920	And I guess maybe my symptoms weren't bad enough, especially because this is the way
361920	362920	it always happens.
362920	363920	Right.
363920	364920	And we will get into video games.
364920	369160	We always do, but sometimes talk about ourselves, uh, is that I go to the doctor on Thursday
369160	373280	and of course the symptoms on Thursday were like the best they've been all week.
373280	376300	So she was able to see that my throat was irritated a little bit, but like, it wasn't
376300	377300	as bad as it is today.
377300	379240	It wasn't as bad as it is Tuesday.
379240	382400	So she's just like, oh, you're, yeah, you have a little bit of allergies.
382400	387040	I mean, the big baby, I mean, she's not going to say that to me, but you know, it was kind
387040	390960	of like, it wasn't bad enough for her to think like, oh, I should refer him to an allergist.
391000	394080	So I'm going to have to keep complaining if it's really bad or something.
394080	396440	I don't know, but I'm going to try to stick it out for at least a little while longer
396440	401400	and see because it could be maybe that I have like a cold symptom or something that's going
401400	404720	through, but then Alan would have got it because he kind of lives here.
404720	406840	So I don't know guys.
406840	407840	So confusing.
407840	409120	Is there a doctor in the house?
409120	410120	I'm just teasing.
410120	411240	I saw a doctor.
411240	412340	It'll be okay.
412340	416440	But you know how healthcare is here in America.
416440	418840	I have to be, I have to be coughing.
418840	424000	I have to be, you know, really showing more symptoms and probably bleeding or something
424000	425920	to get more expensive tests ordered.
425920	430400	That's that's the way it is, I suppose anyway, or at least prove that these over the counter
430400	431400	things don't work.
431400	432400	All right.
432400	436240	As I promised, we do talk about games here at Orange Launch Radio, and there's been quite
436240	440960	a bit going on this week, especially as we are leading up to E3.
440960	441960	Let's start with this.
441960	445800	This is, this is, I guess this kickoff topic tonight is more of, I guess, maybe a little
445800	450860	bit of a special interest thing, but it does kind of cater to how you buy games and what
450860	451860	you're able to buy.
451860	452860	Right, Logie?
452860	453860	Yeah.
453860	457880	So Valve decided, hey, you know what, we're going to actually do some content moderation
457880	463160	now being that they don't do it for anything else ever.
463160	469140	But now they're apparently they're cracking down on some of these more sexier pornographic
469140	474040	games, basically actually targeting visual novels.
474040	479200	So there's been quite a few different developers of these visual novel titles that have been
479200	484520	getting emails basically stating that, you know, they were going to be removed from the
484520	491040	platform because of, you know, erotic material in those games.
491040	494860	But it sounds like that they have backtracked on that a little bit.
494860	500980	So apparently, Mega Gamer, Honeypot and Loopy Soft have now said that they've received emails
500980	504700	from Valve saying that they're going to be rereviewed for content and they'll be informed
504700	507020	that there's any specific concerns.
507020	508100	So that's kind of good.
508100	513820	But I find it ironic that this is what they come down on, you know, this like, oh my God,
513820	518180	there's, you know, anime breasts in a fucking game versus, oh my God, there's a bunch of
518180	522780	broken ass shit that people are exploiting this platform to try to get online.
522780	527400	That no big deal because we get paid, but oh my God, the titties, please don't show
527400	528400	those titties.
528400	530520	The ultra violent things they can get through.
530520	531520	No problem.
531520	533200	But that that speaks to a larger issue in this country.
533200	534200	We all know that.
534200	539040	Yeah, they had one that Hatred had been one of those titles that they removed for violence.
539040	542980	But then eventually they just went ahead and put it back on there.
542980	545840	So it was just, you know, huh?
545840	549720	I just I mean, it's it's kind of like you said, though, like it's it's just boobs.
549720	552840	Like, why can't they just put a warning or something like that on there?
552840	555940	Why can't they just put it all games on the floor, you know, make it so that you have
555940	558320	to be 18 or older to purchase it, which isn't it?
558320	563360	I mean, granted, I I've always kind of hated, which, you know, well, those those age gates
563360	564360	aren't very hard to get around.
564360	565360	You just lie about your birthday.
565360	568360	But don't you have to have like be 18 to buy games on steam anyway?
568360	569360	Maybe not.
569360	571240	I mean, I would think so, because you have to have a credit card, but you could have
571240	572240	a steam.
572240	573920	Yeah, I guess that's really hard.
573920	574920	Steam points card.
574920	575920	Allow them.
575920	578640	So you have to have a credit card on file or something like that.
578640	579640	Yeah.
579640	583320	Something in your name or something, something to get the more intense stuff and certainly
583320	587480	like a warning or who gives a fuck because it's just fucking drawn boobs.
587480	590240	I mean, well, I mean, let's put it this way.
590240	595120	If you're if you're below the age of 18 and you're on the platform and you're attempting
595120	599360	to purchase sexy whatever game and you're not allowed to do that.
599360	600740	Oh, my God.
600740	605900	It's not like you don't have access to the whole Internet where there's just pornography
605900	607660	literally everywhere.
607660	613060	That's true that you can access parents really freely and still need to watch what their
613060	617280	kids are doing and actually use steam, especially if like, you know, little Timmy.
617280	621000	Who is, you know, maybe only 14 years old is going to have a steam account because grandma
621000	623840	buys him steam port point cards for Christmas.
623840	626400	And the parents probably want to make sure that like porty games don't go on it.
626400	630720	But shouldn't it be very easy for the parents to be able to see receipts and what they don't
630720	631720	they have?
631720	634180	I'm assuming since this would be like any other platform that's out there when they
634180	637840	have parental controls on steam to be able to prevent those types of games from even
637840	638840	showing up in searches.
638840	642280	I have to be honest, I've never really used that stuff because I don't have kids.
642280	646000	I don't have kids that buy games either on my steam account because it's just me buying
646000	647880	games on my steam.
647880	649440	No one's buying games on my steam account.
649440	652920	Well, I was just gonna say your kids are going to get older soon enough.
652920	655720	So have you thought about any of this type of stuff or are you just going to kind of
655720	657200	try to control all that?
657200	660080	Nah, I'm not going to block anything.
660080	661360	Who cares?
661360	662360	It's just titties.
662360	667000	I'll just say, I'll just tell them this, okay, it's like, listen, these games are here to
667000	669360	try to sell you anime titties.
669360	671560	They're not that great.
671560	675280	If you're looking to see anime titties, you can just don't pay for fucking pornography.
675560	676560	Yes, not even like good boobs.
676560	678240	Don't pay for pornography.
678240	680320	That's the lesson that needs to be learned there.
680320	681840	They're not even like good boobs.
681840	682840	They're not even tittle-lating.
682840	688080	Anyway, let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
688080	692240	Some help from folks that have actually seen some of these things in steam.
692240	696880	MXC says some steam games do have age gates before you go to the store page, although
696880	698560	Kaiju-do, you know how to get around it.
698560	702140	I tell them I was born in 1923, I can get into anything.
702140	707780	Let's see, MXC does say, steam accounts do have family libraries you can set up, as in
707780	710340	hiding certain games, restricting, etc.
710340	714500	Yeah, I was gonna say, like, there has to be, I mean, that whole type of stuff is customary
714500	715500	now.
715500	716500	I'd be very surprised if that wasn't in there.
716500	719980	And if the issue is, oh, well then my child is gonna find a way to get around it, if they're
719980	724500	smart enough to find a way to get around your age gating or whatever, they know where the
724500	725740	porn is on the internet.
725740	727260	I mean, come on.
727260	731460	Bobby Black Wolf says, notice that Valve only cares about anime titties.
731460	734620	3D model titties like in The Witcher 3 are not in trouble.
734620	738860	If some of those anime visual novels were 3D models, they probably would be fine.
738860	739900	That's a good counterpoint.
739900	740900	There are some-
740900	742500	Which doesn't make any goddamn sense.
742500	747860	Is it because, like, again, I haven't played these games, but is it because the anime characters
747860	749780	are portrayed as young girls?
749780	753500	So it gets in that really, like, yucky area of kiddie porn, which I agree is gross.
753500	754500	Let's just put it this way.
754500	760380	Okay, so I have my Steam store page up here right now, and as I'm scrolling down, I have
760380	765700	under, you know, the under $10 page has a bunch of the Super Dimension Neptunia stuff,
765700	767980	which all has anime chicks on the front.
767980	772280	Scroll down even a little bit further, and I've got this game called RabiRibi, which
772280	781380	has, you know, scantily clad, young looking anime chicks in it as well.
781380	783500	I mean, I don't know.
783500	787220	I was just about to ask, like, where's the anime dicks, though?
787220	791980	And MXC with a good point in our chat saying, some of the visual novels do feature young,
791980	793380	in quotes, looking girls.
793380	798700	However, coming out on top, a gay dating sim about college men was also targeted.
798700	804420	Was- I can't keep my gay dating sims straight.
804420	807500	But is coming out on top, is that, like, sexually explicit?
807500	811340	Didn't it have a version on Steam that took the really gross stuff- well, I say gross,
811340	814820	but, you know, Tumblr type stuff out?
814820	816060	I thought that's how it worked.
816060	819180	Not that I expect you to know, but I- somebody in chat hopefully does.
819180	820580	There's too many games to keep track of.
820580	825060	I remember one of those popular gay dating sims, and I think it was that one, had, like,
825060	829340	a watered down Steam version that came out where they removed, like, the most explicit,
829340	834860	like, jizz on my face type of scenes that were, like, in the original, if I remember
834860	835860	correctly.
835860	838540	You know, I have- honestly, I've never played those games.
838540	841420	Like, if I want porn, just go to Tumblr.
841420	843980	Or the new one that we've talked about on this show, you know where all the porn is
843980	844980	at now?
844980	846580	Like, it's, like, it's Twitter.
846580	848540	Like, all the fucking porn is going to Twitter.
848540	851960	I don't know, like, where that is, but we've talked about this on a previous episode because
851960	856540	you get really annoyed because you just happen to have a lot of gay male friends who heart
856540	859620	stuff and then your feed just fills up with dudes in underwear.
859620	862220	Listen, this is what I- okay, listen.
862220	863500	Which is not your preferred thing.
863500	867860	Wait, and then I'll have a problem- it's really a problem with Twitter, and it's anything
867860	870300	that basically, oh, this person liked this thing.
870300	871940	I don't care what you liked, okay?
871940	872940	Oh, yeah, yeah.
872940	877460	Liking is good if you want to let that person know you liked the thing, or you want to bookmark
877460	881780	it for later so that you can go back to it and it's easily able to find.
881780	885500	That's why I did, like, I- there was a really cool animation that I saw that gave me a great
885500	888780	idea for, like, a game idea, so I was like, okay, I'm gonna like that so that I can go
888780	892660	back to my like list and find this thing that I'm looking for.
892700	898340	So, you know, that's what I use it for, but like, I get it, you find that guy attractive,
898340	902780	but dude, I can only block so many gay men on my, you know, Twitter feed.
902780	904300	And before you start to look over the whole day.
904300	909220	It's not that I am, like, anti-gay or anything, it's like, I browse Twitter at work and I
909220	911900	don't want that, just like, oh, hey.
911900	913100	Loki, it's happening to me.
913100	917140	Believe it or not, I'm friends with some straight people, and the same thing's happening to
917140	918140	me.
918140	921340	I'm getting Beaver on my feed, which I'm- I try very hard not to be one of those gay
921340	924460	guys that's like, ew, vagina.
924460	928860	But you know, I'm just like, okay, I didn't really need to see this, this is not the content
928860	930260	I signed up for today.
930260	937620	Well, yeah, like, I've got a few people on my feed that enjoy, you know, very attractive
937620	940220	cosplay women in there as well.
940220	944620	And that also is something I can't just have popping up on my screen if I'm browsing Twitter.
944620	949100	But you know what most people are gonna tell you, stop using Twitter at work and do your
949100	950100	work.
950140	954540	See, Twitter's blocked at my work, so I only have my phone if I'm gonna check Twitter.
954540	960180	So luckily, that's, you know, pretty easy to hide, but still, I'm like, the hearted
960180	962900	post feed, that really fucking annoys me.
962900	967260	The only way to get around it that I found, I can do it on my PC if I use TweetDeck.
967260	971580	You go to like TweetDeck.Twitter.com or something like that, and it will show you, you can set
971580	975300	up different custom feeds, but like your normal feed will not have any of that shit in it.
975300	979860	So it's like the third party stuff is the only way to get around, like, the forced like
979860	980860	stuff.
980860	984260	But I heard that that might be changing in the coming weeks, that like Twitter's gonna
984260	985820	clamp down on the third party stuff.
985820	989900	Of course they wanna market that shit, so whatever, I mean, it is what it is.
989900	992420	I just kinda, I just block people now.
992420	994620	I mean, that's all I have to do.
994620	997260	And I mean, whatever.
997260	998260	It's fine.
998260	1000420	It's not like I'm gonna follow those people anyways.
1000420	1001420	That's it, yeah.
1001420	1004020	Kaijuto in chat says, I respect my followers on Twitter.
1004020	1005660	I never fav nude pics.
1005660	1006660	I see.
1006660	1007660	Same thing.
1007660	1009940	And like, I would keep it real.
1009940	1015020	Sometimes I've been at home, and I'm looking at Twitter late at night, and you know, some
1015020	1020420	very attractive male is lying on his bed in his jockstrap, and I'm like, that is a fine
1020420	1022100	looking specimen of a man.
1022100	1026260	And like, I wanna click the heart to give that guy that validation he's seeking, but
1026260	1030220	I don't do it out of respect for people like Loki and everybody else who follows me, because
1030220	1034140	I'm like, okay, if I heart this post, everybody's gonna know you're a perv.
1034140	1036900	Like, I don't, but I feel bad.
1036900	1041340	I'm like, I wanna give my friends posting nudes validation, but I can't do it.
1041340	1044460	That's why they should have something separate where you can do it.
1044460	1047540	Or you just have to roll a separate account, and I think that's something that Bobby Blackwell's
1047540	1051820	getting to in our chat, saying, don't be horny on maim.
1051820	1055460	And that's what other people are doing, is that people are making, I keep wanting to
1055460	1057540	say, rolling alt accounts.
1057540	1060660	It's a World of Warcraft character.
1060660	1063580	So you have your real World of Warcraft character Twitter account.
1063580	1065140	I'm rolling the pervert class now?
1065140	1071740	Yeah, then you have your Goldshirean Warcraft character on the Moonguard server.
1071740	1077220	And that's actually, that's what I do see some people doing, not a lot, but I do have
1077220	1078220	friends that do that.
1078220	1084280	They have a, they have a, but they will follow me still on their alt.
1084280	1088700	And like, I'm not interested in posting naked photographs of myself on the internet.
1088700	1090540	I have nothing against people that do.
1090540	1094100	I think that's cool if you have that type of like self-esteem to be able to do that,
1094100	1097940	but like, it's also one of those things where I can look at it and go, you know, not for
1097940	1098940	me.
1098940	1103260	And especially having the increased visibility of doing this show, my career and so forth.
1103260	1106240	Nudes of me on the internet, probably not the best idea, right?
1106240	1113100	So like, I have no interest in rolling an alt account to post, but maybe to view, maybe.
1113100	1115300	Anyway, where were we?
1115300	1118020	Anime titties turned into a Twitter talk.
1118020	1121020	Does Steam need to ban Twitter?
1122020	1125580	I think they need to focus their selves on other things, honestly.
1125580	1131900	I mean, I don't know what the, from what I, because I remember hearing a story about this.
1131900	1136100	And so it was, I think another, it was like a Watchsaw group or something that like went
1136100	1137500	after these types of games.
1137500	1140180	And that's what kind of brought attention to the Steam about it.
1140180	1146460	But I mean, really, they need to just focus more on these games that, you know, the whole
1146460	1149540	getting rid of the whole, the green light thing and stuff.
1149540	1150540	Terrible idea.
1150540	1156540	Because now anything's on there and literally all sorts of bullshit garbage is on Steam
1156540	1157540	now.
1157540	1158540	It's ridiculous.
1158540	1159540	All right.
1159540	1162980	And then I'm looking in chat, Fifth Dreams saying, I just had this conversation on Twitter
1162980	1167020	last night and this morning, a musician I follow click like on a lady and you could
1167020	1168020	see her butt.
1168020	1171180	I wonder out loud if people know we can sometimes see those likes.
1171180	1174860	Well, remember that infamous case that happened with Senator Ted Cruz?
1174860	1175860	Yeah.
1176180	1180780	His account liked some porny thing and it became a meme overnight.
1180780	1182900	And now you still see that come up.
1182900	1183900	That lady in the glasses.
1183900	1184900	What the fuck was that?
1184900	1188100	I don't remember what was going on, but the lady in the glasses biting your finger because
1188100	1191340	she's like looking at something sexy going on, like, you know, that infamous still from
1191340	1192340	that.
1192340	1195820	Like that is probably the most well-known story about that happening was when that account,
1195820	1201040	whether it was him or an intern or whatever it was, it certainly was not a great look
1201040	1206600	for a professional, you know, politician, no matter how you feel about politics.
1206600	1207960	Let's see.
1207960	1209400	Also in chat, S.J.
1209400	1212760	O'Connor-Matt says, I have the same problem.
1212760	1215920	I keep seeing people favoriting borderline, not safe for work, furry stuff.
1215920	1219840	I have no problem or issue with friends having their, that be their interest, but I really
1219840	1225760	don't want to see a sexualized fan drawing of Isabel from Animal Crossing on my feed.
1225760	1228880	I also just block it now.
1228880	1237760	Hey, why don't I show you where you can put those bells?
1237760	1240800	She's just trying to pay off her mortgage.
1240800	1250160	The things Tom Nook makes people do are very, very dark.
1250160	1256520	I love that multiple people in chat are starting to put no in all caps, not just one person,
1256520	1258440	but like multiple people on a row.
1258440	1267080	No, stop, desist, end, cease.
1267080	1269640	Vidpower says, I did not need to know about Isabel porn.
1269640	1270640	A blame S.J.
1270640	1271640	O'Connor-Matt.
1271640	1272640	It was his idea.
1272640	1273640	It's a thing.
1273640	1274640	There's the Internet.
1274640	1275640	Of course, there's porn of it.
1275640	1279120	Oh, my God.
1279120	1280120	Let's see.
1280120	1284920	And then J.D. saying, there's a reason why there's a difference between like and retweet.
1284920	1285920	Amen.
1285920	1291760	Like, why can't it just be if I want people to know I like it, I'll retweet it.
1291760	1292760	And I do.
1292760	1294520	Actually, you know what I really love?
1294520	1300960	I love the quote retweet thing because I know that people will block retweets because I
1300960	1301960	do that.
1301960	1305960	Like, I didn't do this in the beginning, but pretty much after I had about 500 people I
1305960	1310680	was following, whenever I follow somebody new on Twitter, I instantly shut off their
1310680	1311960	retweets.
1311960	1313320	I don't care who it is.
1313320	1314480	I don't want to see retweets.
1314480	1317080	I want to see the content that the people I'm following are posting.
1317080	1321200	That's how I'm able to follow a thousand people, not with any regularity or whatever.
1321200	1324820	But you know, I try to keep tabs on, you know, whatever.
1324820	1327960	So I instantly disable retweets like all the time.
1327960	1331200	But if you quote a tweet, it goes around that.
1331200	1335360	So if there's something where I'm like, oh, no, I want people to say see this like, oh,
1335360	1339300	there's this great new Maxine Waters video you have to see of her shutting some bitch
1339300	1340300	down in Washington.
1340300	1344040	I'm going to quote tweet it so that you have to see it type of thing.
1344040	1346000	That's how you get around the retweet thing.
1346000	1349880	But it's so funny that you could turn off retweets, but it doesn't turn off the heart
1349880	1350880	thing.
1350880	1353460	Well, yeah, it doesn't make any sense either that you're just going to see what people
1353460	1354460	like anyways.
1354460	1355460	And what's the point?
1355460	1357760	What's the difference between a retwee and the like?
1357760	1359960	I mean, you're going to see it anyways.
1359960	1360960	Yeah.
1360960	1361960	I don't know.
1361960	1363560	So anyway, where were we?
1363560	1364560	Steam.
1364560	1365560	Yes.
1365560	1366560	Yes.
1366560	1367560	Steam.
1367560	1368560	How far have we gotten away from that?
1368560	1371400	I guess the only thing I wanted to add on the Steam front, back on the original topic
1371400	1375400	before we went to Animal Crossing porn, I wanted to say about the fact that doesn't
1375400	1376560	Steam sell movies?
1376560	1379040	Is that still a thing that Steam's doing is selling?
1379040	1381680	So don't they sell R rated movies?
1381680	1382680	I don't know.
1382680	1384240	I haven't actually looked at what kind of movies they sell.
1384240	1390040	I know I have just one one movie that I have that whole movie, the indie game.
1390040	1391880	I was kind of like the first one that went up there.
1391880	1392880	Still haven't watched it to this day.
1392880	1399840	I did watch it for when I went to our innovation lab rotation thing because I was prework prerequisite
1399840	1400840	for what we're doing.
1401280	1403960	Literally had nothing to do with what we were doing at all.
1403960	1408680	So I mean, that was nice that they had me watch it, but it was a good documentary.
1408680	1415320	I really enjoyed it, but yeah, I had no bearing whatsoever on what we were doing, but it was
1415320	1416320	still good.
1416320	1418760	It's weird because I've watched a lot of video game documentaries.
1418760	1419760	Just not that one.
1419760	1421480	It is really good.
1421480	1422480	I know.
1422480	1423480	I don't.
1423480	1424480	I'm not trying to be a hater.
1424480	1426760	I just, for whatever reason, I just never get around to watching it.
1426760	1429960	Probably because it is in my Steam library and not on Netflix.
1429960	1432240	It's not something I think about watching, especially at my computer.
1432240	1436960	Well, it's good too because it's like three games that I've, well okay, I haven't really
1436960	1437960	played.
1437960	1442560	Real quick, S200 Matt says they have 1,088 movies on Steam and MXC confirms they do sell
1442560	1443560	R-rated movies.
1443560	1448920	So I would assume at least one of those R-rated movies has boobs, maybe even a dong or a beav
1448920	1452120	because you can get away with showing like a little bit of that in an R-rated movie,
1452120	1453120	right?
1453120	1454120	Maybe from like a distance, you know?
1454120	1457680	So if you, like up close genitals, probably NC-17, but like from a distance.
1457680	1458680	I don't know.
1458720	1461800	We got away with a lot with Borat.
1461800	1471120	Well, uh, Shape of Water, her lady self was on full display, full frontal display, and
1471120	1473040	that was an R-rated movie.
1473040	1476480	And then, what was the, I mean, spoiler alert, but what have I really spoiled?
1476480	1478360	What's the other one?
1478360	1481880	The other character that he played as well that was in Borat.
1481880	1482880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1482880	1483880	I know what you're talking about.
1483880	1484880	I don't remember his name.
1484880	1490720	But there was, I'm also thinking that movie with, okay, God, you all are going to judge
1490720	1491840	me so hard.
1491840	1495120	Who plays Magneto in X-Men now?
1495120	1499120	And he was in that movie where he did a full frontal, but it was like for like two seconds.
1499120	1500120	Michael something.
1500120	1501680	I don't remember.
1501680	1502680	Somebody in chat will know.
1502680	1503680	I don't know.
1503680	1504680	Anyway.
1504680	1505680	Oh, and Sia Tabiri in chat says Bruno.
1505680	1506680	Bruno, yes.
1506680	1507680	Oh, yeah.
1507680	1508680	Forgetting Sarah Marshall on that.
1508680	1509680	Thank you.
1509680	1510680	Fassbender.
1510680	1511680	That's it.
1511680	1512680	Fassbender.
1512680	1513680	Michael Fassbender.
1513680	1514680	Assassin's Creed!
1514680	1517840	Because I remember joking about, is he going to show us his sword in Assassin's Creed?
1517840	1519520	So, but anyway.
1519520	1521640	And then pretty much half the movies you and McGregor has been in.
1521640	1525680	Anyway, this isn't a nudity in film chat, I promise.
1525680	1530720	Tiger Claw in chat says, did you guys see the trailer for the Happy Time murders?
1530720	1533880	I'm sure there will be plenty of boobage, be it Muppet boobage.
1533880	1534880	Yeah.
1534880	1535880	Yeah.
1535880	1537160	Alan sat me down and made me watch that.
1537160	1539360	That's a total like Meet the Feebles.
1539360	1540920	That's exactly where my head went to.
1540920	1543000	I'm like, didn't they do this called Meet the Feebles?
1543000	1546280	And like the 90 and Meet the Feebles was not very good.
1546280	1547280	It was terrible.
1547280	1550480	But it didn't have Melissa McCarthy or Joe McHale.
1550480	1552420	So these really like funny, funny.
1552420	1553420	It does look funny.
1553420	1556400	Like, Alan's like, we're gonna go see this day one.
1556400	1559560	And so I'm like, even though I never go to movies, I'm like, okay, if it'll make my husband
1559560	1564680	happy, I'll go, you know, I'm kind of looking at it going, this looks ridiculous, but he,
1564680	1566520	he will make me go to the most random comedies.
1566520	1567840	What was the last one we saw?
1567840	1568840	This is the end.
1568840	1569840	That was hilarious.
1569840	1572360	It was it was have funny moments.
1572800	1576040	That's what I'll get funny moments and funny parts.
1576040	1577040	It was funny.
1577040	1578040	I liked it.
1578040	1579040	All right.
1579040	1580040	Anyway.
1580040	1581040	Oh, wow.
1581040	1582040	Okay.
1582040	1585860	JD says this has the actual Jim Henson company behind it, or it sounds like it, which is
1585860	1586860	a change.
1586860	1587860	Wow.
1587860	1588860	Sun or whatever.
1588860	1589860	It's they're allowing that.
1589860	1590860	Yeah.
1590860	1592160	They're the ones doing the puppets.
1592160	1594480	I'm kind of shocked to hear that.
1594480	1595800	My how times have changed.
1595800	1596800	All right.
1596800	1598100	My how the topic has changed.
1598100	1602000	So I think we need to shift gears here before we get into the rest of the news.
1602000	1605200	Talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
1605200	1606680	So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1606680	1609380	I didn't play a whole ton, but I did buy a lot of things.
1609380	1610680	So I mean, there's that.
1610680	1613560	So there's like all sorts of sales going on.
1613560	1617920	I went to that we were looking.
1617920	1622560	My son wanted me to get that Mario and Rabbids kingdom battle thing.
1622560	1627920	So we ended up finding that half off at Fry's because it was their thirty third anniversary.
1627920	1630720	So they had a bunch of things that were half off.
1631080	1634440	With that, though, Fry's also had their DualShock 4's half off.
1634440	1639120	So I got them for thirty bucks instead of like seventy dollars per controller.
1639120	1644760	And because my kids had kind of destroyed a couple of my DualShock controllers, I went
1644760	1646740	ahead and picked up two new ones to go along with it.
1646740	1649400	So now we have four, which is awesome.
1649400	1655920	And then I also picked up yesterday a completely different sale at GameStop.
1655920	1665040	They're doing their pro elite, some sale thing, and they had Skyrim VR for half off.
1665040	1668080	So, of course, I've been holding out and getting Skyrim VR.
1668080	1670040	So I had to pick that up as well.
1670040	1671660	So I can't wait to play that.
1671660	1675420	And then, you know, they've been doing flash sales on the PlayStation Network.
1675420	1680480	So they had Titanfall 2, like the Gold Edition or whatever like that for five bucks.
1680480	1685120	So I was like, hell yes, I will pick that up for five dollars.
1685320	1688120	There's some other like PlayStation VR games that I picked up.
1689040	1691520	So, yeah, lots of stuff to play.
1691800	1692760	Didn't play a whole lot of that.
1692760	1695400	I did play just the kind of the same type of stuff that I've been playing.
1695400	1704240	So lots of Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme still playing a little bit more of Mario Odyssey.
1704920	1708640	And then, of course, on the front of Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme, I was also playing
1708920	1709640	Statmania.
1709640	1716400	I did get my replacement J-packs for my arcade cabinet and for eventually when I convert
1716400	1718680	the machine into a Statmania machine.
1718880	1721480	So I have those now for that.
1721880	1724880	And then what else did I play?
1725120	1730240	Lots of Pokemon Go because I had a field trip and we went down to like the Sacramento Zoo
1730240	1735520	area. So that whole William Lamb Park stuff, tons of PokeStops everywhere.
1735520	1736600	So I did that.
1736600	1741200	And then also, I guess it's like a I don't know if it's a farm for like some sort of like
1741200	1745000	weird frog alligator thing.
1745000	1747680	I don't know what it is, but there was a ton of them around there.
1747680	1752440	So I got that. And then I played through that event that they had on Saturday.
1752440	1759960	Got my Charizard upgraded with the new Dragon Power thing.
1759960	1766080	Sadly, did not get any shinies because the shiny Charizard looks fucking awesome.
1767600	1769800	Um, and then what else?
1770400	1771320	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
1771680	1773560	All right. My gaming week.
1773560	1774960	I'm sorry. One more thing, bitch.
1774960	1779800	Sorry. No, I wanted to get into this because I tweeted about this on Twitter quite a bit.
1779800	1782760	My gaming week is like super short this week because I'm still working on my project.
1782760	1787320	So I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto five because I haven't played Grand Theft Auto five
1787320	1788480	on PC very much.
1788480	1789520	And I'm like, you know what?
1789520	1792800	I keep watching people play Grand Theft Auto five stuff.
1793040	1795200	I'm just going to go ahead and do that.
1795720	1801760	So, um, I went ahead and tried to do that and my password didn't work.
1801760	1802960	And I'm like, well, that's weird.
1802960	1805360	And I'm like, did I change my password and just forget what it was?
1805360	1806320	Like, I don't understand.
1806440	1810600	So I tried resetting it through their service or whatever, and their service is broken.
1810600	1812960	It doesn't send emails out at all.
1813280	1814640	So I was like, OK, well, what the fuck?
1814640	1819200	So I ended up having to log back in or create a new account and relink it to my stuff.
1819360	1820240	And that worked.
1820240	1822320	And it was weird because I was able to keep the same name.
1822560	1826160	But at the same time, I'd already sent a ticket to Rockstar to get that back.
1826440	1832240	So they finally like reset the password for me after confirming my email address.
1832240	1836880	And then I went and logged back in and it was tied to some the PC account was tied to
1836880	1837960	some Russian guy.
1838440	1841120	And I was like, what the fuck is this?
1841120	1846840	And so because I never played on PC, at least online, I played on console.
1847880	1849920	And so I'm like, what the fuck is this shit?
1850040	1854480	Because someone even using my account to play like Grand Theft Auto online on PC, it's not
1854480	1857280	like they're stealing anything from me because I never played on PC.
1857560	1860720	So I don't know what would be the purpose of that other than not having to buy the game.
1861880	1867440	So I was like, yeah, I was in like some Ukrainian clans or whatever on there and Cruz.
1867440	1871120	And so I was like, OK, well, I reset the password already.
1871120	1872920	So that's done. I'm unlinking all this stuff.
1872920	1878080	I'm deleting this. Now I have a level 14 character that's in Grand Theft Auto that I
1878080	1881520	don't know who it is, but it's mine now, which I thought was funny.
1881960	1883400	Jokes on them. Steal my account.
1883400	1884800	I was steal your shit. Wow.
1884800	1886720	So somebody got in your account. That's crazy.
1887240	1891000	I don't even know how, because like it was weird, though, because like I hadn't been
1891000	1893520	that long since they played because I played once I got those computers and I've had
1893520	1894800	this computer for almost a year.
1895800	1897640	So I don't know.
1897640	1902400	I was weird, but man, I mean, it's not like they were going to steal anything from me
1902400	1903920	because I had nothing on that account.
1903920	1908960	So I don't know what the purpose was, but they're going to be upset that their
1908960	1913040	character's gone. They're only level 14 anyways, so whatever.
1913520	1915720	All right. So that was just my little adventure.
1915720	1919040	And then like after trying getting that all resolved and trying to play it, it's like,
1919040	1921480	oh, I got downloaded like 10 gigs of updates.
1921480	1926040	And so that's the worst when the game like you want to sit down and play a game and
1926040	1929560	it's like, oh, I've got to download like 10 gigs of updates before I even tried to
1929560	1932160	reset my password. It downloaded updates and installed them.
1932200	1934320	So I'm like, OK, so we're done updating now.
1934480	1938240	So I go back in there after I logged in, it's like, oh, hey, we got another like five
1938240	1940360	gigs of updates now. Fuck.
1940920	1944240	So I didn't end up getting the playground the thought of five this week, but I will
1944240	1947640	this week. On somebody else's account.
1947640	1950080	All right. Have fun with that.
1950760	1955200	All right. Finally, my new week, I also did the Pokemon event on Saturday, as many of
1955200	1959720	you are talking about in chat, and I hope this doesn't sound like bragging or anything
1959720	1963200	because I know some people have mixed luck on that event and that sucks.
1963200	1967400	But I did get five shiny Charmanders, which you asshole.
1967400	1971440	And I got five. Well, I mean, we we went to the capital when everybody was like, don't
1971440	1974800	go to the capital. It's gonna be fucking nuts down there because we had this big bike
1974800	1977040	race called Amgem that was happening downtown.
1977240	1982040	And then there was graduations going on both at the Golden One Center and at the
1982040	1986240	Memorial Auditorium, which I realize means the two big places to have graduations here.
1986760	1989400	And then there was something else. It was like everything that could be happening in
1989400	1991960	Sacramento was going on this weekend. So they're like, don't go downtown.
1991960	1996040	But I was like, I have guaranteed parking at Alan's work, you know, not to tell all his
1996040	2000720	business, but he works a reasonable distance from the capital so I can park at his work.
2000840	2002040	No problem. And walk.
2002040	2006040	And that's what we did. And, you know, the capital had a few Pokemon players, but it was
2006040	2010600	like probably a quarter of what we usually see at the community days because I think the
2010600	2011560	news scared everybody off.
2012360	2014280	But there was still a lot of Charmanders to be found.
2014520	2016720	And we just kept catching over and over and over again.
2016800	2019760	And I would say we were getting probably one about every 30 minutes.
2019960	2023880	So finally, when we got the third, I say we, it was me and my buddy John, who I used to
2023880	2025000	live with a long time ago.
2025560	2028720	He's like, he was not like a big gamer back in the day.
2028720	2031360	I don't remember if he was ever on this show, but I lived with him for a while.
2031360	2032520	This is a long time ago, guys.
2032760	2036560	This was when, for those of you that have been with OLR a long time, this was when we
2036560	2041680	were simulcasting the show on Justin TV, which, yes, I know a lot of you would like us
2041680	2043760	to go back to and we're talking about it.
2043760	2046400	That's all I can say with Twitch now, obviously.
2046640	2051280	But when we had Justin TV, the simulcast there, remember that that garage studio that
2051280	2054720	had the lights and everything, that was me and John's house.
2054880	2058920	OK, so John was not like a huge gamer, although he was really rad because he always
2058920	2061600	supported this show and the fact that we kind of took over the house every Sunday night.
2061920	2066760	So but he he's he's like more into Pokemon Go than I am.
2067160	2070280	Like we have a competition about who can get more gyms, gym badges.
2070440	2072480	I think 569 gym badges.
2072480	2075640	This bitch has like 630 gym badges.
2075640	2077880	It's like he's visited that many unique gyms around the area.
2077880	2082200	It's pretty crazy. Anyway, so but John's great.
2082960	2084160	He wouldn't hear this anyway.
2084400	2086160	But so him and I went out.
2086160	2090360	We were technically Shane, who you all know him, I'm sure from Ranger Pride and all that.
2090480	2091400	He was there, too.
2091400	2093600	But Shane gets and I'm sure you all know this.
2093800	2096640	He gets in the zone when it comes to shiny hunting.
2096880	2101440	So if we're not moving fast enough for him, he goes off and does his own thing.
2101440	2105480	So within like 20, not even 20 minutes, 15 minutes, that's what happened.
2105640	2108840	John and I were lagging too far behind and he went off to go catch more jar manners.
2109080	2110800	So we weren't able to catch up with it until the end of the day.
2111160	2114800	So anyway, John and I were kind of both like catching about one every 30 minutes.
2114960	2120440	So finally, about the time we got to 90 minutes in and we had three, we were like, OK, well,
2120440	2123160	like three, that's kind of the goal.
2123160	2125600	Like if you get one, you're content.
2125800	2129160	If you get three, you're great because you can have one for each evolution.
2129160	2133720	Right. And even one of the shinies I caught appraised as a wonder or highest appraisal.
2133800	2135840	So it's my first shiny wonder.
2135840	2139680	And it was it was probably like level twenty nine or something also.
2139840	2142560	So like I think I caught a good Charmander.
2142560	2144920	We're good. So I got my little black dragon Charmander.
2144920	2147080	I'm good. So we kind of took it easy at that point.
2147160	2151720	You know, we went over to Starbucks, just would catch whatever shows up on the Starbucks,
2151920	2153400	got a drink, took it easy.
2153400	2156320	Then we walked back and caught a couple more shinies on the way back.
2156320	2158280	So we had a nice kind of like easy day.
2158480	2162680	So I hope you guys had a good Charmander experience, those of you that went out and did
2162680	2166760	it. If you didn't catch a shiny, I can sympathize again.
2166760	2169360	I'm not trying to rub it in. You know what I think they should do.
2169560	2170720	Here's what I think they should do.
2170720	2173520	And those of you that may be a little more frustrated at community day, maybe you'd
2173520	2177720	agree with me on this. They have that questing system in Pokemon Go.
2177920	2179840	Why don't they just make it during community day?
2180040	2184880	Like if you catch fifty Charmanders or you complete twelve quests, which are all I
2184880	2186240	catch three Charmanders or whatever.
2186440	2190120	If you if you do the questing, you get a guaranteed shiny spawn.
2190320	2191320	Wouldn't that be nice?
2191360	2194520	And then, you know, you could at least get one if you put a little effort into it.
2194640	2196840	Yeah, it's kind of like the theory from MMOs.
2196840	2199000	I see Warcraft, I see Final Fantasy 14 doing this.
2199200	2204480	If you do the boss enough times, the boss drops an item or the boss drops points.
2204680	2208720	So you can at least get some sort of reward, even if the thing you want is noise
2208720	2212360	dropping. That I think would be a nice I'd be very happy with that.
2212360	2215360	Even to somebody who did very well this community day, I'd be very happy with a
2215360	2219480	system like that. So anyway, we'll see.
2219520	2222520	I'm finally just now looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2222720	2224840	S2100 Matt says, I got three shinies.
2224840	2227320	I got nothing until the last hour and then I got all three.
2227520	2230000	I was sweating and not happy about it during it.
2230200	2234520	It doesn't help that it was pouring in NYC and the map was messed up with a lot of
2234520	2235720	weather boosted Pokemon.
2235920	2240440	Well, I mean, it probably worsened my allergies and here I am today.
2240440	2241680	So there you go. All right.
2241680	2245280	So besides Pokemon Go, which I talked about plenty enough, I played Blaster Master
2245280	2248320	Zero this week because I was just looking through stuff on Switch.
2248520	2252440	I almost got Hyrule Warriors, but I was like, I haven't had a lot of time.
2252440	2256440	Yeah, I thought about I saw that the sort of like, am I really going to do I want to
2256440	2257680	drop 60 bucks on this?
2257680	2261560	I mean, well, I if I can, which I know Nintendo games never go on sale, but if
2261560	2264800	maybe like Amazon Prime still has the deal, maybe I'll get it through that or
2264800	2271320	something to excuse me, guys, maybe I'll get it there at some point.
2271680	2273080	But yeah, 60 bucks.
2273080	2274240	Yeah, it's always like 60 dollars.
2274240	2276520	Take a risk. Will I really play this game or not?
2277280	2279040	But I think I will probably end up getting it.
2279040	2279880	But I was like, what do I want to play?
2279880	2283720	And I was like, you know, I love this Blaster Master Zero game and there's all
2283720	2285200	these DLC characters I've barely touched.
2285200	2286600	So I went in and played that for a little while.
2286600	2289680	That was my good little like decompression game earlier this week.
2289720	2294080	So anyway, hopefully I'll get to play more games this week.
2294080	2298720	I still need to go binge spend money on Pinball Arcade because like you guys
2298720	2301760	that news last week, I'm sad that all those tables are going away.
2301760	2306200	But I think, Loki, I think I'm going to double dip on PC if for nothing else.
2306200	2309640	The fact that I can stream some of them and just kind of have them in my steam
2309640	2313240	library because like PC, that's always going to be there, right?
2313440	2315720	Yeah. PlayStation three, PlayStation four.
2316120	2319720	You know, if PlayStation five, I can't believe I just brought up PlayStation
2319720	2321000	five on this podcast, but here we are.
2321200	2324800	If PlayStation five isn't backwards compatible again, I wouldn't.
2325000	2326480	I wouldn't guarantee anything.
2326520	2327960	I don't think it's ever going to.
2327960	2329400	I'm not going to guarantee it either.
2329400	2332480	And like honestly, like when it comes down to the next gen systems, whatever
2332480	2335920	that's going to be, I'm probably going to go Xbox this time again, because
2336120	2339440	honestly, it's like I like the first party games.
2339440	2343600	But when it comes to some of these other games that I tend to play more, which are
2343600	2347040	like, you know, Skyrim and stuff like that, you know, the Bethesda games, look
2347040	2348960	who's supporting modding a lot better.
2349040	2352720	Yeah. I mean, like they have like these whole beyond Skyrim things, you know,
2352720	2354640	that giant mod that they're talking about and stuff.
2354800	2358440	They have the first part of that available on the Xbox.
2358640	2361560	You can you can download that mod on the Xbox.
2361600	2364200	Can't do that shit on PlayStation four.
2364400	2367720	So, yeah, I mean, I think take the stance
2367920	2371680	of someone that actually seems to be listening to their user base.
2371880	2374120	JD in our chat at live.vognetwork.com
2374320	2376400	points out Nintendo games do go on sale.
2376600	2379280	The eShop has an on sale section, for instance.
2379480	2382280	I should have. Well, I should have clarified.
2382480	2385280	I meant like first party Nintendo games rarely go on sale.
2385280	2387600	I am aware that the indie stuff, they are pretty good.
2387600	2390600	And that's a good way to like feature the indie stuff to just like on Steam.
2390800	2395000	Now, and to be fair, I know that sometimes you have like the gold coins
2395000	2396000	you can trade in for deals.
2396000	2398160	I'm not talking about one cent per coin, but like you can buy
2398160	2399480	like a 40 percent off coupon.
2399480	2400720	They do those types of things.
2400720	2402400	Maybe Black Friday, they'll have a sale.
2402400	2405400	But Nintendo first party sales are pretty rare.
2406880	2407600	Well, I don't.
2407600	2410640	Maybe the Wii U was a little more generous because the Wii U was struggling
2410640	2414160	a little bit, but I think like, no, even the Wii U wasn't very.
2414160	2415640	Yeah, you know. Yeah.
2415640	2417320	So, you know,
2417480	2419440	anyway, just like I think,
2419440	2422600	JD, nothing that's going to be on sale, like in the next couple months,
2422600	2425040	like Black Friday would probably be the first time a game like that.
2425040	2427160	Weird stance to take, though, like I get it.
2427400	2430600	And I guess, you know, with the switch, it's still early in its lifespan.
2430600	2433680	But I mean, they did the whole Nintendo select stuff with the Wii U.
2433680	2435040	So maybe they'll do that with the switch.
2435040	2437320	So they'll re-release them for 20 bucks or something like that.
2437760	2442400	But I mean, even first party companies on all the other platforms,
2442400	2443720	you know, they discount their stuff.
2443720	2445880	I just don't understand
2445880	2448520	why they're so stingy with their titles.
2449120	2452360	Like, I get it. They're, you know, these games are masterpieces.
2452400	2453720	Yeah, no one is arguing that.
2453720	2455800	But they're arguing that, you know, hey,
2455800	2458880	maybe charging $60 for a game that came out four years ago.
2458880	2461560	Not a great idea. You know, I don't know.
2464600	2466400	To register participation for this week's
2466400	2470640	episode of Orange Island Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase cover.
2471240	2473640	All right. Well, let's you know what?
2473640	2474920	We're talking about game sales.
2474920	2477000	What a great transition into our first topic tonight.
2477000	2478240	Let's get this gaming news.
2478240	2480240	I'll just quickly do some housekeeping.
2480240	2482080	No shows off plan in the immediate future.
2482080	2484320	We will be out the weekend of June 24th.
2484320	2486920	I think the day is as I'm going to be out of town on a trip.
2486920	2490720	But you can look forward to our 16th anniversary special the week before that.
2490720	2493120	I say there's not going to be anything special about the show.
2493120	2495160	Maybe we'll try to get a guest or two.
2495160	2497160	But that will be on June 17th.
2497160	2502400	We'll be celebrating 16 years doing this old enough to drive this show is.
2502400	2505720	But, you know, it's one of those things where I'm like, I'm actually like
2505720	2509840	not to get too sappy, but I'm I'm really proud that we've had the drive to just
2509840	2514200	fucking stick with it this long, like 16 years is a long time to do anything.
2514200	2515840	It's amazing. It's pretty amazing.
2515840	2517960	Anyway, that's the one little toot our own horn.
2517960	2520200	I will do we'll do more of that in June.
2521480	2523800	But yeah, so and of course, follow us on Twitter.
2523800	2526760	Twitter dot com slash all our and Facebook, Facebook dot com slash Orange
2526760	2529640	Lounge Radio. OK, now we can do gaming news about sales.
2529640	2532480	Yes, Logie. So this is actually unfortunate.
2532480	2537080	But Best Buy, they've canceled their Gamers Club and they haven't even really made a big
2537080	2542520	announcement. But apparently Gamers Club unlocked was that service that you could get
2542520	2545160	20 percent discounts on new games.
2545160	2550320	You pay like a one time fee each year and you get those wonderful discounts.
2550320	2556400	Well, there was apparently rumors that the service had been canceled.
2556400	2561920	And it's been confirmed now, speaking with some Best Buy employees, that there was an
2561920	2565640	internal memo saying that the service ended on May 17th.
2565640	2572720	They haven't given a reason why it was ended, but apparently, you know, they're going to
2572720	2576040	honor the subscriptions for as long as they have left.
2576040	2579280	But you're not going to be able to renew that subscription going forward.
2579280	2586000	So that's unfortunate because I know a lot of people use that for preordering games, but
2586000	2587600	maybe it just wasn't profitable for them.
2587600	2591600	Yeah. And I know some people that swear by that as opposed to Amazon Prime.
2591600	2594760	So that's a little bit shocking because that Gamers Club is also giving you discounts on
2594760	2597680	Amiibo and that stuff, which the Prime thing doesn't do.
2597920	2599000	So this is a little bit.
2599000	2603760	Well, I mean, it is and it isn't shocking, you know, because they probably were losing a
2603760	2606480	bit of money on it and retail's kind of hurting as it is.
2606480	2608440	So maybe this is something they had to do.
2608800	2612240	Maybe they're going to think about a way to try to discount games from the top for
2612240	2616600	everybody, as opposed to just having to sign into this program to make it a little more
2616600	2621360	appealing that like, hey, we do cheaper games even if you don't have our subscription.
2621480	2624600	I obviously you probably go, Rob, that makes mathematically no sense.
2624600	2628480	Obviously, I'm talking about not as deep of a discount, but maybe, you know, a couple
2628480	2632160	bucks. Well, not that they promote GameStop or anything, but I know they have their
2632760	2635160	because I was looking at it this week, their used game.
2635160	2639000	I think they have this now elite thing you can buy, which is slightly more expensive than
2639000	2641040	just the fifteen dollars a year.
2641040	2645840	And you get 20 percent off their used games versus just the 10 percent off that you
2645840	2647960	normally get, which isn't a great deal.
2647960	2651880	But I mean, you could if you were looking to purchase, you know, quite a few games like
2651880	2656400	I was thinking to purchase, you know, quite different games or quite a few games on the
2656400	2657440	switch and other platforms.
2657440	2661440	I was like, well, you know, I could probably make up that difference, that cost to pay
2661440	2664840	for that with the savings I would get from purchasing those games.
2664840	2669440	So I was like, it might be worth it in that sense, but I don't know, maybe not something
2669440	2670880	I'd pay for every year.
2671120	2674800	So some of the comments from our chat, some surprise actually at this news, fifth dream
2674800	2676080	says, whoa, shit, they canceled it.
2676080	2677440	So many people are going to be pissed.
2677880	2680080	Tiger class says maybe because nobody took advantage of it.
2680080	2681640	Nobody ever talks about this gamers club.
2681840	2683040	I know people that used it.
2683040	2687600	I mean, I think more people are using the Amazon Prime thing, but that's not to say I
2687600	2691960	don't certainly know people using the Best Buy thing because somebody else points out in
2691960	2695040	chat, you could double dip on it and get the points and so forth.
2695040	2698120	And JD said that you can double dip and get points and the discount.
2698120	2699840	And that's what kind of sells it for some people.
2699840	2703720	So, yeah, you kind of have to wonder, like, was it really profitable for Best Buy or was
2703720	2704840	it, you know, they're taking a step back.
2705800	2709800	Fifth dream with another perspective here says game companies have been fighting back
2709800	2714760	to Sony and others have been stopping Amazon from offering presales on their games because
2714760	2716280	of that discount, I'm sure.
2716640	2717840	Very, very interesting.
2718080	2720600	And Brad from Pod Culture says, I used it a lot.
2720880	2723320	Lego Dimensions alone saved me the cost.
2723320	2726320	Yeah. If you buy a lot of those add ons and so forth, for sure.
2726360	2731080	For sure. So many times I've been so tempted to buy Lego Dimensions every time like I'll
2731080	2733360	see it. It could be dirt cheap, like 20 bucks.
2733360	2736840	And I'm like, I know if I buy that, I'm not going to play that game.
2736880	2738440	Yeah, I know I'm going to buy that.
2738440	2741080	I'm like, ooh, I'm not going to play the game.
2741080	2743600	I'm like, there's no way I'm buying this game.
2744160	2745200	It's a fun game, though.
2745200	2747640	That being said, though, I have so many of the characters.
2747640	2750800	I really appreciate that they didn't put out a new version every year.
2750800	2754680	Seriously, though, if you are into Lego Dimensions and want to pick up some of those
2754680	2759840	things before they go away, Dollar Store has them for two dollars a pack and they're
2759840	2764160	still selling them and like best like GameStop and Target and Walmart for 20 bucks a
2764160	2765960	piece for those little things.
2766120	2768440	Two dollars. I have a desk drawer full of them.
2768560	2771320	All right. Let's move on to another story.
2771320	2774480	This is another big story from this week talking about the game No Man's Sky.
2774480	2777120	Yeah, it's been two years, believe it or not, since that game launched.
2777360	2780920	But No Man's Sky is going to be getting a new multiplayer mode.
2780920	2785800	And Hello Games has confirmed that this is happening as part of the Inside Xbox YouTube
2785800	2788360	show, which we already knew No Man's Sky was coming out for Xbox.
2788360	2791520	Like, yeah, exclusive window for PlayStation is probably run out.
2791720	2794880	So the game is going to be coming out on Xbox now on July 24th.
2795400	2799920	So the director, Sean Murray, said that alongside this Xbox launch, the game is going
2799920	2803400	to start allowing people to work and fight alongside one another.
2803560	2807760	So I'm not sure if Jason got that right in the intro or what he was alluding to, but it
2807760	2812440	sounds like this multiplayer update is coming out the same day as the Xbox version.
2812440	2814040	It's in July, July.
2815040	2820400	So even though there was a multiplayer update last year, it was with the little glowing dots.
2820400	2822600	It's not fable multiplayer.
2822600	2823920	Yeah, no, it's not really what it is.
2824120	2828440	So in the press release, you can do the infinite universe with your friends or bump into random travelers.
2828680	2832880	As you voyage together, friends will help you stay alive or possibly prey on others.
2832880	2834480	Oh, God, trolls can't wait.
2835160	2840360	Build bases from tiny shelters to complex colonies that you create as a team and can be seen by the community.
2840480	2843040	The shelter colony thing was kind of already in the game, to be fair.
2843880	2845120	I got a call again. Sorry.
2846640	2855120	Be a pirate or wingman in epic space battles with friends and foes and race exocraft across weird alien terrains and create tracks to share online.
2855360	2857800	That that bullet right there.
2857920	2863120	That's the one that made me perk up because I'm like, is this the closest to F-Zero we're going to get?
2863280	2867000	Because that I like that we're going to get vehicles aren't that fast.
2867280	2868760	They're like little dune buggy thing.
2868760	2870680	Not yet, but maybe like the Mako.
2870680	2872080	You have to mine more.
2872080	2873120	That's all it has to be.
2873120	2875280	But that that part sounds really exciting.
2875280	2875960	So that's pretty cool.
2875960	2877160	So, yeah.
2877160	2885040	So what do you think about No Man's Sky still kind of working on the game for keeping, you know, for keep working on it?
2885040	2887240	I mean, seriously, they got their money.
2887400	2893240	Yeah, especially in the face of all the negativity out there about the game, like they have really stuck with it.
2893440	2895760	And I really can't help but give them props either.
2895760	2896480	I think it's great.
2897640	2899720	So, I mean, congrats to them for sticking with it.
2900320	2902160	And maybe maybe it'll work out in their favor.
2902160	2908840	I mean, I don't know how many people are going to want to visit this game again on Xbox, but I'll go back to it on PlayStation after all the updates are done.
2908840	2917120	Yeah, there's a there's a loyal crowd on Microsoft's end that I'm sure we'll be curious to check this out, that maybe they feel like they're getting the better version.
2917120	2920080	I don't know, although PlayStation is getting the same update, so is PC.
2920360	2922000	But, you know, kind of neat, kind of neat.
2922600	2925840	Dungeon Buster in chat says, I hope the multiplayer works out for No Man's Sky.
2926080	2927720	The base building stuff is pretty crazy.
2927920	2931960	And Dungeon Buster continues, kudos to the team for adding more content this way.
2932080	2933160	And it really should be noted.
2933160	2937920	I mean, in case you weren't aware, they've been slowly adding to the game this whole time.
2938160	2945560	I mean, it's not like every couple of weeks, but they've been putting out these big updates on a fairly regular basis, you know, across these two years.
2945800	2946760	So kudos to them.
2946760	2949240	I want to check this out, too, when it comes out.
2949600	2951800	So I'll probably reroll again.
2951800	2958360	I guess maybe PC for me, even though I do have the PlayStation 4 version, if I do PC, my streaming set up is better there.
2958360	2961920	So that's why I tend to get on PC to see what the sales look like.
2962080	2964080	We'll see. All right, let's move on.
2964080	2966080	Loki, more big announcements for this week, right?
2966120	2971400	Yes. So less is less of announcements, more of confirming rumors.
2971400	2981320	But they did a whole Black Ops 4 presentation that was streamed online talking about the big changes coming to Black Ops.
2981880	2985680	So Call of Duty this year is not going to have a single player campaign.
2986600	2988440	Instead, it's going to be multiplayer only.
2989160	2993440	With that, you're getting three zombie modes or maps or whatever that are going to be in there.
2993720	3002080	And then they're also going to have this brand new mode that's basically their big battle royale mode.
3002200	3004600	So that's going to be available as well.
3004960	3020640	Interesting, though, I know with rumors of this and other, I guess, inside sources had said that they were working on a single player campaign for the game, but apparently due to time constraints, they weren't able to finish it.
3021120	3024040	And so that was scrapped from the game because of that.
3025600	3033280	But, you know, some of the other selling points of the game, they're saying this time it's more class based multiplayer.
3033360	3036240	So they have different classes you can play on that can do different things.
3036840	3041920	A lot of the wall running and stuff that were in some of the other games are gone.
3041920	3048880	They say now it's boots on the ground and the zombie modes look kind of interesting.
3048880	3057640	They had one that was, you know, kind of this gladiatory type thing, which is melee weapons.
3058040	3062840	Then they had a couple other ones that were, I don't know, just look like your classic zombie fare.
3063360	3069240	But for me, I'm really disappointed with it because I did play the campaign.
3069240	3077840	And they would like to say, and I've heard this and a lot of fans of Call of Duty will say this, that no one plays Call of Duty single player.
3077840	3079560	No one plays the single player campaign.
3079560	3082000	Everyone's in Call of Duty for the multiplayer.
3082960	3092240	And that's just wrong, actually, because I've watched other videos talking about this in one of them, which is by a YouTuber that I tend to watch,
3092400	3102800	Yang Ye, which talked about if you look at these sites like Steam and I want to say there's a PlayStation Trophy site that had the same type of information.
3102920	3111360	And you look at the trophies that people have in Call of Duty as far as these games, there's about half of the people that play Call of Duty that finished the campaign.
3112000	3118120	And then only about half as well that have actually prestige, you know, once they've gotten that trophy, the prestige.
3118120	3123160	So to say that no one plays single player is not really true.
3123160	3125160	And here's what it comes down to, honestly.
3125160	3131560	And I know that the fan base wants to, you know, say, oh, well, too bad you don't like it and you're just scrub or whatever.
3131960	3138000	It comes down to the point that Activision and they've been it's been a numbers game with Activision.
3138000	3147680	Like look at what they did to Call of Duty Tomorrow Warfare Remastered, where they basically interject, you know, they sold the DLC maps for the game.
3147760	3152840	Separately, they gated the game behind Infinite Warfare.
3152840	3158400	You have to buy Infinite Warfare to get the game because no one really wanted to purchase Infinite Warfare.
3159400	3163400	And then they, you know, stuck in loot boxes into the game.
3163400	3164920	It's a numbers game for them.
3165400	3173560	So do they spend money to develop a campaign that might get some people, you know, get a lot of people excited about it and bring it in there?
3174440	3181920	Or do they save the money in developing the campaign and sure, they're going to lose, you know, quite a bit of sales from it.
3181920	3188680	But in the end, they make up more money by putting in this battle royale mode and they're able to monetize that more.
3188840	3197680	And so they're going to make up more money with monetization and loot boxes, because honestly, if you listen to any of their financial numbers, that's where all the fucking money is anyway.
3198040	3201960	And so that's why they're not seeing people as their customers anymore.
3201960	3208560	They're seeing them as the numbers and they're playing the numbers to make themselves the most money because they don't want just some of the money.
3208560	3209560	They want all of the money.
3210040	3212160	And that's why we're getting this shit.
3212160	3214760	And unfortunately, I can't support it.
3214760	3224040	And I haven't been purchasing Call of Duty the last few years anyways, just because I've looked at the single player campaigns and they had some of them haven't been very good.
3224040	3225080	I did like Black Ops.
3225080	3226600	That was one of my most favorite customer.
3226600	3233440	Realize that in the modern warfare stuff, just this infinite warfare was just a little too much like advanced warfare, which was the last one I had picked up.
3233440	3242760	But, yeah, Loki, a very, very how, how worrying, but very realistic take on what may be going on in the games industry for some companies.
3242760	3245560	I mean, indie development is certainly still all about the players.
3245560	3246200	Absolutely.
3246200	3248600	But very interesting kind of perspective.
3248600	3255800	You know, I know not everybody always agrees with what you say, but I think you worded that very well where, you know, it seems like some companies, you know, players are numbers.
3255880	3264680	Activision and EA are big proponents of they think they can get away with, which is weird because I never really feel that for the Blizzard side of Activision.
3264680	3274280	But then as Activision slowly gets their little tentacles on things, they kind of like, like the whole fact that this is in the Battle.net launcher is kind of one of those like, oh, God, you know.
3274480	3276080	Well, yeah, and I get it.
3276080	3278000	And no, I mean, it's smart.
3278000	3284800	It's smart, but it's like and I get it like, you know, Overwatch is extremely successful with their loot boxes.
3284800	3285160	Yep.
3285160	3289440	But to to me, that says it's just it is just cosmetic stuff.
3289440	3291560	And it's always that's what it's been.
3291560	3292960	That's what's always going to be.
3292960	3297960	And I'm fine with that because I don't feel the compulsion, the need to get that stuff.
3297960	3299640	But some some people might.
3300040	3301680	But it's Overwatch.
3301680	3302400	Sorry to cut you off.
3302400	3305920	But Overwatch is also a very special kind of game.
3305920	3308040	It is not your typical first person shooter.
3308200	3318680	You know, and I've said this for years on OLR, Blizzard has this way of Disney-fying popular genres or popular games and making them extremely accessible.
3318680	3337360	And that is exactly what they did with Overwatch is they took the Team Fortress 2 most obviously slash first person formula, Disney-fied the characters, gave them rich backgrounds and made this game that even people who's bread and butter is World of Warcraft wanted to play because the characters were so strong, you know, that people wanted to get into this universe.
3337360	3346680	I'm telling you, Loki, when we look back in 50 years on like what were the biggest video games of this decade, Overwatch is going to be towards the top of the list.
3346680	3347280	Exactly.
3347280	3347840	No question.
3347840	3348400	Exactly.
3348400	3353920	And here's the problem, though, is like when you have these people that they take this out, it's a total EA.
3353920	3356760	Well, I don't even think it's an EA move because it's an Activision move.
3356760	3358360	Activision has been doing this forever.
3359240	3370240	It's an Activision move where they basically say we're removing something that you're paying your $60 for and you're not really we're adding this battle royale and we're innovating.
3370240	3378120	We're innovating because we removed the single player camping because they would say that's like that's like Apple talking about courage when they got rid of the headphones.
3379320	3379920	Yeah, exactly.
3379920	3384360	They want to they say they want to tell a story in a different way through the multiplayer modes.
3385360	3388800	Bullshit, I'm calling on that because Titanfall did that same shit.
3388800	3392760	We we all know it's marketing speak and like we all know it's crap.
3392760	3396000	Like, I hate to say it, Loki, but you are stating the obvious in that way.
3396000	3401960	Like we know like the fact that Activision is saying, oh, we had the the courage or this is the artistic vision.
3401960	3408560	Now it's a line of smoke to blow up our ass to explain why, you know, you just wanted all the resources and multiplayer because that's the bread and butter.
3408560	3410000	That's the money. That's loot boxes.
3410000	3411040	You don't make money off single player.
3411280	3419760	The ironic part, though, is before all like first off, the lack of like a single player campaign, that was kind of just a quick mention at the end of the presentation.
3420040	3424280	And before in the beginning of the presentation, they're talking about like the rich storytelling of Call of Duty.
3424280	3429840	And they were showing clips from the single player campaigns that are not going to be in this game.
3429840	3431800	It's like, what?
3432640	3435040	I don't know. It's just I hope it's good.
3435440	3436960	My expectations are not high.
3437360	3444800	Let me ask this question about the battle royale stuff, because that's what our chat is really screaming about in over at live.vognetware.com.
3445280	3452640	S200Matt says, I hope this royale game movement helps innovate the genre with the additional competition and doesn't just dilute and jump the shark with it.
3453560	3455160	What do you think about the whole battle royale edition?
3455160	3457120	I mean, it's not surprising, that's for sure.
3457440	3466640	But it just to me, it looks like the big like battlefield type games where it's a bigger map, you've got vehicles and that's it.
3466840	3470400	But, you know, it's not that innovative because battlefield's been doing it forever.
3470400	3473400	Yeah, I don't I don't hate them for jumping in on that genre.
3473400	3475800	I mean, it's kind of the thing that people are doing right now.
3476000	3483480	When Minecraft first came out, every game, like a lot of game friendships, like here's a build your own type of thing or how do we expand on that?
3483480	3486280	Right. We get all these kind of like Minecraft, cloney things or clone boats.
3486280	3489760	They're doing that kind of like this like Fortnite stuff where, oh, I'm building barricades and stuff.
3489760	3491360	And it's like, yeah, I don't know.
3491360	3492480	Whatever, whatever.
3492480	3493600	See how it plays out.
3493720	3495800	They haven't said how many players it supports.
3496040	3500280	So we don't know how many players online you can do in this battle royale type game.
3501640	3502520	Let's hope it's good.
3502720	3505640	Yeah, that's I don't buy into the hype.
3505640	3508000	Just see if it's good.
3508400	3514880	All right. Well, another big show event that happened this week, maybe if you aren't in like I find there's kind of like two types of gamers.
3514880	3516120	There's like the Call of Duty gamers.
3516120	3520840	And if you're not really into that, maybe this is your team or maybe you like both and that's cool, too.
3520960	3522080	Or maybe you like neither.
3522080	3524800	And then I'd wonder what do you what do you play?
3524920	3527960	But anyway, the other game I want to talk about is Kingdom Hearts three.
3527960	3530240	That's right. The premium showcase event happened this week.
3530240	3533760	I didn't I didn't know that because we are invite clearly got lost in the mail.
3534680	3541080	But anyway, so apparently the members of the press were allowed to talk about the game on May 18th.
3541080	3547720	So some of the information started coming out and there were two modes in this demo at the event called Olympus and Toy Box.
3547920	3550080	So they got to actually play a little piece of the game.
3550280	3553600	You probably saw some Wreck-It Ralph stuff coming out of it.
3553800	3559200	I don't know if there was a Wreck-It Ralph mode or if Wreck-It Ralph was a summon because it kind of looked like it was more like a summon to me.
3559920	3561040	And that's what people are saying.
3561040	3564040	But that's still really cool that there's at least a reference in the game.
3564320	3571480	But I mean, with all of this kind of showing up right now, doesn't it really seem like it's happening?
3571480	3574160	Like Kingdom Hearts is going to finally fucking be this year.
3574480	3578680	Like it really I mean, they said we're going to announce the release date next month.
3578680	3580440	Well, no, it's going to be E3. No shit.
3580440	3582120	E3 is next month. I think it's this year.
3582480	3583240	I hope so.
3583240	3589680	I mean, if they come out and say April 20 or what would it be, March, when's the fiscal year end?
3589680	3590200	April, right?
3590200	3590920	Maybe March.
3590920	3595680	So if they came out and said March 2019, that wouldn't be the biggest surprise in the world.
3595880	3605640	But at least I think we kind of know that, like, OK, this fiscal year is when it's happening, if not the holiday, which would be a great time, a great time because kids and everything that are going to be like Disney, Disney.
3606480	3610920	But I mean, who's I mean, even though I say that the kids that are like Disney, Disney.
3611080	3614680	How long ago was Kingdom Hearts two at this point, like ten years ago?
3614680	3623080	The being that they invited the press out, those kids are adults with their own kids, being that we're at this point in the, you know, press media cycle.
3623080	3625240	Yeah, my guess is probably around September.
3625560	3627640	Yeah, I I kind of think that's the case.
3627640	3630120	I think we're going to hear at E3 that this is really happening.
3630280	3634920	And so that would mean that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is the game that's going to be bumped back a little.
3634920	3637720	Yeah, I heard that was like before 2023.
3637720	3639600	OK, but excuse me.
3641400	3642600	Tonight's show is going to be a little struggle.
3642600	3643280	Thanks for being with me.
3644120	3649520	I think that was like a tongue in cheek reference that didn't really make the translation very well.
3649840	3652080	Like, I think that was one of those self-aware jokes.
3652080	3659560	I don't think they were serious about the 2023 thing, because by the 20 by 2023, the PlayStation five will be here again.
3659760	3661600	Here I am talking about PlayStation five.
3661600	3664400	But dude, that's one, two, three, four, five years away.
3664560	3666360	No game generation has gone on that long.
3666360	3667840	We're going to have a PlayStation five by then.
3668000	3672320	So Final Fantasy 7 Remake, it'll be out maybe next year.
3673080	3677720	It's not to say that Square can't do two big games for holiday, but I don't think they would.
3677720	3680320	I kind of feel like one is this holiday, one is next holiday.
3680320	3683000	But also Final Fantasy 7 is episodic.
3683560	3690280	Maybe they would do the first episode before end of fiscal year or next year and then maybe
3691280	3700000	episode two, like either that holiday or if that's not enough time, maybe, you know, holiday 2019 or Jesus, no, I guess it'd be holiday 2020.
3700000	3704720	I don't think they would put those two games out that close to each other because they would cannibalize each other.
3704720	3706400	So I think it would be spread farther.
3706400	3707480	You think they would cannibalize each other?
3707480	3708200	I don't think so.
3708200	3708920	Yeah, probably.
3708920	3709720	I think both would happen.
3709720	3713520	Didn't the Kingdom Heart remakes come out not too long around Final Fantasy 15?
3713520	3714600	Yeah, but those are remakes, so.
3714680	3716000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
3716040	3716720	I guess.
3716720	3724800	S2100Matt says, some of those kids who've played Kingdom Hearts have as many kids now as Kingdom Hearts has had those Decimal Edition games.
3725440	3726320	Ain't that the truth?
3726600	3730920	I guess that is another thing, too, is that, you know, we knew they were doing this.
3730920	3744520	Square was kind of trying to refresh our memory with those HD remakes and allow new kids to get exposed to the series, even though, again, as a near 40-year-old, I can't explain the fucking plot of Kingdom Hearts.
3744840	3746440	How is a kid going to understand it?
3747120	3747920	But whatever.
3747920	3751120	Sometimes you don't necessarily need a plot.
3751120	3752840	I mean, whatever.
3752840	3755160	Tonight in Final Jeopardy, explain the plot.
3759520	3761920	Explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts in one word.
3761920	3762400	Go.
3763320	3763920	Stuff.
3763920	3764680	Keyblade.
3765040	3765600	Pretty.
3766080	3766560	All right.
3766960	3769160	Anyway, and as S2100Matt says, it's fan service.
3769160	3770000	There is no plot.
3770200	3772000	I mean, accurate.
3772000	3776600	Like, I'm just gonna sit there and button mash and like, ooh, Tron.
3776800	3778200	Ooh, Disney movies are the best.
3778200	3781000	I just hope there's easy mode because I am an animation geek.
3781000	3786360	And then scream it, uh, uh, I can't wait to say Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, scream at Donald for being an idiot.
3786360	3788360	God damn it, Daffy, shut the fuck up.
3788360	3790360	I'm Donald.
3790360	3792360	That's a terrible, that's the worst thing ever.
3792360	3795360	Can you rename Goofy, I guess you can't, because they're kind of, like, protected.
3795360	3799360	It would be great if, like, most RPGs, you could rename the characters.
3799360	3800360	Your name is Asshole.
3800360	3803360	No, I would rename Donald as Daffy, and that would be funny.
3804960	3805480	Anyway.
3805520	3808120	Have we had the crossover Donald Daffy Duck?
3808120	3811120	Uh, no, because it's Disney and Warner Brothers.
3811120	3812120	It's never gonna happen.
3812120	3813120	It wasn't, like, in a...
3813120	3816120	You're thinking, like, Space Jam or something, and that is not, you know.
3816120	3819120	I know, I was thinking, like, maybe, uh, Who Framed Roger Rabbit or something like that.
3819120	3820120	Mmm, no.
3820120	3821120	I don't think so.
3821120	3822120	No.
3822120	3823120	Good try, though.
3823120	3825120	Maybe, I don't know.
3825120	3827120	Oh, actually, folks in chat are saying Roger Rabbit.
3827120	3828120	It did happen.
3828120	3829120	Alright, well, shit.
3829120	3831120	Shows how much I know.
3831120	3835120	What didn't really happen, I guess, I guess Roger Rabbit was a Warner Brothers movie at the end of the day.
3835760	3836760	Wasn't it?
3836760	3837760	Well, it didn't really just happen.
3837760	3840760	That was when, you know, they were playing nice with each other.
3840760	3841760	Interesting.
3841760	3842760	Alright.
3842760	3843760	The more you know.
3843760	3844760	Alright.
3844760	3845760	Anyway.
3845760	3846760	Let's move on.
3846760	3849760	Uh, we're gonna do one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.
3849760	3855760	So, with games being released, you know, for a new life to begin, some lives must end.
3855760	3856760	Right, Loki?
3856760	3859760	Yes, it's the circle of life, and Sony is actually...
3859760	3862760	It's the circle of life.
3863400	3871400	Sony is actually acknowledging the fact that the Vita exists, and they're basically letting us know that it exists because they're saying, hey, we're ending production of Vita games.
3871400	3873400	So, yeah.
3873400	3877400	Apparently, no more physical Vita games are gonna be released.
3877400	3888400	I'm not sure how long the digital is gonna continue, but they're saying that apparently the final purchase orders will be entered by February 15, 2019.
3888400	3890400	So, yeah, they're ending it, but that's next year.
3891040	3894040	Um, but there's not a lot of Vita games coming out.
3894040	3900040	Well, at the same time, not to be a bitch, but is anybody really surprised at this news?
3900040	3901040	No.
3901040	3904040	Because there's a part of me that's like, they didn't already end this production.
3904040	3905040	Exactly, yeah.
3905040	3910040	Like, it's just Sony's support of the Vita has been not good.
3910040	3911040	No.
3911040	3920240	Which is funny, because I've heard this term a lot, that the Switch is the successor to the Vita, and I kinda like that little tongue-in-cheek jab at a, you know, how
3921080	3922080	Sony didn't really support the Vita.
3922080	3929080	And in a way, it's kinda sad, because with the PlayStation TV having been a thing, even though it didn't get supported for very long,
3929080	3936080	like, you kinda had that system where you could play something on the TV and then pick it up and take it on the go.
3936080	3944080	Like, if Sony, granted, it was two separate elements, you had to buy the TV, but if Sony had just kinda taken that like a few steps further and really had that faith
3944080	3948080	and really put that kind of marketing into it, like, they could have beaten Nintendo at their own game.
3948080	3950080	They so could.
3950920	3958920	I mean, it wouldn't, now to be fair, before the chatters yell at me, it wouldn't be as fast as, click, like, pick it up, take, I mean, you would have to like have the cloud save.
3958920	3962920	But they kinda started to do that with the whole, god, what the fuck did they call it?
3962920	3966920	Um, oh my god, we made fun of it.
3966920	3967920	Konami had-
3967920	3970920	No, Konami had a different name for it that was like, stupid.
3970920	3971920	And it was-
3971920	3976920	Uh, R Rising or something, god, what was they, somebody in Terrar form or something like that?
3976920	3977920	I don't remember what it was called.
3977920	3978920	Yes.
3979760	3980760	Stop naming things, Konami.
3980760	3985760	Transfarency, thank you, transfarency, that's what was, Dark Tetsuya, Gold Star for you.
3985760	3986760	Transfaring.
3986760	3987760	Transfaring.
3987760	3990760	Get it, cause you're not transferring, you're transfaring.
3990760	3991760	That's stupid.
3991760	3997760	I hope that's the name of Sony's next handheld, the trans, just kidding, Sony's never gonna make another handheld, but the Sony Transfar.
3997760	3998760	They might, I don't know.
3998760	3999760	Probably not.
3999760	4000760	In Japan, maybe.
4000760	4008760	Alright, well, rest in peace Vita, but again, if you're in Japan, they're gonna still be making Vita games, because they still acknowledge the Vita in Japan.
4009600	4010600	That's right.
4010600	4011600	It's still accepted there.
4011600	4012600	Alright.
4012600	4015600	Uh, let's, uh, let's get to the classic game of the week.
4015600	4017600	You guys ready for the classic game of the week?
4017600	4019600	Every week we dive into the game involved.
4019600	4026600	In Dark Sakura, she usually jumps in there and finds a game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this video game this week.
4026600	4031600	But Dark Sakura's on vacation, so when, you know, mom's away, we're gonna play.
4031600	4036600	So, last week, I took over and gave you SimCity as the classic game of the week.
4036600	4037600	Look out, y'all.
4037600	4038600	It's Loki's turn.
4038600	4039600	Loki!
4039600	4040600	No, but you picked a good one.
4040600	4041600	You picked a good one.
4041600	4042600	Yeah, I picked a good one.
4042600	4050600	I, so, well, Rob notes that this is my potential second pick that I, I, I urged him to save his first pick for, like, an anniversary show and convinced Jamie it's a good idea.
4050600	4051600	But anyway, let's not talk about that.
4051600	4052600	Let's talk about tonight's pick.
4052600	4053600	What did you pick for tonight?
4053600	4064600	Well, being that we were just talking about Call of Duty and Call of Duty just had a World War II, uh, game come out, I thought it'd be great to choose a game that isn't Call of Duty at all.
4064600	4073600	Um, no, this is actually, um, 2006, this is my favorite game out of both Halo 3 and, well, this is Resistance Fall of Man.
4073600	4089600	So, Resistance Fall of Man was a PlayStation 3, like, launch title, and what was kind of cool about it is it took not only the World War II, like, Call of Duty style gameplay, but it also added, like, kind of some alien elements to it as well.
4089600	4093600	So, basically, you play this guy, uh, Sergeant Nathan Hale.
4093600	4102600	He is part of this human resistance that's trying to drive out this mysterious alien-like invasion out of the UK, and the...
4102600	4106600	I didn't realize the whole beginning of this was narration, so I need to fast-forward to some gameplay here in the clip.
4106600	4107600	Sorry.
4107600	4108600	Much better. No, that's alright.
4108600	4118600	Um, yes, and so he, it's the Chimera is what they're called, so these aliens are coming down and trying to take over everything, and it's just a pretty great story-driven game.
4118600	4130600	And so, um, what was kind of cool about it is, you know, with the traditional World War II weapons that you had, you also got alien weapons that you can use, and some of these had alter-, you know, alt-fires on there as well.
4130600	4139600	So, you can do this one weapon that, for example, would launch out a tracking beacon, and you can basically curve bullets around the wall.
4139600	4147600	So, if, like, you know, you tagged one of these enemies with the beacon thing, and the enemy ran behind the wall, the bullets would fall right around the wall to, you know, him.
4147600	4153600	Or they had one that was, um, that would actually go through walls, or you could create a shield with it.
4153600	4155600	So, lots of cool stuff.
4155600	4165600	But, um, you know, it was actually one of my most favorite games on the PlayStation 3, and, uh, one of the series that, they did make a few additional ones.
4165600	4168600	They did, uh, Resistance 2 and 3.
4168600	4177600	Um, also, of course, being that this is one of the systems that had motion controls in their controller, the 6-axis at the time, because it wasn't the DualShock 3, if you remember.
4177600	4185600	Uh, the 6-axis, they had motion control support ports, so, like, for example, in multiplayer games, if you got tagged with one of the beacons, you could shake your controller to shake it off.
4185600	4191600	Or, in this one, they would have, like, these, like, facehugger alien things that would try to attack you, and you could shake those off of you with that.
4191600	4194600	Um, so, they're, like, just little neat things like that.
4194600	4197600	Um, what else?
4197600	4204600	Um, multiplayer was kind of fun. They had, you know, offline and online multiplayer for up to 40, uh, players online, which is pretty sweet.
4204600	4208600	And then, um, you know, lots of different maps to play as.
4208600	4214600	Uh, one of the cool things, though, once Resistance 2 was coming out, they actually offered all those maps for free, which is kind of cool.
4214600	4223600	Um, but yeah, I mean, it was one of these games, I still think this is a game that they should remaster and bring back, because I thought it had a pretty decent storyline.
4223600	4231600	And, you know, out of the two games, you know, Halo 3 and Resistance, I think Resistance was my favorite, because I had played through both of them.
4231600	4241600	But, um, and the other thing that's kind of cool about this is, once you do play through the whole game, you can play through it a second time, and there's actually different alien weapons that are in there as well, so you can play quickly through the game.
4241600	4247600	So, it kind of urges you to repeat playing through the campaign, uh, which is kind of nice.
4248600	4257600	Something that certain games don't do nowadays, but, um, whatever, it's all a numbers game for these people now.
4257600	4264600	So, yes, Resistance Fall of Man, my pick for Classic Game of the Week. That's it. I keep it short.
4264600	4269600	Alright, no, that's all good. Sometimes, uh, there isn't a lot to say, but I like it.
4269600	4279600	And, plus, we don't highlight a lot of first-person shooters. I mean, we know that Jamie doesn't play as many of them, but she has, you know, she's talked about her motion sickness and things, so she doesn't get as into those games.
4279600	4282600	So, it's good that we can spotlight something, I think, a little bit different.
4282600	4288600	So, I think sometimes you and I are, you know, Jamie, and I'm not, I would never disrespect her when she's not here. I ain't that stupid.
4288600	4295600	But, you know, she has her experiences in gaming, and she has a deep knowledge about all these import games that I could never, like, do, right?
4295600	4304600	But then, for me, I'm like, oh, old Commodore 64 and PC games. That's my bread and butter, right? So, then I'm able to spotlight those, and then you play some different types of games, like first-person shooters.
4304600	4305600	So, I'm glad we could spotlight that.
4305600	4306600	Yep.
4306600	4310600	Yep. Alright. There it is, your Classic Game of the Week, Resistance Fall of Man.
4310600	4320600	Alright, we're gonna take a break, though, and when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Launcher Radio to come, including rapid-fire news, what's coming out in stores, emails, if we have any. I didn't peak.
4320600	4328600	And then some more big news. We have, for what I believe is a surprise closure, kind of coming out of nowhere. So, not all good news, either.
4328600	4335600	So, we're gonna get into that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Your calls, too, when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4335600	4342600	Thank you.
4342600	4352600	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with our 731st episode already in progress for this May 20th of 2018.
4352600	4361600	Loki and I here alone in studio tonight as Dark Sakura is extending her vacation a little bit, but she has, it's understandable, she has a good friend from, like, out of the country, I believe, visiting.
4361600	4363600	So, you know, you wanna spend every moment with a friend of yours that's-
4363600	4364600	When they just bring them along.
4364600	4376600	I actually thought at one point she was going to do that, but I completely understand that, like, seeing San Francisco is probably, like, more on this, her friend's bucket list than go sit in for five hours on OLR.
4376600	4377600	Yeah.
4377600	4382600	Three hour show, one hour before and after, you know, it's a lot of Sunday nights, so I totally respect that, it's good.
4382600	4389600	I also wanna give a birthday shout-out, even though I know he doesn't listen to this show, but maybe you all will tweet him and tell him that I was talking shit tonight.
4389600	4395600	But I wanna wish a very happy birthday, because he's- he already- technically his birthday passed, but his birthday party was today.
4395600	4403600	So, Captain Matt from Starboard Power Coupling, also if you used to listen to Hoard House back in the day, Grandpa, he's had his birthday today.
4403600	4413600	And the theme of his party was, fuck it, I'm 40, which is funny because I'm older than he is, he's not 40, I think today was 38, or this week was maybe 37.
4414600	4424600	He's not 40, but because we call him Grandpa and older stuff, he's just saying, fuck it, I'm 40. He's like the reverse Bobby Blackwell, he doesn't do the 29, he's just, fuck it, I'm 40.
4424600	4431600	So, big happy birthday to Captain Matt over at Starboard Power Coupling from your boos here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4431600	4435600	Anyway, let's get back into some rapid fire news, Loki.
4435600	4446600	You may remember we talked a little bit about Walmart leaks, Walmart Canada leaks, and some games that were posted on there prior to their announcements that would be assumed at E3, if they were legit.
4446600	4454600	Well, maybe there's a little bit of legitimacy to it, because one of those leaked games was Rage 2, and Bethesda was trolling the shit out of them.
4454600	4463600	And now, they released their gameplay and announcement trailers, so it looks like very Mad Max-ish, as kind of the first Rage game did.
4463600	4469600	And I think there'll be more coming out during the Bethesda conference in probably a few weeks here.
4469600	4471600	So, um, neat.
4471600	4479600	I got a Battle Royale vibe from it, maybe that's because everybody's doing Battle Royale, but I kinda got a Battle Royale vibe from it.
4479600	4481600	But maybe that's just the trailer.
4481600	4483600	Just saying. Looks cool, though.
4484600	4496600	This is interesting. So, you know how they do some of these different speedruns and stuff, where they'll do a length of the past randomizer, where they'll randomize weapons and stuff throughout the different...
4496600	4502600	I don't watch enough of those, but I have a friend on Twitter who streams on Twitch who does a lot of Final Fantasy 1 shuffle.
4502600	4504600	And I always found that fascinating.
4504600	4506600	Yeah, so it's really cool.
4506600	4509600	This is gonna be quite the thing to see.
4509600	4518600	I really hope this is something that they run at one of the AGDQ events, either the summer or the regular one.
4518600	4526600	This is a ROM hack that combines The Legend of Zelda, length of the past, and Super Metroid.
4527600	4534600	So, the way this works is basically when you go into a dungeon, you end up actually going into...
4534600	4541600	It goes back and forth between Super Metroid and Legend of Zelda.
4541600	4549600	And you'll find sometimes Super Metroid power-ups in The Legend of Zelda, so you'll find different things there.
4549600	4552600	Or you may find some Zelda stuff in Super Metroid.
4552600	4554600	I like those little crossovers, that's cool.
4554600	4556600	I just think it sounds really cool.
4556600	4561600	So, that I am very much looking forward to seeing how that would work.
4561600	4568600	But apparently it's a ROM hack that they've done, and some people have run it, but I need to see this.
4568600	4570600	It sounds so awesome.
4570600	4572600	Yeah, cool.
4572600	4576600	Not cool. If you were looking forward to Shenmue 3, it got delayed.
4576600	4579600	Well, you know how we feel about delays at this point.
4579600	4583600	If a delay is what the game needs to be better, then by all means, delay it.
4583600	4586600	So, the game will be launching in 2019 now. It will not be launching in 2018.
4586600	4589600	Somebody brought it up earlier when we were talking about Kino Hearts.
4589600	4592600	So, if you weren't already aware, Shenmue 3 did officially get pushed back.
4592600	4596600	Deep Silver made the announcement this week updating their release window for 2019,
4596600	4601600	stating, the extra time will be used to polish the quality of the game even further to the high standards it deserves,
4601600	4604600	and release the product in the best possible time frame.
4604600	4605600	Thank you.
4605600	4609600	Yeah, you know what? Gamers, we don't do that anymore. We don't get angry when games are pushed back anymore.
4609600	4615600	Because when you don't do that, and you cut corners like that, that's when you lose your single player campaign.
4615600	4620600	So, thank you Deep Silver for doing what you had to do to ensure that the game is going to be great.
4620600	4626600	So, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC worldwide in 2019.
4626600	4632600	Something you can play a little bit sooner than that is Locke, or Locke Cole, which I forgot he had a full name.
4632600	4635600	If you don't remember that name, he is a character in Final Fantasy 6.
4635600	4643600	Remember, I think people would call him a thief and he'd say treasure hunter, or at least in the English translation of that game.
4643600	4646600	Anyway, he is going to be a new character in Dissidia.
4646600	4651600	Gotta be honest, this was a game I couldn't really get into, but maybe I need to give it a second look.
4651600	4654600	Maybe it's one of those things I'll revisit when it comes down a little bit in price.
4654600	4660600	I was hoping it would be more of a standard fighter, but it was a little weird to me with all the objectives and all these things.
4660600	4661600	I had a hard time figuring it out.
4661600	4669600	But for those that are into it, cool. Play a lot of it, and now you'll get to play it with Locke, as he is the second download character for this game.
4669600	4677600	Of course, coming from Final Fantasy 6, or 3, if you grew up in the States in the 90s. It was originally Final Fantasy 3.
4677600	4685600	So, yeah, you'll get to play with him, and he joins Terra as one of the people from Final Fantasy 6.
4685600	4688600	And there's some costumes and some swords, you can see about that as well.
4688600	4698600	Also, they've announced that there will also be four more DLC characters, including a female, a male, a female who was in Dissidia previously, and a male.
4698600	4704600	So all the characters will be from the latter half of the Final Fantasy series. So, hmm, interesting.
4704600	4708600	Anyway, May 17th is when you can check out Locke in Dissidia.
4708600	4714600	Let's travel around and check out what's coming out a little- actually, May 17th already happened, so you can download them now.
4714600	4717600	I did not realize that story was like, it's happening today!
4717600	4723600	Anyway, let's travel around and check out some other stuff you can pick up really soon this week in stores. Loki.
4723600	4729600	Yeah, so starting things out, we have the expansion for Yellow Scrolls Online, Summerset, that's coming out on PC and Mac.
4729600	4735600	We've got the Mega Man Legacy Collection 1 and 2 on the Nintendo Switch.
4735600	4738600	Runner 3 on PC, Mac, and Switch.
4738600	4743600	Stardew Valley is making its way out to Vita. Oh my god, a Vita game.
4743600	4745600	Pretty good one, I bet.
4745600	4749600	State of Decay 2 on PC and Xbox One.
4749600	4755600	Tennis World Tour on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
4755600	4757600	This is cool.
4757600	4761600	Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, that game we talked about last week, the kind of retro-
4761600	4763600	Oh yeah, like the major one?
4763600	4767600	That's coming out on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Vita.
4767600	4768600	Cool.
4768600	4775600	We've got Dylan's Dead Heat Breakers on 3DS, remember that tower defense armadillo game that Nintendo has?
4775600	4776600	Yes.
4776600	4787600	And it looks like some, I'm assuming these are remasters, Persona 3 Dancing Moon Night, Persona 4 Dancing All Night, and Persona 5 Dancing Star Night.
4787600	4795600	PlayStation 4 and Vita on 3 and 5, and number 4 is getting just the PlayStation 4 release, and those are all rhythm games.
4796600	4811600	Punch Club on the Switch, and we've got a few more games, looks like 7 Scarlet on the Vita, Dark Souls Remastered on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
4811600	4821600	Detroit Become Human on PlayStation 4, and last but not least, Sudden Strike 4 European Battlefields Edition on Xbox One.
4821600	4822600	That's it.
4825600	4829600	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.
4829600	4835600	I know they had a big holiday week recently, but I think things are slowing down a little bit, including PlayStation 4.
4835600	4838600	Excuse me, things are ramping up again, because the holidays have slowed down.
4838600	4840600	PlayStation 4, in fact, getting a few releases this week.
4840600	4845600	I did not know this, that Persona 3 and Persona 5 dancing games are on their way to the PlayStation 4.
4845600	4846600	How did I not know that?
4846600	4847600	I just mentioned them.
4847600	4849600	Oh, well, yeah, there you go.
4849600	4850600	Well, yeah, they're coming out here in the US.
4850600	4853600	I just, when I saw this earlier, I was like, I didn't even know these games were coming, but there you go.
4853600	4856600	So they're also released in Japan, same thing as Loki just mentioned for here.
4856600	4861600	The Dark Souls remaster, also making its way to Japan this coming week on May 24th.
4861600	4867600	As well as a game called Mikagame Sumika no Seifuku Katsudo comes out this week.
4867600	4871600	And Undertale gets its release in Japan, obviously on the PlayStation 4, it's a pretty big deal.
4871600	4872600	It doesn't stop there, though.
4872600	4879600	We also have the Karu Maruka Circle in regular and limited edition.
4879600	4884600	And Detroit Become Human gets its Japanese release in parity with the US release.
4884600	4887600	That is very soon. I'm actually really excited to check that out.
4887600	4889600	I hope I have the time to do that.
4889600	4893600	And then I close my list without looking at the Switch or the 3DS.
4895600	4897600	So bear with me a minute while I bring it back up.
4897600	4900600	They don't release games on anything but the PlayStation 4 over there.
4900600	4901600	It's all beta over there.
4901600	4904600	It's all beta. Actually, you remind me to check to see if there is a beta.
4904600	4908600	Believe it or not, yes, Undertale on the Vita, the Persona dancing games also on the Vita.
4908600	4910600	Vita is still super well supported over there.
4910600	4912600	So those games all out on the Vita.
4912600	4914600	And let's check out the Switch real quick.
4914600	4918600	Yeah, the Switch is getting the Rockman Classics 1 and 2, hits Japan this week.
4918600	4920600	Obviously that is Mega Man here.
4920600	4924600	And then Rabbit Cross Labyrinth Puzzle Out Stories, also happening on the Switch.
4924600	4927600	And Urban Trial Playground, also on the Switch this week.
4927600	4935600	As well as a special micro SD card that's branded for Nintendo that is 256 gigs in case you're downloading all this stuff.
4935600	4938600	As far as the DS goes though, it's a little quieter over there.
4938600	4944600	Nothing to announce. I think that is probably ramping down with the exception of that Luigi game in like 2019.
4944600	4945600	How about the UK, Loki?
4945600	4951600	We've got Space Hulk Deathwing Edition, or Deathwing Enhanced Edition.
4951600	4954600	That's coming out on PlayStation 4.
4955600	4958600	State of Decay 2 on Xbox One.
4958600	4963600	Tennis World Tour on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, the Switch and PC.
4963600	4965600	Detroit Become Human on PlayStation 4.
4965600	4969600	Dark Souls Remastered on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
4969600	4971600	And that's it.
4973600	4975600	Alright, we're gonna get to the mailbag.
4975600	4977600	You guys send us emails and we read them.
4977600	4981600	Even when you don't send us many emails, we'll still go in there and read them.
4981600	4986600	If you want to send us an email in the future, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send an email.
4986600	4989600	Our first and only email tonight from Robert M.
4989600	4993600	Hey, you know what, Robert M. always there to email us when none of y'all else will.
4993600	4997600	So thanks Robert M. who says in the subject line, bats.
4997600	4999600	And then it's in the email saying,
4999600	5007600	Just thinking about bats as I tend to do and just wondering besides games that use them as basic enemies,
5007600	5012600	such as the Swoopers of Super Mario World and the Bubble Bats of Mega Man,
5012600	5015600	what other games have bats as major characters?
5015600	5020600	The only ones that come to mind are Sunsoft's Arrow the Acrobat,
5020600	5024600	Rogue the Bat from Sonic Adventure 2, I believe,
5024600	5028600	and Laylee from Yooka Laylee by Playtronic.
5028600	5032600	So Robert M. wants us to talk about video game bats.
5032600	5034600	Driving us batty tonight.
5034600	5037600	Well, you know the first thing that came to my mind, Robert M.
5037600	5040600	Batman.
5040600	5042600	He's technically not a bat.
5042600	5043600	Now, man, bat.
5043600	5045600	He's a man bat.
5045600	5047600	I'm sorry, that's where my brain went.
5047600	5049600	I was like Batman because those games weren't bats.
5049600	5051600	Pokemon, sort of.
5051600	5054600	Okay, yeah, there's bat-like characters in Pokemon.
5054600	5056600	I mean, they're not supposed to be technically bats.
5056600	5058600	They're other bat-like equivalents.
5058600	5059600	They're bats.
5059600	5060600	They're bats, yeah.
5060600	5061600	How about you guys in chat?
5061600	5063600	What do you guys know over at live.vognetwork.com?
5063600	5064600	What do you guys think?
5064600	5070600	Because I'm having a hard time thinking about other bat enemies in video games.
5070600	5072600	Didn't Legend of the Mystical Ninja have some?
5072600	5073600	Castlevania had a bat.
5073600	5074600	Oh, yeah, Castlevania.
5074600	5075600	That's a great answer.
5075600	5076600	That's a great answer.
5076600	5077600	Castlevania, of course.
5077600	5078600	Like the first boss.
5078600	5082600	Like in every Castlevania game, that big vampire bat is always the first boss.
5082600	5083600	Great answer.
5083600	5084600	Or Zelda.
5084600	5085600	Great answer.
5085600	5086600	Zelda, that's right.
5086600	5087600	That's right.
5087600	5088600	There was a bat monster in Zelda as well.
5089600	5090600	Adventures of Link.
5090600	5091600	Let's see.
5091600	5093600	Go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5093600	5094600	See a Tiberius.
5094600	5098600	Just Michael Morbius from Spider-Man who crosses with a bat.
5098600	5103600	Dartitsuya says La Mulana has bats, but those are probably lifted from Castlevania.
5103600	5105600	Good answer there as well.
5105600	5115600	And Tigerclaw links us to the giant bomb wiki who actually has an article on list of bat characters.
5115600	5116600	So how about that?
5116600	5117600	There really is an article.
5118600	5122600	Tigerclaw says, fuck this game.
5122600	5126600	I have the answer right here.
5126600	5129600	I'm kind of laughing at how funny that is.
5129600	5131600	They list Batman, by the way.
5131600	5132600	Just so we're clear, Loki.
5132600	5133600	They list Batman.
5133600	5136600	Batman is a bat character in a game.
5136600	5137600	Let's see.
5137600	5138600	I'm trying to see if there's any of these.
5138600	5143600	A beautiful Joe had Charles III, a bat creature in that game.
5143600	5145600	I don't know why they say Conker is a bat.
5145600	5146600	Why is Conker in this list?
5146600	5147600	Conker is not a bat.
5147600	5148600	Demon Hunter?
5148600	5151600	Well, the Demon Hunter has a bat in Diablo III.
5151600	5153600	I guess the Demon Hunter does have a bat pet she can have with her.
5153600	5155600	So there is that.
5155600	5158600	Kirby O'Neil, the father of April O'Neil.
5158600	5160600	I guess was a bat.
5160600	5162600	Is that a thing that happened in Ninja Turtles?
5162600	5163600	I had no idea.
5163600	5165600	So there you go.
5165600	5169600	Wingnut, also from Ninja Turtles, a character in the TMNT universe.
5169600	5171600	So there you go.
5171600	5174600	JD says Barbara the Bat was in Super Smash Brothers.
5174600	5177600	And JD says this list needs a fact check.
5177600	5179600	Okay, OLR.
5179600	5183600	For Robert M., you guys need to get the giant bomb wiki updated.
5183600	5188600	We need an accurate perception of bats in video games.
5188600	5190600	Thank you for the email.
5190600	5192600	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5192600	5194600	At first I thought we were talking about baseball bats.
5194600	5197600	And I was like, okay, well, lots of games with baseball bats.
5197600	5200600	You would think emails like that drive me crazy.
5200600	5203600	But I appreciate the emails that are like,
5203600	5206600	I had a random fucking thought today, OLR.
5206600	5208600	And I want to share it with you.
5210600	5212600	We never do that on this show.
5212600	5214600	I know. We never get into tangents.
5214600	5215600	I love it.
5215600	5217600	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
5217600	5219600	if you want to send us an email for a future week.
5219600	5221600	In the meantime, Loki, why don't we get to it?
5221600	5224600	Let's talk about closures. That's unfortunate.
5224600	5227600	Boss Key Games has decided to shut down.
5227600	5230600	So Boss Key Games, if you're not familiar,
5230600	5232600	is Cliff Boot.
5232600	5234600	I can't talk because I just ate a bunch of salsa
5234600	5236600	and my mouth's on fire.
5236600	5239600	Cliff Bleszinski's software company.
5239600	5241600	Just do what I do and always say Cliffy B.
5241600	5243600	Cliffy B. There you go.
5243600	5245600	Cliffy B's company.
5245600	5247600	Even though he's older now, so he's Cliff.
5247600	5249600	Clifford B.
5249600	5252600	No, I don't think he's Clifford. He's just Cliff.
5252600	5254600	Just like you don't call me Robert.
5254600	5256600	Mr. Zinski.
5256600	5258600	B. Zinski.
5259600	5262600	He went and formed the company after he left Epic Games.
5264600	5268600	They were really trying to push out a couple games with it.
5268600	5270600	One, of course, was Lawbreakers,
5270600	5272600	which didn't quite take off.
5272600	5274600	Of course, then, the last second,
5274600	5277600	they tried to come out with a Battle Royale-type game,
5277600	5279600	Radical Heights,
5279600	5282600	which also didn't really seem to gain traction.
5282600	5285600	Unfortunately, because of all this,
5285600	5288600	they've decided to just shut it all down.
5288600	5291600	Radical Heights is going to stay online
5291600	5293600	for probably a little bit longer,
5293600	5296600	but then that's going to be closed down as well.
5296600	5300600	As of today, Boss Key Productions is effectively no more.
5300600	5303600	Four years ago, I set out to make world-class video game studio
5303600	5306600	and I hired some of the best talent in the video game industry,
5306600	5309600	worked tirelessly to produce quality products,
5309600	5311600	and while we had our ups and downs,
5311600	5313600	I'd like to think we had fun doing it.
5313600	5315600	Lawbreakers was a great game
5315600	5317600	that unfortunately failed to gain traction,
5317600	5319600	and in a last-ditch attempt,
5319600	5321600	we scrambled to do our take
5321600	5324600	on a huge Battle Royale genre with Radical Heights,
5324600	5326600	which was well-received.
5326600	5329600	However, it was a little too long.
5329600	5332600	As for today, I'm going to take some time off and reflect.
5332600	5334600	I need to focus on myself and my family,
5334600	5338600	as well as my Aussie, Teddy,
5338600	5340600	who is slowly fading from us.
5340600	5344600	Video games will forever be a part of who I am,
5344600	5347600	and I hope to make something new again some days.
5347600	5350600	However, I need to withdraw and take this time.
5350600	5352600	To those who have supported myself
5352600	5354600	and the studio for the last few years,
5354600	5356600	thank you from the bottom of my heart
5356600	5358600	and everyone who came to work for me.
5358600	5360600	Please note that the servers for Radical Heights
5360600	5362600	will remain up for the near future.
5362600	5364600	Thanks again, Cliff.
5364600	5366600	I'm not going to talk shit about Clifford
5366600	5369600	because I have nothing but respect for somebody who says,
5369600	5371600	you know what, I'm going to take a little time away
5371600	5373600	to go work on family stuff and focus on these other things.
5373600	5376600	I think that's great, and I wish him well with all that stuff.
5376600	5378600	I am a bit surprised, though,
5378600	5380600	at how sudden this kind of feels.
5380600	5382600	I didn't even...
5382600	5384600	Maybe this is part of the problem.
5384600	5386600	Granted, I don't play these games.
5386600	5388600	I didn't even realize Radical Heights was out.
5388600	5390600	It just came out.
5390600	5392600	That's what I thought.
5392600	5394600	It was in early access or something like that.
5394600	5396600	It was right around its infancy.
5396600	5398600	So it's surprising to me that it's this sudden.
5398600	5401600	Cliff had to walk away because of family issues.
5401600	5403600	Again, I respect that.
5403600	5405600	But the entire studio closing,
5405600	5407600	that just seems really big.
5407600	5409600	But maybe the money, the funding,
5409600	5411600	he kind of fesses up to it in there saying
5411600	5413600	maybe it was just too little, too late.
5413600	5415600	Key word there, they couldn't get it out fast enough
5415600	5417600	and the money well is dry.
5417600	5419600	Yeah. It's unfortunate.
5419600	5421600	Sad, but a reality about games.
5421600	5424600	It's unfortunate because they were trying to take on popular genres.
5424600	5426600	They had the whole,
5426600	5428600	we're taking on Overwatch with Lawbreakers,
5428600	5431600	which is a somewhat unique game.
5431600	5435600	But still, it just didn't have the character
5435600	5437600	that really brought people to it.
5437600	5439600	And then Radical Heights,
5439600	5441600	it was interesting to see it.
5441600	5443600	Neat take on the idea,
5443600	5445600	but it was just a little too late.
5445600	5447600	DungeonBuster in chat says
5447600	5449600	at live.vognetwork.com,
5449600	5451600	if I recall correctly, one of the leads tweeted
5451600	5453600	that he learned about the company being closed
5453600	5455600	from his 8-year-old daughter who showed him the news online.
5455600	5457600	She asked him if he was going to be okay now
5457600	5459600	that he was losing his job.
5459600	5461600	Radical Heights was very prototyped.
5461600	5463600	They were testing the waters with it.
5463600	5465600	It was largely unfinished, but playable.
5465600	5467600	That's a bummer, but you know what?
5467600	5469600	That kind of sudden closure news
5469600	5471600	is not particularly unique
5471600	5475600	to the gaming industry.
5475600	5479600	I learned at a previous employer,
5479600	5481600	not my current one, but a previous employer,
5481600	5483600	I learned that layoffs were happening
5483600	5485600	and there was a financial disclosure
5485600	5487600	that happened that morning
5487600	5489600	before they brought employees into a meeting.
5489600	5491600	So we were all pretty nervous
5491600	5493600	for a good chunk of the day
5493600	5495600	because we knew it was coming.
5495600	5497600	This isn't something that's unique
5497600	5499600	to the games industry,
5499600	5501600	but it's not a good look.
5501600	5503600	But, anyhow.
5503600	5505600	Well, that's really unfortunate
5505600	5507600	for those developers.
5507600	5509600	I will say, though,
5509600	5511600	a lot of other game industry people
5511600	5513600	are doing really good to the people there.
5513600	5515600	Blizzard Careers is out there
5515600	5517600	tweeting people right away.
5517600	5519600	We're looking for people
5519600	5521600	because I'm sure they've got some unannounced things
5521600	5523600	they're working on.
5523600	5525600	God, I hope one of them is Diablo IV.
5525600	5527600	Ooh, I can't wait for Blizzard's take
5527600	5529600	on the Battle Royale genre.
5529600	5531600	Although, I guess they already have Overwatch.
5531600	5533600	I don't know if I'm necessarily saying
5533600	5535600	they need to bring Battle Royale to Overwatch.
5535600	5537600	I don't think everybody needs to do Battle Royale.
5537600	5539600	No, they don't.
5539600	5541600	I just want them to do Diablo IV
5541600	5543600	since it doesn't seem like there's going to be
5543600	5545600	another expansion for III at this point.
5545600	5547600	So there you go.
5547600	5549600	Let's talk about Super Smash Bros.
5549600	5551600	I know a lot of you are waiting for E3
5551600	5553600	for just this game.
5553600	5555600	And I know we don't have a ton of people
5555600	5557600	overseas that listen to this show,
5557600	5559600	but for those that are over in Japan,
5559600	5561600	Super Smash Bros. is going to be playable
5561600	5563600	at various events across Japan
5563600	5565600	around the same time as E3.
5565600	5567600	So that's pretty cool.
5567600	5569600	If you're in Japan and you feel like,
5569600	5571600	oh, I want to play the new Smash 2,
5571600	5573600	I don't want to have to go all the way
5573600	5575600	to the States to do it, the good news is
5575600	5577600	that you're going to be able to do that.
5577600	5579600	So on June 17th at the Rage 2018 Summer,
5579600	5581600	you can do that there, or the
5581600	5583600	Jisai World Hobby Fair on June 23rd and 24th,
5583600	5585600	and the Jump Victory Carnival
5585600	5587600	in both Tokyo and Osaka
5587600	5589600	on July 16th and July 22nd,
5589600	5591600	you will be able to play the game in Japan.
5591600	5593600	So that's pretty cool.
5593600	5595600	They're going to unveil it there.
5595600	5597600	It's obvious that this game is getting its big unveiling
5597600	5599600	at E3, and it's going to be playable at E3,
5599600	5601600	and Nintendo not really keeping
5601600	5603600	it a secret either, because they are going to be
5603600	5605600	doing, get this, ticket reservations
5605600	5607600	this year.
5607600	5609600	Oh, fuck that bullshit.
5609600	5611600	Finally, a fucking fast pass
5611600	5613600	system at E3. Of course, that just means
5613600	5615600	all those people are going to be out on the floor,
5615600	5617600	and I don't know if they're going to be able to handle that,
5617600	5619600	but that's ESA's problem.
5619600	5621600	Anyway, E3 attendees, Nintendo
5621600	5623600	announced, will be able to reserve play slots
5623600	5625600	ahead of time for Super Smash Brothers
5625600	5627600	with the purpose of having the fans
5627600	5629600	get a faster, smoother experience.
5629600	5631600	You're going to be able to reserve a ticket to play against people
5631600	5633600	casually for fun, or play
5633600	5635600	for glory in a competitive elimination
5635600	5637600	match. You will get an
5637600	5639600	email from E3 organizers
5639600	5641600	by June 5th if you register by
5641600	5643600	May 31st with details about
5643600	5645600	how to reserve one electronic ticket
5645600	5647600	for this. This is pretty, so
5647600	5649600	official E3, this is through.
5649600	5651600	Nintendo is ticketing through official E3. That's pretty big.
5651600	5653600	You have to play the game,
5653600	5655600	you have to sign up ahead of time.
5655600	5657600	No on-site registration will be available.
5657600	5659600	You'll get a ticket as a QR code
5659600	5661600	and more information
5661600	5663600	at E3.Nintendo.com
5663600	5665600	Reservations not taken for any
5665600	5667600	other games at Nintendo's booth.
5667600	5669600	This is only their E ticket
5669600	5671600	ride for the year, which is Super Smash Brothers.
5671600	5673600	How long before they appear on eBay?
5675600	5677600	Who knows? Who knows? Yeah, I'm sure
5677600	5679600	there's some E3 attendees who have no interest
5679600	5681600	in seeing this, but it's
5681600	5683600	interesting that they are doing it this way.
5683600	5685600	The part of me that stood in a line
5685600	5687600	for a very long time to see things
5687600	5689600	like the DS
5689600	5691600	when that was first announced and some of the other like
5691600	5693600	I didn't have to stand in line to the Wii.
5693600	5695600	Thanks for a buddy of mine, who by the way
5695600	5697600	well, I shouldn't talk about it.
5697600	5699600	But anyway, he knows who he is
5699600	5701600	and thank you very much for it.
5701600	5703600	He helped me get to see the Wii with
5703600	5705600	getting to skip that line and so forth.
5705600	5707600	And you know, other
5707600	5709600	Nintendo stuff, 3DS
5709600	5711600	we stood in a big line for that too, so
5711600	5713600	it's nice that people are going to be able to kind of like
5713600	5715600	skip it big time this year to check out
5715600	5717600	Super Smash Brothers, and hopefully it runs smooth.
5717600	5719600	Hopefully it runs smooth, but the fact
5719600	5721600	that they're not doing any on-site, that's pretty good.
5721600	5723600	Because I remember when Sony
5723600	5725600	did the VR thing, you had to kind of like go
5725600	5727600	run and get a ticket, and it was obviously
5727600	5729600	a clusterfuck straight to Sony's booth
5729600	5731600	that morning, but it worked out
5731600	5733600	pretty well. You didn't have to stand around all day
5733600	5735600	to get to try VR, so.
5735600	5737600	Alright, so
5737600	5739600	any interest in going to E3, Loki?
5739600	5741600	Nope. Yeah, I think they'll take that
5741600	5743600	Super Smash Brothers thing on the road here in the
5743600	5745600	US too. They're going to be really
5745600	5747600	pushing that before the game comes out. It's very clear
5747600	5749600	that that is going to be Nintendo's bread and butter for the holidays.
5749600	5751600	And how they plan to
5751600	5753600	Just put out a demo.
5753600	5755600	Maybe they will. Who knows?
5755600	5757600	Alright, moving on, Loki.
5757600	5759600	Alright, so this is interesting.
5759600	5761600	There's a new Halo game soon.
5761600	5763600	Coming to arcades.
5763600	5765600	Yes, so
5765600	5767600	Microsoft announced Halo Fire Team
5767600	5769600	Raven. It's a light gun shooter
5769600	5771600	game that's coming to arcades.
5771600	5773600	And which arcades might you ask?
5773600	5775600	Dave and Busters, this
5775600	5777600	summer.
5777600	5779600	So check it out. Will the Halo
5779600	5781600	arcade game give tickets?
5781600	5783600	I don't know. Every frag
5783600	5785600	is a ticket, maybe?
5785600	5787600	It looks interesting though.
5787600	5789600	It reminds me of like the
5789600	5791600	Glaxion type game.
5791600	5793600	It almost looks like it's in a booth
5793600	5795600	with two big giant screens.
5795600	5797600	And that's done by
5797600	5799600	Raw Thrills
5799600	5801600	and Play Mechanic.
5801600	5803600	It actually looks exactly like that.
5803600	5805600	Even the way the guns are set up
5805600	5807600	and everything.
5807600	5809600	Very much like that.
5809600	5811600	Like a Glaxion game.
5811600	5813600	I'll play it.
5813600	5815600	Do you think Halo 6 is the big E3 announcement for
5815600	5817600	Microsoft this year?
5817600	5819600	I don't know. I thought it was going to be Gears of War.
5819600	5821600	Maybe. And so which game is getting the
5821600	5823600	battle royale mode first?
5825600	5827600	You know it's coming.
5827600	5829600	You know it's coming.
5829600	5831600	Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
5831600	5833600	it's another one of those railgun shooters.
5833600	5835600	Which is the only way you can do a Halo arcade game.
5835600	5837600	I like railgun shooters in arcades.
5837600	5839600	Yeah, I like railgun shooters in arcades too.
5839600	5841600	How's my bread and butter? It would be kind of fun
5841600	5843600	though if they had like four of these together and you could
5843600	5845600	like frag other people. But I understand that's
5845600	5847600	a difficult arcade experience in a lot of
5847600	5849600	real estate. Especially in a small
5849600	5851600	ass Dave and Busters like the one we have here.
5851600	5853600	Which is, sorry not
5853600	5855600	sorry, a joke. The one
5855600	5857600	here in town is, it's like the smallest,
5857600	5859600	they said it's the smallest one in the entire chain next to
5859600	5861600	Times Square. Lucky us. I know, right?
5861600	5863600	And even, I went to the one in Times Square
5863600	5865600	and I was more impressed with that one.
5865600	5867600	Sorry not sorry.
5867600	5869600	Couldn't they make ours like two story or something
5869600	5871600	like that? Multiple stories. You would have thought.
5871600	5873600	Have like, you know, space.
5873600	5875600	It's going to be interesting when round one opens up across
5875600	5877600	the street next year. How about we just bulldoze the
5877600	5879600	whole Sunrise Mall and put a big Dave and Busters
5879600	5881600	in there? Watch your words
5881600	5883600	because I think that's not to get too much into local
5883600	5885600	politics, but I really don't see how that mall stays
5885600	5887600	around much longer. It's not. It's
5887600	5889600	clearly not and well
5889600	5891600	to get into local politics,
5891600	5893600	my wife and I would follow
5893600	5895600	a local Facebook group around
5895600	5897600	here and there's one of the planners for
5897600	5899600	the area is in there and they talk about
5899600	5901600	like different proposals for Sunrise Mall. That thing is
5901600	5903600	not staying around very long.
5903600	5905600	I went there the other day and like
5905600	5907600	half the restaurants are gone out of the food court.
5907600	5909600	Shears is closing down soon.
5909600	5911600	So I mean there's
5911600	5913600	nothing anchoring that there. You know
5913600	5915600	they might have more success and I will
5915600	5917600	tie this to video games. Stay tuned.
5917600	5919600	They may have more success as an event
5919600	5921600	center because they do that tennis thing
5921600	5923600	was there like some summers and that was
5923600	5925600	like a circus.
5925600	5927600	They had like circuses, carnivals. So I bet that place
5927600	5929600	would have a lot more success as an event space which
5929600	5931600	could include and this is one thing they've been talking
5931600	5933600	about that more shopping malls are getting into
5933600	5935600	is like e-gaming and e-sports hosting.
5935600	5937600	That would be very interesting.
5937600	5939600	It would be neat. Yeah if like the old Sears
5939600	5941600	at Sunrise Mall became like an e-sports arena
5941600	5943600	that mall might be kind of interesting.
5943600	5945600	I just
5945600	5947600	don't know what they're going to do. Who knows.
5947600	5949600	Alright.
5949600	5951600	Excuse me guys.
5951600	5953600	Let's move on to a story
5953600	5955600	on Star Fox. This is a rumor
5955600	5957600	big rumor but as E3
5957600	5959600	approaches we're going to have a lot of these so
5959600	5961600	bear with us. But what would you all think
5961600	5963600	if this were true? Because
5963600	5965600	sources say that Retro
5965600	5967600	Studios is working on Star Fox
5967600	5969600	Racing.
5969600	5971600	No. Yeah Retro Studios apparently this is
5971600	5973600	their next project.
5973600	5975600	It's a Star Fox racing game.
5975600	5977600	And this originally came from Eurogamer
5977600	5979600	who has had some leaks in the
5979600	5981600	past. Some other bullets
5981600	5983600	that have come out about the game. It's not
5983600	5985600	like F-Zero.
5985600	5987600	Star Fox Grand Prix is a tentative title.
5987600	5989600	It's based on an air wing
5989600	5991600	which is how it's not F-Zero.
5991600	5993600	It's a mix between Star Fox and
5993600	5995600	racing. You shoot enemies to move forward
5995600	5997600	and get combos. You can shoot
5997600	5999600	other players too. It's a big
5999600	6001600	hub area where you can interact with the Star Fox
6001600	6003600	characters. Retro
6003600	6005600	is considering cameos like Donkey Kong
6005600	6007600	maybe 2019
6007600	6009600	or 2018. I know.
6009600	6011600	They can throw Diddy Kong in there.
6011600	6013600	Why not? Because you know Diddy
6013600	6015600	Kong racing would have been more
6015600	6017600	apt as a racing game than
6017600	6019600	you know what
6019600	6021600	Star Fox racing is. You know
6021600	6023600	I would rather see an F-Zero but I
6023600	6025600	also understand that I may need to let that go
6025600	6027600	a little bit. I'm open
6027600	6029600	to the idea of a Star Fox racing game
6029600	6031600	but it's all about how does it play. Now
6031600	6033600	if it's kind of making
6033600	6035600	it's niche on like a competitive racing
6035600	6037600	game where like the more you destroy other
6037600	6039600	people the more you move faster.
6039600	6041600	It sounds
6041600	6043600	a little bit like Wipeout in a way maybe.
6043600	6045600	There's been games like that I think.
6045600	6047600	Yeah. So I'm
6047600	6049600	open to it and I realize that Mario
6049600	6051600	Kart is a huge game
6051600	6053600	on the Switch and was great
6053600	6055600	for Wii U2. So I think
6055600	6057600	maybe Nintendo wants to duplicate that success
6057600	6059600	without necessarily doing Mario Kart 9
6059600	6061600	right now. And do Diddy Kong racing. You don't need
6061600	6063600	to add more racing games. Or F-Zero
6063600	6065600	Oh yeah F-Zero. Hey yeah
6065600	6067600	everybody's asking for F-Zero
6067600	6069600	are one of our big racing games
6069600	6071600	that we have. Let's make an additional
6071600	6073600	racing game that no one's going to have interest
6073600	6075600	in instead. Dark Tetsuya says
6075600	6077600	there is another rumor that supposedly says
6077600	6079600	F-Zero SX for Switch
6079600	6081600	but I don't know if I buy it or not.
6081600	6083600	You know again now we're getting into rumors
6083600	6085600	that are really out there. I would love it if it's true.
6085600	6087600	Maybe it's a type of revival
6087600	6089600	of F-Zero GX and they're
6089600	6091600	going to just kind of like port it to Switch
6091600	6093600	and maybe put a few more tracks.
6093600	6095600	I'd be down. I'd be down. I would.
6095600	6097600	You know what if you could like play it online
6097600	6099600	smoothly and everything
6099600	6101600	like actually I'd be kind of down.
6101600	6103600	I would check that out.
6103600	6105600	You know right now Fast Racing Neo kind of has to
6105600	6107600	fill that void. But F-Zero is
6107600	6109600	unique in what it is. And Fast Racing has the whole
6109600	6111600	like polarizing thing like
6111600	6113600	Ikaruga kind of does when you race. So it's a little
6113600	6115600	bit different than an F-Zero game feels.
6115600	6117600	But I would be okay
6117600	6119600	if a new F-Zero game is
6119600	6121600	like basically a GX remaster
6121600	6123600	so they can do it on the cheap. And you know
6123600	6125600	that game is I think
6125600	6127600	horribly underlooked by a lot of people.
6127600	6129600	So I'm all for giving it a second chance with a newer
6129600	6131600	Nintendo generation.
6131600	6133600	For sure. Just a couple more
6133600	6135600	stories and then we'll probably open up the Skype line
6135600	6137600	for a brief bit but I am
6137600	6139600	kind of dragging here towards the end. So
6139600	6141600	a couple more stories here Loki. Take it away.
6141600	6143600	And once again just as I mentioned
6143600	6145600	when we were talking to Bobby.
6145600	6147600	Microsoft slowly has been chipping
6147600	6149600	away at PlayStation as far as
6149600	6151600	the things it does for
6151600	6153600	you know it's community
6153600	6155600	and like supporting
6155600	6157600	things that people want like backwards compatibility
6157600	6159600	or different audio
6159600	6161600	modes you know for Dolby Atmos
6161600	6163600	or you know 4K
6163600	6165600	video
6165600	6167600	playback in you know
6167600	6169600	4K Blu-rays and stuff like that.
6169600	6171600	So now to add on top of that
6171600	6173600	you know they came out with
6173600	6175600	a new control system specifically
6175600	6177600	for those with
6177600	6179600	people with limited mobility.
6179600	6181600	So this new controller
6181600	6183600	looks really strange
6183600	6185600	but you know with it
6185600	6187600	they have different add-ons that you can
6187600	6189600	add to allow for all sorts of
6189600	6191600	different options for mobility.
6191600	6193600	So for example if
6193600	6195600	you know you can add giant buttons
6195600	6197600	you can customize
6197600	6199600	it with certain you know mouthpieces
6199600	6201600	if you can only use your mouth to
6201600	6203600	move stuff or
6203600	6205600	I mean they just have so many options
6205600	6207600	to basically map stuff out.
6207600	6209600	You can remap everything.
6209600	6211600	It looks pretty
6211600	6213600	awesome. It's going to be out later this year for $100.
6213600	6215600	But
6215600	6217600	I mean just a very
6217600	6219600	interesting thing to support
6219600	6221600	you know which
6221600	6223600	probably not a huge large demographic
6223600	6225600	of people playing
6225600	6227600	you know games but it's
6227600	6229600	important though and the fact that they see
6229600	6231600	that it's important and
6231600	6233600	you know address it is far
6233600	6235600	and away better than some other companies.
6237600	6239600	All right. Yeah I love that
6239600	6241600	they're like doing this.
6241600	6243600	I love that this is like a thing that they're putting out there.
6243600	6245600	I'm all about more accessibility and getting more people
6245600	6247600	gaming and if that has to be
6247600	6249600	Xbox's like niche or whatever to
6249600	6251600	really like you know differentiate it from
6251600	6253600	what Sony is doing and what others are doing.
6253600	6255600	Cool. You know I would hope
6255600	6257600	that maybe they're going to set something that Sony
6257600	6259600	and Nintendo will want to copy
6259600	6261600	and I think
6261600	6263600	I think there have been great advocates
6263600	6265600	in the gaming industry with companies like
6265600	6267600	Ablegamer which by the way
6267600	6269600	is who I use my Amazon smile with.
6269600	6271600	Just you know a free shout out for Ablegamer
6271600	6273600	because I think it's great what they're doing is that they do
6273600	6275600	advocate and they do kind of like remind people
6275600	6277600	because you know I don't want to give Sony
6277600	6279600	shit or Nintendo's shit either because I feel like
6279600	6281600	we're more aware of those type of things now
6281600	6283600	because like you know Sony the fact that you can
6283600	6285600	in the PlayStation 4 operating system you
6285600	6287600	can like natively do whatever button swap you want
6287600	6289600	so games don't have to put it in themselves
6289600	6291600	like that's a step that's progress that lets a few
6291600	6293600	more be able to do something they couldn't before
6293600	6295600	but this this whole device that Microsoft's
6295600	6297600	doing really takes it one step further.
6297600	6299600	I think it would be even more awesome if this thing
6299600	6301600	were universal and you could use it on any system
6301600	6303600	I realize that gets into a little bit
6303600	6305600	crazy fan went territory but I mean
6305600	6307600	yeah to be fair it is a Microsoft
6307600	6309600	controller and Microsoft
6309600	6311600	controllers yeah are usually compatible with PC
6311600	6313600	so I mean that's
6313600	6315600	still pretty good. Yeah that is very good.
6315600	6317600	Sorry that doesn't support
6317600	6319600	Sony systems oh well yeah
6319600	6321600	too bad. Do you see yourself
6321600	6323600	picking one up I mean I guess there's no
6323600	6325600	there's not really a reason for you or me to
6325600	6327600	own this and I hope you know again
6327600	6329600	to shout out
6329600	6331600	Bobby a little bit because the reality is I know you
6331600	6333600	podcasters some of you may listen some of
6333600	6335600	you may not but for our live folks
6335600	6337600	they always you know almost always if they're
6337600	6339600	here early enough they hear him for an hour before
6339600	6341600	we're on so he kind of got into this a little
6341600	6343600	bit talking about you know he doesn't and Bobby
6343600	6345600	if I misquote you feel free to correct me as you would
6345600	6347600	anyway but like when it comes to speed
6347600	6349600	running and things you wouldn't want somebody to be
6349600	6351600	like look I can speed run a game because I use this
6351600	6353600	controller you don't want this to like be a thing
6353600	6355600	that's like you
6355600	6357600	know like oh it's a cool new thing
6357600	6359600	to use this controller because it lets you do games faster
6359600	6361600	it lets you like exploit things or whatever
6361600	6363600	I don't think that would be the case I
6363600	6365600	would hope not either but you know
6365600	6367600	it's a little different
6367600	6369600	when somebody wants to say
6369600	6371600	use the dance pad
6371600	6373600	to play Mario Brothers
6373600	6375600	or something which yes you could do because GameCube
6375600	6377600	had a DDR game you know it's a little different
6377600	6379600	from the like crazy crossovers
6379600	6381600	but something like this that's really for accessibility
6381600	6383600	kind of hopefully sort of like
6383600	6385600	stays
6385600	6387600	as something for
6387600	6389600	that audience to really be able to use
6389600	6391600	for them and celebrate you know what I mean
6391600	6393600	so alright
6393600	6395600	let's see SheHulk
6395600	6397600	in chat says the elite controller makes
6397600	6399600	gaming much easier a definite
6399600	6401600	advantage you know I
6401600	6403600	always forget about those elite controllers but they are
6403600	6405600	they are something they are very nice pieces
6405600	6407600	of hardware I mean I haven't dropped the
6407600	6409600	money on one because I just don't do quite enough
6409600	6411600	Xbox gaming but the
6411600	6413600	more and more PC gaming I do the more
6413600	6415600	I think about picking one up and using the Bluetooth to
6415600	6417600	use PC too so yeah
6417600	6419600	for sure anyway
6419600	6421600	last but not least
6421600	6423600	more rumors this is
6423600	6425600	about Pokemon I want to ask what you guys think
6425600	6427600	so apparently
6427600	6429600	the big Pokemon for Nintendo Switch
6429600	6431600	some information is coming out about it
6431600	6433600	and it's coming from the
6433600	6435600	Emily Rogers camp which you know she's
6435600	6437600	she's had a lot of you know predictions that have
6437600	6439600	come true so I mean take it with
6439600	6441600	a grain of salt as you would any rumor but what
6441600	6443600	would you guys think if this was true
6443600	6445600	Pokemon let's go
6445600	6447600	Pikachu and Pokemon let's go
6447600	6449600	Eevee so it's not really Gen 8
6449600	6451600	so I mean this is where this does
6451600	6453600	kind of make sense to me because we've heard conflicting
6453600	6455600	rumors about a Gen 1 reboot
6455600	6457600	and that no the Switch
6457600	6459600	Pokemon is going to be Gen 8
6459600	6461600	so maybe instead
6461600	6463600	of the full fledged Pokemon game
6463600	6465600	being this year maybe that is next year
6465600	6467600	which would make sense too because the time
6467600	6469600	between generations is usually a good 3
6469600	6471600	4 years you know it hasn't been that long
6471600	6473600	yet since Sun and Moon so maybe
6473600	6475600	we're getting a spinoff game
6475600	6477600	a la Pokemon Pinball
6477600	6479600	a la Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
6479600	6481600	to kind of like hold us over this year
6481600	6483600	and give us a Pokemon experience on the
6483600	6485600	Switch and it sounds like it could
6485600	6487600	be this in the Pokemon let's
6487600	6489600	go and that would be what would come
6489600	6491600	out and it sounds like it may have some ties
6491600	6493600	into Pokemon Go it sounds like
6493600	6495600	these games and correct me if I'm wrong guys it sounds like
6495600	6497600	these games might be like some type of
6497600	6499600	like single player couch playing
6499600	6501600	Pokemon Go-esque experience
6501600	6503600	is what it sounds like can you imagine though
6503600	6505600	because I know that these are all cartridge based
6505600	6507600	so could we in fact have
6507600	6509600	like a device
6509600	6511600	that's larger than a game cartridge
6511600	6513600	to fit in there that may have like
6513600	6515600	GPS built into it or something like that I
6515600	6517600	don't think it's literally Pokemon Go
6517600	6519600	because that's what Pokemon Go is so
6519600	6521600	I think that this would be something where
6521600	6523600	well I mean you could
6523600	6525600	here's the thing Loki
6525600	6527600	it could be an ingenious use
6527600	6529600	of the Nintendo app to be
6529600	6531600	able to use your GPS from your phone
6531600	6533600	to geolocate you but like
6533600	6535600	are we really going to put Nintendo and
6535600	6537600	app development and are we going to give
6537600	6539600	them that much credit that they know how to do that?
6539600	6541600	I'm in the middle of the ocean
6541600	6543600	I'm not the big hater you are and I'm not going to give them
6543600	6545600	that much credit but you know I could
6545600	6547600	see some type of like single player
6547600	6549600	experience built around the
6549600	6551600	concept of Pokemon Go
6551600	6553600	maybe
6553600	6555600	where it's a little more action based
6555600	6557600	maybe and maybe they
6557600	6559600	tie the raids into it somehow and you know
6559600	6561600	a little bit of that it's not maybe the same
6561600	6563600	classic JRPG experience I mean
6563600	6565600	it would be a spinoff game
6565600	6567600	Pokemon spinoff games are often
6567600	6569600	notable as well right Pokemon
6569600	6571600	Snap that was a
6571600	6573600	that was a rad game we love that Pokemon Snap
6573600	6575600	the Mystery Dungeon games not bad
6575600	6577600	I love the pinball games those pinball games are pretty sweet
6577600	6579600	so like there's no shame in being a
6579600	6581600	Pokemon spinoff game as long as it's you know
6581600	6583600	a fun spinoff game. I see the price that Pokemon Snap hasn't come back
6583600	6585600	yet with all the selfie
6585600	6587600	type you know social media
6587600	6589600	stuff I would think that
6589600	6591600	that'd be all people would be all over that
6591600	6593600	crap yeah for sure
6593600	6595600	so there you go that's the latest rumor
6595600	6597600	but honestly guys just wait
6597600	6599600	until E3 they'll
6599600	6601600	tell you what's coming at E3
6601600	6603600	alright let's open up the Sky Flight
6603600	6605600	I'm going to open this up real quick because I'm kind of dragging
6605600	6607600	here at the end of the day Orange Laundrio
6607600	6609600	all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call
6609600	6611600	Loki I know there were some stories that didn't
6611600	6613600	make the cut tonight did you want to address any of them now
6613600	6615600	sure let me
6615600	6617600	jump in there real fast
6617600	6619600	sorry to spring that on you
6619600	6621600	but you should be used to it now
6621600	6623600	I should be you would think I'd be ready
6623600	6625600	Orange Laundrio on Skype if you want to
6625600	6627600	give us a call
6627600	6629600	so let's talk a little bit about sales numbers
6629600	6631600	Gran Turismo sold 80 million
6631600	6633600	copies or they've hit their milestone
6633600	6635600	there I know I saw
6635600	6637600	Grand Theft Auto 5 actually
6637600	6639600	hit a pretty large milestone of
6639600	6641600	95 million copies sold
6641600	6643600	so that's pretty ridiculous
6643600	6645600	this is kind of cool so you may
6645600	6647600	remember there's that whole homebrew or
6647600	6649600	hacker thing that you can
6649600	6651600	basically mod the Switch now
6651600	6653600	so someone has actually taken the interface
6653600	6655600	or something that looks very similar to the interface
6655600	6657600	of the SNES mini
6657600	6659600	and put it on the Switch I'm so sorry Loki
6659600	6661600	to interrupt but can I just say on going back
6661600	6663600	a little bit because I wanted to pull this up because I was curious
6663600	6665600	how does that sales number for Grand Theft Auto 5
6665600	6667600	compare to other video games
6667600	6669600	that is more than Wii Sports at this point
6669600	6671600	Wii Sports was number 3 now Grand Theft
6671600	6673600	Auto 5 is number 3 it still
6673600	6675600	has not outpaced Minecraft
6675600	6677600	and the number 1 best selling game
6677600	6679600	ever with 177 million units
6679600	6681600	Tetris not too
6681600	6683600	surprising there some other ones
6683600	6685600	that kind of surprised me I did not realize PUBG
6685600	6687600	is already 40 million
6687600	6689600	that's crazy
6689600	6691600	Mario Kart Wii also did very well
6691600	6693600	37 million a lot of those Wii games
6693600	6695600	really high up on the list Pokemon Red and
6695600	6697600	Blue at number 9 you can check out the whole list over on
6697600	6699600	Wikipedia I know I'm using Wikipedia
6699600	6701600	as a source but I figure hey they've got
6701600	6703600	to source it to get it on wiki
6703600	6705600	so for the most part
6705600	6707600	you would assume yeah if I went over there
6707600	6709600	and it's like President Cat is the third best
6709600	6711600	selling game of all time I'd be like okay maybe not
6711600	6713600	maybe somebody went in here and
6713600	6715600	talked with a wiki anyway
6715600	6717600	Loki I'm sorry to cut you off
6717600	6719600	I wanted to get that out there
6719600	6721600	yeah so there was that cool
6721600	6723600	mod that someone's working on an emulator
6723600	6725600	that's basically a virtual console though for
6725600	6727600	the Switch so I'm
6727600	6729600	down with that
6729600	6731600	and then apparently there's some sort of thing
6731600	6733600	going on for
6733600	6735600	Street Fighter 5 where they're basically
6735600	6737600	doing a tie in with
6737600	6739600	Power Rangers
6739600	6741600	so that's going to be interesting
6741600	6743600	um
6743600	6745600	I know they've got some Power Rangers
6745600	6747600	Legacy Wars it's a mobile game
6747600	6749600	and so I don't know
6749600	6751600	they're going to have like Street Fighter
6751600	6753600	characters in there as well I mean that's pretty cool
6753600	6755600	ah neat
6755600	6757600	so let's see what that is all about
6757600	6759600	um
6759600	6761600	what else
6761600	6763600	let's see
6763600	6765600	I don't know
6765600	6767600	that's pretty much it I think
6767600	6769600	there isn't a whole lot else for the week
6769600	6771600	um
6771600	6773600	Taiko no Tatsujin
6773600	6775600	there are Switch versions coming out
6775600	6777600	um in Japan they're also going to be doing
6777600	6779600	a controller from Hori
6779600	6781600	um so that's kind of cool
6781600	6783600	they're going to have 20 party games in there
6783600	6785600	and let's see when that's
6785600	6787600	expected to be out here
6787600	6789600	so there's the money sale
6789600	6791600	besides the load here
6791600	6793600	come on
6793600	6795600	you can do it
6795600	6797600	ah
6797600	6799600	never mind
6799600	6801600	alright that's alright
6801600	6803600	oh we have one call wow I was just about to close it
6803600	6805600	and then it lit up so why not
6805600	6807600	I don't see this name popping on skype an awful lot
6807600	6809600	but let's see how you're on Orange Sounds Radio who's this
6809600	6811600	hi this is JD
6811600	6813600	hey I don't see you on skype an awful lot even though we get you in studio once in a while
6813600	6815600	but it's good to hear from you what's up buddy
6815600	6817600	um so one of the stories
6817600	6819600	I saw this week was Ariana Grande
6819600	6821600	did a lobbo
6821600	6823600	promotion doing um
6823600	6825600	no tears left to cry
6825600	6827600	all lobbo instruments
6827600	6829600	you know what I appreciate you bringing that up
6829600	6831600	you're right that's a pretty big deal
6831600	6833600	Ariana Grande she's kind of a big deal
6833600	6835600	I don't know if you know her
6835600	6837600	but uh yeah she's kind of a big deal a pop star
6837600	6839600	so for her to be doing this lobbo
6839600	6841600	thing is kind of like
6841600	6843600	those 3DS commercials with Beyonce
6843600	6845600	but I would put that at number one because Beyonce
6845600	6847600	is like untouchable
6847600	6849600	but Ariana Grande like that's
6849600	6851600	pretty solid that's like Nintendo's second biggest
6851600	6853600	grab ever probably
6853600	6855600	right I mean we already know Ariana Grande
6855600	6857600	is a gamer queen because of the Final Fantasy thing
6857600	6859600	oh yeah Final Fantasy gamer queen
6859600	6861600	absolutely
6861600	6863600	so my hope is
6863600	6865600	they were playing a bunch of musical instruments
6865600	6867600	that were all lobbo things
6867600	6869600	I'm hoping that they will
6869600	6871600	release a all musical instrument
6871600	6873600	lobbo bundle instead of variety
6873600	6875600	pack that includes a piano that I'm only
6875600	6877600	gonna want the piano out of
6877600	6879600	I must confess I didn't see the commercial
6879600	6881600	I just saw some of the screenshots on Twitter
6881600	6883600	I didn't realize it was a commercial
6883600	6885600	I know that they did something I thought
6885600	6887600	on the late what was it with Seth
6887600	6889600	Myers or not Seth Myers
6889600	6891600	Jimmy Fallon that's right
6891600	6893600	they did their thing
6893600	6895600	was there instruments
6895600	6897600	in there that we haven't seen yet
6897600	6899600	indicating that there's more to come
6899600	6901600	I feel like yes they had like
6901600	6903600	a drum set and it wasn't just
6903600	6905600	all pianos and as far as I know the only one that's
6905600	6907600	been released is pianos
6907600	6909600	a lot of it looked like they were hacked from other things
6909600	6911600	they had taken some of the parts from
6911600	6913600	the robot set you know what I really
6913600	6915600	would not be surprised I mean labo seems
6915600	6917600	to be doing well it was sold out at target
6917600	6919600	like and it's I don't I saw it on
6919600	6921600	shelf I've seen it around yeah
6921600	6923600	but I feel like it's doing well they had it marked down
6923600	6925600	at Fry's they had the
6925600	6927600	robot kit marked down that's what I saw today
6927600	6929600	Fry's anyway
6929600	6931600	cause I got new mics
6931600	6933600	that I never bothered to hook up but anyway
6933600	6935600	so yeah labo I feel like
6935600	6937600	is doing well so I mean it would make sense that
6937600	6939600	it's probably going to be a volume 3 and a volume 4
6939600	6941600	and that musical instruments are
6941600	6943600	probably one of those upcoming things
6943600	6945600	right someone else posted
6945600	6947600	a link about the Game of Thrones
6947600	6949600	composer playing the theme
6949600	6951600	on labo like the labo piano
6951600	6953600	so like clearly
6953600	6955600	at least somebody in Nintendo's marketing
6955600	6957600	department is trying to make this happen
6957600	6959600	yeah no I would say you know labo
6959600	6961600	it feels like from a pop
6961600	6963600	culture standpoint labo's
6963600	6965600	kind of breaking through a little bit so I feel
6965600	6967600	like look we're
6967600	6969600	seeing this in a way we didn't see the Wii vitality
6969600	6971600	sensor okay so I feel like
6971600	6973600	this is something that's probably going to be around for a little bit
6973600	6975600	I hope so
6975600	6977600	did you ever buy labo did you ever
6977600	6979600	actually pick it up? no I didn't I just
6979600	6981600	decided that there was
6981600	6983600	I mean the signal to noise ratio wasn't great
6983600	6985600	for me I was like if I only want one of the five
6985600	6987600	things I'll wait until it's either
6987600	6989600	available separately or just not
6989600	6991600	get it I'm kind of with you but if they do
6991600	6993600	an all music set that is going
6993600	6995600	to be very tempting with or without the piano
6995600	6997600	honestly I mean the piano is rad but if they did
6997600	6999600	like a drum and a guitar
6999600	7001600	and like this whole set I'd kind of be
7001600	7003600	into that I think yeah absolutely
7003600	7005600	yeah all right JD anything else on your mind
7005600	7007600	tonight? that's it all right I'm gonna let
7007600	7009600	you go thanks thank you for blessing our
7009600	7011600	show with Ariana Grande's presence I appreciate it

7025600	7027600	pretty awesome yeah
7027600	7029600	so all right pretty sweet
7029600	7031600	well I'm running out of gas you guys I think I'm gonna
7031600	7033600	close up the skype line for tonight sorry it's a little
7033600	7035600	bit shorter of a show but you guys know I'm kind of battling
7035600	7037600	this whole allergy thing which you know
7037600	7039600	in the years I've been doing this show has never been a problem but here we
7039600	7041600	are we'll be back next

7061600	7063600	so yeah a nice five star review on
7063600	7065600	iTunes goes an awful long way but word of mouth
7065600	7067600	is like the absolute best thing you can do
7067600	7069600	and that brings me to final
7069600	7071600	thoughts my final thought
7071600	7073600	tonight is rest and liquids
