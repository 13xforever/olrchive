00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This week, Wal-Mart Canada may have let the cat out of the bag listing handfuls of titles possibly to be officially announced at E3. Strangely, all of them could be easily guessed, minor typos notwithstanding. That's just one headline, stay tuned for plenty more people-powered discussion starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, May the 13th, 2018 with episode number 730 of our show.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Rob Roberts or you might follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. Joining me, sadly not tonight, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but if you were listening last week, you heard our little tangent about DragCon and that's where she is at tonight.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So she's been putting a lot of pictures over on her Instagram and all that stuff so it looks like she's having a great time and I'm sure she'll tell us a little bit about it next week, although I don't think there's a lot of video game content to announce.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But I think maybe some TV stuff, I don't know. Anyway, but join me here in studio to hold down the fort this week. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey Loki, how are you?

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm fine.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, good. How's things going well for you?

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Sure, I've been driving around town trying to scour Lego deals. The problem is there's some inventory sites online that aren't exactly accurate.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And so there was one they had was the Destiny's Bounty, which is the Ninjago ship from the movie, which is normally like $160 set, but they were closing it out at certain locations at Walmart for $40.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So I was like, shit, I want to get that for $40 because that's a steal. But all the locations that supposedly had it in stock, and it's been that way for weeks now, don't have it.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's funny you bring that up because I still don't have that Tron Lego set that came out like a few weeks ago.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You got to get it from the Lego store.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I know. Yeah, that one has to come from official channels. Well, so let me backtrack a little bit because to set up the story, I need to wish all of our mothers out there a happy Mother's Day, all the mommy gamers out there.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And of course, if you consider yourself a mother, if that is for a child or you got a single parent situation going on, then all the people who consider themselves mothers and mommy gamers, I hope you all are having a fantastic day today.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So I say that because even though those of you that have listened to the show for a while know that I lost my mom last year, that the party must go on, so to speak.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So we had like a family thing in Old Town today with my dad and my sister and myself and Alan.

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So while we were there, we went over to, you know, how some of the like Old Town shops can be very kitschy here.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's look like candy barrel stores and souvenir like sock stores.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There's so many socks stores and find a license plate with your name on it that says, you know, beautiful Sacramento or license plate. Exactly.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Those types of things. So anyway, there was a little story that there's actually kind of a neat store there.

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's the same place that has like the retro arcade games for 50 cents a pop.

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Even though I kind of laugh like my God, trying to play like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from, you know, the 90s on 50 cents a credit.

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But I got to say, those machines are in great condition. Like sometimes you see classic games and a few of them are like really run down.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I will give this store props like I don't know who's maintaining those cabinets, but they're doing a great job because they're all great.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They're probably still getting that kind of money. It's like, well, we could charge 25 cents, but people are paying 50 cents.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, it's all tourists and you get kids in there and kids like mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So, you know, because that's what kids do, right? Look, it's what your kids do. Yes.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's what they do. So, so they get, you know, here's 50 cents. Shut up. Right.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then that'll get you maybe 45 seconds on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or whatever it is. But anyway.

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So they also have Legos and like other this store is set up like a Disney souvenir shop or like you can walk from one store.

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think it's like all five stores like owned by the same people because you can walk like from the nerdy store to the like a painting store with nerdy stuff in it to the end.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's like candy. I think there's a candy thing too because everything in old town is candy. And so like you can kind of walk through it kind of like a Disneyland.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That must be the old costume shop that they had there because they had one. Not Evangel, not Evangelions. That's still there.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, is it? Okay. Yeah. Because I remember that one had kind of where you can walk next door to.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes. But that was because it was all the same store basically. Yeah. No, this one is some other, I don't know what it used to be. I don't remember.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So I feel like it might've been like a mall of stores before. And so maybe they've converted it into this. But anyway.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So they had the Legos there and Alan started looking and I'm like, Oh, what are you looking for?

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's like, I'm trying to get you the Tron thing. And I'm like, well, I think that's only at the official sources, sadly.

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Because those contest winners, that's what they're for, right? They're not going to go into mass production or anything like that.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah. They don't really put those in. Well, that's not necessarily true because you do see a lot of those.

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They still carry those at Barnes and Noble. So you will have those there, but you don't see them very spread out.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think the Tron one though is exclusive to Shop at Home, the Lego Shop at Home and their website and the Lego stores.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah. That's why I just ordered it from the website. And honestly, it's an okay set. I have mine on display.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But it's just like, it took me like 30 minutes to put it together and I was just like, well, it's one of the things I just want to own for the novelty, for the fact that it's Tron.

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You know what I mean? So it is cool. But like I've put together, you know, many better sets.

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Loki, maybe if they sell enough of those, Disney will make a third movie.

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, I don't think so. I can dream. Damn it. I can dream.

51
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hi to our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who's back this week.

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So welcome back, Bobby. And happy belated birthday, Bobby Black Wolf.

53
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes, happy birthday.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Because I forgot to say it on your show because I got all flustered because I swore on the Bobby Black Wolf show.

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And Bobby has a wholesome family show that you can listen to on the speakers.

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Even I know that.

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah. And I know you don't. And I said a very brown word on his show that he will not have to go back and censor. So sorry about that.

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So but here at OLR, we we are. What was the tweet that Donovan sent us earlier?

59
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We're the Tarantino's of the podcasting with our language. So, you know, what the fuck ever. Anyway.

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So Bobby Black Wolf is in chat saying yes, Tarantino's the John Waters.

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They are. They are in Lego stores. They had a bunch of the hard to find women in NASA sets on the shelf before the holidays.

62
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's really cool. Go to Barnes and Noble. They have all that stuff. And they're clearing out their Batman, their Lego Batman stuff for the movie, which I was like, no, I'm not going to buy any of those.

63
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But but Toys R Us is probably kind of a shit toys arrest. I mean, no, no offense.

64
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, I mean, Loki, they're kind of fucked already.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, but yeah, well, they're kind of fucked because they never lower their prices on stuff and everything's retail, even like with the discounts, it becomes like higher than retail.

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So just forget it. But yeah, you can get the women in NASA. They have the new blind bag sets. Those are all at Barnes and Noble.

67
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Bobby in chat also says, I enjoyed putting together the set, the Tron set. So there's a there's a positive.

68
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Maybe I'm just spoiled when it comes to that.

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're just stubborn. All right. Let's see other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

70
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Tigerclaw, since I brought up Ninja Turtles, of course, Tigerclaw had to be like, wait, wait, I got your Turtles nudes, dude.

71
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Tigerclaw says, speaking of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the finalists for that Ninja Turtles Splatfest is set for May 18th.

72
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Team Raphael versus Team Donnie. So that's that's where it ended up.

73
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Or is it just Team Raph now? See, obviously, I haven't watched cartoons since the 90s. I don't I disavow all the new stuff.

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's the 90 cartoon forever for me. But obviously, Team Donnie in that situation or Donatello.

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Sometimes stuff grows like especially the new DuckTales cartoon. Not bad.

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
OK, David Tennant's Uncle Scrooge in that, right?

77
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think so. Yeah. So that's that's already some points right there. I don't have anything against new cartoons.

78
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I just got I bear I barely have time to watch like the shows that I'm supposed to be watching, let alone, you know, add cartoons into that.

79
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So, well, anyway, let's see other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

80
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's see. YYR says Legos were five percent off when everything else was 10 to 20 percent off.

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I haven't looked. What are discounts at now? I don't know. I haven't bothered with the whole thing.

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I almost went over there today, but I didn't. There's nothing going to be there.

83
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Do you know how many vultures participate in those sales? Like people that are going to wait for that type of steal to just flip it on eBay or something or save them for a couple of years, then put them on eBay.

84
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You know, things like that. Like, I just I don't feel like dealing with the professional.

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There's not going to there's no way that's going you can get better deals everywhere else.

86
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And I mean, honestly, well, we talked about this when the when the news first came out, the Toys R Us is going to go under.

87
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We talked about the fact that when it's really 10 to 20 percent off, like keep an eye out to make sure you really are getting a good deal because sometimes they jack up the prices.

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But usually it's going to go for the manufactured suggested retail price, which almost all chains are selling under that because they're all trying to outdo each other.

89
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Not so much with Legos. I mean, like when I think that's why they're not discounted.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In fact, the fact that they are Legos and they know that is the ticket item, like you can go to like any Walmart or Target and get, you know, sets that are normally sixty dollars MSRP for forty eight or forty dollars.

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Or, you know, you do get a discount on that all the time, which is why I'm looking for stuff even lower than that, but never on the big sets.

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It seems like there's a couple chatter saying it's 30 to 50 percent now. So it's starting to get a lot of Legos.

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Definitely not Legos.

94
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Fair enough. All right. Well, we could talk about Legos all night long. Yeah, I think there'd probably be a lot of room in the universe for a Lego podcast. I'm sure there's got to be a Lego podcast out there.

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, dozens.

96
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Actually, YouTube channels will be where it's at for Legos. I don't know if that translates as well to a podcast. I'm sure someone's doing it and doing it well.

97
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, dozens of those too.

98
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But the YouTube channels, I'm sure are crazy. Anyway, let's talk about what's going on in video games and really starting off this week with our kickoff topic tonight.

99
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Some really big news on a really big company we've been waiting for for a really long time. So let's...

100
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is it big news, though? Is it?

101
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Read the goddamn story, Logie.

102
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm just saying. So Nintendo has finally unveiled what Nintendo Online is going to be.

103
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So guess what? So first off, let's talk about the pricing. So pricing, one month, only four bucks. Not bad.

104
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Logie, I think your mic is cutting in and out. Sorry there. I don't know if that... Are we having mic problems again? I'm going to freaking scream. All right.

105
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Does Toys R Us sell mics? Because we could probably buy some there.

106
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Seriously. All right. Well, with Miss Dark Sakura being out this week, I guess we will just have to borrow her setup here.

107
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And while I get that all ready to go, I will probably just have to pick up some new microphones this week.

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Her mic, I don't know if her mic is in much better condition. If it'll reach. Hold on. Don't pull too hard on that. There.

109
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

110
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
OK, try now, Logie.

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hello.

112
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There we go. Much better.

113
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're probably going to need to turn me, well, down or up. I don't know.

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I think you're fine for right now. I'll futz the volume.

115
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm going to turn this one off.

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, please do.

117
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And shove this over here. And maybe not remember that it's wrapped around my laptop.

118
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
All right.

119
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Thankfully not wrapped around the glass of water I have right here next to my laptop ever so responsibly.

120
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Anyways, Nintendo Online, where are we left?

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Nintendo Online.

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The joy of live radio, folks.

123
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So yes, as broken as our microphone is.

124
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So Nintendo Online, they're going to offer one month for $3.99, three months for $7.99.

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Or you can get a whopping 12 months for $20.

126
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
While that doesn't seem like it's very much compared to the competition out there.

127
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's see what you get for that kind of money.

128
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So. Oh, and then I forgot to mention.

129
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If you also want to sign up for a family plan, which allows you to have eight different profiles across a bunch of different switches.

130
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's only $34 or $35 a year.

131
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So that's not bad.

132
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So what do you get with that?

133
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So starting off, you get, of course, access to play games online.

134
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You get cloud backup saves or cloud backups for your saves.

135
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And then they have you get access to the Nintendo Online phone app.

136
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And then, of course, you know, the thing everybody is waiting for.

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What about all those virtual console games?

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What are we doing virtual console?

139
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, they have the NES classic game service, which I guess is launching with that.

140
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They're going to offer games that you can play multiplayer across the Internet.

141
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And they're going to have 20 titles and going to be adding more as it goes along.

142
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So the first few titles that they've got, they have soccer, tennis, Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers,

143
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. 3.

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And then there's supposed to be more.

145
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They'll be announced later.

146
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And those are going to, I guess, be in lieu of other console games.

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And, of course, this is supposed to be coming out in September.

148
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So you're not too big on this, Loki.

149
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I mean, what a surprise, you and Nintendo not getting along.

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know. I'm not as cold on this as you.

151
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm actually pleasantly surprised that instead of them just doing virtual console and charging five bucks a pop, like we've kind of had.

152
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I mean, and they've also said virtual console gone.

153
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This is there is no more virtual console.

154
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
This is what they haven't really said.

155
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This is the replacement.

156
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But you can all read into that is that Nintendo online is where they're going.

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And this would also explain why, you know, Neo Geo for some time has in case been doing those arcade archive partnerships.

158
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Sega's got their Sega Aegis thing going on.

159
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So I would expect third parties, at least other consoles, you know, where the Wii played Genesis and other stuff.

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You can expect the other consoles that were not Nintendo's family not going to be a part of this ever.

161
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Third party games to be determined, I suppose.

162
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But anyway, my point is, instead of charging five bucks a pop again for this stuff, it seems like if I'm reading this right,

163
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and I guess there's still room for interpretation, but if I'm reading this right, they're moving to a Netflix model.

164
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Which I think everybody's kind of been asking for, right?

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So why are you mad, though?

166
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm mad because this is only a few games.

167
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They could be offering a lot more that's available.

168
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And like, I would have purchased them right away.

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And I don't care if they're five dollars each.

170
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah, it's expensive, but I would have bought them so that I could have them on my system.

171
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because this...

172
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
See, but here, even if they did the five dollars each, it would have only been, it always was the drip fed titles.

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why wouldn't it still be the drip fed titles?

174
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The reason why they're doing it this way is to keep you sucked into that Nintendo Online month after month.

175
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because you'll have something to look forward to.

176
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
At some point when the wells get dry, they'll say,

177
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let's see what they offer, because I just, I think, you know, that they have 20 titles or whatever at launch.

178
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let's see how quickly they're putting titles in there.

179
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Because if it's gonna be like, oh, we're adding like four a month or something like that, that's still not that great.

180
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I mean, I don't know. I just expected better.

181
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And on top of that, it's awfully nice of them to have no way to back up your saves,

182
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
despite the fact that the system has goddamn USB ports on there.

183
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But oh, but if you pay us $20 a year, we'll allow you to back them up to the cloud.

184
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Then gee, that's a little bit of pay gating for that stuff.

185
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's ridiculous.

186
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
All the other console systems out there allow you to back up your saves without having to subscribe to a service?

187
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What the fuck?

188
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No, Microsoft doesn't do that.

189
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh shit, I can dump my saves to a memory card.

190
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, a memory card. Oh, I thought you meant the cloud.

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, I'm not talking about the cloud. Fine, they can gate that shit. I don't need that.

192
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But I'm talking about actually being able to dump them to a thumb drive or something like that.

193
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, I see, I see.

194
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

195
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Bobby's saying it's PlayStation Plus only, you can't access cloud, but he said he's not talking about the cloud, so fine.

196
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But I do want to point out over chat, Rama says it's $20 a year, I failed to see the issue.

197
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
JD says I'm extremely looking forward to expanding my family on Nintendo for just $4 a person.

198
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And Bobby Blackwell says this is literally exactly what everyone asked for in 2006 when Virtual Console launched.

199
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Loki, I kind of tend to agree.

200
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Like, why is this? Especially considering that they're going back and adding online play.

201
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So they are modifying these ROMs, or you know, making sure that they're going to work in an emulator like this.

202
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And I didn't fucking ask them to do that.

203
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I did.

204
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Well then fine.

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I said back in the days of the week.

206
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's fine, and they can have their ROMs with their multiplayer in this online service and then sell me this shit that's one player that I can play locally.

207
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's all I want. They can do that now. You can't tell me that I can't fucking emulate NES games.

208
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I just-

209
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They can fucking emulate NES games.

210
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay, so let me- I have to admit, I'm a little surprised at this.

211
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So what if we're now looking one year from now?

212
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So let's say this thing launches in September, so we'll say September 2019.

213
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And we'll say they have put out five games a month from that time period.

214
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That would be 20 to start, 60 additional games, 80 games in the library now at that point.

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Are you still going to say Baja Humbug?

216
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes I am, because they're NES games.

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What if I want Super Nintendo games? Nintendo 64 games? What if I want DS games?

218
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Or whatever else they're going to offer on virtual- what was virtual console.

219
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There's a lot of other consoles.

220
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
80 games across all their platforms is not enough.

221
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
When they had, I don't have time to play the two games I bought in the last month.

222
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Where am I going to play 80 games?

223
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And if you don't have time to do that, then it doesn't matter.

224
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Here's my thing, is their offering is pitiful, but the price is pitiful too, so it doesn't matter.

225
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So you're paying for almost nothing, and you're getting almost nothing.

226
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So that's fine if you're happy with it. I'm not happy with it.

227
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
As a person that bought a Switch, I wanted to immediately be able to download those games.

228
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I would have easily dumped another $100 or $150 in virtual console games,

229
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
to get the same games that my son was playing back onto the system.

230
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But now, that's not even an option.

231
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So my other option, I guess at this point, if I want to be able to play those things,

232
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is, well, I guess I gotta go to piracy, because they're not offering them on their platform.

233
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So, because this is a show where every gamer has a voice,

234
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and I know some of you Nintendo fans are probably a little huffy at what Loki is saying right now,

235
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
part of the reason I'm, you know, indulging this is because,

236
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A, he's not the only one saying this.

237
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I've got into the same kind of discussion on Twitter with somebody else,

238
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
so I know he's not the only one saying it.

239
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And B, I will give you that, that that is a decent perspective,

240
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
where your son was getting used to these games on the Wii U,

241
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
so, you know, when, you know, backwards compatibility,

242
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
let's say, on Microsoft's ecosystem is pretty rich,

243
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
why can't, you know, we know that there's not much that goes in a virtual console emulator,

244
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
why can't they just unleash the floodgates, and what they put out on Wii U,

245
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and even Wii, they just put out on Switch?

246
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll tell you how it's gonna go. Here's exactly how it's gonna go.

247
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay.

248
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They have already an unpatchable exploit for the system,

249
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
you're just gonna get a fucking emulator and be able to dump whatever you want in there,

250
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and that'll satiate anybody that's looking to play a bunch of ROMs on their Switch.

251
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Because Nintendo isn't gonna step up to the game.

252
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I think, yeah, it's nice that they added online multiplayer to some ROMs and stuff,

253
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
but dude, come on.

254
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Emulators on PC have had online play for decades.

255
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Like, what is the fucking problem?

256
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
To be fair, it's kinda jank.

257
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Like, in the early days especially, like, it was not, I don't know,

258
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I haven't, honestly, I haven't dinked around with emulators in a long time.

259
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And maybe that's because companies are making it easier and easier to just,

260
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
eh, push A to support, you know, whatever, buy the thing.

261
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Like, I don't feel the need to go to emulators as strongly as I used to.

262
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That whole type of thing.

263
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So maybe, to be fair, I haven't been up and up on the online technologies in the emulator.

264
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I remember when it was first out on, what is it, SNES 9X, all those years ago,

265
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and that, it was kinda, it was there, but it was like, eh, wasn't that great?

266
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Like, I get it, that they're offering the service if you want to pay for this.

267
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like, say, what if I didn't want to play multiplayer?

268
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You know, wouldn't it be nice to have an option to be able to purchase these ROMs

269
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
to have them, you know, before their release on the service?

270
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Like, I mean, with this argument, basically saying, well, it's okay,

271
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
because these are all gonna be on this online service, like Netflix,

272
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
so you're saying I just never need the, why even sell movies at the store anymore?

273
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Because we have Netflix, you know, what's the point?

274
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Why even buy any of that stuff?

275
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Because it's available on Netflix, or at least it'll eventually be on Netflix.

276
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Just don't buy movies anymore.

277
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You know, YYR has a decent counterpoint.

278
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Seriously, though, before it was buying games outright.

279
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Now it's a monthly service.

280
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But hashtag, why not both?

281
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And Act F says, my co-host in my podcast, cheap plug for GFMCast.com,

282
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
there you go, it's good times, are in the same boat as Loki, so it's a legit concern.

283
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah, no, I mean, you can get mad at Loki all you want,

284
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
because he's, you know, not thrilled about this,

285
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but there's a lot of gamers out there that are feeling the same thing going on.

286
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I can support the why not both methodology.

287
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, there's also a part of me that says, well, wait a minute,

288
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
am I reading too much into this?

289
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That Nintendo does plan to have this 80-game catalog

290
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
on Netflix-style Nintendo thing by next September.

291
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Or is this the 20 games that will be playable Netflix-style now?

292
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And then as new games come in, old games go out.

293
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, but if you want to keep that old game, $5.

294
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Possible.

295
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I mean, I know, I'm tinfoil-hatting a little bit.

296
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm just saying, why are they making this so difficult for me to give you money?

297
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I mean, what is the problem here?

298
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Sorry, just real quick, the reason why I'm going tinfoil-hat on that

299
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
is because my mind is a little bit still hung up on

300
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
when they first announced this whole thing a long time ago

301
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and they said, one free game a month, or whatever it was.

302
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Which is stupid, I was like, okay.

303
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, so clearly plans have changed a little bit, but, you know, that's, anyway.

304
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So that's where my little tinfoil-hatting comes from.

305
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I just, whatever, you know what, I'm sure I'll pay for the service just to play online.

306
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm not really looking forward to this stuff, though.

307
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I mean, it's disappointing.

308
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's just constant disappointment with them.

309
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's like, we've been waiting for them to launch Virtual Console on this platform forever now.

310
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And now they're just like, well, fuck you guys, we're not doing it, we're just gonna do this.

311
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This is what you guys want.

312
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Well, you know what, it's okay to have a service.

313
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Like, for example, PlayStation Now.

314
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
PlayStation Now, I can pay for that service

315
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and I have access to a library of different games that I can play.

316
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Many of which I can also purchase on the PlayStation Store.

317
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Why can't we do that?

318
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So you want both, like what I said.

319
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Why not? What's the harm in doing that?

320
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No, honestly, that I think is the happy middle ground where we can all agree,

321
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
whether people agree with you or not, that maybe both would be even better.

322
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Because, you know, with the PlayStation Now, there's a fair point in there,

323
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
is that how many of us are actually subscribed to PlayStation Now right now?

324
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Or Microsoft Service? I know I'm not, I don't think you are.

325
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I doubt Dark Soccer is, because I don't think she's mentioned it before.

326
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Is she on EA's thing?

327
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I can't remember, but maybe, well, if she was, she probably isn't anymore.

328
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
She may have got it for the Mass Effect thing and then dropped it,

329
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
but I'll have to ask her and let her speak for herself.

330
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But anyway, you know, so maybe people do want to kind of buy this

331
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
so that they quote unquote own it, but then at the same time,

332
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
there's a lot of digital stuff I'm buying on PlayStation 3,

333
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and it's like, well, I used to buy on PlayStation 3,

334
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and it's like, well, as my PlayStation's over there collecting dust,

335
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
there's really no way for me to play it anymore,

336
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
because PlayStation 4 won't really support any of it.

337
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Well, that's dumb too, but you know, that's a whole other argument.

338
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Which I would be way more excited about PlayStation Now

339
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
if it would just give me access to the stuff I bought before,

340
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and yes, it should give that to me for free,

341
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
or at least for being a PlayStation Plus subscriber.

342
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If they want to gate that behind PlayStation Plus,

343
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
because bandwidth for streaming, then fine, fine.

344
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Bandwidth for streaming isn't free, fine, do that.

345
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Anyway, I didn't mean to make the Nintendo thing a PlayStation thing,

346
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but I guess there are some similarities, for what it's worth.

347
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm still, maybe that's how they got rid of some of the lag for multiplayer.

348
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Maybe something about that you're like streaming the games,

349
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I guess that would probably be more lag.

350
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Maybe like you and the person you're playing with

351
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
are streaming the games from a central computer,

352
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
but I guess that would be more lag, not less.

353
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Like the emulator, you're talking about NES ROMs?

354
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah.

355
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Dude, those are like a few K, that would transfer instantaneously.

356
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I mean, you could download the whole ROM in a fraction of a second,

357
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't think any lag is going to be coming from downloading that ROM.

358
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Fair enough, I guess I'm overthinking it.

359
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Let's see, go into chat for more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

360
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Bobby Blackwolf does point out, remember early on,

361
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
they said it was Super Nintendo games with online play.

362
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
When Switch was announced, they said it would be Super Nintendo games with online play.

363
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So, your concern about there not being any Super Nintendo games right now may be short-lived.

364
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I think this is exactly what Nintendo's doing.

365
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
They did this when they first rolled out Virtual Console on the Wii,

366
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
they did this when they rolled out on the Wii U, and they're doing it now.

367
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Okay, so I guess I'll look forward to Super Nintendo games in 2020 or some bullshit.

368
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't think it'll be that long.

369
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Okay, well, we'll see what a year from now what's actually out.

370
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I don't trust them to be on time with any of this stuff.

371
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I think September is going to be the Nintendo thing,

372
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and that's going to be their push through the holiday,

373
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and then probably next year, either summer or whenever they kind of want to wake people up,

374
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
they'll put out Super Nintendo as the next wave.

375
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But what's not going to happen is something now in this little,

376
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
like where do things fit in now, is Mother 3.

377
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And A, I know that's not Super Nintendo, that was Game Boy Advance, right?

378
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
There's another system.

379
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And there's no reason this maybe wouldn't grow into that at some point.

380
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, especially with the Switch being portable as well, it's possible.

381
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But if they release Mother 3, wouldn't they be able to just charge 10 bucks for that as a standalone game?

382
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Why would Mother 3 be on a service like this?

383
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's never going to be on the platform, period.

384
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So, I mean, it's a non-issue, but it's...

385
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That's true. Keep on dreaming, right?

386
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's never going to happen.

387
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Nintendo doesn't know that the consumer wants that.

388
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
They fucking know. They don't care.

389
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So it's never going to be on the platform anyways.

390
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But to that point, you're like, oh, NES is going to launch now,

391
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and then later on it'll be Super Nintendo, then fuck.

392
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Then if I'm going to get Mario 64, then I'm just going to have to wait.

393
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I mean, what's the point?

394
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Why do I even want to mess with their stupid service at this point?

395
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's dumb. At this point, it should be not...

396
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Why is it taking so long?

397
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They'll put multiplayer in a fucking NES game.

398
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Like, this boggles my fucking brain that they can't figure out how to program...

399
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Dude, there's so many emulators out there that do this shit better.

400
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Like, I've seen Wii U emulators that are so goddamn sophisticated,

401
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I can purchase...

402
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Wii emulators, they can purchase games from the fucking online store.

403
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I mean, why is it that they can't take an old-ass game

404
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
that can run on anything and add multiplayer to it?

405
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
People have figured out how to do this shit.

406
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's not a priority for them.

407
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And honestly, if this is what's stopping this stuff coming out,

408
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
is adding these extra features, that's cool.

409
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Sell that as something separate.

410
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Call them Nintendo-enhanced titles or something like that.

411
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Or the NES Classic or the SNES Classic,

412
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
because that's where my mind's going,

413
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
is that maybe part of this is conflict of interest with those things.

414
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They don't want to put out all the same games that are already available on those devices,

415
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
because they want to sell those devices.

416
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And maybe that is Nintendo's MO for how you're going to buy games that you want to keep.

417
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Because, and low-key, get mad at the people for buying those things like fucking crazy,

418
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
because it showed that that works.

419
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And this is something I'm just processing out loud and thinking out loud,

420
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
because I didn't even think of it until you said,

421
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
why are they doing this?

422
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And I'm like, well, maybe they still want to push those NES Classics.

423
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And I'm thinking of that tweet, that late-breaking news we just saw

424
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
before we went live tonight,

425
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
that the NES Classic reproduction hit shelves June 29th.

426
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And they said that and the SNES are going to be available throughout the rest of the year.

427
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah, but here's the problem.

428
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So that's what they don't want to compete with.

429
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That argument doesn't make any sense to me,

430
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
because that doesn't mean I wouldn't buy that system anyways.

431
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You're saying that you can't sell me Virtual Console games,

432
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
because that'll stop me from buying an SNES Classic or something like that.

433
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That's not even going to...

434
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I've already purchased these games on the Wii U.

435
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I should actually not have to pay for these again anyway,

436
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
since I've already bought them the first time.

437
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I bought them several times on the Wii and the Wii U.

438
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So, I mean, I would purchase them again on the Switch,

439
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and I'd probably still purchase one of those Classic systems.

440
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That doesn't make any sense.

441
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
All this is basically saying to me, bottom line,

442
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
is to make an end to this argument.

443
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Just remember, we've got people in chat saying,

444
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Loki is salty as fuck tonight.

445
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That's from Brad from Pop Culture.

446
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm just going to have to fucking go to piracy,

447
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
because they're making it too fucking hard to give them money.

448
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So fuck them.

449
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm not giving them money.

450
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm just going to pirate the shit out of it.

451
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I have to disagree strongly with that.

452
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't think that's the way to go.

453
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But it is what it is.

454
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay, show me a way to purchase the Nintendo 64 game on the Switch.

455
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I can't.

456
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I can't this year.

457
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I probably can't next year, and probably the year after that.

458
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Do you want me to give you the answer Don Mattrick would have gave you?

459
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Go buy a Wii U.

460
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That's the answer Don Mattrick would have gave you.

461
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Go buy a Wii U.

462
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Or no, because you're not supporting that system anymore.

463
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Why are you physically unable to put a system that can be emulated on a Raspberry Pi?

464
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's the thing.

465
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The Raspberry Pi is going to outsell the stupid NES classics.

466
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So Bobby in chat says, Loki, you're already at piracy.

467
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You already pirated it all.

468
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So people who might be a little ragey that you would say you're going to piracy with all that,

469
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
but you kind of like, to be fair, you haven't.

470
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You do support this stuff when it's available.

471
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You did it on Wii U.

472
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I did. I purchased tons of virtual console games.

473
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay, so piracy is not always the answer for you, and I think that's an important point to make very clear.

474
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's see, I was going to read this other stuff in chat before we got on that tangent.

475
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
At live.vognetwork.com, where were we?

476
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Oh, YYR says they've added multiplayer and are making a big deal about it,

477
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
but several games in the initial batch, such as Donkey Kong and Super Mario Brothers,

478
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
are not two-player simultaneous.

479
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And Bobby Blackwolf points out, hence controller sharing, I mean, Zelda's in the list.

480
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Help me get through this boss.

481
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah, I mean, that would be kind of fun that you can kind of pass the controller.

482
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You can kind of do that on PlayStation 4 right now.

483
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And that's something that you can only do with PlayStation Plus.

484
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I think you can watch for free, but to actually take the controller requires PlayStation Plus.

485
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And I've done that before.

486
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I think that's how I played Monster Hunter, was I was like,

487
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
well, I don't really want to, I want to see if I like this first.

488
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So a friend of mine fired it up, and I was able to take over his game for a little bit,

489
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
see how I liked it.

490
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So.

491
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But I mean, I don't know.

492
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Games from 1987 and so forth aren't maybe the same Try Before You Buy thing,

493
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
but I still think that's, I think, I think when it comes to streaming,

494
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
like, I'm just thinking about, like, I've been on a little break from streaming for a little bit

495
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
because I've had other projects going on.

496
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But when I do come back to streaming, and I will,

497
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
you know, I've been doing a lot of streaming, so like my buddy Delvin,

498
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and I'm like, oh my God, there's like so much potential here to do like co-streaming

499
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
in a game like Super Mario Brothers 3 that was like, that was like the game to play.

500
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You know, I remember going over to a friend's house and having to sleep over

501
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and we would stay up until like four in the morning playing Super Mario Brothers 3

502
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and passing the controller or, you know, and doing the fighting on the square

503
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and like all that stuff, trying to beat the hard levels.

504
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You know, now it's like, oh, cool, I can do that streaming,

505
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
but like across a great distance, like I'm, I'm like so jazzed about that.

506
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah, hopefully Nintendo, hopefully Nintendo doesn't pull a YouTube

507
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and decide that they're going to copyright strike everybody

508
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
that's not part of their partner's program.

509
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That's a whole nother problem, I guess, but so far they haven't,

510
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
at least with just, oh, just with TV, good Lord.

511
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I went really old school for a minute there.

512
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Twitch TV, they haven't so far, and maybe it's something about the live versus recorded.

513
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm not sure they can in the same way because it's live versus recorded.

514
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That does change a lot.

515
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Look at Twitch's policy on the music streaming.

516
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
When you play music during a stream, if it's copyright music, you can play it live,

517
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
but it'll be muted on your broadcast after the fact

518
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
because it's the whole live versus recorded.

519
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So I'm not sure that Nintendo could do anything about live.

520
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I guess I should try to be hopeful, but I'm just not expecting much from Nintendo.

521
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So we'll just leave it at that.

522
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah. All right.

523
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's, ooh, a lot to digest there.

524
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So we're going to hear more at E3, right?

525
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
We're going to hear the other 10, the back 10 at E3?

526
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
All right, I mean.

527
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But like, okay, let's like, sorry.

528
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
No, it's fine.

529
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's a big topic.

530
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So then why even put out NES Classic Games

531
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
if we're going to have the NES Classic Edition coming back out on June 29th?

532
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I mean, wouldn't that drive away sales from the NES Classic Edition

533
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
if I can just pay $20 and get access to all these different games?

534
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I mean, that's the argument you guys were making earlier.

535
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Well, this is the way I'm going to get to that stuff,

536
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
so wouldn't that be detrimental to their service?

537
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Perhaps. There's another factor at play,

538
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and that is that Nintendo fans will probably collect a lot of it.

539
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But I am kind of sitting here going,

540
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
do I really need an NES Classic, especially with this coming out soon?

541
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
One thing to consider, though, is that this won't be around forever,

542
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and we're going to have another example of that later on in the stories,

543
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
how games can kind of come and go like that,

544
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
so this won't necessarily be around forever.

545
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But the NES Classic is something that will.

546
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It is a piece of hardware that will be around forever,

547
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
but will it play on televisions that they make in 50 years?

548
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Probably not.

549
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
There will probably be a new standard besides HDMI then at that point,

550
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
so you have to get an old-ass converter or something.

551
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't know. I don't know.

552
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But anyway, let's see.

553
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Going in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

554
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Bobby Blackwell says,

555
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There are people who want an NES Classic but don't want a Switch.

556
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
My stepmom-in-law would never get a Switch,

557
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
but she loves the NES and SNES Classics.

558
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So maybe it's a very particular audience

559
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
that wants to do the retro stuff they remember as a kid,

560
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but they don't really play stuff now.

561
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There is definitely an audience for that,

562
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
but I kind of think the response to these systems

563
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
has been much larger than that.

564
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The people buying the Atari flashbacks, the Intellivisions,

565
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
those things may be a little more what I mentioned a minute ago,

566
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and your few collectors here and there too.

567
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But NES Classics, SNES Classics have been much bigger than that.

568
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I just think they're leaving money on the table.

569
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
They could easily just sell it and...

570
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And at the end of the day,

571
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
this is where your frustration comes from the most, right?

572
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You view this as Nintendo leaving money on the table.

573
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah, because, like, just sell your damn shit.

574
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Why do I have to jump through all these hoops?

575
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Like, seriously, to get an SNES Classic,

576
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I can't find them in stores.

577
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm not gonna pay a scalper for this shit.

578
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Like, why are you making it so hard for me to give you money

579
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
for this stuff that I want, and why does it have to be...

580
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I don't want my virtual console games, if you will,

581
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
to be on a hardware system that's attached to my TV.

582
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Why can't I put them on the Switch to take it with me if I want to?

583
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Why are you making this so fucking hard is the problem.

584
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But as far as, like, SNES Classics aren't hard to find now,

585
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and soon NES Classics, that'll be resolved too.

586
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I hope those NES Classics, since we're talking about this,

587
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
don't require an online connection to play them,

588
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
because that's gonna be a fucking annoying piece of shit

589
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
if I have to be always connected to the internet.

590
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Why would they?

591
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because it's an online service.

592
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Because it's streaming.

593
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Oh, you mean the Switch?

594
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You're switching topics on me.

595
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm talking about the NES Classic hardware thing.

596
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
No, I'm talking about the Switch now.

597
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So I hope that's not gonna be a situation.

598
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Hopefully they're smart enough to avoid that.

599
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Because the Switch's biggest thing is the whole, like,

600
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
click, pick it up and go.

601
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't see Nintendo making a move like that.

602
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I mean, for multiplayer, I mean, duh,

603
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
yes, you're gonna have to be online for any of that.

604
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Maybe if there's leaderboards and stuff,

605
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
maybe there'll be some type of online connection for integrity.

606
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But as far as, like, being able to pick it up

607
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and take it on the go,

608
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
especially when you look at other markets like Japan,

609
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
where picking it up and taking it on the go on your commute

610
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
or something is actually kind of a big deal,

611
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I don't see them chaining it to online

612
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
in the sense that, like, playing Diablo on PC is chained online.

613
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
All right. Well, I hope that's the case.

614
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Yeah. All right.

615
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Anyway, let's move on.

616
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I know we could probably fill three hours just talking about this,

617
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
but there's actually been quite a bit of other gaming news this week,

618
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and we will get into that.

619
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But I want to get into how was your gaming week

620
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and what types of video games have you been playing this week?

621
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

622
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It was all right. I played more Mario Odyssey,

623
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
so I'm quite a ways through that.

624
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And then I actually did try out a little bit of...

625
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I can't help but laugh that...

626
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And maybe some of the Nintendo fans can kind of have a Google at this, too,

627
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
is that after you've just read the book at Nintendo,

628
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
how was your gaming week?

629
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I played Mario Odyssey.

630
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I just... I love it.

631
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's not a read.

632
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Is anybody listening to my actual argument?

633
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Like, I don't understand why this is confusing to anybody.

634
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
My question...

635
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like, my whole argument is that I can't give Nintendo money.

636
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
What is so confusing about this?

637
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
All right. We'll leave it at that.

638
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't understand why people are so confused or think it's funny.

639
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm saying I want to pay them more for more of their services,

640
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
but they're not selling those services,

641
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
so I can't purchase them.

642
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'll let you have the final word at that.

643
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
There it is.

644
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Anyways, so I did try a little bit of Minecraft on the Switch,

645
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and well, it's Minecraft on the Switch.

646
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I was surprised with their...

647
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Like, it doesn't seem like it's as updated as the other stuff,

648
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
but I know that they have more updates coming,

649
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
so I'll just wait for them to catch up on that,

650
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but it's still fun.

651
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And then, um...

652
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
What else?

653
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Um...

654
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Pokemon Go a little bit.

655
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm playing that.

656
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And...

657
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
A little bit of StepMania, actually.

658
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And, of course, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.

659
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Um, StepMania more so,

660
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm actually looking at, um,

661
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
more of converting my cabinet over to a StepMania cabinet now.

662
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So I did purchase a new J-Pack,

663
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
because I had to replace the one in my candy cab

664
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
to have that working, because I guess it died.

665
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It just doesn't display anything anymore,

666
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
but I know the display works.

667
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's just not working with the, um, J-Pack.

668
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So I bought two to replace that.

669
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
One to replace the one that's in there,

670
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and one for the Dance Dance Revolution machine.

671
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And then eventually, um...

672
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Whenever I finally decide to do that,

673
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
then I'll buy the light board for the, um,

674
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Dance Dance Revolution machine.

675
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I think they call it a mini-made or something like that.

676
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's basically to hook up the lighting to StepMania.

677
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So I'll eventually get to that.

678
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I've been trying to find a small computer to go in there.

679
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm looking for maybe, like, either, like, a NUC, um,

680
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
or, like, some micro-ITX system or something to build in there,

681
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
because I wanted it to be really small.

682
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Ideally, if I could swing it,

683
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I want to actually have it where it's both the arcade cabinet

684
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and the StepMania machine at one time,

685
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
so I can flip between the two.

686
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So I'm going to see if there's a way to rig that.

687
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I think with my setup, because I actually do have...

688
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It's an LCD monitor in there,

689
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
so it runs through a converter anyways.

690
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So, which makes it nice,

691
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
because then I don't have to worry about an arcade VGA card

692
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
or anything like that.

693
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Um, it's all HD, so I can do all that.

694
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But, um, if I have a way I can switch between the two,

695
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
that would be nice,

696
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
because I don't want to, like, completely modify everything

697
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
if I want to sell it down the road or, you know,

698
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
want to downgrade to a different mix or something like that.

699
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I want it to be flexible in that sense, so we'll see.

700
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That's it.

701
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That's it.

702
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Um, my gaming week.

703
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Um, actually, not a lot for me to talk about.

704
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I've been working on some other projects

705
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
that have nothing to do with video games or podcasts,

706
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
so I've been really busy,

707
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
so I haven't had a lot of time to game.

708
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But I still have been doing progress on Diablo III,

709
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and I was playing that with Grandpa from...

710
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Well, I would say Grandpa from Hoard House,

711
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
but he's also Captain Matt on Starboard Power Coupling.

712
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Uh, I've been playing a little bit with him online,

713
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
because I finally convinced him, I was like,

714
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
you should roll a Seasons character, and he did,

715
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and I guess he found some really high-level players

716
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
to, like, really carry him.

717
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So now he's kind of carrying me a little bit,

718
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
because his Paragon level's, like, through the roof for the season.

719
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So he's been helping me out.

720
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm up to, um, Paragon 310, I think,

721
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
as a last check now for the season.

722
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So, um, you know, still working through that.

723
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And, uh, yeah.

724
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Uh, honestly, besides Diablo,

725
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I played a little bit on Switch this week,

726
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
just, you know, because it's the nice little console

727
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I can kind of pick up and, uh, take into bed with me.

728
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Uh, but, um, that's, that's really it.

729
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I, I don't know if I ever talked about this game at length on the, uh, show,

730
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
but I got this, um, reimagining, if you will, of Lode Runner.

731
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's the L-O-D-E Runner, you know, the classic game.

732
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
They have, like, a new Lode Runner on Nintendo Switch.

733
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And the cool thing about it is that it has, like,

734
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
user-made levels that you can, uh, do and put online.

735
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And you can also redo the sprites in the game.

736
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And so, like, people have put up these sprites

737
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
where you can kind of turn the main little hero character

738
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
into, like, Samus and things like that.

739
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
So it's some neat little things.

740
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Um, I, I don't think it's quite as,

741
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I mean, like, if you've not seen this,

742
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
you, uh, dial back your expectations a little bit

743
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
because you are kind of confined, you know,

744
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
to, to what all you can do in these levels and things.

745
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's not like Mario Maker by any means.

746
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I mean, Lode Runner back in the day was a very, very simple game.

747
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But it is still kind of cool that you can, you know,

748
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
kind of have this functionality, uh, in a Switch game right now.

749
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
On a, you know, what I think was $10, $15 download title.

750
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So, and I think it's also cool that they have

751
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
some of the retro levels in there, too.

752
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Uh, so they can do, like, some kind of, like,

753
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
sprite switch-ups and they, they let you do some of the retro levels.

754
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So that's pretty fun, too.

755
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So they throw on, like, some online leaderboards

756
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and some other stuff.

757
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So if you remember that game, uh, from, you know,

758
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
way back in the day, uh, fondly like I do,

759
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
then that's, that's something that might be worth

760
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
a little bit of your time, is that new, uh, Lode Runner re-imagining.

761
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I can't remember the full name of it.

762
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Lode Runner Reloaded or something like that?

763
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I don't know what it is.

764
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's the Lode Runner, but it's on the, uh, Nintendo Switch.

765
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And that's one of those things where I can play that game

766
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
for, like, 30 seconds.

767
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You know, I, it's, it's a little, like, bite-sized game.

768
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Maybe not 30 seconds, but, like, 5 minutes.

769
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You know, get through one level and then,

770
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
yay, I did something, I feel accomplished.

771
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So, um, outside of that, uh, Pokemon Go,

772
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
tiny bit of Ingress, but not a lot.

773
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Like, really, when I've been gaming on the phone,

774
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
it's been a lot more Pokemon Go.

775
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm really close to level 37.

776
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I've been trying to get those new shinies

777
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and not having a lot of luck, and it's really pissing me off

778
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
because, like, everybody else I know has those new shinies.

779
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's like, ah.

780
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
What new shinies?

781
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Uh, Makahita, the little, little guy that looks like King Hippo.

782
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
That guy.

783
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh.

784
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And...

785
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Were there shinies in those?

786
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
There are now.

787
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
They started it with the fighting event,

788
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
because they, they've been...

789
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Oh, I caught so many of those.

790
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yeah, that's why.

791
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I haven't even recycled any that...

792
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
There's, there's been a fighting event going on.

793
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Right, yeah, I know that.

794
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
No, the system will stop you.

795
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The system will warn you if you're gonna recycle a shiny.

796
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Just, like, if you try to do a favorite or something like that

797
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
or a legendary.

798
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Uh, so you, you can't accidentally throw one of those away.

799
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Uh, and then it's that and the little, the little monkey fighting guy

800
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
is also, um, a shiny right now.

801
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The Manky?

802
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
No, not Manky.

803
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The other one from Gen 3.

804
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Med, Med, Medi, Medi, Meditite?

805
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Meditate?

806
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Meditate?

807
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Something like that?

808
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I think I know which one you're talking about.

809
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah.

810
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Thank you.

811
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Act F says Meditite is the one that has it.

812
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So, yeah, but sadly I can't find those, uh,

813
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I can't find those shinies.

814
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's, it's extraordinarily frustrating.

815
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And I still can't catch a Latias either,

816
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
which they just flipped Latios for Latias.

817
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And, uh, I, I did a triple raid the other day.

818
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
We did three back to back.

819
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Couldn't catch one of them.

820
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Ugh.

821
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
That was frustrating.

822
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And then just because I've been busy with other stuff,

823
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I haven't been doing Pokemon raid as much.

824
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I have a frickin' EX pass for tomorrow at, like, 12 o'clock.

825
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But it's like, uh, I have this thing called work

826
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and I gotta kinda do that.

827
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Uh, I know that's lunchtime, but, like,

828
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I gotta get all the way to the park and back.

829
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's, like, I don't know about that.

830
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So, that was weird that they started doing EX raids on Monday,

831
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
but, anyway.

832
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I guess maybe they thought they wanted to mix it up a little bit

833
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
because, um, some people work on Saturday and Sunday,

834
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
so maybe they're thinking to mix it up a little bit,

835
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
but, I don't know, I find it a little bit irritating.

836
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

837
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
As far as housekeeping goes, I don't have a lot for you guys

838
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
because we should be here live pretty much every week,

839
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
pretty consistently.

840
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
We should be here Memorial Day weekend.

841
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't see us taking that weekend off.

842
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'll check with the co-host, make sure nothing's going on.

843
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But the next show we would have off would be June 24th.

844
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'll be out of town on June 24th, so.

845
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Otherwise, follow us on Twitter for all latest updates.

846
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

847
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Let's get into gaming news, Loki.

848
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So, Microsoft has offered gift, or gaming,

849
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
or you can actually gift games to other people.

850
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So it's like the first modern console to actually offer that.

851
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Um, of course, you know, that's been something that's been available on,

852
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
you know, Steam for the longest time.

853
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But now you can actually do that on the Xbox One as well.

854
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Um, so that's kind of cool.

855
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And there are a few restrictions.

856
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They said, um, gifting full-price games is unlimited.

857
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And only two discounted games can be gifted within a 14-day period.

858
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And up to ten overall.

859
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So, um, the games also have to be redeemed in the country that they were purchased in.

860
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's kind of cool that they offer that.

861
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Um, my worry, though, with Microsoft at least,

862
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
is, you know, you remember people were hacking,

863
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
and I guess that's more EA, though,

864
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
but people were hacking, you know, Microsoft accounts and stuff

865
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
to basically buy those, uh, card packs and stuff like that.

866
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So, what's to stop somebody from, like, you know,

867
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
hacking your account to buy some games for themselves and gift them?

868
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Well, but then it would be very obvious whose account they went to,

869
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and that would be a whole, uh, very easily traceable, I think, Loki.

870
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I guess, but...

871
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And you could make that same argument about, like, Steam today,

872
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and I don't think that's happening a lot a lot, at least nobody I know.

873
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
That'd be my only concern, but other than that, I mean, yeah, that's cool.

874
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I wish all of them offered that kind of service, but...

875
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

876
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm reading your comments a lot tonight, Bobby.

877
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I think he's catching up on being gone for a few weeks.

878
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Uh, Bobby says, I've gifted Xbox One games.

879
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I bought the digital code from Amazon and sent it.

880
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I suppose that's an option.

881
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
That is absolutely...

882
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Guess what? That trick also works on, like, PlayStation 4 cards,

883
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
uh, and, like, Nintendo.

884
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
You know, with Amazon, you can actually just ship a physical game

885
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
to somebody else's house and say it's a gift,

886
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and you did it all digitally.

887
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's not instantaneous.

888
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And other companies, I should say, not just Amazon,

889
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
but other companies, too, because not everything has to be Amazon.

890
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Can you do that, like, was it like the Amazon,

891
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
was it Amazon Now is what they call that?

892
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You know, where you, like...

893
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Oh, yeah, where they come to your house in, like, two hours?

894
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah, can you, like, ship that to somebody and then instantly...

895
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Um, I don't know if you can do it to somebody else. I haven't tried.

896
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I have used that service for myself,

897
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and I know you can get video games, like, day of release and stuff.

898
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You can get video games through that.

899
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Um, but, uh, I've never tried to send it to somebody else.

900
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But I've used regular Amazon to send regular stuff to somebody else.

901
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I sent, like, when we had, at my old company, we had Boss's Day,

902
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
but my boss was in the Los Angeles area at the time,

903
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
so we sent something to the admin assistant in the L.A. office

904
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
through Amazon and put the note,

905
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Happy Boss's Day, to our boss at the time.

906
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So you can do that.

907
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's really easy when you use one of those gift registries,

908
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
because shout-out to Mel B, a friend of the show,

909
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and his wife, also, Mel, because they had a baby.

910
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And I don't know, I don't remember if we called that out last week or the week before,

911
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
but I'll shout it out every week, because I love those guys.

912
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I love that kid, so props to them.

913
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But they did a gift registry thing, and I was able to ship my gift,

914
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
just, oh, click that, buy, goes right to their house.

915
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Nice.

916
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah, anyway.

917
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Let's see.

918
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Chat over at live.vog network.com, Bobby Blackwell says,

919
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
My reading registry was on Amazon.

920
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
People send us stuff from it a lot.

921
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Let's see, Sia Tabiri says,

922
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
My uncle gave me the Sam and Max games for PC the same way.

923
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
There's that, too.

924
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
All right.

925
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Anyway, so game gifting, that's the thing you can do on Xbox One.

926
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So now can I put my wish list up on, like, my,

927
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
why do I keep going to Justin TV?

928
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Like, my brain is stuck in 2007 tonight.

929
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I could put my wish list up on Twitch TV,

930
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and you could just go buy me games to stream right there.

931
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That would be pretty cool. I'd be into that.

932
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
All right, anyway.

933
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I guess that's what people already do, anyway, through, like, Amazon.

934
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But I was thinking it would be even more direct with an Xbox One list.

935
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
All right.

936
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Well, anyhow, it looks like there could be a spoiler alert

937
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
for types of video games that you might digitally buy someone on the Xbox One.

938
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
This coming year,

939
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Walmart Canada unleashed a whole lot onto their websites

940
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
for unannounced games for their pre-order listings.

941
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Some of these games are things that we kind of knew were coming,

942
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
such as Dragon Quest II, which I think is Builders II.

943
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Why would it be the original Dragon, why would that be Dragon Quest Builders II?

944
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Unless there's something, I don't know.

945
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Let's see, what else in here do we already know about?

946
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
A new Assassin's Creed game. We knew that was happening, right?

947
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
What? I thought they were taking a year off, though.

948
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Well, most things in this list are things that, like,

949
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
of course they're going to happen at some point.

950
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Maybe they weren't. Maybe that was another year, though.

951
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Just Cause 4.

952
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Forza Horizon 5 is on this list,

953
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
but that's also a little weird because wouldn't the next game be Forza Horizon 4?

954
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So, hmm, that was on the list.

955
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Lego DC Villains, now that's a pretty specific call-out on that list.

956
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Borderlands 3, which tons of people have been speculating for this year.

957
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Anyway, it's about time.

958
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Rage 2, which Bethesda's been...

959
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Well, that, I think, is going to be announced very soon.

960
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Well, Bethesda's been having a little fun with this leak,

961
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
because they went to Twitter and started putting pink graffiti all over this

962
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and started doing a little, like,

963
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Hey, Walmart Canada, you missed some things, and all this stuff.

964
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But, like, the fact that that official Twitter account

965
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
then proceeded to clear all the other tweets off the timeline,

966
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
except for that, is a little bit like...

967
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Well, there's another countdown tweet or something that they have, too,

968
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
so that's going to be announced in a few days, I think.

969
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah. So, anyway, this was all there.

970
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Some folks thinking, why would Forza Horizon be happening so soon?

971
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Because, supposedly, the Forza Horizon studio is said to be working on Fable 4.

972
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
No reason they didn't send it off to yet another studio.

973
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
They didn't pass off Horizon to somebody else to just make a new game in 3's engine.

974
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You know?

975
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And I'm a sucker for that series. I'll probably buy it.

976
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Doesn't really matter who makes it.

977
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Is it going to have the kick-ass soundtrack?

978
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Is it the same, like, awesome graphics and arcade gameplay and all that?

979
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I'll probably buy it. It's going to be very hard to miss that.

980
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'll get it on PC.

981
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yeah. And Bobby Blackwolf points out, studios do work on multiple games at a time.

982
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That is true. Studios are capable of working on more than one game at a time.

983
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It does happen.

984
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So, yeah, Dragon Quest 2, again, also called out as weird.

985
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It could be Heroes 2. I forgot about that.

986
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It could be Heroes 2, Builders 2, which was already confirmed in a Nintendo Switch thing, right?

987
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Because they put out Builders 1 on Switch and they confirmed Builders 2 is coming to Switch, right?

988
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I don't remember.

989
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I feel like that's a thing they did.

990
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And then it could be Dragon Quest 11.

991
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But, yeah, anyway.

992
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So there you go.

993
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Some lists from Walmart Canada.

994
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
There were also some games that we knew about.

995
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Metroid Prime 4, Beyond Good and Evil 2, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which maybe indicates it is this year.

996
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Who knows?

997
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So what do you think?

998
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Something to this?

999
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Is there any kind of app where they're filling up their database to get those pre-orders because GameStop would let you pre-order a PlayStation 5 today if you want?

1000
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Well, no.

1001
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I don't think that they're just filling up their database with bogus information.

1002
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I think that they probably have...

1003
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Maybe they're doing planning for fourth quarter stuff and so they're adding stuff that they probably weren't supposed to be adding stuff to the database or weren't supposed to be making it public.

1004
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So probably some of it's legit, but it's...

1005
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
You have limited insight from your past experience in the distribution world.

1006
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Now, granted, I know you never did Walmart, but would you guys get titles?

1007
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You did because that's when the whole Katamari shit happened.

1008
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yes, we know when stuff's coming out well before it comes out.

1009
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Usually they could have...

1010
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Which for those that are newer to the show, one of the points when this show was on all the blogs is when we had a little insider information that there was a game called Beautiful Katamari coming out.

1011
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
On the 360.

1012
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And it hadn't been reported anywhere else yet.

1013
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And it caused some headaches.

1014
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It caused some headaches.

1015
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
That's in the past.

1016
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It is in the past.

1017
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm free to talk about whatever now because I don't know shit.

1018
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Yeah, you can talk about shit. You can talk about whatever you want now.

1019
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But no, so they had...

1020
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
There could be different planning things.

1021
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I'm trying to think. I know they do.

1022
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
There's a couple different events that go on throughout the early part of the year before E3 usually.

1023
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
There's...

1024
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh, what's the PlayStation one?

1025
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
There's the PlayStation 1 destination PlayStation.

1026
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And then there's a Microsoft event that they hold as well.

1027
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And that's more of a retail partner event that they do to kind of plan strategies, work out deals for different incentives and stuff like that.

1028
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
That's where you get your pre-order bonus stuff worked out and stuff.

1029
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So it could be that some information that they got from one of those.

1030
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
They may have had like, okay, here's our roadmap for 2018 or whatever.

1031
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And it had some titles on it.

1032
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
They may not have been given the full details of when stuff's coming out.

1033
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
But they had a list and so someone jumped the gun and put all that in their database so that they could, I don't know, do something.

1034
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And unfortunately, usually they get called out on it and they have to pull it back and someone gets in trouble.

1035
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So it's likely that that's what the case is.

1036
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It's something like that where here's the stuff that we have coming and maybe they put it in the system.

1037
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Typically, they won't just like put things that are complete rumor and speculation in there.

1038
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Not to say it's impossible, though.

1039
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I'm looking at some of the funny tweets that happened as a response to this.

1040
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Somebody had tweeted one of the guys that's on the team that makes Doom with Pete, where's the next Doom?

1041
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And he responded, go buy a Magic 8-Ball at Walmart and ask it.

1042
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So I think some people in the industry had their feathers a little ruffled with this information.

1043
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Let me ask this question.

1044
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I'm going to do a little 180 on this story a little bit, but I want to open this up to chat as well.

1045
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I want your thoughts on this.

1046
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And not just Bobby.

1047
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I want all your thoughts.

1048
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
We love Bobby, but I've been reading him a lot tonight.

1049
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
All you guys, I want to know your thoughts on this.

1050
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Do we still need to have these types of secrets in the industry?

1051
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Why is the game industry so fucking secretive?

1052
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Because they don't want to spoil their announcements.

1053
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
But what's the big deal?

1054
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The movie industry.

1055
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I mean, the game industry is not what it was all these years ago, you know, and so forth.

1056
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And yes, I also understand it makes years upon years upon years to make a game.

1057
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I get that.

1058
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But we know what Marvel Disney films are coming out for the next three years.

1059
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
We know that already.

1060
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So, what's the big fucking deal if we know, like, Square Enix, I'll pick on them for no good reason.

1061
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
What's the problem if we know their trajectory for the next three years?

1062
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Well, we do for some of it.

1063
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I mean, we know that some stuff's coming.

1064
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
But thankfully, unlike, you know, movies, they don't tend to delay movies a ton.

1065
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Whereas games just keep on rolling, keep on coming.

1066
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Like, when the fuck is Crackdown coming down?

1067
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
They move movies around all the time.

1068
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I understand that.

1069
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
That's an art in itself, is the art of the release date and predicting box office and all that.

1070
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And how one movie moving will have a snowball effect on everything else.

1071
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I don't know.

1072
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I think that they want to keep some stuff as a surprise.

1073
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And, you know, that way competition can have as little time as possible to react to things.

1074
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I mean, I don't know.

1075
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Why do they do anything, honestly?

1076
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
The YYR in chat says, if you announce a game too early, how are you going to build hype?

1077
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It stalls and sputters.

1078
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Well, but the movie industry's doing it.

1079
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
They do it with posters hung up at the movie theater.

1080
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
They do it with, you know, little stills, production stills that come out from the set.

1081
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And, oh my gosh, somebody snapped a picture of what Captain Marvel looks like because she was seen on set and all this stuff.

1082
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Like, that's kind of where that hype, interviews, things like that.

1083
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
The thing is, they don't want their, like, they're doing these announcements soon.

1084
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,000
They're doing these at E3, and they just don't want to have it spoiled already because it's supposed to be exciting.

1085
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
People get hyped up, like, oh my god, I didn't know that was coming, you know.

1086
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah, but if the trailer's really fun, like, let's say something like Rage 2, which maybe some people, if they're hearing that, are kind of going,

1087
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
okay, that makes sense, but maybe not something they would have predicted that Bethesda would have done.

1088
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Like, I think we talked lightly about what could be Bethesda's thing.

1089
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And if it's Rage 2, the only bummer about, I'm going to tell you the real bummer about Rage 2, though,

1090
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
is that means it's probably that and not Elder Scrolls 6, which was kind of like what I was trying to get hyped for this year.

1091
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
No, it's not. Rage 2 is not going to be their big game. Rage wasn't even a big game.

1092
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Rage is like, oh, it's supposed to be such a revolutionary engine, and everyone's like, yeah, but the game's not very good.

1093
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I don't know. I don't think that's going to be a big deal.

1094
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And Bobby Blackwell points out, again with a good comment, because needling Loki tonight, Ready Player One was delayed.

1095
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It was, but it was so worth it.

1096
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And that happens to some video games, too, right?

1097
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Like, I think we've gotten to the point where, like, Nintendo delays a game and we're like, alright, well, just make it good.

1098
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Right? Zelda Breath of the Wild, case in point.

1099
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
That game got delayed so they could put it on the Switch as well, and anybody complaining about that now?

1100
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Nope, because that game is fucking fire, right?

1101
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And, you know, if this new Smash Brothers gets delayed so they can get it right, you think people,

1102
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
people will probably complain there's, you know, for a little bit, there's nothing out at Christmas,

1103
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
but at the same time, when that game comes out, all the complaining is going to stop.

1104
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yeah, you better stop complaining. You got, you got this generous offering of virtual, I mean, sorry, not virtual console games.

1105
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I thought we were done.

1106
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
We're never done. This is going to go on for months.

1107
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Next story, Loki.

1108
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Anyways, let's switch topics here.

1109
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I agree with Dr. C. Oh, here we go again. No, no, putting the break on.

1110
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I need, I need a little light or something. Well, that doesn't really work for a podcast.

1111
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Maybe I need a sound effect. I need something for when Loki starts that fucking, I need like a stop sound effect or something.

1112
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Is there like a funny sound effect of somebody going like, stop, or something?

1113
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
It's like me during the week with the kids.

1114
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Just stop. I don't care about whatever Power Rangers thing you're showing me.

1115
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It's like, I get it. Yes. There were different seasons. Yes.

1116
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
These Power Rangers was different. Yes, I get it. I've seen. Stop.

1117
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Like just trying to sit here. I have a headache because you kids just keep talking to me.

1118
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
All right. Star Trek, red alert sound.

1119
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Okay. That's the best suggestion I see so far. Chat like a little like that.

1120
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Like that is hilarious. Star Trek red alert sound. I'm going to see what I can do about that.

1121
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
All right. In the meantime, Loki is going to switch topics and we're going to talk about the PlayStation four.

1122
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So the PlayStation four, you may remember that they just did a release of the remastered version of Parappa the rapper and hackers gonna hack.

1123
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And so hackers discovered that, hey, guess what? That Parappa the rapper version that's on the PlayStation four.

1124
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Yeah, it's actually just running the 2006 PSP version through a PSP emulator.

1125
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And as a result, hackers have now jail who have jailbroken PlayStation fours are seeing what other games they can run through that emulator.

1126
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:47,000
So they've actually run games like Loco Roco, Potapon.

1127
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You know, some other it looks like.

1128
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah, it was a they're saying that maybe that they can do some homebrew products or projects with it, like him playing.

1129
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
There's a PSP HD or something like that.

1130
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:16,000
That's interesting. And so the one thing the emulator does do that's different than other things is it's possible to swap out original textures from the UMD version of the game with a higher resolution one.

1131
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
So that's why, despite the fact that the PSP version of Parappa the rapper looked different on the PSP, it was the older graphics.

1132
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The remastered version is more well, it's higher resolution graphics.

1133
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So that's interesting that they could do something like that.

1134
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Did they only look at Parappa or did they look at like Patapon because that was also on PSP and they also brought that to PlayStation four.

1135
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
So I'm sure the same party trick being used.

1136
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,000
No, they only looked at Parappa the rapper, they did get Patapon to run on that emulator.

1137
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So, uh huh.

1138
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It's interesting, but.

1139
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah, and they even have a screenshot that's showing, you know, Patapon on there.

1140
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,000
So it makes the question once again, it's like, OK, you have this emulator that's capable of running these PSP games.

1141
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Why can't they purchase these games?

1142
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Oh, I'm sorry. You can't because PlayStation now.

1143
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Yes.

1144
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Awesome.

1145
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It's not going to get me to stop there.

1146
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'm going to let him continue on this because it's Sony for a change.

1147
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So go ahead. Go ahead.

1148
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
No, that's all I had. I mean, it's just frustrating.

1149
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And actually, and to be fair, I actually kind of agree.

1150
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Like, you know, you can give Nintendo all that shit.

1151
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But hold up, because here is Sony like showing, look, we could do PSP on the PlayStation four,

1152
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
but we're only going to do it in these particular circumstances.

1153
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Like, to be fair, they need to get.

1154
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
But we've been giving this shit for forever for this.

1155
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
We know damn well the PlayStation four can run PS one and PS two games.

1156
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
They just don't want to let you.

1157
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Of course they can. A PSP can run PlayStation one games.

1158
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,000
They could probably take a PlayStation one game emulated through the PSP emulator

1159
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
and then run it through the PlayStation four.

1160
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Let's emulate the PSP, which is emulating the PlayStation one.

1161
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I'll press all the graphics.

1162
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
All right.

1163
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Let's move on and continue a discussion on Sony talking about what they have in plans for store for E3 this year.

1164
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It sounds like E3 for Sony might be a little bit different this year.

1165
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
How would you feel about a different tone for one of the big three press conferences this year?

1166
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Is the tone going to be backwards compatibility?

1167
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Because what's the tone going to be?

1168
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
What's the tonal shift going to be in here?

1169
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
More games that are going to announce it.

1170
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I don't know when they're coming out.

1171
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
They've had so many games they've announced.

1172
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Shut up.

1173
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Let me tell you more about what it is.

1174
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
All right.

1175
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
So you guys are going to be so mad you gave me that sound effect.

1176
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
All right.

1177
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So this was in the PlayStation blog cast.

1178
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And what happened is that Sony is taking kind of a different angle on how we're bringing it out

1179
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and trying to refresh and remake and reignite what used to be called a press conference for E3.

1180
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:09,000
So in this PlayStation blog cast, Sean Layden, of course the CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America,

1181
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:20,000
said that there will be deep dives into Death Stranding, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel's Spider-Man, and The Last of Us Part II.

1182
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
There will be no hardware announcement at E3 this year.

1183
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So those of you hoping for the PlayStation 5 this early, I think were...

1184
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
No.

1185
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
No, it was never going to happen this early.

1186
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Those of you that were hoping for the Vita 2.

1187
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
No.

1188
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Vita what?

1189
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah, exactly.

1190
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Exactly.

1191
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So how would you feel about maybe instead of like announcement, announcement, announcement, which was kind of like Sony's biggest year,

1192
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
maybe Sony's going to do a little bit more of a deep dive and spend more time with certain games,

1193
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
which it sounds to me if they're going to do a deep dive with Death...

1194
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I don't know why I keep using that term, but that's what comes to mind.

1195
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,000
If they're going to go further with Death Stranding, that tells me it's going to finally be some fucking playable footage.

1196
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So we know, what the fuck is this game?

1197
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Right?

1198
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Because that's the thing I've been reading this game for is that, okay, look, I get it.

1199
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
A plus cast, A plus talent.

1200
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Wow, it looks like a mindfuck. Cool.

1201
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Okay, yes.

1202
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Oh, pregnant man.

1203
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
This is crazy.

1204
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
What the fuck?

1205
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
You know, okay, where's the fucking game?

1206
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Right?

1207
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
The same thing I have with No Man's Sky.

1208
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I'd be fine with...

1209
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So it sounds like we'll get to see the fucking game this E3.

1210
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Some of these games, some of them I just don't really care about.

1211
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Some of them I just don't really care to see a deep dive in like Spider-Man.

1212
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I mean, we've seen enough deep dives in that already.

1213
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
There must be DLC or something happening for...

1214
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Well, Spider-Man's not out yet.

1215
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh, that's right.

1216
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
So that's coming out in September.

1217
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
That's one of the big games in the show.

1218
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
But still though, I've seen so much gameplay footage of it.

1219
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's like, I get it.

1220
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's a cool looking game, but do we really need this?

1221
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I mean, I guess they do because it's a first party title, so why not?

1222
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
But...

1223
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Last of Us Part II though, if that game is out this year, if that's Sony's big holiday release for this year,

1224
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
it totally makes sense where that's going to be their number one breadwinner at E3 this year.

1225
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's going to be Last of Us Part II for sure.

1226
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Because I'm sure a ton of people...

1227
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Death Stranding would be amazing.

1228
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
They're kind of both there, but Death Stranding, again, this is not going to be Death Stranding's first show at the rodeo.

1229
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I also understand it's not the first time for Last of Us Part II, but I feel like one of them has been teased...

1230
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Or the other zombie game that they had that who knows what it's called.

1231
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Was that the Ghost of Tsushima?

1232
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I don't remember which one that was.

1233
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
No, that was the Ghost of Tsushima.

1234
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That was...

1235
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Is it Days Gone?

1236
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1237
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
That was the one they showed twice last year, right?

1238
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
They were like, here it is.

1239
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And then they were like, here's the beginning.

1240
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
We're going to show more of Days Gone.

1241
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
It was like, okay, clearly something was deleted here.

1242
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Red Dead 2.

1243
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah, Red Dead 2 was deleted from this part of the presentation.

1244
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Anyway, also they do say that Sony is going to focus on third-party publishers and indie studios.

1245
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It will be June 11th at 6 o'clock, of course.

1246
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And everywhere where you watch these things like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1247
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Probably not Mixer.

1248
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
It's probably the one place you won't be able to see this is Mixer.

1249
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And I'm not shading Mixer.

1250
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It's just that Mixer is Microsoft's thing.

1251
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I would hope that they're doing something with VR.

1252
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I mean, can I get a new...

1253
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I think it would be great if you could watch the Sony thing in VR.

1254
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
That would be cool.

1255
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Since we got to go that one year, that one year we got to go see the press thing live.

1256
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
At least for me.

1257
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I got to see it that one year live.

1258
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And I don't even remember.

1259
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
What was the big thing?

1260
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Bobby, what was the thing they announced that year?

1261
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
We went to the PlayStation thing.

1262
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It was not the big year.

1263
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It was not that year where everybody's like scream-crying at Last of Us and Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Shenmue 3 and all that shit.

1264
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
It was not that year, but it was like the year before or the year after.

1265
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It was the year that they had Entwined was the very first thing they announced.

1266
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
That was the game that was like... I just remember being there for that.

1267
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Anyways, somebody can look at that.

1268
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Just tell me what year Entwined came out. That was the year we were there.

1269
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So anyway, the reason why I say that is that what you don't really get sitting at home watching it,

1270
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
at least when it was in that venue.

1271
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Now, they've moved venues since then.

1272
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,000
That was when it was at the old Olympic Coliseum, was this event.

1273
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And so it was like all around you.

1274
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
You had the trailer on the big screen, but if you looked to the left, you'd see stills.

1275
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
If you looked to the right, you'd see more stills.

1276
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
There'd be lasers, lights, all around for the ambiance.

1277
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And I think that would actually translate very well into VR.

1278
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
If Sony wanted to do a VR presentation.

1279
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But can they stream VR video?

1280
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
That would be pretty cool if they pulled that off.

1281
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Alright, Bobby says Far Cry 4 first gameplay, No Man's Sky's debut,

1282
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and Destiny launching on PlayStation 4 first. That was all 2014.

1283
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I think that was the last year I did E3. It was 2014.

1284
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
There it is. So I think a VR experience would be very cool.

1285
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yes, an Uncharted 4 closed out the show. Yes, I remember that now. I remember.

1286
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I remember.

1287
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade,

1288
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
use the passphrase, truck.

1289
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Alright, just another story for you, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

1290
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But Loki is going to start this off.

1291
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
So this isn't uncommon with different software companies and stuff like that.

1292
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:26,000
But Seem, they're basically having a bug bounty, offering white hat hackers

1293
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:35,000
to find vulnerabilities with the service, and offering payouts for those that can document that stuff.

1294
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
So it's interesting. Apparently, they're using the CVSS system,

1295
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:49,000
so the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, and based on the success the hackers have,

1296
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:58,000
they will be earning between $200 to up to $2,000 per each exploit that they can report on.

1297
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So I mean, it's interesting. It's nice to see that they're taking steps to try to improve security and stuff.

1298
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But yeah, it's not unheard of.

1299
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I mean, I know you don't go as into the weeds with hacking as to what it probably takes to do this stuff,

1300
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
but I'm kind of surprised you've never tried your hand at some of this stuff.

1301
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

1302
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
It's a little too hard mode, huh?

1303
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Yeah, I don't care. Why would I want to do that?

1304
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Well, it's nice to hear a little financial incentive for some of the folks that want to make sure your information is secure,

1305
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
and your games and all that, especially in this day and age where it seems like every other day

1306
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
some company's having a fucking breach of information, right?

1307
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And then the thing that really kills me is when the company that's supposed to hold all your information had a breach of information.

1308
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That was like Equifax, right?

1309
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Or yeah, or they were going to be like, oh, by the way, that breach is even bigger.

1310
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Oh, and by the way, that breach was even bigger.

1311
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Oh, did I mention it was even bigger?

1312
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
So it is kind of nice because Steam did have an issue, I still remember, a while ago.

1313
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Didn't they have a breach where you were getting pages that weren't your own and all this stuff?

1314
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That happened at the end of last year.

1315
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
That's more of a mistake than a breach.

1316
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Well, anyway, so it's nice to see that they are trying to take measures to prevent that

1317
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
and get some of the hackers to do some good things with their skills when it comes to hacking.

1318
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Skills that admittedly we do not have here at Orange Mountains Radio.

1319
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Nope.

1320
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But we do have the skills once a week to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that we want to talk about tonight.

1321
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Because you should be playing this game. It's the classic game of the week.

1322
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And once a week, excuse me, once a week, every week during the month, except the time she does peripherals,

1323
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Dark Soccer jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking this game out.

1324
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
But, well, Dark Soccer's not here tonight. She's hanging out with drag queens.

1325
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Choices.

1326
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
So, anyway, I'm going to be picking the classic game of the week tonight.

1327
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And I picked one that I hope you guys will enjoy.

1328
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Maybe some of you will recognize a port, a very infamous port of this game, just from the lovely opening tune.

1329
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Because the music in this game, when it finally got music, was so freaking good.

1330
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Because the port of SimCity on the Super Nintendo was so good.

1331
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And that's what I picked for the classic game of the week tonight is SimCity.

1332
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So, I do want to technically say SimCity was on a ton, the original SimCity was on, like, 20 different platforms.

1333
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Super Nintendo was one of them. It was probably the only, like, console.

1334
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Well, I don't know. The Game Boy Advance got it, I think.

1335
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But, like, SimCity goes all the way back to the Commodore 64.

1336
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
SimCity goes back to, like, PC DOS.

1337
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
SimCity was on the ZX Spectrum. It was, like, on every system at the time.

1338
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
So, but Super Nintendo was just one of the more memorable ones.

1339
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
And it makes for a better soundtrack to listen to in the background while I talk a little bit about SimCity.

1340
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Because, obviously, this was the game that started a series.

1341
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
This, I mean, SimCity is why we have The Sims today.

1342
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I mean, this is all, what it all comes from.

1343
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:16,000
And SimCity was so successful, we had, what, SimEarth, SimAnt, we got all the fucking SimTowers, SimTower, all that stuff.

1344
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Anyway, what is SimCity? What do you do in SimCity?

1345
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Well, SimCity, which was released in February of 1989, was, and I think the first version was Commodore 64, if I'm not mistaken.

1346
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I have to, yeah, the first version was the Commodore 64.

1347
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It was developed in 1985, but not published for another four years.

1348
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
So you know it's near and dear to my heart because it was a Commodore 64 game.

1349
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
So, in SimCity, of course, you're trying to build a city.

1350
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And it was different because it was a little more sandboxy.

1351
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You didn't really have a specific goal, like, you didn't, like, there was no win condition, per se.

1352
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
At least the goal wasn't to just destroy my city all the time with Godzilla.

1353
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And maybe that was your goal.

1354
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So, it depended.

1355
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I think when they finally put it on the Super Nintendo, it was like, oh, you get little rewards for being like a metropolis and things like that.

1356
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So they did try to put some goals and gamify it a little more.

1357
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But, in the original SimCity, it was just, you know, it was a little more of a sandbox.

1358
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
It was, you know, build this city up and manage it.

1359
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So, as you build your city, you can build power plants.

1360
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And probably the biggest, you know, element was that you could zone areas as commercial, industrial, or residential.

1361
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And you can add parks and things like that.

1362
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And you can even get in there and change the tax rate.

1363
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Make sure everything's getting power.

1364
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Build light rail, rail systems, as well as roads.

1365
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Other ways to enhance your cities.

1366
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So, as you do this, and probably why people love this game, is that you would actually see your city grow.

1367
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And that you would see little houses in your residential district.

1368
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And then those houses would turn into mid-rises, which would turn into high-rises.

1369
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And you would start to see your city get bigger and bigger.

1370
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And sometimes the commercial buildings would be churches or hospitals.

1371
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You don't really know what they are until they show up.

1372
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
And I think that was part of the fun of the game.

1373
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Well, I thought you could actually put down either fire departments or police.

1374
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Some of them, yeah.

1375
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Fire departments, police departments specifically were like special things.

1376
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,000
But I think when it came to things like hospitals and churches, at least in the first version of the game, you couldn't place those.

1377
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
They were just commercial things.

1378
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Got it.

1379
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Yeah, and sometimes a strip mall might show up. You just don't know.

1380
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So, anyway, the industrial areas, the more of them you have, the more pollution you get.

1381
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You have too much pollution, it keeps the residential people away.

1382
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
You keep the residential people away, then the commercial people don't want to develop.

1383
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So there's this interesting kind of like rock-paper-scissors thing that goes on in trying to build your city efficiently.

1384
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And everybody has their own way to build it.

1385
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,000
So, anyway, later on when they did this for the Super Nintendo, you got even more special shit.

1386
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You could do a mayor's mansion, you could do a casino.

1387
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
So the Super Nintendo kind of threw a Mario statue I think was there too.

1388
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
They threw some extra stuff in to kind of spice it up.

1389
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Especially because the Super Nintendo version wasn't until the mid-90s.

1390
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So this game was a few years old at that point.

1391
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
So they wanted to spice it up a little bit and give it that Nintendo touch.

1392
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:09,000
However, the big part of this game where people got really crazy with it is kind of where Loki's talking about.

1393
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
You might have disasters.

1394
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Your town could flood, you could have a tornado, there might be a fire or an earthquake or a monster attack.

1395
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Like Godzilla attacks your town.

1396
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Or a nuclear meltdown.

1397
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah, or a nuclear meltdown, which can happen to your power plant every so often.

1398
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I should also say with the monster attack in the Super Nintendo version again, what we're hearing in the background,

1399
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Bowser would be the monster that would attack your city.

1400
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So that was really cute, the way they incorporated all that.

1401
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
There were also scenarios that you could play.

1402
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And so that was a little more of the game where you had these goal-centered scenarios that were timed.

1403
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
So for example, I think they had a town that was just a road running through the town.

1404
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And your goal was to build up that town to 100,000 people in so much time.

1405
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Or there's a nuclear meltdown that's going to happen in this city and you've got to clean it all up.

1406
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Or Godzilla's about to attack Tokyo, which, yes, was one of the scenarios.

1407
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And you have to make sure your city recovers from that and so forth.

1408
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So it's kind of fun that they have those different scenarios.

1409
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:15,000
SimCity was made by Will Wright, infamous designer, and this is part of the reason why he's an infamous designer.

1410
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Where did he come up with the idea from?

1411
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It actually came from when he was working on the game Raid on Bungeling Bay.

1412
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I don't know if I'm saying that right.

1413
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I always say Bungeling Bay, even though it makes it sound like, you bungled up the bay again!

1414
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Caitlin, you bungled it up again!

1415
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Anyway, so Raid on Bungeling Bay was the game he was doing and he kind of found as he was making the game,

1416
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
the map editor was the best part.

1417
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And in fact, probably very few people remember Raid on Bungeling Bay.

1418
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I have no idea what that is.

1419
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It was on the NES, it was like a little shooter game, but you would fly down these little maps.

1420
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And so Will Wright had to make all those little cities that you were flying over.

1421
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So he was like, well this is the best part!

1422
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
So anyway, he developed this game and he made it on Commodore 64.

1423
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
It was done in 85, but it was not published until 1989.

1424
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
The original working title of the game was Micropolis.

1425
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Micropolis, I think is how you would say it.

1426
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Micropolis. It's micropolis, micropolis.

1427
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
The game could not be won or lost, which made it a little bit unique.

1428
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And game publishers for that reason didn't really care for it.

1429
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Finally, Broderbund to the rescue.

1430
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
That's right, the character behind such games as the Print Shop.

1431
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And publishing the Guardian Legend on the NES.

1432
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Broderbund saved the day and published the title when Will Wright proposed it.

1433
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And there you go, that was that.

1434
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:42,000
So SimCity then signed to Maxis to a distribution deal for both the initial games.

1435
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And then SimCity came out for Amiga, Macintosh, IBM, Commodore 64.

1436
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I mean, it was just everywhere is where it was.

1437
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Now it's on iOS too, if you want.

1438
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
So anyway, the Super Nintendo version, I gotta talk about that a little bit.

1439
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It had its own ideas. Bowser, of course, became Godzilla.

1440
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Once the city gets to 500,000 people, you get a Mario statue that you can put in the city.

1441
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
There's special buildings like casinos, large parks, amusement parks, expo centers.

1442
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Some of these came in the sequel, SimCity 2000.

1443
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
You can also do a bank, and that will allow you to take out a loan of $10,000.

1444
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But you have to pay it back before you can take out another loan.

1445
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
So that's kind of interesting, that was a little feature there.

1446
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
So anyway, it ended up being a million seller, and it was Nintendo's player's choice.

1447
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Also cute about this, the doctor that would help you through the game was named Dr. Wright.

1448
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
As a little bit of a nod to Will Wright.

1449
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So that's why he's named Dr. Wright, is after the creator of the game.

1450
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
So, pretty neat.

1451
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
If you want to check out Micropolis, you can do that.

1452
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Because in January 2008, the source code was released under the free GPL3 license.

1453
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So, yeah, that's pretty cool.

1454
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
So if you want to see the Micropolis source code, it's already been translated to C++ and so forth.

1455
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So, Micropolis, you can pretty much do whatever you want, but you can't call it SimCity because of EA's trademarks.

1456
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Because what I'm not going to talk about is what happened to SimCity years later.

1457
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
We're going to just focus on the original.

1458
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
No one wants to remember that.

1459
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Keep a memory of the good times.

1460
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
This game won awards upon awards upon awards.

1461
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Best entertainment, best educational, best simulation.

1462
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
This game won a shit ton of awards because, I mean, it left a legacy.

1463
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Here you go. Do you want to know what Sim games came out after SimCity?

1464
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
You ready?

1465
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Sure.

1466
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
See if you can name them all.

1467
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:47,000
SimEarth, SimFarm, SimTown, SimCopter, SimAnt, SimLife, SimIsle, SimTower, SimPark, SimSafari, Streets of SimCity, and The Sims.

1468
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
By the way, did you know they made a Simsville and a SimMars that they never released?

1469
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
There was a lot of fucking Sims.

1470
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And probably my favorite in that entire list is SimAnt, which will have to be a classic game of the week another week.

1471
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Because I could talk another 15 minutes about SimAnt.

1472
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I should note SimEarth, though, was probably the biggest little spin-off game that they had that was kind of like the next one that happened.

1473
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Not to be confused with the direct sequels, but SimEarth was kind of like the next one that happened.

1474
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And SimEarth, they also did on Super Nintendo at one point.

1475
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
And it was really complicated.

1476
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I think that's why it probably didn't do as well, because it was a lot harder to understand.

1477
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
You know what I mean? These games were really crazy.

1478
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Anyway, I should talk about some sequels that came out after SimCity.

1479
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:48,000
There was SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4, which had an expansion called Rush Hour, and then the reboot in 2013 that we don't talk about.

1480
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Because EA, once again, and as we talk about EA's bad decisions in 2018, EA made a very bad decision in 2013 that I believe caused Maxis to go under, if I'm not mistaken.

1481
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
If I'm not mistaken, right?

1482
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Yes.

1483
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yeah, because that's what EA has done. Anyway.

1484
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:14,000
But SimCity, the original game, has left quite its legacy on gaming and was absolutely noteworthy to bring up tonight on the show.

1485
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
So there it is, your classic game of the week, SimCity.

1486
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:31,000
However, I could really, really, really not stop talking about this until I talk about the port of SimCity that was released on CD-ROM in 1994 by Interplay Productions.

1487
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:39,000
When they upped it to 256 color graphics, new music and sound effects, and full motion video.

1488
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:48,000
That's right. Full motion. Horrible, horrible full motion video interspersed in for when certain things would happen to your town.

1489
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And it was pretty ridiculous.

1490
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
We need to locate her someday.

1491
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Find the actual people that did some of the full motion videos and all that?

1492
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
SimCity Action News.

1493
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Let's see. For example, here's what happens if you build too many nuclear power plants.

1494
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Watch residential zoning two...

1495
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Uh oh. That was supposed to be from the enhanced CD-ROM. I don't know if that was...

1496
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Oh yeah, it's like a full motion video from the CD-ROM. Oh no, here it is, here it is. This is the video I was looking for.

1497
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:40,000
These full motion videos ran at like five frames a second.

1498
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Finally in the news, 90 year old Yancy Kornblatz was arrested last night for flashing for the 79th time.

1499
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Kornblatz told the court that he was going to retire, but decided to stick it out one more year.

1500
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,000
We've just received an emergency report that a serious meltdown has occurred at the SimCity nuclear power plant.

1501
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Plant may reach critical mass at any moment and explode.

1502
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Above all, do not panic. Repeat, do not panic. Stay calm.

1503
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Even though radiation may fear our flesh and turn us all into slipping slices of human spam, everything will be just peaking.

1504
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Do not panic.

1505
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
They've gotta have, I gotta imagine that...

1506
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Who is she?

1507
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:33,000
They have to have, like I bet if we find somehow, through the magic of eBay, a boxed copy of that, they've gotta have like an instruction manual.

1508
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
That has all the people in it.

1509
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

1510
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Just no one probably is like, who the fuck would want me to pick one?

1511
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I know, I'd send this email to somebody's agent and they'd be like, the fuck?

1512
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Who wants to talk about SimCity from 24 years ago?

1513
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
God damn it, here at Orange Lounge Radio, we do.

1514
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
We're asking the hard hand questions here.

1515
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
We would record all of the bumpers.

1516
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Oh, SSJ100Matt thinks he has a name.

1517
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Because I feel, this has come up on OLR before, so somebody probably already did this research.

1518
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Oh my god, it is, this is it, this is the name.

1519
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
This is her, Stephanie Fargo.

1520
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Alright, yep, because she's got an actress, she's got one credit to her name.

1521
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And that is the SimCity enhanced CD-ROM as Carol Davenport, the SimAction news anchor.

1522
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
So we have a name, I'll do my best to track her down.

1523
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Thank you IMDB.

1524
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
She's gotta have a Twitter, everybody's got a Twitter, right?

1525
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Anyway, alright, thank you SSJ100Matt.

1526
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
SSJ100Matt said we already did this, we tracked this down a while ago, and that was as far as we got as we got a name.

1527
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So, I just, it's been 730 episodes y'all, I don't remember everything.

1528
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Alright, we're gonna take a break, but when we come back there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to look forward to, including rapid fire news.

1529
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
We're gonna talk about what's in stores this week.

1530
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Get to the mailbag, your emails, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we'll also get to the Skype line at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

1531
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
We'll get to all that and more when we come back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1532
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight, episode number 730 of our show, already in progress.

1533
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Myself and Loki here in studio with you, DarkSakura, she has the night off, she is visiting DragCon, not to be confused with DragGunCon,

1534
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:37,000
which is coming up over Labor Day weekend, where I will be in the Atlanta area, and I'm very much looking forward to that.

1535
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Anyhow, I think we're gonna get back into some rapid fire news at this point, so Loki, why don't you start us off?

1536
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Alright, so hey, Bloodstained's coming out sooner than you thought.

1537
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, which is actually an 8-bit spinoff of Bloodstained.

1538
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:59,000
But it's coming out May 24th on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Vita, Switch, and Steam.

1539
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And it's also very similar looking to Castlevania 3, they're even gonna have the ability to switch between characters as well,

1540
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
but it keeps that kind of retro NES art style to it.

1541
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So I'm looking forward to checking that out, because, yeah, looking forward to the actual main game too, eventually, whenever that comes out.

1542
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
But hey, this one's out in a couple weeks, so look for that.

1543
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:31,000
And then, you may remember, with the Switch coming out, they had different means to be able to play the Switch.

1544
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:38,000
One is tabletop mode, and it has a really janky-ass kickstand in the back that doesn't really cut it.

1545
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
And if you wanna charge while you're using that kickstand, well, you better just fucking forget it.

1546
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
So Nintendo's decided that, hey, let's go ahead and put out-

1547
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Loki, how else am I gonna play on the rooftop?

1548
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Well, the way I have to do it-

1549
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Remember the first Switch commercial? How else am I gonna play on the rooftop?

1550
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Yes. So, they have a new stand now that you can actually lean your Switch against that allows it to charge as well.

1551
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:14,000
So you can get that stand from Nintendo. It's an official adjustable charging stand for 20 bucks, or one of the many unofficial ones that are available now as well, which is what I'm using.

1552
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:23,000
And this doesn't actually- it doesn't look like it- it literally plugs into it, but I don't see that it includes another AC adapter plug or anything like that.

1553
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:28,000
I think it's just more of a moving the plug around.

1554
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:35,000
So it's kind of like a little piece of plastic, but that also kind of extends- moves the plug around a little bit to help you out, basically.

1555
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I don't know. I think I got my-

1556
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
How much do they want for it?

1557
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
20 bucks. Coming out July 13th if you're interested in that.

1558
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Alright. One of those games you might be playing in tabletop mode on your Switch is Runner 3.

1559
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
That is, of course, Bit.Trip Runner 3, but now I guess they just shortened it now. It's just Runner 3.

1560
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
So, for whatever reason, they've shortened the name of the series.

1561
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
The series is pretty fun. I remember the first game was good, and then that second game was out, like, everywhere.

1562
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
They had out, like, every system, and I think it was a giveaway game at one point on PlayStation Plus or one of those.

1563
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
But anyhow, there are going to be some characters that are going to show up in this game.

1564
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Some guest characters that I think are pretty interesting, including Eddie Riggs from Brutal Legend.

1565
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Kind of- kind of a throwback, because Brutal Legend, yeah, that was like a one and done kind of series there.

1566
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Shovel Knight will be a playable character in the game.

1567
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Practically in all the games now.

1568
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Yeah, that's pretty rad, though. But here's the other one that is crazy for a playable character.

1569
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Charles Martinet, the voice of Mario, will be a playable character.

1570
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not Charles Martinet voicing something? Not Mario?

1571
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,000
It's actually- actually Charles Martinet is the character, and you can even see the little-

1572
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
But he's not new to the series. He did the voicing in part two.

1573
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,000
So, kind of- kind of random, but hilarious, so that's pretty great.

1574
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Anyhow, obviously, of course, you know that Charles Martinet voices Mario, Luigi, Waluigi, Wario.

1575
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And he was the narrator, of course, in Bit.Trip Runner 2.

1576
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So, he is jumping on in to the series, ba-dum-bum.

1577
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And one more rapid-fire news story for you, and I just- I couldn't get through an episode of Orange Launch Radio

1578
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
and not acknowledge the hard-working talents of Dark Tetsuya behind the scenes.

1579
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And I know he is extremely jazzed about- so, shout-out to Dark Tetsuya when I mentioned La Mulana 2.

1580
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
He's probably this game's biggest fan.

1581
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And La Mulana 2 is going to be coming out during the summer on PC and Mac.

1582
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Yeah, there was a Kickstarter campaign for this game back in 2014.

1583
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And so, here it is. La Mulana 2 is finally here all these years.

1584
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
So, you can check out a teaser that is available online, and the game will be out soon.

1585
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It looks a lot like the first one, but it's probably going to be really fucking hard as well, but I think it'll be really fun.

1586
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So, check that out.

1587
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Let's travel around and check out what is in stores this week, starting with the US.

1588
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yes, so we have a few things coming out this week.

1589
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,000
So, starting off with Battle Chasers Nightwar, and that's going to be coming out on the Switch.

1590
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Little Witch Academia Chamber of Time on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1591
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Shin Megami Tensei Strange Journey Redux on 3DS.

1592
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
We have a game called Far Lone Sails on PC.

1593
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
The Banner Saga is coming out on the Switch.

1594
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Yonder the Cloud Catcher Chronicles, also on the Switch.

1595
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition on the Switch.

1596
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
And Little Nightmares Complete Edition on the Switch.

1597
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
That's it.

1598
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Alright, well last week was a holiday week in Japan, so things had slowed down significantly.

1599
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
But we do have some releases finally back on target this week, starting on May 17th.

1600
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
We're going to see in Japan Caligula Overdose is out on the PlayStation 4.

1601
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
That is going to be out this week.

1602
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Sadly, the Vita doesn't get that, but they do get a game called Amasutsumi is coming out from Prototype.

1603
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
That is also on May 17th.

1604
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And then checking out the Nintendo Switch, nothing.

1605
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
There's no Nintendo Switch releases this week.

1606
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I'm not sure if they have anything on the 3DS either.

1607
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
They're still kind of trickling in a little bit on the 3DS.

1608
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
No, not in Japan this week.

1609
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
So it's pretty light, but they are coming right off a holiday week in Japan right now.

1610
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So that's what Japan looks like.

1611
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Are you able to do the UK for us, Loki?

1612
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Yeah, I'm going to attempt to do that.

1613
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
So let's see here.

1614
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Out in the UK, we've got Hitman Definitive Edition.

1615
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
The Day One Steelbook Edition.

1616
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
That's out on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

1617
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
They also have the regular Definitive Edition as well.

1618
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And what else do we have here?

1619
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Looks like Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition also making its way out there as well.

1620
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And State of Decay 2 Ultimate Edition.

1621
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
That's coming out as well on the Xbox One.

1622
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And also I see they are doing steel work for that one as well.

1623
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,000
And one more here.

1624
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
So we've got Dragon Crown Pro Hardened Edition.

1625
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
That's coming out.

1626
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And Dragon Crown, if you remember from last week, we talked about it.

1627
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Big anime for us, yes.

1628
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
That's the game.

1629
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,000
And they're also getting Battle Chasers Night Wall as well on the Switch.

1630
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
And it looks like that's about it.

1631
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag because every week we invite you to email us.

1632
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Participate at Orangelauntrader.com if you want to participate with our show and send us some lovely love mail.

1633
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Or I guess you could send a hate mail, but I don't like hate mail.

1634
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I don't think you should send that.

1635
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Send love mail instead.

1636
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Or just send mail.

1637
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
If you're not a lover or a hater, just send mail.

1638
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Anyway, we've got one email tonight, but I'll take it.

1639
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
It's from our old friend YYR.

1640
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
We love hearing from YYR here at OLR.

1641
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And starts off as YYR usually does, saying,

1642
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Hello, LR!

1643
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Just doing my usual-ish thing of addressing a few things from last week's show.

1644
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Rob, you mentioned playing Streets of Rage for a bit and then losing interest.

1645
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Here's my advice.

1646
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
First of all, forget the first game.

1647
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Streets of Rage 2 is better in absolutely every respect, so play that.

1648
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And don't just play it willy-nilly.

1649
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Try to complete the game without continues.

1650
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Don't require that you learn your character's complete moveset and try to maximize your score.

1651
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Higher score means more extra lives.

1652
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,000
The best designed beat-em-ups give you lots of tough spots to work through and make you think on your feet in order to win.

1653
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Streets of Rage 2 is a great game, and if you do stick with it, I'm sure you'll have a great time.

1654
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
You know, I should have clarified last week.

1655
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I do know that Streets of Rage 2 is the better game.

1656
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I don't know why I felt the need to play one first.

1657
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I think it's just that whole thing of like, you know,

1658
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
when you're going to sit down and watch all the movies, you start with the first one.

1659
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
First, appreciate how good the second one is.

1660
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yes, it's something like that.

1661
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And I didn't really anticipate spending a lot of time with Streets of Rage.

1662
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I think it's one of those things that we do with classic games and, you know, with emulation.

1663
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And maybe this, you know, not to get the red alert noise out,

1664
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
but maybe this ties in a little bit to Nintendo's whole thing and the Netflix thing,

1665
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
is that sometimes I'll play a game for like, you know, 30 seconds.

1666
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And then it's like, oh, okay.

1667
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
It's like I got a little sample out of the frozen yogurt machine.

1668
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I got a little sample of what I wanted. I got to taste it. I'm good.

1669
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I remember this. Now, granted, I played a little more than that.

1670
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
A Streets of Rage 1, but I don't know. Sometimes you just want a little taste.

1671
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I'm just super excited that Nintendo's releasing Soccer and Tennis as some of their titles,

1672
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
because I know I couldn't miss playing Soccer or Tennis.

1673
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Well, you know what just came out on Arcade Archives was 10 Yard Fight.

1674
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
How about that first football release?

1675
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
That's better than Soccer or Tennis.

1676
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I'm loading up the red alert. I'm loading up. All right.

1677
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
We need to continue with YYRS email, which says, on another note,

1678
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
yes, I'm pretty sure that Dave and Busters has gotten rid of all their Derby Owners Club setups

1679
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
at every location by now.

1680
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Womp womp.

1681
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
But if you miss it, I have a game recommendation for you.

1682
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Dust off your 3DS, head to the eShop, and buy Pocket Card Jockey by Game Freak.

1683
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Yes, the same developer as Pokemon.

1684
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Pocket Card Jockey is basically a fusion of Derby Owners Club and Solitaire.

1685
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Don't even ask, well, how the hell does that work? Just know that it's awesome.

1686
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I was obsessed with it for probably about six months straight back when it came out.

1687
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It cost $7, and it's worth far more.

1688
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
There's a demo available, but don't even bother. Just buy it and play it obsessively.

1689
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
You're welcome.

1690
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
You know, that's the same thing I would say about Super Multitasking.

1691
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Just buy it and play it obsessively.

1692
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
There you go, YYRS. Shout out for you.

1693
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I had not heard of this game. I know Game Freak does stuff that's not Pokemon,

1694
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,000
because they also did that Harmonite game on 3DS, and that's pretty good.

1695
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So I don't know how I missed this Pocket Card Jockey,

1696
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
but your recommendation carries a lot of weight with me, YYR.

1697
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I will strongly consider that.

1698
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Do I get to name the horses? That's the most important part.

1699
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:07,000
It's not fun if I can't whip the horses named after things that, you know, need some whipping.

1700
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I'll mention one more thing from last week that you guys might not have noticed.

1701
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze came out last week on the Switch for $60,

1702
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
but did you know that a few days prior to that release,

1703
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
the Wii U version of Tropical Freeze was pulled from the North American eShop?

1704
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
That version only cost $20.

1705
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I just looked and can confirm that it is still gone.

1706
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
You may still be able to find physical copies for $20,

1707
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
but don't you think this is a bit messed up?

1708
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Anyway, thanks once again for producing the show, and have a great week.

1709
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Hugs, Aaron, YYR.

1710
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It's not like that they would take away the options of purchasing games and, you know...

1711
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
You know what, I'm not even gonna try to drag this into it.

1712
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Here's the thing.

1713
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Well, but I don't think Nintendo's the only company to do this.

1714
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
We've seen other companies that will come out with the remastered edition or whatever,

1715
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
and to be fair, it's not an exact copy.

1716
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
They did add some stuff to this.

1717
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
But we've seen other companies with their remastered edition and so forth,

1718
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
like, you know, you can't really find the old ones as easy and all that stuff anymore.

1719
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I don't think this is a thing you need to Nintendo.

1720
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
The reason why I didn't bring it up on last week's show,

1721
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I thought I had saw something where it came back on the store,

1722
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
so it was only temporarily missing.

1723
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Apparently that little nugget of information I saw must have been wrong,

1724
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
because you said you just checked, and you didn't send this email that long ago.

1725
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
So I guess it did actually disappear there.

1726
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
But one other thing to maybe ask yourself is,

1727
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
well, how many people still have a Wii U to play it on?

1728
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
So Nintendo's trying to get some of that cost of game development back.

1729
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Maybe it's one of those games that will go on sale a little sooner rather than later,

1730
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
because you know Nintendo games never go on sale.

1731
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Maybe this will be one of them that does because of the fact that the Wii U one kind of exists.

1732
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
So, anyway.

1733
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
There is one more important thing that YYR said in the email

1734
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
that I do need to make sure we get out here,

1735
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:07,000
saying, PS, I agree that Tacos Are Fantastic would be a wonderful subtitle for Pixel Poops Number 2.

1736
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Now, there's a very distinct way he wrote that.

1737
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Pixel Poops Number 2.

1738
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Right. I think I meant that in that sense as well.

1739
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
But that's also, like, I see what you did there, YYR.

1740
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:27,000
And so if he simply names the game Pixel Poops Number 2, that's really funny.

1741
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
And if he even makes the fucking game, I mean, he's got other things going on right now.

1742
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
But someday, inevitably, when he's bored enough and puts pen to paper,

1743
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
maybe we'll see Pixel Poops Number 2.

1744
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Let's put Pixel Poops stuff in multitasking.

1745
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
There you go. A little cross-marketing.

1746
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Everybody's doing crossovers with, like, different things.

1747
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Alright.

1748
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Put Shovel Knight in there. Everyone looks over there.

1749
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Just put Charles Martinet in it. Alright.

1750
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Charles Martinet playing Charles Martinet.

1751
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. YYR in chat says,

1752
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
OMG. Why did I not think of that? BRB.

1753
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Like, that would've been the first thing he did.

1754
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Hey, I've got all these assets they made for other games.

1755
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I'm putting all that shit in there. Recycle those assets.

1756
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Well, he did.

1757
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Because the shooter stuff came from that shooter game.

1758
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
And I'm sorry, I can't remember what it was called in the moment, YYR.

1759
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
But the shooter gallery game, point blankish type of thing he did on 360.

1760
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
All those assets were the same.

1761
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
But there was no, like, Snake 360 redo or anything like that.

1762
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
So, Sharpshooter. Thank you, YYR.

1763
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Anyway.

1764
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Yes, he should've had Snake in there.

1765
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
You know, YYR, if you do add a couple new boards to the game,

1766
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
then it allows it to be back out there all over again.

1767
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Because now it's like, oh, new free DLC.

1768
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And then you're gonna get people that'll run an article on it because,

1769
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
oh, there's free DLC. There's new boards.

1770
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
But I say it like DLC is this easy thing to implement.

1771
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I'm sure it's not.

1772
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Alright, anyway.

1773
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Let's move on and get into some more gaming news.

1774
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And, Loki, we'll start with you.

1775
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Speaking of Steam, and a place you can play Super Multitasking, right?

1776
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Yeah, exactly.

1777
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
So, Steam is gonna...

1778
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
You may remember the Steam link.

1779
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
It's still something that's being sold.

1780
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Well, now they're saying that they're gonna be coming out with a Steam link app.

1781
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And it will allow Steam users to play their games on Android and iOS devices.

1782
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
So, phones, tablets, and even Apple TV.

1783
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:35,000
And if they're connected via Wi-Fi or Ethernet to the same network,

1784
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:42,000
or if they're, of course, connected to the same network as your PC or Mac that you have Steam installed on.

1785
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Also, they're saying it's gonna be compatible with a variety of controllers.

1786
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Steam controllers, MFI controllers as well.

1787
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
And, so that's gonna be pretty awesome.

1788
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I thought I also read on here too that they were gonna work on something for, I hope, Android TV.

1789
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Because I have an Android TV and that would make it nice and convenient.

1790
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I have a Steam link.

1791
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I just haven't actually set it up yet.

1792
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Because, once again, you know, if I have my laptop in front of me, I'll just play on my laptop.

1793
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
But it comes in handy for games.

1794
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Like, I have some Lego games on my Steam library.

1795
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:20,000
And if my kids wanted to play those multiplayer, I don't have to, like, plug in a cable to my computer so that they can do that.

1796
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
So, it would be nice to see that available.

1797
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
But, yeah, if they have Android TV support, that would be even better.

1798
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Since I've already got that.

1799
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
We'll see you in a couple weeks.

1800
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
So, but, why would, I don't know.

1801
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Like, I'm trying to think, like, what stuff from Steam would I really want to play on the go?

1802
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And I'm like, eh.

1803
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Well, you wouldn't really even play it on the go.

1804
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
This would be, like, it has to be on the same network.

1805
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true.

1806
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
So, you can't really, like, play, yeah, playing it over LT would be a bit much.

1807
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
It would be more like playing, like, on a tablet.

1808
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:57,000
So, instead of having to have, like, a monitor or something like that, you would just have, you know, just a device that you can play it on.

1809
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And, I guess, if you had a Bluetooth controller, then you could run that with the tablet.

1810
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Or, would a Steam thing work with the tablet? I guess if it was the right tablet.

1811
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Yeah, if it...

1812
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Not an iPad.

1813
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Yeah, you could...

1814
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
No, it's all Bluetooth, so maybe it would work with an iPad.

1815
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Yeah, it might.

1816
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
So, I mean, it's cool.

1817
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
It's neat to have other options.

1818
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I mean, I'd have to check it out and see how well it works.

1819
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I certainly wouldn't want to play with just the phone.

1820
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Yeah, I wouldn't want to play, like, Civilization...

1821
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I'm not even.

1822
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I wouldn't want to play, like, Civilization 6.

1823
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
But you have people in chat that are saying, a couple of people saying Super Hexagon.

1824
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Which, I mean, is already a standalone iOS game anyway.

1825
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
So maybe something simple like that would work.

1826
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
The other thing I was thinking of, and sometimes we forget this, you guys.

1827
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Steam got into movies a while ago.

1828
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
You can buy movies, is it right? You can still buy them, right?

1829
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Yeah, I think so.

1830
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I know, like, Indie Game the movie. That was one of the first.

1831
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And then there was a few that trickled out there.

1832
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,000
So, I mean, this would be a way for Steam to do more, I guess, if you will, traditional media.

1833
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:03,000
That, I understand a lot, being able to beam that from Steam to your iPad when you're in the bed or something.

1834
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,000
So, that could be something.

1835
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Alright, well, something that you're not going to be able to buy on Steam, at least right away anyway,

1836
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
is Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.

1837
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Yeah, Atari has cut off the ability to buy this game.

1838
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
And it's because Frontier Developments did file a lawsuit over unpaid royalties from the game.

1839
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I don't know why this lawsuit news apparently came from TMZ, of all places.

1840
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Like, why the fuck is TMZ doing games?

1841
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Yeah, like, why are they covering that?

1842
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I think the word Atari still kind of resonates with a certain crowd.

1843
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
It's like, remember how-

1844
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Atari's a big company, right?

1845
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Remember how rad the 80s were? Let's see what Ataris do to all Ataris on Judge Judy.

1846
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
You know, whatever's going on. Anyway.

1847
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:49,000
So, Roller Coaster 3 Tycoon developer Frontier Developments said, in the suit,

1848
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
they alleged, that Atari failed to pay out $2.2 million in royalties.

1849
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Frontier, which made the deal with Atari to develop the game way back in 2003,

1850
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,000
wasn't able to pursue the unpaid balance when Atari went through bankruptcy in 2013.

1851
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
But now that Atari's fortunes have reversed and the company is at a profit,

1852
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
must be those Atari boxes that they're planning for 2019,

1853
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Frontier wants their damn money.

1854
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
So, the developer wants an audit of the royalties owed,

1855
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
and says, basically, in a nutshell, bitch, give me my money.

1856
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
So, in response, Atari has pulled the game from the pending litigation.

1857
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
They haven't really said why, but we know why.

1858
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
The listing is still there, you just can't buy the game.

1859
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Other games that Frontier worked on after that, Jurassic World Evolution,

1860
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Elite Dangerous is also a big title that that same company worked on,

1861
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
but I think y'all know Roller Coaster Tycoon.

1862
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
So, anyway, weird that it didn't just disappear from the store altogether,

1863
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
but maybe they had to do that for some reason to, like,

1864
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
kind of allow you to still download it if you own it type of thing.

1865
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Maybe they see this as temporary, like it's going to come back

1866
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
when they resolve all this lawsuit stuff,

1867
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
but if they, well, of course they'll resolve it.

1868
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
There's always a frickin' settlement in these types of cases.

1869
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
There's not gonna be a trial here, there'll be a settlement.

1870
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
And then it'll come back. We'll see.

1871
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
You found a Roller Coaster Tycoon, Loki?

1872
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Um, I didn't really claim. I have some of them, though, from Humble Bundle.

1873
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I haven't played it since, like, the very first one.

1874
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
But I still, and I know I've mentioned this on the show, it's a while ago now,

1875
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:27,000
one of my favorite YouTubes is when they're doing the roller coaster in the first person,

1876
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
and it's playing, like, Rihanna's, like, you know,

1877
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, and they're all, like, having fun,

1878
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
and then the roller coaster just flies off the rails,

1879
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
and the song instantly turns to Adele.

1880
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And it's all sad, as all these people fall, and there's flames everywhere.

1881
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
That is my favorite thing to have come out of that series in a very long time.

1882
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Thank you, SC100Man. Dude, he's on fire tonight.

1883
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
He's got this, he's got all this stuff bookmarked from old episodes.

1884
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I'm not gonna play it on air, but you can look at it in chat.

1885
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Yeah, I've got, um, the one I have is actually, I've got both that,

1886
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
and I've got No Limits Rollercoast, No Limits 2 Roller Coaster Simulator.

1887
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
That one's VR, so that one's pretty fun.

1888
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Oh, okay.

1889
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Um, but, uh, I have Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.

1890
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I don't see 3 in here, though.

1891
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

1892
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Alright, um, so this is different, but Nintendo's revealed that they're gonna be releasing

1893
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
a Japanese-exclusive Famicom mini to celebrate Shonen Jump's anniversary.

1894
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
So it's the 50th anniversary of Shonen Jump, and with that,

1895
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:35,000
the Famicom system is gonna have different games on there

1896
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
than when they released the Famicom mini before.

1897
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,000
So they've got, like, Tag Team Match Muscle, Dragon Quest, Fist of the North Star, Dragon Ball.

1898
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Um, they've got some Saint Seiya games,

1899
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
uh, Famicom Jump.

1900
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Let's see, yeah, a few Dragon Ball games.

1901
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Um, but yeah, like, quite a bit, you know, all Shonen Jump properties.

1902
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
So, interesting, though, that they're doing that,

1903
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
and that's gonna be something that's available in Japan July 7th.

1904
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,000
So do you think, I mean, we, well, see, when I put the short roll together,

1905
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,000
we didn't have the late-breaking news about the confirmed NES, you know,

1906
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
gonna be back on the shelves in June, so I guess it's kind of a moot point now,

1907
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
because I was wondering, like, oh, when the NES Classic comes back,

1908
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
do you think they're gonna sweeten the pot by adding a few games to it,

1909
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:31,000
maybe some sort of tie-in, uh, to, you know, get the people who bought it the first time to buy it again.

1910
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Although, I don't know, if I had bought it the first time,

1911
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
and they put out a new one with, like, three extra games, I'd probably be pretty pissed.

1912
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
So...

1913
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,000
All I wanna know is, are those controllers longer again? I bet they're not.

1914
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I don't think we know yet. For all we know, it's the exact same thing.

1915
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Probably is.

1916
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
But the Super Nintendo ones, I think, were a little longer.

1917
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Right.

1918
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,000
So, maybe, who knows? It doesn't, it's not for sure that it's gonna be the short chords again.

1919
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
But, we'll probably be asking some of these questions of Nintendo in the coming days.

1920
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Maybe E3, this seems like very much a thing that Treehouse would probably bring up in their days-long stream,

1921
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
that they might go like, oh, don't forget, guys, that Nintendo's coming out.

1922
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Uh, NES Classic is being re-released on the end of June,

1923
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
and, uh, here's what they look like if you forget,

1924
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
and either you're gonna see an NES sitting there with longer chords,

1925
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
or it's gonna be the same thing as before.

1926
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
And, even though no one's paying attention to this,

1927
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,000
we must tell you that all 30 games in there are all copies of the Guardian Legend.

1928
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Now that-

1929
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
We're releasing only one system, and somewhere in Alaska, I mean Antarctica.

1930
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Get, get, we're gonna go for, where are all the Kmart's in Alaska?

1931
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
I'm on my way.

1932
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Alright.

1933
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Hey, this sounds like a pretty neat Switch title that's on its way pretty soon,

1934
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
uh, is, uh, this crossover fighting game, uh, Crystal Crisis.

1935
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I think Crystal Crisis is supposed to be, like, uh, maybe kinda like Puzzle Fighter,

1936
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
although I don't know if, um-

1937
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
It looks like Puzzle Fighter.

1938
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Yeah, it kinda, it kinda really does look like, uh, a Puzzle Fighter type of thing.

1939
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
But, uh, it-

1940
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
It's all indies.

1941
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
And Nysalis is the game, is the company doing this?

1942
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Yeah.

1943
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Is that how you say it?

1944
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Okay, uh, they are putting, like, all these kinda, like, indie characters in the game.

1945
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
So when it was Puzzle Fighter, it was all the Capcom characters, right?

1946
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
So in this one, it's going to be, uh, you know, different indie characters,

1947
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
such as the little thing from Cave Story, uh, that looks like the little Binding of Isaac.

1948
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
It is Binding of Isaac.

1949
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Yeah, uh, I don't have a list here in this story of all the characters.

1950
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I do.

1951
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Do you? What are the characters in this?

1952
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Yeah, it's on here. So they've got, um, you're talking about-

1953
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
So they've got, like, C here.

1954
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Astro Boy, which is kind of interesting.

1955
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
That's pretty cool.

1956
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Um, they had, um, the Turbo Duo spokesman.

1957
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
They said Johnny Turbo.

1958
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Um, Code of Princess, Cave Story, um,

1959
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I know they did, uh, yeah, Binding of Isaac, as you mentioned.

1960
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Not sure who any of these other characters are, though.

1961
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
But, uh, lots of different characters.

1962
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,000
So, yeah, uh, it is a Switch title, uh, that was revealed at BitSummit in Kyoto,

1963
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
which is why we're getting some indie news this week, you guys, actually.

1964
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
It's where some of this news, uh, tonight came from was this whole thing.

1965
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Um, so they, uh, showed off the game, and it's going to be coming out on the Switch.

1966
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Uh, uh, the early trailer's in Japanese, so, um, you know,

1967
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
you may not be able to understand it all, but you can see all the characters that are in it.

1968
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Uh, and I don't know if we have a date yet. I don't think so.

1969
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I think we just have Fall for North America and Europe.

1970
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
That's all we know. Fall. So.

1971
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
But, uh, you know, especially if Puzzle Fighter kind of dies on the phones,

1972
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
and they don't end up doing a console release of that game,

1973
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
this might be a neat substitute.

1974
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
And there's some anime in there, too. Like, I see, uh, Blackjack is something that's in there.

1975
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Hmm.

1976
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Um...

1977
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
That's really cool.

1978
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah, I don't know who these characters are.

1979
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Sadly.

1980
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I mean, I know who Astro Boy is, but...

1981
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Of course, of course. So.

1982
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Alright, well, we'll, uh, check out that when it comes out on the Nintendo Switch in the Fall.

1983
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
But, Loki, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys,

1984
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
and we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

1985
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
But first, Loki.

1986
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Yeah, so, uh, there's Pokémon GO Fest coming out again.

1987
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yes, Pokémon GO Fest 2018.

1988
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
And they've already sold out in their tickets.

1989
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
In an hour.

1990
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So, uh, Pokémon GO Fest is going to be, I guess, coming to Chicago again.

1991
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,000
And they're switching up which park it's going to be at.

1992
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I know that.

1993
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah, they're going to, I think, what's a much bigger park.

1994
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I'm not as familiar. I didn't go there when I was there last year.

1995
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Um, but I think it is a bigger, like, park, uh, ride along, like, the coastal area.

1996
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Yeah, so they said that, um, it is going to be...

1997
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:43,000
They're leaving Grant Park for Lincoln Park, they said, which has, uh, 1.8 miles of walking path.

1998
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:49,000
And they're going to have some new physical installations there,

1999
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
and activities for trainers of all ages.

2000
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
And, yeah.

2001
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Um, they said, well, of course, the tickets went on sale May 11th, but they're already sold out.

2002
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Of course they are.

2003
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
So, people pretty quick to forgive last year and sign up to go again.

2004
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
It sounds like, what, there's two days of this event, and you could buy a ticket for one day or the other.

2005
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Right, and then they also have, there's also, this isn't the only one that they're doing,

2006
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:17,000
there's also going to be, uh, Pokemon GO Summer Tour, which is, um, kicking off in Germany on June 30th as well.

2007
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:23,000
So there's stuff. And then they're saying that also that goes all the way, they're going around the world, uh, to Japan.

2008
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
That's where it's going to end.

2009
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
And I think the GO Fest is going to tie into Community Day somehow as well.

2010
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Like, you're going to be able to participate, uh, remotely, you know, even if you can't go to GO Fest,

2011
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
there will be some cool things that you can do so you don't feel so left out because you can get to go.

2012
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Hopefully. Because I can't go to Chicago.

2013
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
No, and what's-

2014
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:47,000
And I would be hesitant to go to Chicago again, especially with, you know, how the last one turned out.

2015
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I would hope that it's better this time, but-

2016
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Well, I love Chicago, but, um, I'm already going to be, just like last time, I already booked my trip to be there two weeks before.

2017
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:04,000
So, I'll be there two weeks before, but, uh, I won't be able to be there for the event.

2018
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
So, because it makes no sense to go back just for that two weeks after the fact.

2019
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
So, uh, who knows.

2020
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Uh, actdefs theorizes in chat at live.vognetwork.com, like, regionals, perhaps.

2021
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Maybe we'll see some more regionals released that you can get maybe only during the event.

2022
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
That would be a pretty cool thing. Make some people very happy.

2023
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Maybe.

2024
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Um, certainly people at the event will probably be able to chase Unowns.

2025
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I know it's a big thing.

2026
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Uh, there was a Pokemon that was spotted in the little video that is available currently only in India, I believe.

2027
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Uh, or not in the video, in the little picture.

2028
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
So, they're thinking that regionals could actually show up.

2029
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,000
So, maybe that Pokemon that's region locked right now will be available for everybody.

2030
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:50,000
That's, uh, Torkoal is the one that's available only in India right now.

2031
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Hmm.

2032
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Um, maybe that will be them throwing the switch on for Gen 4.

2033
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Who knows?

2034
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:09,000
There could be, there could be a big new feature for the game, uh, for Go Fest because last year we got the gym redo happened when I was in Chicago.

2035
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
So, it was like two weeks prior to Go Fest.

2036
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,000
And it was all the 1, 2, 3, and 4 star raids at first, right?

2037
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Right.

2038
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:21,000
And then, because the very first raid I ever did in Pokemon Go was a Totodile.

2039
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
No, what's the second form?

2040
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Crocomaw, okay?

2041
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
I did a raid for that at that fountain.

2042
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I think it's Buckingham Fountain or something.

2043
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
It's the fountain that's in the opening credits of Married with Children.

2044
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Got it.

2045
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
That's the very first raid I did was at that fountain.

2046
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Um, and then what they did at Go Fest two or three weeks later is they added,

2047
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Oh, Legendaries!

2048
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Lugia is out now, as is Articuno because Mystic won all the catch stuff for the day.

2049
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Because that's how everybody was getting in with Go Fest around the world.

2050
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:02,000
So, um, and that's kind of where the, um, that's where the Community Day stuff I think came from.

2051
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Because, uh, you know, I remember when I was down at the capital during Go Fest because they said,

2052
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Oh, you get all these bonuses in the game if you get so many catches and all this stuff, right?

2053
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,000
So, um, we were all down at the capital, like a ton of us.

2054
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
And it was like the day the game first came out.

2055
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
It was crazy.

2056
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Tons of people everywhere.

2057
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Um, so that's, and ever since then when they've done the Community Days, it's been the same thing.

2058
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I've gone to the Capital Park every single Community Day except the one I was out of town.

2059
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Uh, the Bulbasaur Day when I was out of town.

2060
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
But, like, Capital Park is always, like, hopping.

2061
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
So, we'll probably go there. I think there's one coming right up, like, next week of the week.

2062
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Yeah, I think it's next weekend. I think next weekend is the Charmander Day.

2063
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Oh, yeah.

2064
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
May 19th, yeah. So, uh, I'll probably go out there again.

2065
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
So, uh, good times.

2066
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:51,000
So, anyway, the whole reason why I brought up the raid in the first place I did is that, you know,

2067
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
they did make some big changes to the game and rolled that out at Go Fest.

2068
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
So, who knows? Maybe there will be another big addition to the game.

2069
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Trading, battling, like, crazy.

2070
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Yeah, trading would be huge or PvP. That would be a huge thing.

2071
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Gen 4 would be something that I would think would be...

2072
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Because, you know, to be fair, we did just get the questing thing, the research tasks.

2073
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Yeah.

2074
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Which, if you haven't played Pokemon Go in a while, like, the research tasks are a huge change and a really welcome one.

2075
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Because the nice thing is now is that if you don't raid, it looks like they are slowly rolling out those Mon through these tasks.

2076
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Because now, uh, Moltres was, uh, the first one that you could get from the research task.

2077
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
That was last month. Now Zapdos this month.

2078
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:43,000
So, like, you can kind of catch up on a lot of those legendaries you missed because you don't raid through the research task.

2079
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,000
And the little trade-off is that those that did do the raiding, uh, there are five levels higher usually.

2080
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Ten if you lucked out with a weather boost.

2081
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Um, and, uh, you, um...

2082
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Yeah, they're five or ten levels higher.

2083
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Um, I feel like there's something else with that.

2084
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Oh, and you had them for a longer time.

2085
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
You've already had them for a year or so.

2086
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
So.

2087
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Anyway.

2088
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Uh, yep.

2089
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
So that's it for Pokemon Go then, right?

2090
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
That's it.

2091
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Alright.

2092
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
So we'll see if we, uh...

2093
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
See if we, our buddy, um...

2094
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Because we had, uh, our friend from the Pokemon Go podcast, Charles, was there last year.

2095
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I haven't checked with him to see if he's, uh, going again this year.

2096
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
So I'll find out soon.

2097
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Maybe we can get him back this year.

2098
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Uh, anyhow.

2099
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Let's talk about, lastly tonight, um, some big news on Pinball Arcade.

2100
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:47,000
This is the, uh, Farsight Studios production that takes real pinball tables and, uh, kind of converts them, uh, for use on your PlayStation 4, your PC, your, what, iOS.

2101
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
It's everywhere, basically.

2102
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Yeah, everything.

2103
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:54,000
They even had them on, like, PS3 and, I mean, the, like, you know, I don't think they work on those versions anymore and they haven't for a while.

2104
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:58,000
But anyway, this is, uh, this is gonna be a pretty big, uh, pretty big loss for them.

2105
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:05,000
And that is that the licensing agreement for Williams and Bally pinball trademarks is not going to be renewed.

2106
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:17,000
So this means tables that you can purchase now will no longer be purchasable as of, uh, I think it's June 30th is the day that these are all gonna go away.

2107
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Um, so, uh, I'm not gonna read the entire list of tables, but there are some big ones that are gonna be leaving.

2108
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,000
One of my favorites, Pinbot, uh, including tables that were crowdfunded.

2109
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Uh, the Addams Family, which I think they were on this show promoting that one.

2110
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I think it was that one they were here.

2111
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Farsight came on this, uh, show.

2112
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Uh, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, I think was one they crowdfunded for.

2113
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
That is going to be going away.

2114
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Um, so that's kind of a bummer.

2115
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Uh, Doctor Who, the 92 Table, that is going away.

2116
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
World Cup Soccer, Jamie's Fave, that is going to be going away.

2117
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Uh, one of my other faves, Theater of Magic, uh, one of the all-time greats, Elvira and the Party Monsters.

2118
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:02,000
All of these games gonna be going away, or all these tables gonna be going away and no longer purchasable.

2119
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Um, so of course if you own it, you can play it forever.

2120
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Um, if you are, um, kind of like thinking, oh, I'll hold out for the big goodbye sale, don't do it.

2121
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Because Farsight's licensing agreement, they are banned from offering discounts.

2122
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Probably due to the fact that many of these tables do involve some complicated intellectual, uh, properties.

2123
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Because, you know, it's like you have the Addams Family, you have the characters that are on the table.

2124
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
I mean, they have to license all of that.

2125
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
So, that's probably why they're not allowed to do discounts.

2126
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
So, the seven current seasons are $30 a pop.

2127
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
So, if you want every table, it's gonna cost you $210.

2128
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Um, maybe you don't want every table though, maybe you only need certain ones.

2129
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:50,000
You can buy individual tables and two packs from inside the game, so check that out if you want.

2130
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Farsight has said that season eight will be Stern games.

2131
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
It's gonna take some of the tables from Stern Pinball Arcade, uh, as well as some others.

2132
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,000
So, there are still some other, um, table, uh, companies that they can work with.

2133
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
But that's, uh, that's a pretty big loss, sadly.

2134
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I don't know if, um, I wonder why, uh, they weren't able to get the renewal.

2135
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I wonder if Williams and Bally priced them out, if they plan to do their own thing, or what the hell's going on.

2136
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:19,000
So, um, it would be great if maybe they could work that out.

2137
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Um, but that, that really sucks, especially with the crowdfunded tables.

2138
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Although, to be fair, anyone who paid to get those tables made got their copy of the table.

2139
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
So, it's not like you're really losing anything in this.

2140
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So, uh, Bobby Blackwolf points out on Facebook, all they said is, we don't know why they decided not to renew.

2141
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
And so, they are telling Farsight that they are not renewing. There was no negotiation.

2142
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:47,000
So, that makes it sound like, uh, EA got the license. No, I'm just kidding.

2143
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I made that up, I made that up, but isn't, isn't that a scary conclusion to jump to?

2144
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Alright. Anyhow.

2145
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Uh, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call and say hello, talk about anything that we've talked about tonight, or maybe something else.

2146
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Maybe there's something, uh, we weren't able to, uh, bring up on the show, uh, and you want to bring that up now, we can do that.

2147
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype is the place to be. Uh, and we'll get your calls here shortly.

2148
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Um, I think we do have calls coming in. Let's lighten up tonight, so let's get to it.

2149
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
And we'll start here. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2150
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Hey guys, it's Aaron, YYR.

2151
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Hey, we have an email and a call tonight. It's Doubles. What's up, buddy?

2152
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Um, well actually, I was planning to call in and mention the business about the Pinball Arcade, but it turns out that was the very last story.

2153
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Well, what are your thoughts on this whole thing?

2154
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Um, I don't think a lot of people realize just how big of a deal this is.

2155
02:04:48,000 --> 02:05:04,000
If you go through, and by the way, the Pinball Arcade, it really is on everything. It's on Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, PS3, Vita, PS4, 360, Xbox One, Wii U, Kindle Fire, Ouya, and now Switch.

2156
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Except the Switch version already has these tables gone.

2157
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Yeah, that was a real kicker. Now, here's the thing. The Switch version came out, and it had all the tables in it. It was available for about eight hours, and then it was pulled from the eShop.

2158
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:26,000
That was a few weeks ago. It just came back a few days ago, and all of it had been scrubbed already.

2159
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,000
So, you gotta wonder if something about the Nintendo Switch version is what set this whole thing off.

2160
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:41,000
You know, it's hard to say, and a few other people have speculated that maybe it had something to do with VR, because there are now some VR pinball simulations available.

2161
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:48,000
And it's really cool, because you know how, I don't know, have you played the Pinball Arcade at all, or any of the previous versions?

2162
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Oh yeah, I backed Adam's Family.

2163
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Oh wow.

2164
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Yeah, so I've played it, yeah.

2165
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Yeah, then you know that there are some camera views available, and the view changes based on where the ball is sometimes.

2166
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:13,000
But if you imagine how much more control over the view you'd have if you do it in VR, you can imagine that it's kind of a whole new game.

2167
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:24,000
The level of the simulation is completely different, so some people are speculating that maybe they made a deal with somebody else to basically remake all of these games in VR.

2168
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:33,000
But honestly, it's hard to imagine that anyone else is going to jump through all of the necessary hoops to make things like this possible.

2169
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:54,000
So this is one example. Terminator 2 Judgment Day. If you want to do that table, not only do you need to have access to the original table to be able to take it apart, understand how all of it works, and reproduce it, but you also need the movie license, and you need Arnold Schwarzenegger's OK to use his likeness.

2170
02:06:54,000 --> 02:07:18,000
So that's a lot of work, and what I was getting at earlier was, if you look at the 96, 96 pinball tables that are currently in the pinball arcade, Bally and Williams, which are all getting cut from the game, that represents 63 of those tables, or about two thirds of everything available in that game.

2171
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Yeah. Bobby and Chad just said it was 61 tables out of 99.

2172
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Oh, OK. 61. I was close. But I mean, basically you're gutting it. It's hard to imagine that they're going to be able to keep going. I mean, Stern is a big deal because they are the only ones besides, I think, Jersey Jack pinball and maybe a few other indie outposts still producing pinball machines.

2173
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:58,000
But, I mean, if you're looking at historical pinball games, that's the big one. They're really losing most of the game there, and it's really sad.

2174
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:15,000
No, and I think we mentioned this maybe on the call during Bobby's show, but I was mentioning how the money that probably still rolls in slowly from the sales of this is probably helping to fund Farsight Studios. This is going to be a huge loss for them, so I hope everything's OK.

2175
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Yeah, apparently the early seasons, especially number one, which, I mean, the first three seasons in particular, there are so many quality tables in them.

2176
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:41,000
You're cutting out a little bit YYR. I'm losing a little bit of your phrases, so hopefully when the connection re-establishes here. You were mentioning the first three seasons have such good tables.

2177
02:08:41,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Yeah, and there's a lot of them. There used to be more tables included in the early seasons than the later ones. So, season one and two represent a great value, and one through four basically have a ton of classics, including Adam's family. So, it's hard to pick and choose. It really is.

2178
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I was going to say the Thank You, Dark Tetsuya, or WikiPro. Episode 570 was when Farsight Studios was on the show, so if you want to go back.

2179
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Oh, wow.

2180
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I'm almost positive during that interview, and I think it was the Adam's family table they were promoting at the time, because I remember backing it, and I thought it was a result of that, or just the fact that I wanted to back it, because I love that table.

2181
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I remember them talking about how you don't, and it's exactly what you're saying about Terminator. You don't have to just license this one thing. You have to license the estate of Rao Julia, who is a deceased actor, whose likeness is in the game, whose voice is in the game. You have to license all of that.

2182
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Yeah, and it's hard to imagine that any other company, EA or otherwise, is going to really be able to reproduce all of what Farsight did. I don't even know how.

2183
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:09,000
So, well, I mean, tipping our hat to Farsight Studios for doing what they could all these years, and hopefully, maybe, I don't know, maybe some of the fact that this news has caught fire, and it is kind of stunning a lot of people.

2184
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Maybe this will put some pressure on Bally Williams, although I don't know. I don't know if they're going to see that their minds need to be changed, especially if they're not making money per table.

2185
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Maybe if they were making money per table sold, they might be more into it, but if they were paid a flat fee, maybe they don't really give a shit.

2186
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Well, I guess we have about six weeks to find out.

2187
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:43,000
That's true. So we'll see. We'll see if this news catches any fire, but I would imagine there's already people tweeting at them, because that's what we do this day and age. We're mad at companies. We send them tweets.

2188
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Why you no license the tables?

2189
02:10:46,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I will say this much. The company that now has these rights, they're basically a company that produces gambling machines now, and so this is probably such an insignificant portion of their revenue that it probably is just a drop in the bucket to them anyway.

2190
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Is it the same Bally still that runs the casino in Vegas?

2191
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:22,000
They're called something different now. I'm not sure what of Bally they still retain, but basically it's just, well, they're like Konami, I guess.

2192
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Oh, I hate that comparison, but yes. Very true. Very, very true.

2193
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:39,000
All right, my friend. Well, I'm going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you for sharing your input on this, you know, whole big change for Pinball Arcade.

2194
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Yeah, it really stinks, but I hope there's a good way forward from this, and I'll leave you with this.

2195
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Yes.

2196
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:51,000
If you do decide to take the plunge on Pocket Card Jockey, yes, you can name all your horses whatever you want.

2197
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Good to know. Good to know. Note me.

2198
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Have a great week.

2199
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
All right, my friend. Take care.

2200
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Yep. Bye-bye.

2201
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Oh my god, the phones are on fire tonight. We got a little time. I'll try to get to as many of these as I can.

2202
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio. Who's this?

2203
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Hey, this is Akdeaf.

2204
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Hey, Akdeaf. What's on your mind, buddy?

2205
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Well, sorry. I'm going to expand a little bit on the Nintendo Switch Online thing.

2206
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Uh-oh, I'm getting my red alert out. No, no. You get to have your say, too.

2207
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:30,000
And aside the NES games and all that, I have a more legit concern, at least in my aspect.

2208
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Because if some of you have learned or seen either from Twitter or Flacco Jones' Splatoon 2 streams,

2209
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:51,000
you can all know that I cannot play any Switch game online since March.

2210
02:12:52,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Because of my internet provider and the connection it provides, it's my NAT.

2211
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:08,000
It isn't either A or B, which is what it should be. It's either D or F.

2212
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Why is that? Because I don't have a direct connection. I use cable internet.

2213
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:21,000
And that pretty much doesn't let me play online, at least with the Switch.

2214
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I can play on the PS4, I can play on the Xbox, and all that stuff.

2215
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And it isn't Nintendo's fault entirely. But here's my point.

2216
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Nintendo uses peer-to-peer connections. It isn't dedicated servers or anything like that.

2217
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:56,000
So my question here for you is, do you want to pay aside the Nintendo Entertainment System stuff, aside the crowd saves?

2218
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:08,000
If it were only the online connection, and in this case you know that it's a peer-to-peer connection and it isn't servers,

2219
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,000
would you still pay for the service?

2220
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I'm thinking that's why I've got dead air going on here, because I do feel like it's hard for me to not discount the Netflix-type service,

2221
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
because in a way that's kind of like selling it for me.

2222
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I also feel that the other companies have been charging online for years now, so it makes sense that Nintendo's coming to the table.

2223
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
They are doing it cheaper, but you do make a good point.

2224
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:44,000
If it's not dedicated servers, if it's peer-to-peer, but don't they still have to run at least matchmaking servers or something?

2225
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:49,000
What connects you to those other players in Splatoon? That isn't magic.

2226
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Maybe once you're in the game, now it's peer-to-peer. But there's still got to be matchmaking servers, right?

2227
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I think so, but I'm not sure exactly if that's the case.

2228
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I still think if that's the case, then it's still a little bit justified, but at least they're charging a lesser price.

2229
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:21,000
If Nintendo was charging $60 for this, I'd be like, okay, hold up, because you guys don't even have basic voice chat system.

2230
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:27,000
No, I'm not buying the app. That app is not good. Maybe if they improve the app, it'll sweeten the pot a little bit.

2231
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Before their lower price, and considering they're throwing in the NES classics, which I'm sorry, it's hard for me to ignore that,

2232
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,000
I do think it's something I will pick up.

2233
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,000
If the NES classics things weren't there, I would really have to consider, because then it's just online play.

2234
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Is there something I want to play online? Yes or no.

2235
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Splatoon? I've cooled down a little bit on that compared to you and Flacco.

2236
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:55,000
I certainly don't dislike Splatoon by any means, but I've just gone to other games, as we sometimes do.

2237
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,000
But when Smash comes out, I might want to be able to play that online.

2238
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Do I need to play that online for a year? No, but I might want to play it online for a month.

2239
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:11,000
But then, YYR in chat says, whatever someone would answer to this question now, the answer may change when Animal Crossing comes out.

2240
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:16,000
And there's the big ticket item there.

2241
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Now, if Animal Crossing comes out, and it's really going to open up your village 24-7 for some types of interactions there,

2242
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:29,000
because you've got more central servers and stuff, or whatever, depending on these online capabilities of Animal Crossing,

2243
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:33,000
that one, my friend, that would probably sell it to me right there.

2244
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:40,000
And yeah, that's definitely a good thing, because we're going to get more games, starting with Smash.

2245
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:45,000
And he also adds a Pokemon. That's going to be a big thing.

2246
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:53,000
That's true. This encourages Nintendo, for better or for worse, Loki, to do more online stuff.

2247
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Because now they know if they put online in games, that could be a constant revenue stream for them.

2248
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:04,000
So it actually, it kind of forces Nintendo to look at a calendar already.

2249
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Loki, you want to chime in on this, or you spent?

2250
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I just, I'm not expecting much from them, whether they're charging for it or not.

2251
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I think just because they're now charging for it, that they're all of a sudden become better at what they're doing.

2252
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
But you don't really play any Nintendo games online right now.

2253
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
No, I don't.

2254
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
So I wouldn't expect that you would buy this for any reason.

2255
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:29,000
No, I'm still going to, just in case I want to, but I'm not, I don't want...

2256
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Well, no.

2257
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
After all that, you guys.

2258
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Well, hold on. To that extent, I don't really play PlayStation 4 games online either.

2259
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I play mostly single player stuff.

2260
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I still pay for that, just in case if I want to play with somebody online.

2261
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Okay.

2262
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Same with this, I would pay for it just with the thought that I may want to play a game online with somebody at some point, like Mario Kart or something.

2263
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I won't have to like, oh wait, I better go buy my online thing to go do that.

2264
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:06,000
You know, that's why. It's not because, oh yeah, I'm just saying I hate all their stuff now, but truly I love it all.

2265
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:13,000
No, I think it's so... No, I don't. I'm sorry. I think it's really underwhelming, but it's the gateway that I have...

2266
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,000
It's what I have to pay a door to play online.

2267
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I wish I'd gotten you to say that in the beginning of the show, that you're going to pay for the service anyway.

2268
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,000
I think that would have been a very important footnote, but anyway.

2269
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:31,000
SSG100Man says, rips it to hell, but is going to buy it anyway.

2270
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:32,000
You know what?

2271
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
That's why I got to switch. Hello?

2272
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Have you ever logged on to Twitter? Any of you? Have any of you looked at Twitter.com?

2273
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Anyway, sorry Act F. I didn't mean to derail your call. What's your perspective on this?

2274
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I mean, you have the online issues, so if Nintendo's going to want to charge for that, then they kind of have to fix them?

2275
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:56,000
So I mean, it goes without saying, if online doesn't work, you're not going to pay for it, because what the fuck are you paying for?

2276
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:03,000
But let's assume that maybe something about having money under it finally fixes it for you. What are your thoughts on it?

2277
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:12,000
And that's the thing. I actually do want them to change, not use peer-to-peer, because it's not a problem that's only affecting me.

2278
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:23,000
It's affecting a lot of people. If you search like, Nat problems switch on Google, you're going to find like tons of people complaining about this.

2279
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:37,000
It is an easy fix for most people, but in my case, my ISP isn't letting me change that, at least fix the problem myself.

2280
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I have to pay them 600 pesos, which is like around $25 a month to get a private IP for me to let me play online.

2281
02:19:52,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I'm not going to pay that, especially since I have to pay for the Switch service online.

2282
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:13,000
I really, really want them to fix this, because even with the NES games and all that stuff, it's good and the price isn't that bad.

2283
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:21,000
But I would actually like to play online. I haven't played Splatoon that much because of that thing alone.

2284
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:24,000
What has your internet service provider said about this?

2285
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I called them and they said, oh, you have to pay. That's it. I'm like, really?

2286
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:37,000
You have to pay to get an answer out of them, or you have to pay for them to flip a Switch?

2287
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Yeah, I have to pay them to flip a Switch every month. So, no, fuck that.

2288
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And so there it is in chat. Bobby Blackhill says, welcome to net neutrality, or lack thereof, as the case may be.

2289
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,000
What are net neutrality laws in Mexico, or are there any?

2290
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Oh, no, we don't have any. It's only this ISP, because other ISPs let you fix this problem by yourself.

2291
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:12,000
But in this case, and I have researched this because, again, it's been like two months.

2292
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:20,000
And it's because of how cable networks work here, especially here in Mexico, that it isn't a direct connection.

2293
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,000
You share the connection with other people. So that's why.

2294
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:32,000
And you have to pay the ISP here to get a direct connection, to get a private IP in this case.

2295
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:38,000
So as brought up in chat, it's more kind of about Mexico's internet infrastructure to begin with.

2296
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Yeah, it sucks.

2297
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that, Defs, but I hope there's something that can be done to help you out.

2298
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Yeah, I hope that Nintendo changes things here, at least instead of being peer-to-peer to be a dedicated server.

2299
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:07,000
So in that way, I can play. Because, again, I can play on the PS4, I can play things like Overwatch, Street Fighter, other stuff on other consoles.

2300
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:13,000
But I cannot play any game on the Switch Online. So hopefully that changes with the service.

2301
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,000
But if not, the ISP hopefully will come around.

2302
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Hopefully too.

2303
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
As more and more people get Switches.

2304
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Hopefully that happens too.

2305
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Yeah, because I think that would happen sooner than the other. But we'll see.

2306
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Alright, well, act Def. Don't stop raising a fuss. Use social media if you have to with your ISP.

2307
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:38,000
I'm not talking about Nintendo. I'm talking about your ISP. So, anyway.

2308
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Alright, take care, my friend.

2309
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2310
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Yeah, good to hear from you as always. Take care.

2311
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Alright. More calls. Longer show, more calls. But it's good. A lot of news this week.

2312
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio. Who's this?

2313
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Hey, what's going on, everyone? It's Ron, though.

2314
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Hey, Ron. It's always good to hear from you. What's on your mind?

2315
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Not too much. It was two things I wanted to talk about.

2316
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:05,000
One, I forgot, and I'll probably send an email in right here to show.

2317
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:11,000
And the second thing, jog my memory as I'm sitting here, restoring my computer, taking care of business.

2318
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:21,000
This is in regards to an article from a few weeks ago when you all talked about the Steam links being pushed to another section of Steam's website.

2319
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
What did you want to say about it?

2320
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:33,000
The thing is, I'm not surprised, because I'll be the first to say it. I don't think Steam links were that popular to begin with.

2321
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:47,000
It also falls on the lines of the Steam machines, and to be perfectly honest, we all know the reason why Gabe Newell pushed Steam machines is because he has a hard-on for hatred of Windows.

2322
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:53,000
In a way, I don't blame him, but as you can see, nobody is doing Steam machines.

2323
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:00,000
You have to get a lot of the offices to get off of Windows before you're going to get the homes off of Windows, if that makes sense.

2324
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I mean, this is where Microsoft makes its killing, is the Office life.

2325
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Yes, and I remember a time when Best Buy was selling Linux in retail stores for like 50 bucks.

2326
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:19,000
And you can look at it, it looks like Windows, it kind of feels like Windows, but it doesn't taste like Windows.

2327
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Or it's like how I use Open Office, because I've historically been too cheap to get Microsoft Office on my own computer.

2328
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
It's like, it's close!

2329
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Uh, Rob, I'll tell you this. If you use it at work, you can use it at home, and I can tell you how.

2330
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Well, I'll have to follow up with you offline. I do use it at work.

2331
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Mm-hmm.

2332
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Alright, fair enough.

2333
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:54,000
And the funny thing is about that, that's not a secret, it's more or less a known fact, it's just that IT guys just doesn't like to tell other people, even though Microsoft says go ahead and tell the other people.

2334
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Well, because they can't control what you do at home.

2335
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Yeah, because I'll say this. If you're using Office at work and you log in with a Microsoft account, like Office 365, each user has five licenses.

2336
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:14,000
So if you log in with your Office account at work, you can download, you can go to the website, log in, and download a copy for your home personal use.

2337
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I'm going to look into that. Thank you for that tip, because I had no idea about that.

2338
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:32,000
I mean, I enjoy OpenOffice well enough. I think they've done a very good job considering what kind of project it is, but it would be nice to have something that I can open directly and all that stuff. It would be nice.

2339
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:46,000
That's true. I mean, before I really went back into being more oriented with Office, I followed OpenOffice, but I stopped because there is an issue between Excel and Calc.

2340
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Sometimes the formulas do not add up properly on both.

2341
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:59,000
That is correct, and Calc is actually how I make the show rules for this show, but luckily no math is involved, so it works out okay.

2342
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:03,000
All I need is something that exports to HTML, which I know Office can do too.

2343
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:15,000
See, you use Calc. I actually use OneNote. It makes it easier for my crew, because they can just log in, drop articles in. I just go in, make the outline, and be like, log in here, done.

2344
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:35,000
But we're kind of really straight off the beaten path here. What I'm saying is, I enjoy Steam just as everybody else, but I'm not going to sit here and build a $1,000 Steam box to play maybe, I don't know, a third or two-thirds of my collection.

2345
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Even though there are more games, there are more Linux and Mac OS friendly, every game that's on Steam plays on Windows.

2346
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:52,000
And as far as I recall, with a Steam machine, you're not really going to be able to stream a Windows game for your PC to your Steam box.

2347
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Yeah, and the Steam box thing, I always had a hard time understanding who that was for.

2348
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:06,000
And so the fact that they're fading a little bit, they're moving into the background, backup singers, isn't totally surprising to me.

2349
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Steam Link, I don't know, I always thought maybe there was a better calling for that, because especially when Steam got more into movies and stuff, but I kind of feel like Steam kind of brought out movies and then really didn't do anything with it.

2350
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Like, I feel like they missed the ball on that.

2351
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Yeah, I mean, if you built a Steam box and you loaded it where all you have to do is load the software, log in with your Steam account and bring everything forward, I think that would be good, but you still have extra stuff to do that.

2352
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Hell, I mean, with Windows 10 S that's coming down the route, I mean, if you could just have a decent front end for a media PC where you don't have to do anything special, just turn it on and it just comes right up like a console, you're good.

2353
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Yes. Agreed.

2354
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I mean, think about it, I mean, Xbox, 360, one, they're all Windows OSes, but it boots directly to a front end, that's it.

2355
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:37,000
And I don't see, and the thing is, nobody's really kind of making that forward. You kind of can, by building your own machine and running scripts or automatic executables to bring it right up, but you should be able to just have a special front end edition of Windows where you load it, you log in, then once you log in, you tell the front end to come up, you reboot, you're golden.

2356
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Well, I gotta say though, you know, when it comes to the Steam Link, as much as I'm sitting here going, oh, the Steam Link is something that makes more sense, honestly, I can't tell you the last time I used mine. You know, when I want to play a computer game, sometimes I just want to be sitting at the computer.

2357
02:28:51,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Exactly. And I mean, my apartment is probably the size of your studio, so I can either go to my TV to play whatever consoles, if I want to jump on a steam, I just walk four feet over back to my PC and sit down in front and go for the gusto.

2358
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Yeah, and Rage Nator is giving a very similar scenario in chat saying my PC is right next to my new 40 inch TV, so Steam Box and Steam Link are unnecessary for me. Like if your living space or situation is small enough where it's kind of like all in the same place anyway, you know, then it doesn't make a lot of sense.

2359
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:36,000
But you know, Alan and I rent a three bedroom house, so we thought it made more sense for us, but even then, it's not really needed. Like if I want to play something like Civilization on Steam, I'm not gonna do that on the TV.

2360
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Now, if I end up dumping $210 to get all seven Pinball Arcade Seasons, maybe that's something I do. I don't think I'll really do that, but I might buy some of these tables on PC that are like my fave fave fave ones, and then kind of go from there, but yeah.

2361
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Okay, now that you mentioned Civilization, now I remember the other thing I want to talk about. SimCity.

2362
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Oh, okay.

2363
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:05,000
You're talking to someone who sat there in junior high, in high school, and just played SimCity non-stop.

2364
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Dude, that game is a classic. I used to play that game a shit ton on our very first 386 PC. I used to play that game all the time.

2365
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I wanted SimTown so badly because I thought it was a fun game. I just wanted it so badly. I wanted SimCity for Super Nintendo when it came out, but I was told you gotta pick this or that because they didn't have SimCity in at the time, so I was like, tear.

2366
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Aww.

2367
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:34,000
But I actually went digging. I'm seriously thinking about purchasing SimCity 4 to play. Seriously.

2368
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Just so you can do some SimCity playing. Whatever you do, don't buy the 2013 version.

2369
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:56,000
I want you to know, I bought SimCity CD. I lost it in my move, but I can tell you, I actually had a physical copy of it on our podcast, Anime Jam Session. I think it was last season. It might be this season.

2370
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Ari, his intro music is from SimCity.

2371
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I had the SimCity 94 CD-ROM as well, and hell if I know where that is now. It's probably in my dad's garage somewhere. That's gonna be a fucking treasure if I find that someday.

2372
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Well, if you find that, I would love a copy in exchange. I'll hook you up with copies of Sonic CD and Sonic R for PC that came out years ago. I just stumbled across them, now trying to find my copy of Last Bronx and the other Sega fighting game that came out on PC.

2373
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:38,000
By the way, I see the chat happening right now between you and Bobby in chat, and I would actually agree with him too. Cities Skylines is kind of like what we think SimCity, the new one, should have been.

2374
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:45,000
So if you haven't even played Cities Skylines yet, that might satisfy the itch. And there's a lot of people playing that.

2375
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Plus they have an expansion now, so if you wanted to play RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 as well on top of that, they have that theme park expansion.

2376
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Right, they have the theme park expansion. So I'm gonna give a hearty OLR recommendation to that to you.

2377
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:15,000
You know what? I might just have to, because before SimCity came out for mobile, I kept looking around for a game that came close, but it's like, you had to do these extra features in order to do this one thing. I'm just like, I can't sit here and play this, so no. So I'm definitely gonna have to check into that.

2378
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Yeah, I definitely recommend.

2379
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I may just have to. I mean, between that, Age of Empires and Mini Metro, I think I'm gonna be a happy little nerd for a while.

2380
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Alright, well remember to go outside once in a while and drink plenty of water.

2381
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I have no choice but to go outside. It's called work. I have no choice but to drink water. I mean, there's a water fountain at work, so you know. I gotta pay for the habit, and you can't tell if you can hear it.

2382
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I'm tapping that vein, and that's the vein where I inject the money to play the games. And what's in that injection? The weekly paycheck.

2383
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
That certainly doesn't sound like tapping a vein.

2384
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I know. I'm glad to know your basic needs are taken care of, Rama.

2385
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Let's not talk about my Friday night, okay?

2386
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Alright. Alright, I'm gonna let you go, so we can try to squeeze in one more call, but thank you.

2387
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Okay, bye.

2388
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Alright, bye. We'll see if we can squeeze in one more call. OrangeLaundrio, all one word on Skype. Loki, I haven't really been looking to you for last minute stories. Anything else you wanna bring up here?

2389
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Yeah, we got lots of stuff. So, Super Mario 64 Online is coming back. They had that whole season in the system that came down. For those of you who don't remember, that was the online multiplayer version of Super Mario 64.

2390
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
It let you play Waluigi in it.

2391
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Yes, now you can play Waluigi, and Sonic, and Knuckles, and a bunch of other characters. Plus, they've added a capture the flag mode as well, so that's out there now.

2392
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Sounds like fun.

2393
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Yeah.

2394
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Let me get to a call, actually. We got one more call coming in. I'm gonna try to grab this here. Hi, you're on OrangeLaundrio. Who's this?

2395
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Hey, this is Regineater.

2396
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Hey buddy, what's on your mind tonight?

2397
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Not a whole lot. Well, two topics. I'll start with the one that I immediately called in about.

2398
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Okay.

2399
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:20,000
As everyone knows, I've been mainly a PC gamer for the past, going on six years now, and I have dabbled with the 360 to a certain degree over the past few months.

2400
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:29,000
And of course, I grew up with console gaming, and God knows I play virtually anything put in front of me.

2401
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Now, with all that being said, would you recommend getting a current gen system, be it the Switch, Xbox One, or a PS4, considering that I get games updated on PC, or should I just stick to mainly PC?

2402
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I'm not sure that's something we can answer for you, Regineater, because you have to ask yourself, you know, is what you have enough? Do you feel satisfied with what you have?

2403
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Do you think there's enough for the entertainment in those things that you have? And I'm sure, you know, I know you're a deal hunter. We make a lot of jokes here on OLR about the, you know, free games and all that stuff.

2404
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:25,000
But I'm sure over the years, you've built up quite a little library on your 360 and your PC, and if that is enough to satisfy you, then you know what? Then you're good.

2405
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:31,000
And you don't have to buy these systems just because other people are buying these systems. It doesn't make you any less of a gamer or anything like that.

2406
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Now, on the other hand, if you're sitting there going, God, I see these videos for Breath of the Wild, and I see these things for Mario Odyssey, and man, I am missing the fuck out because these things are not on PC.

2407
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Or, you know, that goes other ways, too. You know, if you're watching, you know, the clips of PlayStation 4 games, you know, like, God, I really want to be able to play Horizon or God of War.

2408
02:35:52,000 --> 02:36:09,000
God, everybody's fucking raving about God of War, but it's like, I can't get that on PC. Then you have to start asking yourself, you know, that harder question of, well, like any luxury, like going on a trip, going, you know, getting booze one night, going to a movie.

2409
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Like any luxury, is it worth the effort for me to really save for that to enjoy that? Or would my money be better spent? Just, I'm perfectly, I'm getting, I get the same satisfaction out of finding 10 bargains for five bucks a pop on the 360.

2410
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Yeah, you know, my thought is, you know, don't get me wrong, I love PC gaming. I'm always talking about this deal, that deal, whatever. I get more PC games than I can possibly count or play in a lifetime.

2411
02:36:45,000 --> 02:37:08,000
But, you know, in fact, you kind of touched on it. PC gaming doesn't have everything, you know, like, you know, Sony has the Uncharted series, you know, Microsoft has like the Forza series, and hell, I just picked up Forza Horizon 2 on my 360 not too, too long ago.

2412
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:25,000
I mean, enjoying the crap out of that. I mean, unfortunately, as far as I know, to get anything newer than Forza Horizon 2, I would probably have to get an Xbox One. So that's where I'm kind of now having this little debate.

2413
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Well, yeah, I all I can really do is wish you luck in that it seems like you would get a lot of value out of Xbox One because the fact you have the backwards compatibility and all that stuff. But at the same time, you know, you already have a rich Microsoft library, maybe it's time to go to Nintendo.

2414
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:53,000
But don't forget that is that not only do you have to get the system, you have to get the games. So one thing that the Xbox One would give you is that while you already have several games that are going to carry around on over to Xbox One, but they're not going to look any different than they do now on 360.

2415
02:37:54,000 --> 02:38:00,000
A lot of that is a convenience thing when it comes to many of those games. Anyway, you said you had another question. Let's get to that real quick.

2416
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Yeah, well, I kind of touched on that to a degree when I called Bobby's show earlier, but I started commenting on the whole pinball arcade losing the bulk of the tables.

2417
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Yeah, what's your thought?

2418
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Pardon?

2419
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:21,000
What's your thought?

2420
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Well, the thing is, you know, I can understand why they're losing it. Unfortunately, I can't control what Williams is doing.

2421
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:39,000
But at the same time, I'm kind of sad to see the tables go.

2422
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Yeah, I mean, you know, unfortunately, I've been kind of neglecting buying the seasons and whatnot for that game compared to pinball effects.

2423
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:04,000
But, you know, these games, whether you're talking about pinball effects or pinball arcade, they're fun to sell.

2424
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Yeah, sure. Bobby can attest to that. New guys can attest to that. I mean, no.

2425
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Well, I don't know if Dark Soccer was here. She'd say, I have the real thing in my garage. But not everybody has that. And we know that not everybody takes their pinball love to that level. That's a very special level.

2426
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:29,000
You know what, though? I want to bring up an interesting point from Brad from Pod Culture in our chat who says used OG XB1s are pretty cheap-ish.

2427
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:36,000
You know, he makes a good point because, you know, how we talked about the whole, like, luxury budget, you know, and you mentioned that you're into the pinball arcade.

2428
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Now, not that I don't think you've maybe dropped this much on pinball arcade, especially all at once. But we all know that, you know, there's not going to be a sale for pinball arcade.

2429
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:49,000
So I'm sorry to break your heart on that, but that is due to the licensing and all that.

2430
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:59,000
So the reality is, all seven seasons here before they go away are going to be $210. Whether you bought them before or you buy them now, it's going to set you back over $200.

2431
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:03,000
You know what, Regenator? That's about the price of a used Xbox One.

2432
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Yeah. Well, admittedly, to date, I had bought two full seasons, season two and season three.

2433
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:20,000
And I think I bought, you know, the occasional eyeball table, like the next Star Trek Next Generation table.

2434
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:31,000
And I think one other one. But so I won't necessarily have to drop the full $210 between now and the day of June.

2435
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:38,000
But, you know, even then, you know, I won't be able to drop all that money, you know, you know, for all the seasons.

2436
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
So I could have to be a little selective.

2437
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Yeah. I'm not going to drop all that money either because some of these machines I just don't have that same attachment to like F14 Tomcat.

2438
02:40:49,000 --> 02:41:00,000
I mean, not I'm sure it's a fine table, a solid table, but not one that evokes those childhood memories in the same way that, say, Tales of Arabian Nights or the Pinbot family does.

2439
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
You know, it's not quite the same thing. So I might be a little more picky choosy, too.

2440
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Yeah. And the thing is, you know, well, I don't live in California like you guys.

2441
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:19,000
I never had the chance to go to these cons or whatever you want to call them.

2442
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:31,000
They have all these people tables on display in most places that are in my area that have had arcades, you know, over the years.

2443
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Not very rarely, if ever, have pinball tables.

2444
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:48,000
So a lot of these classic tables I never really got a chance to play over the years is mostly actual upright arcade games more than anything.

2445
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Keep an eye out, Raginator. You never know when they'll show up in the area.

2446
02:41:52,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Yeah. So a lot of these classic pinball tables, I played for the first time through pinball arcade.

2447
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:09,000
So, you know, with these tables going, you know, it's going to hurt a little bit.

2448
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Yeah. Hopefully, you know, even though I think Farsight did a fine job and deserves to keep the license, I mean, the reality is, if Williams is going to revoke it,

2449
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:23,000
and they're taking it somewhere else, I hope they're at least going to be able to put this out somewhere else.

2450
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:28,000
But, you know, based on everything we talked about with YYR, it's not going to be as easy as just getting the table.

2451
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Because especially with these things that tie into TV and movies, it goes a whole lot deeper than that.

2452
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:38,000
And another company may not have that drive that Farsight had.

2453
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Anyway, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up. But thank you so much for the call.

2454
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
All right. Sure. Have a nice night.

2455
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Yep. You too. Bye.

2456
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:53,000
All right. That will do it for the show tonight because I do know Bobby's going to be doing a live stream here after the show.

2457
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I don't want to keep him up too late, so I do want to wrap things up.

2458
02:42:55,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Let me just quickly get, like, the cliff note headlines from you here of anything else we missed here, Loki.

2459
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:05,000
We talked about that Crystal whatever game.

2460
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Yeah.

2461
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
So they also have a fighting game that's coming out too.

2462
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Oh, cool.

2463
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:13,000
So that one was called Blade Strangers, and it also has similar characters as well.

2464
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:25,000
They have the binding of Isaac, quote from Cave Story, Gunvolt from Azure Strikers, Gunvolt Solenge from Code Princess.

2465
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:32,000
And they had, like, other characters in there as well. So that looked kind of cool.

2466
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:35,000
And, yeah, I guess that's about it.

2467
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Oh, there's a new SNES game coming from Devolver Digital, Fork Parker's Crunch Out, talking about video game developer Crunch.

2468
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:50,000
And so that's something that you can actually get on a physical cart.

2469
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:56,000
They're going to have actual playable cartridges for $50 each, or you can get a special edition for $150.

2470
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Hmm.

2471
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
So interesting.

2472
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:04,000
And if you want to check that out, I believe they have it on MegaCatStudios.com.

2473
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
That's it.

2474
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,000
That's it.

2475
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:13,000
All right. Well, I want to thank you guys for downloading and checking out our show tonight.

2476
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf is saying, I bought this Super Nintendo game and I paid for the special edition cart.

2477
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Happy birthday to me.

2478
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Yes. Happy birthday to you.

2479
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:25,000
You know what? You get to spend that luxury money on whatever you want, and nobody gets to judge you for it.

2480
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:26,000
It's your money.

2481
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:30,000
And it's also your time, and we appreciate you taking the time out to listen to OLR every week.

2482
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:36,000
I hope we helped you get through the work day or the commute or live on Sunday night or however you choose to partake in Orange Ons Radio.

2483
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:40,000
We really appreciate you guys downloading the show and listening live and checking it out.

2484
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:43,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2485
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, you know, we can't air them.

2486
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
So that is really going to do it here.

2487
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,000
A five-star review on iTunes, Google Play, wherever you found the show.

2488
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Those go a very long way as well.

2489
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2490
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Hopefully I will work on game development again.

2491
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I've been trying to this week, but I've been just like really tired.

2492
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:21,000
I haven't been able to sleep well between the kids and the cat, because the cat decides to throw up in the most inconvenient spot at three in the morning and then sprint around the house, throwing up in each and every single room there.

2493
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
So that was annoying.

2494
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:30,000
So yeah, I just want to sit down and actually build a program, but I just don't have the mental capacity to do that at that point.

2495
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
It's almost like just go to sleep.

2496
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
So I'm going to try this week, hoping.

2497
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Although if it's anything like today, Outlook's not very positive.

2498
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:45,000
All right, and my final thought is I hope to get in some more game playing this week.

2499
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:52,000
It's been very, very busy this week and will probably continue to be for another couple of weeks, but hoping to get some more gaming time in soon.

2500
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
So that is going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

2501
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:57,000
We want to thank you guys again for taking the time out with us this week.

2502
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Sorry, you better make it fast because I'm wrapping up random tangent.

2503
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
I found some ice cream today.

2504
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:08,000
It's maple maple pancake ice cream.

2505
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,000
So it has its maple ice cream with bits of pancake and butter in it.

2506
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
OK, next time you're going to interrupt me with that.

2507
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:14,000
You better fucking bring me some.

2508
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
I almost did today.

2509
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
I did week.

2510
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
All right.

2511
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,000
That's it.

2512
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,000
We're done.

2513
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:23,000
We're out of here.

2514
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Dark soccer will be back next week.

2515
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,000
So we will all be here to do it all again until then.

2516
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Goodbye.

2517
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,000
And thanks.

2518
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:32,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2519
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:38,000
