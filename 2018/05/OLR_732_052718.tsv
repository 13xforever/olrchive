7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	On the heels of the phase-out of the PSP, one Sony chief speaks about rethinking mobile. Given the portability of the Nintendo Switch as well, we may be at a significant pivot point for mobile gaming. This is just one subject on a full night of gaming news. Join us for the rest, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	51000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 732 of our show for this May 27th, 2018. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined once again, I missed her, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers in the house.
51000	53000	What'd you throw?
53000	55000	Everything I possibly could.
55000	57000	If you threw a party, I was already at a party.
57000	60000	Old microphones, that's what I threw. I threw old microphones in the dumpster.
60000	62000	You know what was funny?
62000	68000	With our new mics, I actually considered going out and ordering myself a Pro-Sure.
69000	79000	Hey, if you want, remember when Jason used to come to the show a lot? Our voiceover guy Jason, if you don't know who does the intro here, he would come to the show, he brought his own mic.
79000	87000	And he sounds great on it. His very bassy tones that make him such a good announcer sound great. By the way, he might be here next week.
87000	89000	Oh, that'd be fun.
89000	91000	I should find where my Behringer mic went to.
91000	93000	But it was a good mic.
93000	101000	Anyway, it is a video game show, but I have to allow DarkSakura at least 30 seconds to talk about DragCon.
101000	103000	Oh my god, it was great.
103000	109000	You've been gone because you were at DragCon, so quickly, how is DragCon? If there's anything remotely video game related, you should probably bring that up too.
109000	113000	There is something, because my phone died right after DragCon and I lost some of my photos.
113000	115000	Oh no.
115000	121000	I was very sad, including my ones with Maha Miller. I have my photos with BibleGirl666, who I've been following on Twitter. She's never been on Drag Race.
121000	123000	I love Drag.
123000	125000	I got to meet Karen from Finance, because my friend JJ has friends with her.
125000	127000	Oh nice.
127000	129000	So I met Karen from Finance, who was a sweetheart.
129000	131000	She's Australian, right?
131000	135000	Yeah. Latrice Royale, and JJ gave her edibles and she was wonderfully happy.
135000	141000	But get Victoria to finish the Where Are You Going With Your Money story.
141000	143000	Okay.
143000	149000	Because she was at the season 4 thing and asked her, well Latrice said what happened after that. And it's not my story to tell.
149000	151000	Alright, that would be a reference.
151000	153000	You know the story though, right?
153000	155000	I remember when Victoria yelled at her from the stage.
155000	157000	And Latrice says somewhere sensual.
157000	159000	That's right.
159000	161000	Something sensual happened.
161000	163000	So Shaking and Crying is the show I do with Victoria.
163000	169000	We've been on a little bit of hiatus, because I was on this special project that was taking way more of my time than it should have been.
169000	173000	And then also, I had my allergy stuff. My voice was like gone.
173000	177000	It was really scary. So we've been off, but we should be back with Shaking and Crying this week.
177000	179000	So I will get her to give me the whole story.
179000	181000	Well, her sponge dress got us in to see Monet X Change.
181000	183000	Love it.
183000	191000	I'm still bitter, but I still love. I'm not mad at Cameron, but I'm bitter. I'll leave it that way.
191000	193000	Okay.
193000	199000	I literally, you know how like, maybe this is going to be my DragCon Kojima event, but I ran into Ms. Cracker.
199000	203000	We both turned around at the same time and nearly ran face first into each other.
203000	207000	And I was like, hi. She's like, I'm sorry, I got to go. And ran off.
207000	209000	You know, because they have to bustle in between here and there.
209000	211000	Sure.
211000	213000	So Friday, when we were back, I went to see Ms. Cracker.
213000	219000	And I was like, you remember a girl in red glasses wearing a red, you know, who was rocking her inner Shirley Manson?
219000	221000	That was you! That was me.
221000	223000	I also met Dita Ritz that night, who was also really nice.
223000	225000	You looked great, by the way.
225000	227000	Thank you. Thank you.
227000	231000	Yeah, I just, I got to hang out with Mayhem for a little bit.
231000	233000	Any game stuff in here?
233000	235000	A little bit. A little bit. I'll get to it.
235000	237000	Because I met Yuho Hamasaki.
237000	241000	And I was like, the moment I found out about you, I was like, oh my god, is it Ayumi?
241000	243000	And she's like, yeah, totally Ayumi fan.
243000	245000	I was like, so then are you a big fan of the Ayuro CD?
245000	247000	She's like, yes, I am.
247000	251000	I was like, so then if we're going to go any further than that, then are you a Eurobeat fan in general?
251000	255000	She's like, yeah, I really like Eurobeat, you know, talking about the Initial D soundtrack.
255000	257000	I was like, okay, cool.
257000	259000	So Yuho was really nice.
259000	263000	Okay, so we got one drag queen that's an Initial D fan. Good.
263000	265000	The white horse was there, by the way.
265000	269000	From the disco thing from All Stars.
269000	271000	A triumph car was there, that was really cool.
271000	273000	But there was a cosplay.
273000	275000	Okay, oh!
275000	281000	So we had, what's the character with the chainsaw from Undertale?
281000	283000	Oh, I...
283000	285000	That same cosplayer was at GamerX, by the way.
285000	287000	I know exactly what you're talking about, but I don't remember the name of the character.
287000	289000	It's not Comic or Sans, I know that.
289000	295000	We also had just a bunch of different...
295000	297000	I think you're thinking...
297000	298000	Toriel?
298000	299000	Yeah, Toriel.
299000	301000	Okay, I didn't get to that part.
301000	303000	No, not Toriel.
303000	305000	Toriel's the goat one.
305000	307000	The little goat.
307000	309000	This was the robot one with the chainsaw that has the heart on their face.
310000	312000	But anyway, you know,
312000	314000	and, you know,
314000	316000	Victoria walked in that, too.
316000	318000	There were just a few other really funny ones.
318000	319000	Mettaton.
319000	321000	Mettaton. That was it. Mettaton.
321000	323000	So, but it was...
323000	325000	There was some cosplay.
325000	327000	Oh! There was Digimon cosplay.
327000	329000	This one queen.
329000	331000	And I got this one picture.
331000	333000	Did Mimi from Digimon.
333000	337000	And also, her name is
337000	339000	Anyonka, because she misspelled it
339000	341000	when she first made the name back in the day and kept it.
341000	347000	But she does other video game and anime cosplay and drag.
347000	349000	And then there was an Anji woman there the next day,
349000	351000	and that's one of the photos I lost.
351000	353000	I was so sad.
353000	355000	But yeah, there was also
355000	358000	just other cosplayers, like someone was there as
358000	361000	Rudy Road from The Fifth Element.
361000	363000	Trixie was in Booty Shorts.
363000	364000	Oh, Ruby Rod.
364000	365000	Ruby Rod, sorry.
365000	367000	Trixie was in Booty Shorts buying for Morphe.
367000	369000	Alright, I gotta read some of these comments from chat.
369000	371000	Wait, one last one?
371000	373000	Alright, one last one.
373000	375000	Freakin' Shangela comes in on a litter
375000	377000	and sits on her throne
377000	379000	like the motherfuckin' Khaleesi she is.
379000	381000	We do tape live, of course,
381000	383000	every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,
383000	385000	9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
385000	387000	at The Voice of Geeks Network,
387000	389000	vognetwork.com, and you guys can chat along with us
389000	391000	at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
391000	393000	where Nifty Swirl says,
394000	396000	Maybe someday they'll reboot it.
396000	398000	Yeah, we didn't really get into all that.
398000	400000	Not according to what's been coming from Matt.
400000	402000	Well, here's the thing, obviously,
402000	404000	like, things are different now.
404000	406000	Let's just put it that way. Things are different now
406000	408000	and I'm just gonna leave it at that.
408000	410000	But here's the thing, I think a lot of the concepts
410000	412000	that were brought up with that,
412000	414000	you know, expo and everything,
414000	417000	is bigger than any one person.
417000	419000	You know, so, you know,
419000	421000	because it says maybe they'll reboot it.
421000	423000	Well, you know, I mean, I don't think you meant it this way,
423000	425000	but I mean, you don't have to wait on any one person
425000	427000	or one group to do this.
427000	429000	Like, you can take these ideas
429000	432000	and the idea that everybody should have a place
432000	435000	to play video games and that it's not about
435000	437000	excluding straight white men.
437000	440000	It's about making sure you're including everybody else
440000	442000	by welcoming folks to the table.
442000	445000	You know, here at OLR, we've talked about how OLR,
445000	447000	the way we envision the show is that we're all sitting
447000	450000	at the big diner table after playing DDR
450000	453000	and we're trying to welcome all people to our table, right?
453000	456000	I still think that we should do diversity panels at conventions.
456000	458000	Yeah, so that's my thing, is that, you know,
458000	461000	if there is not going to be another GamerX,
461000	463000	and maybe there will, I don't know.
463000	465000	I mean, obviously, things are different,
465000	468000	so it's gonna be interesting how that might work.
468000	472000	But why not inject a little bit of that into every convention?
472000	475000	And that would be something I would hope to see moving forward.
475000	478000	And, you know, maybe it has already worked out a little bit.
478000	481000	Like PAX has done a very good job with, you know,
481000	484000	as critical as I am of that show sometimes on a bigger scale,
484000	487000	the fact that they do the diversity lounge
487000	489000	and that they do try to have that awareness there
489000	492000	and that they do have some of those panels, you know, that's cool.
492000	494000	That's, you know, a big step forward.
494000	496000	So that's, I guess those are my thoughts on that
496000	499000	because, of course, I was really sad just to see everything
499000	501000	that, you know, went down with GamerX,
501000	506000	but it's one of those things where I get it, you know?
506000	509000	There's a lot more involved than what's on the surface.
509000	510000	I'm sure, I'm sure.
510000	513000	And, you know, so, okay, you know, things are different now,
513000	516000	so how can we proceed as a community?
516000	519000	Because those ideas were bigger than any one person or three people.
519000	521000	You can start changes right in your own local convention.
521000	524000	That's right. That's absolutely fucking right.
524000	527000	By the way, Bobby asked if I used the right hashtag
527000	531000	because he, DragCon, put out a thing that said don't use DragonCon.
531000	534000	Yeah, they actually had a Jinx monsoon in that video.
534000	536000	It looked like she was so fucking high when she did that video.
536000	539000	But, yeah, they had the whole don't use DragCon
539000	542000	because of autocorrect or whatever it was, use DragCon.
542000	545000	Although they did acknowledge DragonCon is a real thing in Atlanta.
545000	549000	Yeah, but I used my right hashtag, so everything was great.
549000	551000	And we did it in Disneyland the next day,
551000	553000	and I had a sad moment, speaking of games.
553000	556000	The sign for the starkade is still up.
556000	558000	Oh.
558000	561000	Yeah, we came out, they're doing Hyperspace Mountain right now,
561000	563000	which is pretty fun, I mean.
563000	567000	But, yeah, I stopped and looked up outside Star Trader,
567000	569000	you know, where the starkade was,
569000	574000	and I was telling JJ, who was also Miss Patsy Declined,
574000	579000	where the starkade was and what it used to be like,
579000	582000	and then I looked up and I was like, oh, holy shit, there's the sign.
582000	586000	This was the starkade, and the whole thing's closed off now.
586000	590000	So, you know, I pointed out like a few where things used to be,
590000	593000	but there was the crappiest thing happened.
593000	595000	We were going to do Big Thunder for our last ride,
595000	597000	when we got out from Blue Bayou.
597000	600000	And so we had time, so we were going to do Hunter Mansion.
600000	602000	Hunter Mansion broke while we were in line.
602000	606000	So then we went over to do our Fast Passes at Big Thunder.
606000	608000	It broke down.
608000	610000	So we didn't get to go on Big Thunder at all.
610000	614000	And then we went over to do Indy, and it broke down.
614000	616000	So our last...
616000	620000	It cost 105 bucks to get a park offer for Disney.
620000	624000	Excuse me. But we did Jungle Cruise for our last one.
624000	625000	Okay.
625000	628000	With a tour guide who did not give a fuck.
628000	629000	In a good way or in a bad way?
629000	630000	In a good way.
630000	631000	Okay, good.
631000	633000	She started doing some of the jokes that they're not allowed to do.
633000	634000	Oh, good.
634000	636000	Like, I'm going to tell you my favorite one of them.
636000	638000	Okay. And then we have to introduce,
638000	640000	there is a third person on this show we have to introduce.
640000	643000	When you go by the snake, like right before you get to Trader Sam,
643000	645000	she's like, what kind of snake is this?
645000	647000	She's like, I'll give you a clue. It starts with a P.
647000	649000	We're like, Python, no plastic.
649000	656000	Because you're not supposed to break the 1800s joke book.
656000	658000	Because I would have yelled penis.
658000	659000	Well, girl.
659000	660000	Alright, but I have issues.
660000	662000	She was like, do you want the thing? Because you can do it too.
662000	664000	I was like, will you let me?
664000	667000	Look, we're ten minutes into the show, and we need to introduce,
667000	669000	but of course we've missed you for the past couple weeks.
669000	671000	And I did play a shitload of pinball on Friday, but I'll tell you about that later.
671000	673000	Alright, we'll get into our gaming weeks.
673000	675000	But first, we've got to get over to Tech Master Loki. Hi.
675000	676000	Hello.
676000	677000	How are you?
677000	678000	I'm here.
678000	679000	You are here.
679000	680000	Yes.
680000	683000	Yes, and you also have a new mic. It's new mic Monday, except it's Sunday.
683000	685000	So, new mic Sunday.
685000	686000	Here at Studio OLR.
686000	688000	New mic on Sunday.
688000	690000	How was your week? Did you do anything exciting?
690000	693000	Have you been doing anything with your long weekend?
693000	696000	Just having to deal with the kids.
696000	700000	It's been just annoying as fuck today.
700000	702000	I heard about the breakfast incident.
702000	704000	No, it's been the whole day. It's just been whining.
704000	709000	Like, yesterday was whining about stuff, and then today has been whining about stuff.
709000	712000	And God, I just don't want to deal with it anymore.
712000	718000	Well, you're only locked in for about another, what, 13 years before they go off to college?
718000	720000	You can do it.
720000	723000	Well, I hope they won't be whining like this then.
723000	726000	Teenagers are worse, Loki. What are you talking about?
726000	727000	Teenage boys.
727000	729000	Are you sure?
729000	731000	Are you sure?
731000	734000	Teenage boys have to be taught what consent is.
734000	735000	Yes.
735000	737000	Have to be taught, you know, things.
737000	742000	Teenage boys are just as much of a problem as teenage girls, and I was a teenage girl once.
742000	747000	I don't think those topics are going to be an issue for Loki's kids, but, you know, they've got to stop whining.
747000	749000	Alright, anyway.
749000	755000	We do, of course, again tape live on Sunday nights, and you can join us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
755000	757000	It's kind of quiet in there right now.
757000	761000	I don't think a lot of comments on DragCon, except Sia Tabiri does say,
761000	765000	Jinx would have been one of the queens who would have been more aware of what DragCon was than she seemed.
765000	767000	Tatiana's a gamer.
767000	772000	Well, there's a couple of the Drag Race alumni that'll, like, Dax exclamation points there every year,
772000	777000	and some of the other, like, local, you know, people in Atlanta will be there, so.
777000	780000	And I'll be there, so you should make plans to be in Atlanta Labor Day weekend.
780000	783000	By the way, I wanted to get a little pancake doll.
783000	784000	Oh, love it.
784000	786000	And they were a hundred bucks.
787000	788000	That's too expensive.
788000	790000	So, and I wasn't also going to wait in line for Alaska.
790000	791000	Yeah, yeah.
791000	796000	But, next year, when I go to DragCon, I'm cosplaying a little pancake.
796000	797000	You should.
797000	798000	It is happening.
798000	799000	Do it.
799000	803000	Anyway, in two weeks, speaking of Atlanta, I do want to give a shout out to this,
803000	808000	because VOG Network is going to be sponsoring the weekend of June 8th and 9th,
808000	811000	the Siege, or, no, sorry, not Siege.
811000	813000	If I can even remember the name of it.
813000	815000	Sorry, I got it confused with something else.
815000	816000	Atlanta.
816000	817000	No, it's something else, sorry.
817000	819000	It's the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
819000	821000	Different, different acronym.
821000	823000	Southern Fried Game Room Expo is the thing.
823000	825000	It's a five-hour flight for me.
825000	828000	That's why I'm not always the best at committing all these acronyms to memory.
828000	831000	But the Southern Fried Game Room Expo is happening in Atlanta.
831000	834000	And, you know, it's a lot like how we have California Extreme up here,
834000	837000	or that pinball thing that Jamie's going to talk about,
837000	840000	where they have, like, classic game stuff, and then, of course, they do panels.
840000	844000	Our very own Bobby Blackwolf here at the network is going to be moderating a panel
844000	846000	with Billy Mitchell and Walter Day,
846000	850000	and this is after many interesting things have happened with those two individuals,
850000	852000	so that panel is going to be a lot of fun.
852000	854000	So check that out.
854000	857000	So that is happening in the Atlanta area in just a couple of weekends.
857000	859000	Yes, thank you, Bobby. I got it.
859000	860000	Are they doing a panel on MAME?
860000	861000	I corrected myself.
861000	863000	Are they doing a panel on MAME?
863000	865000	I mean, they don't know what it is, right?
865000	869000	That is for Bobby to determine when he's going to be the one asking those questions.
869000	870000	So check that out.
870000	873000	What main version are you rocking in that cabinet over there?
874000	879000	Anyway, would you say your favorite musical on Broadway is anti-MAME?
879000	883000	Anyway, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
883000	887000	This isn't, like, totally about video games,
887000	891000	but it's something that a lot of people are talking about in the gaming community.
891000	894000	It came up on our Discord, which you can join our Discord community
894000	896000	at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
896000	898000	That's all you need for the invite.
898000	900000	And on the Discord, they were talking about this.
900000	906000	It has to do with a nerdy show that I know a lot of people love, Doctor Who.
906000	908000	And how it's a little bit adjacent to gaming
908000	911000	is the fact that they're going to be bringing it to Twitch.
911000	916000	Now, Twitch is mostly known as a gaming live streaming platform
916000	918000	where you can play video games and people watch
918000	921000	and, you know, build your audience and interact with them and all that good stuff.
921000	925000	But, you know, more and more, Twitch has been getting into other stuff, too, right?
925000	929000	Like, you know, we know that they do competitive esports like Overwatch League.
929000	932000	It's like you're watching something on ESPN or something,
932000	934000	but it's on Twitch and it's about a video game.
934000	938000	Or even the more IRL stuff like talk shows like this one.
938000	942000	Competitive eating sorts of things.
942000	944000	Competitive eating while doing a talk show.
944000	947000	Yes, right, competitive eating while doing your talk show and all that.
947000	951000	And, of course, Twitch and marathons, not completely unheard of
951000	956000	because we had a Bob Ross marathon that was pretty legendary over there, right?
956000	958000	I don't know if you guys watched the Bob Ross marathon as much as I did,
958000	963000	but it's one of those rare instances where, like, chat was a good thing.
963000	965000	Like, usually with a marathon like this, I'd be like,
965000	967000	don't fucking read the comments, don't read chat.
967000	968000	It's going to be a cesspool.
968000	972000	But, like, the Bob Ross one was, like, really fucking good.
972000	976000	Because you know how Bob Ross is so quiet and timid when he paints
976000	978000	and, you know, makes these happy little trees?
978000	980000	I can't believe he was ever a drill sergeant.
980000	981000	I know, right?
981000	982000	Oh, my God.
982000	984000	But anyway, so he used to say, like,
984000	987000	oh, we're just going to dip this paintbrush in the water
987000	989000	then we're going to beat the devil out of that brush.
989000	991000	We're going to beat the devil out of that brush.
991000	994000	And then the whole chat would light up going, R.I.P. devil.
994000	995000	Devil hacks.
995000	997000	You know, like, all this stuff.
997000	998000	Like, really funny shit.
998000	1003000	So I'm very excited to see what happens when Doctor Who shows up on Twitch.
1003000	1004000	Now, here's the thing.
1004000	1007000	I think when most of you think of Doctor Who in these days,
1007000	1012000	you're thinking of, like, David Tennant and, you know,
1012000	1013000	who are the other people that have played?
1013000	1017000	Peter Capaldi and Christopher Eccleston, Matt Smith.
1017000	1018000	Matt Smith.
1018000	1019000	OK, yeah.
1019000	1022000	It's one of those things, like, my train isn't derailed.
1022000	1024000	My train is just moving slowly tonight.
1024000	1026000	Like, I'm thinking of things, like, five seconds after they leave my mouth.
1026000	1030000	Anyway, so most people think of the newer Doctor Who stuff,
1030000	1032000	but actually that is not a part of this marathon, OK?
1032000	1036000	So that was the reboot that started in 2005 that's actually still going.
1036000	1039000	But anyhow, so that's not a part of it.
1039000	1043000	But Doctor Who actually started, what, 1963?
1043000	1044000	Yeah, something like that.
1044000	1047000	It's a very much older show.
1047000	1049000	With Mr. Hartnell.
1049000	1055000	So the episodes that air between 1963 and 1989 are going to be on Twitch
1055000	1057000	starting on May 29th.
1057000	1060000	What they're going to do, they're going to do an eight-hour block
1060000	1061000	three times a day.
1061000	1065000	So if you miss something, you can catch it again.
1065000	1067000	You have, like, a chance to catch it again before they're rotated out.
1067000	1071000	I wonder if they're going to do any of the recovered footage
1071000	1074000	from the BBC purge during the second Doctor?
1074000	1076000	Yeah, I heard about that. The ones that were lost.
1076000	1079000	They found audio and then did animated versions to that audio.
1079000	1082000	And then there were others that they tried to restore
1082000	1084000	that were people filming their televisions.
1084000	1088000	A few roles were recovered, but yeah, the BBC did a big purge
1088000	1091000	of, like, a lot of their old television episodes
1091000	1093000	and some of it was Second Doctor.
1093000	1097000	They have not said. They have not said if these episodes are a part of it or not.
1097000	1100000	I just care about Fourth Doctor stuff, really.
1100000	1102000	I think that's where a lot of people are.
1102000	1104000	They just want to see the Tom Baker stuff.
1104000	1107000	And Sylvester McCoy, because I really freaking like Ace.
1107000	1109000	She's like one of my favorite companions.
1109000	1113000	Well, 500 episodes from the show's classic period will be streamed.
1113000	1117000	Eight hours of Who per day starting at 11 a.m. Pacific is when the block starts.
1117000	1121000	And then that's going to be three times that it's going to be repeated.
1121000	1122000	Also, prizes will be given out.
1122000	1125000	If you watch ten minutes of Doctor Who in a day,
1125000	1128000	you are entered into a drawing to win a Doctor Who fan pack
1128000	1132000	that includes a TARDIS money box, a themed Monopoly set,
1132000	1136000	and a Doctor Who doormat so you can walk all over your favorite Doctor.
1136000	1140000	There's a grand prize as well, which is a trip to London Comic-Con,
1140000	1141000	so that's pretty cool.
1141000	1144000	You know, I'm not, like, super into Doctor Who,
1144000	1146000	but I certainly don't dislike it.
1146000	1149000	Like, I watched some of the Eccleston ones because that's where I decided to start.
1149000	1152000	And it was good. I just, you know, me and watching TV,
1152000	1154000	I don't always get to binge everything.
1154000	1156000	And then I'll, like, start binging something,
1156000	1159000	and then suddenly somebody's like, you have to watch 13 Reasons Why.
1159000	1160000	Or you have to watch Stranger Things.
1160000	1162000	No, you do not have to watch 13 Reasons Why.
1162000	1164000	Do you know how many people are telling me I need to watch that show?
1164000	1165000	I haven't watched it yet.
1165000	1167000	No, please, please don't support that show.
1167000	1170000	It does terrible things and completely misrepresents suicide.
1170000	1173000	Well, anyway, I have watched Stranger Things.
1173000	1175000	That was the one I did. That was really good.
1175000	1179000	And I still need to finish Queer Eye because there's a second season coming out.
1179000	1181000	Some of those guys were at DragCon.
1181000	1182000	Oh, really?
1182000	1183000	I didn't say anything.
1183000	1184000	Oh, God.
1184000	1188000	Every time I hit a trouble spot in my life, I just think,
1188000	1192000	WWJVND, what would Jonathan Van Ness do?
1192000	1194000	I just think, what would Carson Kressley wear?
1194000	1196000	He would probably call something gorgeous.
1196000	1198000	It's gorgeous. It's gorgeous.
1198000	1204000	Anyway, over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com,
1204000	1208000	Nifty Squirrel wants to know, is the fanny pack bigger on the inside?
1208000	1209000	Yes, I hope so.
1209000	1213000	That's so funny because you know what fanny is everywhere else in the world?
1213000	1215000	It means vagina.
1215000	1216000	It's vagina, right?
1216000	1217000	Yes.
1217000	1220000	So anyway, well, fanny is your bottom, is your booty.
1220000	1225000	At least if you are international, you did not know that that's what we take fanny to mean.
1225000	1227000	But it's just like pants.
1227000	1231000	I put on pants in the morning, but I'm thinking like jeans.
1231000	1232000	Trousers.
1232000	1233000	Or slacks, right?
1233000	1234000	That's pants to us.
1234000	1236000	Pants everywhere else is your unders.
1236000	1239000	Yeah, your under thingies. So, kind of interesting.
1239000	1243000	Not the thingies that go in your under thingies, but the thingies that go over your under under thingies.
1243000	1249000	Which is, ironically, you know how some people really get bothered by the word moist and things like that?
1249000	1254000	Okay, you know what, underpants, I think that is the dumbest word. You sound like you're like three years old.
1254000	1256000	That's why you just call them pants.
1256000	1257000	I don't lie.
1257000	1262000	It's also funny because then you can say, when we give someone a wedgie, you can say you pantsed someone.
1262000	1265000	But that's just you pulled down your pants. You pulled down their pants.
1265000	1266000	But you wedgie.
1266000	1267000	Anyway.
1267000	1268000	Oh, whatever.
1268000	1270000	Oh, forget it. Alright, look. We're going to move on.
1270000	1274000	I wanted to ask you guys, though, about the Doctor Who stuff and this Twitch thing.
1274000	1281000	Well, A, what do you think about this kind of direction for Twitch where we're seeing more and more non-gaming content on Twitch?
1281000	1284000	Is this the future of television?
1284000	1285000	I don't hate it.
1285000	1286000	You don't hate it?
1286000	1287000	I'm not mad at it.
1287000	1288000	I'm not mad at it either.
1288000	1289000	It's fine.
1289000	1295000	You know, it's good. And the thing that I like is that it'll give people easy access to seeing the classic Who to see.
1295000	1297000	Know your roots. Know your doctors.
1297000	1303000	You know, I mean, yeah, Tom Baker made a cameo in one of the specials.
1303000	1309000	You know, but still, you know, it's better to watch him as the doctor.
1309000	1310000	Right.
1310000	1312000	And, yeah.
1312000	1315000	And that fantastic scarf and outfit.
1315000	1317000	You know the BBC released that scarf pattern.
1317000	1318000	Oh, good.
1318000	1319000	To knit it.
1319000	1320000	But, yeah, he had the hat.
1320000	1321000	Yeah.
1321000	1322000	And I mean, of course.
1322000	1323000	It was an ensemble.
1323000	1326000	It was an ordeal.
1326000	1331000	And him and Lala Ward, which he actually married her after and then they got divorced.
1331000	1335000	But it's just funny, you know, watching them together.
1335000	1338000	And then it's just really.
1338000	1341000	Go back and watch the seventh Doctor, though.
1341000	1342000	Oh, my God.
1342000	1343000	That is cranky, Doctor.
1343000	1345000	And he is the best.
1345000	1347000	Let me get to this chat comment and then I'll ask Loki your thoughts.
1348000	1349000	From Bobby in chat.
1349000	1354000	Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's on before us here at Vogue is saying, I think it's interesting
1354000	1361000	that Twitch is reintroducing live TV viewing again, something we stopped doing with Netflix,
1361000	1362000	Hulu and so forth.
1362000	1367000	That's a very good point is that the whole like community coming together and like chatting
1367000	1374000	about it is kind of like like Twitch has kind of done that where other people kind of started
1374000	1375000	to do that.
1375000	1379000	And then like the breaks got hit on it like and I'm thinking of like, remember when Netflix
1379000	1383000	had the party mode on 360 and then that got the plug pulled on it.
1383000	1386000	But that was like a really fun thing to do with friends is to watch stuff together and
1386000	1390000	comment or TV, TV.
1390000	1395000	I remember the we use little thing that they had where you could actually do the chat alongs
1395000	1397000	and stuff with football games and American Idol.
1397000	1401000	Yeah, you probably don't remember it because Nintendo was horrible at promoting it.
1401000	1403000	I can imagine that shit with Drag Race, though.
1403000	1404000	Oh, my God.
1404000	1405000	Right.
1405000	1406000	So that's what we needed.
1406000	1408000	We need a Twitch Drag Race feed or something.
1408000	1409000	Anyway.
1409000	1410000	Right.
1410000	1412000	Loki, what are your thoughts on Doctor Who coming to Twitch and like what that could
1412000	1414000	mean for the future of like television?
1414000	1415000	It's cool.
1415000	1417000	I never watched Doctor Who.
1417000	1419000	So, yeah, I don't know.
1419000	1420000	I'll check it out.
1420000	1423000	I'll watch it a little bit, even though I don't know a lot about the classic ones.
1423000	1424000	Yeah.
1424000	1428000	I mean, it's neat that they're experimenting with that kind of stuff.
1428000	1429000	I think we are.
1429000	1433000	For me, I think we are looking in a little bit of a way at the future of television because
1433000	1439000	there's more and more stuff that people can home grow in this day and age.
1439000	1441000	So I can talk about this now.
1441000	1444000	The project that I was doing for the past couple of weeks that kind of kept me away
1444000	1447000	from a lot of things is that I was playing one of my like online games.
1447000	1450000	That's like the survivor esque type of game.
1450000	1453000	But I had to keep it a secret because that was part of the whole twist was that I'm not
1453000	1457000	going to get too into the details because I kind of want to do an episode of this show
1457000	1461000	about it at some point with some of the people that live here locally that play them.
1461000	1464000	But I got voted out really early.
1464000	1466000	The game is supposed to run through like June.
1466000	1468000	I was like the seventh person voted out.
1468000	1469000	So I didn't even make the jury thing.
1469000	1470000	But whatever.
1470000	1472000	That's just because they're haters.
1472000	1476000	But the reason why I bring that whole project up is because I think it's fascinating because
1476000	1480000	like when events are happening in the game, like challenges and tribal councils,
1480000	1486000	they're streaming them on Google Hangouts and people are watching them like it's like they
1486000	1487000	have this group.
1487000	1490000	There's like something like 700, 800 people in this Facebook group.
1490000	1493000	And there's, you know, a good chunk of people that are like actually watching this shit
1493000	1494000	unfold live.
1494000	1499000	And the reason why I bring that up is because like a lot more of like the television and
1499000	1502000	the programming stuff is homegrown.
1502000	1503000	Right.
1503000	1507000	So people aren't necessarily waiting for a new episode of Survivor to come on this week.
1507000	1513000	They're making their own fucking survivor or, you know, like people aren't waiting for
1513000	1517000	there to be a new gaming channel for a G4 replacement to show up.
1517000	1521000	One's never coming because Twitch, everybody has like their own thing.
1521000	1527000	So I think you're seeing more and more like what the future of television is going to
1527000	1531000	look like because basic cable is on notice, in my opinion.
1531000	1537000	They're like the room for basic cable is that window is dwindling because I think more
1537000	1539000	and more people are kind of making their own shit.
1539000	1544000	I don't think local television is ever particularly going away because local TV is still
1544000	1549000	going to keep us informed, especially when like bad shit is happening in town and people
1549000	1551000	need to see like, where is the hurricane?
1551000	1552000	Where is the flood?
1552000	1554000	Where is the volcano erupting?
1554000	1557000	Like those types of things you still need like your local news for.
1557000	1564000	It's similar in a way, in my opinion, to what podcasts have done to traditional radio.
1564000	1568000	Like podcasts have really kind of fucked up traditional radio in many ways.
1568000	1572000	You know, it really kind of put a dent in satellite radio.
1572000	1575000	They're all under one company now, right?
1575000	1579000	Because people can kind of choose to listen to their own stuff.
1579000	1585000	So it's very interesting to me how more and more media is getting more underground.
1585000	1591000	Of course, this could open up a whole nother can of worms about, well, when you have amateur
1591000	1597000	media, there's no sense of responsibility, which is how we get into spreading news stories
1597000	1600000	that aren't necessarily real, right?
1600000	1601000	Alternative facts, if you will.
1601000	1603000	Yeah, but the major news networks do that too.
1603000	1604000	So, I mean, yeah.
1604000	1607000	So, I mean, but anyway, I don't want to go too far down that.
1607000	1612000	To be fair, their spread, their effect on, you know, the populace is they have a larger
1612000	1614000	viewership is probably greater than a podcast.
1614000	1615000	Right.
1615000	1620000	Well, but I mean, maybe because a lot of their viewership is a lot of older folks who don't
1620000	1624000	use, not only, but there's a lot of older folks that don't use technology.
1624000	1629000	Like Loki, by the time we are the older generation, the ones that are over the age of 65, which
1629000	1636000	is only about 25 years away, you know, that using things like Twitch, using the internet
1636000	1638000	to get things that's going to be commonplace.
1638000	1643000	That's not going to be like a niche thing or something that only tech savvy people know
1643000	1644000	how to do.
1644000	1645000	You know what I mean?
1645000	1646000	Yeah.
1646000	1654000	So, anyway, looking at a chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Nifty Swirl says, ah, bummer, you got pork
1654000	1655000	chopped.
1655000	1657000	No, I wasn't the first one gone.
1657000	1659000	I was more like Mayhem Miller.
1659000	1665000	I was I should have went a lot further and I was like a fan favorite.
1665000	1666000	Cut too soon.
1666000	1670000	That's I was I would prefer to be compared to Mayhem Miller, although I do love Mayhem,
1670000	1671000	though.
1671000	1673000	Yeah, it's perfect.
1673000	1674000	It's the perfect analogy.
1674000	1677000	And Mayhem also was complete perfection in person.
1677000	1678000	Yes.
1678000	1679000	And which I am, too.
1679000	1682000	I got to look at the feather dress in person.
1682000	1683000	Oh, I love it.
1683000	1684000	That shit was hot.
1684000	1685000	I love it.
1685000	1686000	Let's see.
1686000	1691000	Tiger Claw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the problem with Google Hangout, however,
1691000	1694400	if there is any copyrighted music playing in the background, it's going to nag you about
1694400	1697240	it since Google Hangout is archiving the stream to YouTube.
1697240	1699600	Well, that would just depend on the type of programming you're doing.
1699600	1703740	Like all the game stuff I was just referencing, like you don't really play music during that.
1703740	1709520	So there's no there's no need to, you know, watch that or no need to worry about copyright
1709520	1710520	with that.
1710520	1713000	But I I mean, that's also a problem on Twitch.
1713000	1717840	Like if you're going to sit there and play something like Heroes of the Storm all night
1717840	1718840	long.
1718840	1719840	Excuse me.
1719840	1724000	And you get you get sick of the game audio or things like Warcraft.
1724000	1725000	That's another big one.
1725000	1726000	World of Warcraft.
1726000	1728200	Like, you know, the music of World of Warcraft is great.
1728200	1732760	The first 500 times you hear it and then it's like, OK, maybe I'm going to mute the soundtrack
1732760	1734840	of World of Warcraft and play my own music.
1734840	1736740	So I mean, you can do that.
1736740	1741320	And I guess they use a DJ license or something so that the live feeds are unaffected.
1741320	1745140	But your broadcast will get muted if you have copyright music in it, which I'm sure you
1745140	1747440	all know is a big thing over on Twitch TV.
1747440	1749440	So anyway.
1749440	1751640	Whoo.
1751640	1755200	I guess I kind of went off track there on the Twitch and Doctor Who thing.
1755200	1758120	But I really do think it kind of all comes together about kind of like the future of
1758120	1763320	like where the concept of a TV network is growing.
1763320	1766520	And, you know, we're starting to grow more and more of our own stuff.
1766520	1768400	So I'll leave you with that.
1768480	1772360	Anyway, let's move on and talk about our video game weeks and the types of video games that
1772360	1774300	we have been playing this week.
1774300	1779120	So Dark Sakura, you got a little bit to catch up on, but any games you want to talk about
1779120	1780400	that you've been playing this week?
1780400	1784440	Kirby, Zelda Breath of the Wild.
1784440	1789200	And then I went to the Golden State Pinball Expo and played a shit ton of pinball.
1789200	1791680	And I'm going to go in order of what I played.
1791680	1796840	Played Baby Pac-Man, Mr. and Miss Pac-Man pinball.
1796840	1797840	These are all pinball by the way.
1797840	1800040	Black Rose, which is one of my favorites.
1800040	1801040	Dialed in.
1801040	1802040	They had dialed in.
1802040	1806040	So I got to play it on one of the Jersey Jack tables.
1806040	1812440	Also got to play like this vertigo pinball thing, but it also had like double screen
1812440	1817480	or like extra long screen video games.
1817480	1818740	So one of them was Mappy.
1818740	1819740	So I played Mappy.
1819740	1824800	I apologize for this very important interruption, but Dark Sakura, did you want the decaf one
1824800	1828880	or did you want to choose from the other flavors that I have for coffee?
1828880	1830600	Coffee is a very important subject.
1830600	1833080	I will always interrupt this show to talk about coffee.
1833080	1836960	I really want actual caffeine, but I'm afraid about ulcers, but fuck it.
1836960	1837960	You live once.
1837960	1838960	Do you have hazelnut?
1838960	1839960	So we want peppermint.
1839960	1844560	You want vanilla macadamia, vanilla buttercream or toasted graham.
1844560	1845560	Oh, I do have hazelnut cream.
1845560	1846560	You want that?
1846560	1847560	I like hazelnut cream, please.
1847560	1848560	All right.
1848560	1849560	You got it.
1849560	1850560	Now we resume with our gaming weeks.
1850560	1851560	Okay.
1851560	1853400	I also played Centaur.
1853400	1855360	I played the Goldeneye table.
1855360	1859760	I played Starship Troopers, which is actually a really fun table.
1859760	1865120	I did play Doctor Who pinball that has one of the best multi balls to ever exist.
1865120	1869440	I played, the fuck is this one?
1869440	1871960	I think it's the Getaway.
1871960	1874520	I played Middle Earth, which is one of the seventies ones.
1874520	1877560	I played the Got Live Ninja Turtles table, which always sucks.
1877560	1881960	I of course played Lexi Lightspeed, which keep your eyes open for Lexi Lightspeed because
1881960	1883160	it's a modular table.
1883160	1887000	You're supposed to be able to rebuild the table with different rules.
1887000	1891160	And on the play field, it has like a video screen that interacts with the various targets
1891160	1892160	and everything.
1892160	1897800	So you can get one modular table and then switch out other tables and other programming
1897800	1898800	for it.
1898800	1900000	So it's pretty cool.
1900000	1901960	I also played...
1901960	1902960	Which one is this?
1902960	1905280	I don't know which one this is.
1905280	1906840	Oh, this is Lost in Space.
1906840	1907840	It wasn't great.
1907840	1909860	I played Tron.
1909860	1915500	And then I saw a sticker that says, ask not for whom the ball rolls, it rolls for thee.
1915500	1918500	Also played Ghostbusters, the new Ghostbusters, which is pretty nice.
1918500	1920300	It was just funny.
1920300	1927900	If you look in their headquarters, they have a picture of a pinball table that's the same
1927900	1931820	pinball table that was in the firehouse in the movie.
1931820	1932940	So it's pretty cool.
1932940	1938300	I played Aerosmith, which I do nothing but play the Sweet Emotion mode on that one anyway.
1938300	1940660	Which is an appropriate thing to do.
1940660	1942780	I played one called TX Sector.
1942780	1946420	I played The Hobbit, which is a slow ass table.
1946420	1952700	I mean, Jersey Jack does some good tables, but this one was slow as fuck to play and
1952700	1953700	not as much fun.
1953700	1958780	I played Beat Time, which is the one based on the Beatles.
1958780	1965800	I did not get to play one of the new ones.
1965800	1966800	What was it?
1966800	1967800	Houdini.
1967800	1969000	One of the newest ones to come out.
1969000	1972240	And then they had the Iron Maiden machines.
1972240	1976100	But oh, I also played Guardians of the Galaxy, which was a really fun table.
1976100	1977700	That's like their new one, huh?
1977700	1978700	One of the newer ones.
1978700	1982760	But actually the newest one that came out was Iron Maiden and it was okay.
1982760	1983760	I didn't play it.
1983760	1984760	Sorry.
1984760	1987840	I have to deviate real quick because now that you're talking about all this pinball, like
1987840	1991120	one of the big stories that you missed in the couple of weeks you were gone was that
1991120	1994480	the pinball arcade.
1994480	1995480	Is that the one?
1995480	1996580	I can't, there's always like multiple.
1996580	1999220	So they're losing like a ton of those licenses.
1999220	2003100	They're losing, what was it, Midway, Bali.
2003100	2004380	They're losing those.
2004380	2007240	And so you have until the end of June to pick up everything you want.
2007240	2011100	There's not going to be any sales because that's a violation of their license agreement.
2011100	2015100	Like are you sad to see those go or are you just playing the virtual one?
2015100	2017240	So I wasn't fun for me.
2017240	2022140	I guess that is kind of a dumb question for you because you and husband are in the position
2022140	2024340	where you can collect the real things.
2024340	2026260	Or we know people who have them.
2026660	2029660	And I'll be honest, I really don't enjoy playing virtual pinball that much.
2029660	2030660	Really?
2030660	2035020	Even the, um, the, the big like virtue, like the main pinball thing that they actually
2035020	2036620	lay down on a vertical TV.
2036620	2040580	Yeah, because it's really fucking weird to tilt them.
2040580	2045220	It just doesn't, it's just not as much when you don't get the right feedback.
2045220	2048340	Tilt is always weird on a virtual thing.
2048340	2050440	That's one thing that is like impossible to get right.
2050440	2053820	And see, for me, it's almost impossible for me to tilt a table.
2054740	2059100	Usually the way that I knock the, um, the ball back into play is I just give it a smack
2059100	2060100	on the side.
2060100	2061100	Yeah.
2061100	2062100	Same.
2062100	2063300	And it's usually enough, but Dan shakes it.
2063300	2065420	I don't shake the whole table.
2065420	2068380	So getting a tilt is really hard for me.
2068380	2071500	I mean, I wouldn't say I've never tilted before, but, but I have.
2071500	2072500	I've tilted.
2072500	2076940	But you know, but I am still playing Ragnarok.
2076940	2080860	I'm still playing Pokemon Go and that's about it.
2080860	2082180	All right.
2082180	2083180	A lot of fucking pinball.
2083540	2087460	And I took pictures of everything that I took so that I, that I played so I could put it
2087460	2091020	on my thing for today that I played all those pins.
2091020	2092020	All right.
2092020	2093020	You got it.
2093020	2097100	Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby says, I spent that money to buy all
2097100	2098100	the packs.
2098100	2100020	Uh, for someone who can't play the real thing.
2100020	2101020	I liked it.
2101020	2103300	I only play real pinball tables once a year.
2103300	2108500	Uh, and then the VPC caps I want to get, have a tilt button on either side so I won't have
2108500	2109500	to shake my table.
2109500	2115100	Well, I mean, it's, it's hard because you know, a button, it's just not going to be
2115100	2118580	quite that same feeling as the actual physics of shaking it.
2118580	2123180	But I also get it like you may not want to put that type of stress on your table, but
2123180	2124740	that is kind of part of pinball.
2124740	2129100	I mean, believe it or not, tilting machine is kind of without tilting it and getting
2129100	2131260	the error is kind of part of it.
2131260	2134340	That's why the tables, the legs are the way that they are.
2134340	2139480	They are firm steel that are meant to be shaken and the tilt mechanism inside for anyone who
2139480	2144700	doesn't know it is a weighted pendulum that is a perfectly balanced pendulum with, um,
2144700	2147620	a charged plate in a circle around it.
2147620	2152600	And so when it hits, it'll give you a warning, but when it's a full knock, it'll give you
2152600	2153600	a full tilt.
2153600	2154600	Yeah.
2154600	2156760	So that is how it works.
2156760	2157760	To be fair.
2157760	2160840	These things that we're talking about are like advanced pinball.
2160840	2164560	Like most people that play pinball aren't going to be in the notion.
2164560	2168400	Like I would say beginner pinball is when you're still hitting both flipper buttons
2168400	2171480	at the same time for everything.
2171480	2172480	Which is fine.
2172480	2173480	I mean, that's fine.
2173480	2174480	That's like beginner DDR.
2174480	2175480	When you go back to the center.
2175480	2176480	Oh my God.
2176480	2177480	I was thinking the same thing.
2177480	2178480	That's like beginner DDR.
2178480	2181120	The first thing you have to learn about DDR is to like, don't, you don't always have to
2181120	2182120	go back to the center.
2182120	2185320	Well, the first thing you need to learn from DDR watching my kids is that you have to hit
2185320	2188960	more than just the top arrow and you have to kind of look at the screen when you're
2188960	2193100	doing it because you can't just stand there and just keep tapping the top arrow and expect
2193100	2194100	to beat the level.
2194740	2199940	But the, the, you know, the great thing about, about pinball for me is that physicality to
2199940	2200940	it.
2200940	2204900	And so that's why I just don't get the same feel with the virtual tables.
2204900	2209740	I mean, I liked playing, you know, Revenge of the Gator and all that because that was
2209740	2214740	how that was meant to be played or Sonics pinball, Pokemon pinball, but they were designed
2214740	2215740	that way.
2215740	2216740	They were never full size tables.
2216740	2221580	They had that fantasy element to it and things that wouldn't like, or a devil's crush or
2221580	2223260	alien crush.
2223260	2225300	Those things wouldn't happen on a legit pinball table.
2225300	2231540	So, but, you know, if it's a legit pinball and it doesn't and they make a virtual version
2231540	2236060	of it, like it was fine before we could, you know, get these tables or new people who had
2236060	2237060	them.
2237060	2238060	That was kind of the only way we could.
2238060	2239060	Right.
2239060	2240060	But now.
2240060	2241060	Which you realize is where most people are at.
2241060	2247220	But now pinball is really such a growing, um, you know, it's, it's gaining its popularity
2247220	2248220	again.
2248220	2249220	The love has come back.
2249220	2252780	We've got companies returning and I even wonder if part of these licensed failures could
2252780	2258780	possibly be that maybe some of those companies might be thinking of, cause I mean, um, midway
2258780	2263740	and uh, Williams have licensed their tables to stern and to some of the, um, the ones
2263740	2265460	rebuilding them.
2265460	2270100	So it could be, I mean, we may even, who knows, maybe we'll see a return of Williams pinball.
2270100	2271100	Who knows?
2271100	2272100	All right.
2272100	2274540	Anyway, let's move on to Loki and your gaming week.
2274540	2277540	Um, I played no pinball this week.
2277540	2278540	No, it's all good.
2278540	2279860	It's all good.
2279860	2286140	And so, um, I did play those some new stuff, so I did try because I was looking for more
2286140	2292340	games for the switch, so I ended up downloading a few and one of those being a bloodstain
2292340	2301340	curse of the moon, which is a kind of retro, like it's very much like Castlevania three
2301340	2306620	and it's, um, yeah, I mean, it's a good game.
2306620	2311540	It's very much, it looked like it could be an NES game and I've enjoyed quite a bit of
2311540	2312540	it.
2312540	2316420	So definitely check it out cause you can switch between players or let's sort of like, I guess
2316420	2319620	Castlevania three, cause I think Castlevania three you couldn't switch in real time, but
2319620	2322820	this you can, you can actually switch between your characters in real time, which is kind
2322820	2323820	of cool.
2323820	2327620	Um, but yeah, I mean like every, all the enemies in the game, like dude, this is like totally
2327620	2328620	Castlevania.
2328620	2331380	Like this is just such a ripoff of the Castlevania.
2331380	2332380	Granted.
2332380	2336340	Yeah, I know it's the same people, but it's like, dude.
2336340	2337340	It's exactly.
2337340	2339780	It's like reskinning Castlevania and calling it something else.
2339780	2340780	To be fair.
2340780	2342460	That's kind of what a lot of people want though.
2342460	2344560	You know, like, yeah, I'm not complaining.
2344560	2345560	It's a great game.
2345560	2347540	I mean, it was, it's a great game.
2347540	2352300	So not complaining, but I'm just like, Oh man, enemies just like this one and the other
2352300	2355380	game and it's like, it's exactly the same.
2355380	2357060	There's food in the walls and stuff.
2357060	2359740	And so yeah, whatever.
2359740	2360740	It's all good.
2360740	2363580	Um, you know, if Konami ain't going to do it, you know what?
2363580	2364580	Yeah.
2364580	2365580	So, um, definitely check that out.
2365820	2368100	I've been asking, when do we get an old school Castlevania game yet?
2368100	2369100	Here you go.
2369100	2370100	Here you go.
2370100	2371100	Yeah, it's great.
2371100	2372100	10 bucks.
2372100	2373100	Can't be it.
2373100	2374100	Yeah.
2374100	2376180	You should get, if you put 28 or more down, you should get a code for this retro one.
2376180	2378580	But the problem is the codes are like delayed.
2378580	2382860	So like I'm waiting on my switch code, but like I know people that still just went and
2382860	2385460	bought it anyway, but I'm like, no, I'm going to wait on my switch code.
2385460	2389900	But I think they gave backers like a temporary steam code so that you could check it out
2389900	2393660	no matter where you're like copy is supposed to be.
2393660	2394660	Anyway.
2394740	2395740	It's good.
2395740	2396740	So definitely check it out.
2396740	2402580	And then my S my son had their friends over, so they wanted to do PlayStation VR.
2402580	2406500	So I got more PlayStation VR stuff, but none of them played any of the new games that he
2406500	2409340	wanted to play the same old shit that the key plane.
2409340	2413140	So we played a little bit of, um, what do you let your children play until dawn?
2413140	2414140	Rush your blood.
2414140	2416420	I wanted to let them do that, but they don't know.
2416420	2421500	No, the one I wanted to let them play a surgeon simulator, but that would unfortunately be
2421500	2423660	a little inappropriate, but they would love it.
2423660	2426020	They would, they would eat that shit.
2426020	2432740	But no, the, the more, the most violent game they played was, um, super hot VR.
2432740	2437460	And they liked, they liked because like that game, there's no way to like, I can't figure
2437460	2438980	out how to restart the progress.
2438980	2442460	So they had to play like where I left off in the game.
2442460	2447620	Um, and so the one that I left off on, you start off, I think in like a helicopter maybe
2447620	2448620	or something.
2448620	2449620	I don't know.
2449620	2452320	It's like some elevated area and you have to punch a guy.
2452320	2458540	And so they kept cock punching the dude over and over and, um, shooting things.
2458540	2460420	But yeah, they had fun with that.
2460420	2465480	And then we also, I picked up, um, fruit ninja VR, which that's a pretty easy one from the
2465480	2466480	play.
2466480	2468560	Um, and then what else?
2468560	2474160	And then we did a job simulator, you know, the old standby, but like I had like a bunch
2474160	2481340	of stuff and stuff that I like almost accidentally started for them, like accounting plus, no,
2481380	2483940	that's not, that's not a kid's game right there.
2483940	2490100	Um, but yeah, I, my wife's like, well, you know, can I try that?
2490100	2494260	You know, joking them like, yeah, you can, you can play until dawn rush of blood.
2494260	2497460	She didn't want to do that.
2497460	2498460	Is that it?
2498460	2503380	And I also have Skyrim VR, which I haven't got a chance to play yet, but I have it cause
2503380	2508240	I got a half off when they were doing that sale last week at GameStop.
2508240	2514040	So aside from that, um, just basically, uh, Super Mario Odyssey and then on Pokemon Go
2514040	2518020	because you know, we've, they've had the kind of cycling stuff out.
2518020	2521880	So I've been just evolving stuff.
2521880	2522880	That's it.
2522880	2523880	All right.
2523880	2524880	Uh, my gaming week.
2524880	2530200	So, um, I, I, my project came to an end when a bunch of people half my age voted me off
2530200	2531200	the Island.
2531200	2535360	Um, so that's, that's that, but, uh, it, it opened up my free time to play more video
2535360	2536360	games again.
2536360	2539840	Um, so I was able to, you guys don't even know like how much time you spend, but it's
2539840	2541520	like nonstop Skype calls.
2541520	2543600	Like is, are they going to turn on you?
2543600	2544600	Are they going to turn on you?
2544600	2545600	Are you going to stick with me?
2545600	2546600	Are you going to do this?
2546600	2549000	I guess it's like nonstop, but it's actually a lot of fun.
2549000	2553120	It really like, it sounds ridiculous, but like the psychological psychology games, like
2553120	2558640	if you like shit, like, like mafia and werewolf and stuff and conventions, like it's basically
2558640	2560440	that, like just on a much bigger scale.
2560440	2564400	Anyway, that's all I'll say about that until I'm able to get some of the players here on
2564400	2567600	the building, kind of like we did the Ingers episode and we'll do a, we'll do an orgy
2567600	2568600	episode.
2568600	2570680	Um, not to be confused with orgy.
2570680	2571680	That's much different.
2571680	2572680	This is an orgy episode.
2572680	2576800	Um, anyhow, so video games, I picked back up final fantasy 14.
2576800	2580280	I kind of slowed down on that the past couple of months because I sort of wore out that
2580280	2584600	last patch, but they came out with patch 4.3 in this past week.
2584600	2589300	So it's kind of reinvigorated me to go back in there and, Oh, I got a new, a dungeon unlock
2589300	2590300	and check out.
2590300	2594660	I really like the way they did the new dungeons and they referenced geomancers from back in
2594660	2598860	like final fantasy tactics are like, even though they're not a playable class, like
2598860	2603000	the enemies are geomancers and they ring the bells and it like makes the area that you're
2603000	2604440	in completely change.
2604440	2605440	So it's really cool.
2605440	2606440	Um, I like that.
2606440	2611100	Uh, and then, um, yeah, just unlocking some of the other features, like you get to rebuild
2611100	2612640	Doma castle.
2612640	2616700	It's one of those weird things where like Doma castle exists in final fantasy 14, but
2616700	2619780	it's not necessarily the same Doma from final fantasy six.
2619780	2624400	It's just like, what if this concept existed in a different time and place?
2624400	2629440	Like kind of like how final well fancy games do with like Sid and chocobos, right?
2629440	2631620	So they took Doma castle and kind of put it there.
2631620	2633720	And so that's a big part is you get to rebuild Doma.
2633720	2635380	So I had to do a lot of questing for that.
2635380	2638420	So that was some time in fall of SC 14.
2638420	2641380	Um, and then I also played some Nintendo switch.
2641380	2643920	Um, I checked out a game kind of randomly.
2643920	2647500	I noticed it was the number one selling game in the store and it was an indie game.
2647500	2649380	It was beating a bunch of other stuff.
2649380	2651220	And uh, I'd heard some friends talking about it on Twitter.
2651220	2652220	So I was like, what the hell?
2652220	2653220	I'm going to pick this up.
2653220	2654220	So it's called wizard of legend.
2654220	2655220	Yeah.
2655220	2656220	I saw that.
2656220	2658360	I almost bought it by having it's, it's not bad.
2658360	2660800	Like it doesn't handhold you a lot.
2660800	2664460	Like you really have to kind of learn some things the hard way.
2664460	2666180	It is a rogue like, okay.
2666180	2667180	At its core.
2667180	2671800	Um, but even if you're like one of those people's like, I hate rogue likes, like, you know,
2671800	2675260	check out some videos, see what you think about this one, because you know, a lot of
2675260	2680380	it is about kind of like how you build your book of moves before you go out into the world
2680380	2683040	and you can collect these different arcana basically.
2683040	2687620	So like maybe you do like an earth punch or a fire punch and like, or these different
2687620	2692980	moves, like the beams can be fire or lightning, but then I mean it's, it's much more intricate
2692980	2693980	than that.
2693980	2696220	It's not just like, Oh, it's the same beam, but a different element.
2696220	2699460	No, like the ice one will like go out and freeze monster then come back.
2699460	2701580	The fire one kind of does a funky pattern.
2701580	2705700	You know, the thunder one will like suspend bullets in midair, you know, like they all
2705700	2707940	have their own little like things that they do.
2707940	2711280	So you kind of like can build that book, but they didn't, they didn't really explain the
2711280	2712280	whole concept.
2712280	2714700	So I'll just, I'll help you all out if you decide to check this out.
2714700	2718220	So the little like chaos emeralds, I think they're called either that or I'm confused
2718220	2720620	to get with Sonic the Hedgehog little chaos emeralds.
2720620	2724860	That's what you use to like buy new spells that are permanent for your book that you
2724860	2727580	can take each time in there.
2727580	2732220	And that's, that's like, you want to grab, those persist even amongst death.
2732220	2737920	Gold will lose when you die and gold is how you temporarily buy stuff in the dungeons.
2737920	2740740	So you might run across shopkeepers in the dungeons that are like, do you want to buy
2740740	2743480	this spell or do you want to buy this enhancement for your spell?
2743480	2746380	You can spend gold on that, but it will only last during the dungeon.
2746380	2747480	So it's kind of interesting.
2747480	2751600	It feels a little bit like in some ways Diablo-y to me because all the dungeons are like randomly
2751600	2755940	generated and so they're never going to be the same and you know, kind of like the way
2755940	2757860	that you fight and stuff looks a little Diablo-y.
2757860	2759260	So I'm into it.
2759260	2763540	I like it, you know, especially for like a, what was it, $15, $20 indie title.
2763540	2764540	Yeah.
2764540	2765540	It's, it's, you know, it's cool.
2765540	2768980	And apparently it has local co-op, which is cool, but I haven't really been able to test
2768980	2769980	that yet.
2769980	2771940	So there's that.
2771940	2774500	I also picked up Mega Man collection one and two.
2774500	2775500	I just haven't played it yet.
2775500	2779700	So not a lot else to say on that, but I did pick up and I did play a little bit of Hyrule
2779700	2783660	warriors last night because I'm, I didn't bother playing it when it was on Wii U.
2783660	2785700	I didn't bother playing it when it was on 3DS.
2785700	2788860	So finally I was like, all right, this, this is probably going to be the last time they
2788860	2791420	do it and this will be the everything edition.
2791420	2792880	So I'm going to buy it this time.
2792880	2795860	So I did and I'm, I'm liking it quite a bit.
2795860	2798940	Like I've only played the first two regular levels.
2798940	2802140	Then I went into the adventure mode, which is the one that looks like the 8-bit Zelda
2802140	2803140	a little bit.
2803140	2805060	And I did a little bit of that cause I want to explore it.
2805060	2807460	I'll play some more after the show tonight on my Twitch channel.
2807460	2812220	I think last, last I checked my vote on my Twitter, that was the one that was leading
2812220	2813220	by about 20%.
2813220	2815780	So I think I'm going to be doing Hyrule warriors after the show tonight.
2815780	2818540	So I'll show you a little more of that game over on my Twitch channel.
2818540	2822460	It's twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, all one word.
2822460	2826540	But I love the feeling of just hacking through thousands of enemies at once.
2826540	2830340	And I think it's really cool how you can play as Link, but in the first stage you get to
2830340	2834620	be Zelda a little bit, or you can be Impa or I just got a stage with Sheik in it.
2834620	2838080	So it's cool that you can play all these different characters.
2838080	2842180	And then I like that it's not just like run to the other side of the battlefield and hack
2842180	2845620	as many things as you can, like you have to kind of manage everything that's going
2845620	2846820	on in the battlefield.
2846820	2850100	And part of how you manage it is you can flip between your characters really quick.
2850100	2853780	So it's like, you might get an alert, like you have this base under attack in the top
2853780	2854780	left.
2854780	2857420	Okay, well Impa is up there in the top left, so I'm going to flip over to Impa and then
2857420	2860660	I'll have her take the base back and get rid of, okay, now I'll go back to Link who is
2860660	2862360	kind of going through the main objectives.
2862360	2866860	So I kind of like how you have to juggle that a little bit and manage that is pretty cool.
2866860	2868300	And that's only in the first couple of levels.
2868300	2870900	Like I only can imagine how much harder this gets.
2870900	2876720	And I have played a little bit of Dynasty Warriors and it is fucking Dynasty Warriors
2876720	2881620	with a Zelda skin, but that's okay.
2881620	2885180	Like there's probably a lot of people who haven't played Dynasty Warriors but probably
2885180	2889920	will because it's Link and Zelda now and it's cool, I enjoy it.
2889920	2893620	So yeah, Hyrule Warriors, I'm liking it so far.
2893620	2897240	Let's check in again after another week and see if I've actually continued with it and
2897240	2898240	played more.
2898600	2902220	Based on the fact that this is the Definitive Edition, it sure seems like there is an awful
2902220	2903580	lot to do.
2903580	2907920	Like those two modes I named are only like two of like five or six modes that are in
2907920	2908920	it.
2908920	2911460	I mean, there's just crazy amounts of stuff to unlock and things like that.
2911460	2915260	So go into our chat at live.vognetware.com.
2915260	2920500	Vidpower says those blank warriors games, because I guess Fire Emblem has one too, are
2920500	2921940	great stress relievers.
2921940	2922940	Yes.
2922940	2927740	Like I said, it's very satisfying to just chop through like 2000 monsters and you just
2927740	2928940	feel like such a badass.
2928940	2930320	So yeah, I'm a fan.
2930320	2932180	I'm a fan of Hyrule Warriors so far.
2932180	2935980	I'm almost a little sad I slept on it before but then again at the same time, I'm kind
2935980	2941620	of glad that like this edition that I bought is like, this is all you need.
2941620	2943340	It's the Definitive Edition.
2943340	2947760	That is until, you know, it goes the way of like Super Street Fighter 2 and then we get
2947760	2955280	like, it's Hyrule Warriors Turbo Championship Super Mega Definitive Collection.
2955280	2956280	So we'll see.
2956280	2957280	Hopefully not.
2957320	2959260	Alright, that's it for my Game of the Week.
2959260	2964120	Let's talk about some announcements of which I don't have an awful lot, but I will mention
2964120	2968060	that we will not be here at the very last week in June.
2968060	2974520	We will not be here June 24th, but we will be here June 17th for our 16th birthday.
2974520	2976500	So who's going to be buying us a car?
2976500	2980420	It's OLR's My Sweet Sixteen coming to you on June 17th.
2980420	2986960	We need to watch the sweet 17th birthday comic extravaganza by Strongbad.
2986960	2988440	I just hope there's a cake.
2988440	2990720	That's all a person should get for the birthday cake.
2990720	2992240	Should I get us a bunt cake?
2992240	2995160	Or as I called it when I was a kid, a butt cake?
2995160	2996160	A butt cake.
2996160	2997160	You know what?
2997160	2998160	Any cake.
2998160	2999620	Bakers can't be choosers.
2999620	3006320	So when a cake is made for me, all I ask is that it's not a cake with like mayonnaise
3006320	3007320	as frosting.
3007320	3008320	Ice cream cake?
3008320	3009320	Mmm.
3009320	3010320	Ice cream cake.
3010320	3011320	I can't eat ice cream anymore.
3011320	3012320	Oh my God.
3012320	3013920	Shane was just telling me, because Shane just had a birthday and he was telling me about
3013920	3019240	a cake he got that had like banana ice cream in it and it was like graham cracker crust.
3019240	3020480	Oh yeah, something for Shane.
3020480	3022040	Oh, it sounded so good.
3022040	3023040	Anyway.
3023040	3025520	Because Christy gave him banana pocky and it's at my house.
3025520	3026520	Oh, nice.
3026520	3027520	So, all right.
3027520	3030440	Anyway, uh, let's get into some other video game news.
3030440	3034880	We have, it hasn't been a huge gaming news week, but there's a, there's a few things
3034880	3035880	to talk about.
3035880	3036880	Right?
3036880	3037880	Logie?
3037880	3038880	Yeah.
3038880	3039880	The Vita might be coming back.
3039880	3040880	No, no.
3040880	3041880	That's not the case.
3041880	3042880	Uh, no.
3042880	3049720	Apparently there's a new chief of Sony Interactive Entertainment, uh, John Cadara, who's been
3049720	3054960	kind of speaking his mind about the PlayStation brand and talking about, uh, the possibility
3054960	3061800	of a portable system making a return and basically saying, you know, Hey, Sony portable gaming
3061800	3063480	could come back.
3063480	3069440	You know, if they remember that the console actually exists, um, basically put it in my
3069440	3074360	opinion rather than separating portable gaming from consoles, it's necessary to continue
3074360	3078900	thinking of portal gaming as one method to deliver more gaming experiences, exploring
3078900	3081560	what our customers want from portable.
3081560	3084920	Um, we want to think about many options.
3084920	3091480	It sounds like they just want to copy the switch based on that comment, but we'll see.
3091480	3093200	We'll see what happens.
3093200	3095960	It would be neat to see something like the switch that's more powerful.
3095960	3098200	Do you think Sony's going to just straight up copy the switch?
3098200	3101160	I mean, we kind of got into this a little bit last week when we talked about, you know,
3101160	3106760	the Vita dying basically officially, uh, the fact that Sony kind of like almost had it
3106760	3110420	like with the Vita TV and the fact that, you know, you could pick something up and then
3110420	3111420	play it on your TV.
3111420	3113280	Like they, well, they kind of were really close.
3113280	3116960	I don't think that the next system is going to be something like that because they talking
3116960	3123360	that right now the leaked, I don't know if it's leaked, but like the, the specs or the
3123360	3128120	thought was that it's going to be something that's based off the AMD Ryzen chip.
3128120	3132280	So I don't think that would necessarily lend itself to a portable console cause I think,
3132280	3137120	I mean they're pretty low powered, but it's, I don't think you can get it quite low enough
3137120	3139480	to have good battery life.
3139480	3141280	Well some folks will really be down for that.
3141280	3145820	She Hulk in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says PlayStation and Xbox need to be able
3145820	3147940	to take the console on the road like the switch.
3147940	3149960	It is a no brainer.
3149960	3155080	So I mean, but look at what Nintendo had to sacrifice in order to get the form factor
3155080	3156080	and everything.
3156080	3160200	You have to sacrifice some power to be able to get it that small and that portable.
3160200	3161200	Fair enough.
3161200	3164740	But you know, in a few more years, technology will have caught up quite a bit.
3164740	3169960	You know, that, that, that switch consoles just as powerful as a PlayStation three or,
3169960	3170960	you know, it's, it's lasted.
3170960	3173400	It's actually a little more powerful than that, right?
3173400	3177120	So you know, those guys can still pack a punch for being a little portable, you know, essentially
3177120	3178120	a portable system.
3178120	3183560	So yeah, you know, and how much, I mean, are we looking at with PlayStation five that every
3183560	3185520	single game is going to be fully 4k?
3185520	3189040	I mean, you think games are expensive to develop now?
3189040	3193160	Like there's, there's gotta be a point where we can like, I almost feel like in some ways
3193160	3198300	the PlayStation four was not the hugest step up from the PlayStation three.
3198300	3201880	Like we were used to seeing like the one to the two and the two to the three were like
3201880	3202880	big steps up.
3202880	3205200	But the three to the four step was not as big.
3205200	3206200	I mean, don't get me wrong.
3206200	3207200	Duh.
3207200	3209280	Of course you can tell the difference between PlayStation four and PlayStation three.
3209280	3215080	But I mean, you know, I think that technology of what you can do on a screen, we're almost
3215080	3216960	starting to plateau a little bit.
3216960	3217960	Yeah.
3217960	3222240	You know, and I know we've, we've, we've said this since the days of the Atari 2,600.
3222240	3225400	Remember when the NES first came out when we were kids and it was like playing something
3225400	3229520	like Super Mario brothers two was like, Oh my God, it's like an actual cartoon on my
3229520	3230520	television.
3230520	3232520	This is like a real cartoon, you know?
3232520	3234040	And it's like, no, I don't think I ever said that.
3234040	3235040	I did.
3235040	3237000	I remember I was like, how much better can graphics get?
3237000	3238000	It's a fucking cartoon.
3238040	3241280	I didn't say fucking when I was a kid, well, maybe I did, but it's like, it's a cartoon
3241280	3242280	on my television.
3242280	3243440	Like how much better can we get than that?
3243440	3248160	And then, you know, here we are now at PlayStation four, but it's like, you know, okay, we can
3248160	3253320	go to full on four K 60 frame a second games, but you know how expensive those are going
3253320	3254320	to be to make.
3254320	3258680	Well, that's why I don't think necessarily it's going to be that it's going to, I mean,
3258680	3262680	graphics will be one thing, but I think it's going to be more of how we interact with games,
3262680	3267520	you know, pushing more of the augmented reality, the more haptics and that kind of stuff.
3268040	3273040	Cause that, you know, you look at like a PlayStation VR, the graphics aren't that much better than,
3273040	3274040	you know, most things.
3274040	3278760	I mean, the displays aren't as good as like a, you know, a TV or something, but it's that
3278760	3280520	immersion that you feel from it.
3280520	3283520	You can't replicate that outside of VR.
3283520	3289680	So I think once that becomes more mainstream, that's going to be the way things are going
3289680	3290680	to go.
3290680	3296500	Uh, looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell says, uh, I was the same way
3296500	3304140	on the jump from PS3 to PS4 until I got a PS Pro on 4k PS3 and PS4 were both 1080p gaming.
3304140	3305720	So that's why the jump didn't look as good.
3305720	3306940	We didn't jump any resolution.
3306940	3310180	Well, maybe not in my own house, but I've seen PlayStation 4 on 4k.
3310180	3311180	I mean, don't get me wrong.
3311180	3312580	Yes, it looks fucking great.
3312580	3318780	But you know, again, like the PS3 was like already pretty fucking good, you know, and
3318780	3323760	I don't expect that making every single game 4k is going to be, I mean, that just sounds
3323760	3327080	like it's expensive unless, I don't know, maybe there's going to be ways to automate
3327080	3331720	that more and maybe make it easier on the artists who do it, but it just seems like
3331720	3336400	you think you wait a long time for games now, wait until they all have to be 4k and 120
3336400	3337400	frames a second.
3337400	3338960	Like it's just, it's going to be crazy.
3338960	3339960	So I don't know.
3339960	3340960	That's just my thought.
3340960	3346360	Um, vidpower in chat says, I think the biggest graphical jump was from N64 to GameCube.
3346360	3350360	Well, yeah, but that was also Nintendo's big jump from the cartridge format to the disc
3350360	3351360	format.
3351360	3355120	If you can wipe the Vaseline off the screen, you know, then yeah, anything looks great.
3355120	3358600	Uh, dungeon buster says, I think it comes down mostly to the games.
3358600	3363160	I can't imagine horizon zero dawn on the PS3 looking as it does or God of war.
3363160	3366520	I don't have a PS4 pro, but both games look amazing to me regardless.
3366520	3369840	Just just to be clear, cause I want to make sure I'm not coming off the wrong way.
3369840	3373680	I'm not saying that the PS4 isn't noticeably better than the PlayStation three.
3373680	3374680	Of course it is.
3374680	3380480	I'm just saying that step, it doesn't feel like as huge of a step as it did from 1 to
3380480	3381720	DVD to Blu Ray.
3381720	3384800	It wasn't so, you know, noticeable.
3384800	3391280	Well, it's noticeable, but it's not as noticeable as it was when we went from VHS to the right.
3391280	3392280	That's for sure.
3392280	3393280	Yeah.
3393280	3394280	I'll give you that.
3394280	3395280	I'll give you that.
3395280	3398160	So anyway, um, those are just my thoughts on that.
3398160	3403000	So um, w w do you think Sony is going to do something with the portable stuff or they
3403000	3404000	don't?
3404000	3406800	I don't think it anytime soon.
3406800	3407800	All right.
3407800	3414240	Well, last week on the show, we talked about how, um, steam was planning to bring a mobile,
3414240	3417240	uh, steam link basically to cell phones.
3417240	3420360	We talked a little bit about this last week, how they were planning this for Android and
3420360	3421360	iOS.
3421360	3425840	Well, a little monkey wrench got thrown in the plans this week because Apple blocked
3425840	3428960	steam's plan to extend the video games to iPhones.
3428960	3436240	Apple blocked steam from being onto the stores, uh, not incredibly sure the why behind it
3436240	3439680	because I think they got kind of a generic sort of email that was like, you know, it
3439680	3444600	doesn't, uh, it doesn't gel with Apple policies basically.
3444600	3450360	So people are kind of left to think, is it because the marketplace, like Apple wasn't
3450360	3454080	okay with that, but apparently steam disabled the marketplace for that, like they saw that
3454080	3455760	one coming and they disabled it.
3455760	3457840	So apparently that's not the problem.
3457840	3461820	Um, but maybe you're offering a platform that's going to compete with something that's a service
3461820	3463440	that's already offered.
3463440	3469480	So basically Apple TV, not Apple TV including, there's also the app store.
3469480	3473760	Well but remember they disabled purchasing in the steam thing, so it wasn't going to
3473760	3476480	be right, but it was still going to be a competitor.
3476480	3478160	Yeah, so that's fine.
3478160	3480480	Just disabled max support then out of steam.
3480480	3481480	No.
3481480	3482720	Oh, you think valve should just go to war?
3482720	3487400	Hey, you want gaming on your, that's not going to happen because they actually have a very
3487400	3489560	large number of user base that's, that's on Mac.
3489560	3490560	Yeah.
3490560	3493280	I was going to say, don't hurt the users that already bought the games and stuff.
3493560	3495600	That would be shooting their profits.
3495600	3497360	I'm all for petty Crocker.
3497360	3501280	Don't get me wrong, but that may not be the best move to do there.
3501280	3507480	But you know, but if they are planning on doing like a portal three or something, uh,
3507480	3511760	if valve wanted to be petty, they could be like the Mac version will be out six weeks
3511760	3512760	later.
3512760	3517040	Oh, but maybe we could push it to get it out earlier if Apple could do this one little
3517040	3518760	thing for us.
3518760	3519760	But here's the thing.
3519760	3520760	Yeah.
3520760	3522640	And, and they don't negotiate with terrorists.
3522640	3524840	You're saying here's the thing.
3524840	3528440	I kind of don't think the whole phone thing was that big of a deal anyway.
3528440	3530960	Like I know we were talking about it on the show last week.
3530960	3534320	Like I was like, Oh, that's kind of neat, but like, would I really use it?
3534320	3539280	Like how I would like to know the actual like numbers percentage wise of steam users that
3539280	3545040	actually use a steam link, either the phone or cause I have one I'm like, and the problem
3545040	3550120	is like, I've never wanted to just set it up to play on the TV and well, Android is
3550120	3551640	going to have this app.
3551640	3559120	So I think you already, yeah, I have it on my phone and I have it on my, um, my Android
3559120	3560120	TV.
3560120	3562640	So, but yet I've never used either one.
3562640	3563640	I thought about it.
3563640	3564760	I'm like, Oh, that'd be kind of cool.
3564760	3568680	I used my steam link for like a month sparingly and then that's it.
3568680	3570220	Like I haven't really used it since.
3570220	3573920	So, but like I said on the show last week, like I'm not going to play civilization six
3573920	3574960	on my phone.
3574960	3575960	That's redonkulous.
3575960	3577480	Like that's not, that's not going to be fun.
3577480	3582200	It's not like playing that from the bed on my no button device phone.
3582200	3584840	Like that's not going to be fun switch.
3584840	3585840	That's fun.
3585840	3586840	I can still play that embedded.
3586840	3591560	It feels just like playing it on TV, but, um, maybe watching movies out of the steam
3591560	3592560	marketplace or something.
3592560	3596120	But how many of those do I really like to don't think about your phone necessarily.
3596120	3599720	Think about like if you have a tablet, it's better because you can use as a screen prop
3599720	3601400	that Alan has an Android tablet.
3601400	3606120	So he can whip out a Bluetooth controller and you can just play on it like a screen.
3606120	3607120	Yeah.
3607160	3608160	That'd be the point.
3608160	3611400	If you have a computer that you can sit down in a comfy chair and just do the same shit,
3611400	3616240	but whatever, you know, it's flexibility and we didn't have to pay for it.
3616240	3621080	Uh, bonds double six and chat talking about the whole petty stuff that our little fan
3621080	3625680	fic there, uh, bonds double six says when mommy and daddy fight, the kids suffer.
3625680	3626680	It's true.
3626680	3628880	We don't want, we don't want people to suffer cause they get in a fight.
3628880	3632800	Um, let's see, uh, Brad from pod culture talking about the steam link says mine is collecting
3632800	3633800	dust.
3633800	3636440	Hate, hate, hate that damn controller.
3636440	3640680	You can use like any Bluetooth controller with those things now or even like an Xbox
3640680	3642360	wire controller and stuff like that.
3642360	3646960	I mean, um, I just haven't bothered to set it up yet or maybe it did and I just forgot
3646960	3647960	about it.
3647960	3649400	I know I have it somewhere.
3649400	3651920	It may be hooked up and I just completely forgot about it.
3651920	3652920	Yeah.
3652920	3655620	So I, so I mean this is a surprising to hear.
3655620	3656640	Maybe they'll work something out.
3656640	3657640	I don't know.
3657640	3660140	But at the same time, was I really going to use this anyway?
3660140	3662400	To be honest, probably not.
3662400	3669880	Like now if I could use cellular data to like stream my steam stuff over, sell to my phone.
3669880	3670880	But how garbage is that?
3670880	3672960	I was like, yeah, that'd be terrible.
3672960	3675700	Before y'all jump in there and chat going, that would look like shit, Rob.
3675700	3677200	It's like, it's, that's kind of the joke.
3677200	3681980	Like I know it's not going to look that great, but hey, you know what?
3681980	3689080	I remember a time when this show started that we were on dial up friendly radio and look
3689080	3692160	how far internet speeds have come in just that time.
3692160	3695160	So you know what, there's going to come a time when cellular speeds, they're almost
3695160	3696160	stable.
3696160	3697160	I know, right?
3697160	3698600	Hey, you remember the Vita?
3698600	3700720	Remember how the Vita had a three G version?
3700720	3701720	Yeah.
3701720	3706440	Remember how you can remember then the coin, the phrase asynchronous multiplayer.
3706440	3707440	Yeah.
3707440	3708440	Yeah.
3708440	3714120	I'm trying to think of one Vita game that let me play over the three G connection coming
3714120	3716120	up short.
3716120	3719040	Just it just didn't work so well anyway.
3719040	3720040	There you go.
3720360	3724000	Well anyway, if you have an Android device, uh, you could check out the steam app if,
3724000	3725800	if you think it's something you'd benefit from.
3725800	3729160	I mean, I don't know, again, I'm not going to be sitting there playing portal two on
3729160	3730160	my tablet.
3730160	3735120	Pretty much any multiplayer game you play over three G is going to be asynchronous multiplayer.
3735120	3740160	If I played more of those visual novel games, like, um, dream daddy, dream daddy, I could
3740160	3745160	play from the comfort of my bed or I guess, I guess I'm going to be playing in my bed.
3745160	3748560	I'd have to be playing something a little more like coming out on top or something a
3748600	3752480	little more like a, you know, top shelf, if you know what I'm saying.
3752480	3753480	All right.
3753480	3758120	It clearly is going to have to be genital jousting.
3758120	3760320	I was going to say, what about the bottom shelf?
3760320	3765080	Maybe that's what Apple's issue was with some of those adult games.
3765080	3770840	No, because Apple is just being petty because they want a piece of that money.
3770840	3775760	He could be a company has a right to stop anything that's going to be any type of competition
3775760	3777240	with services that they already offer.
3777240	3780760	It's not, Microsoft has done it before in the past.
3780760	3782980	We've seen other companies do the same things.
3782980	3783980	It's really business.
3783980	3789920	This is going to give ammunition to the anti Apple crowd and they're all idiots.
3789920	3794240	I think people are free to make whatever choice they want, even if it's the wrong one.
3794240	3795520	I think that's objective.
3795520	3799320	And I think, I think you, I think you know better than that because like there's more
3799320	3800720	than one opinion.
3800720	3804480	So anyone who hates anything just on principle alone is an idiot.
3804480	3810320	Well, but when they ban certain things from things, that's, that's what it is.
3810320	3815560	If someone's going to hate something, they're going to already hate it.
3815560	3818080	There's no adding fuel to something that already exists.
3818080	3819640	All right, let's move on.
3819640	3820640	Let's change topics.
3820640	3822760	I think you actually have the next story, Dark Sakura.
3822760	3823960	I do.
3823960	3828560	Um, so you know, e gaming is a thing.
3828560	3833160	It's been, uh, e-sports has been big and bigger and growing and growing.
3833160	3838360	So now the Special Olympics USA is going to host a video game tournament.
3838360	3844040	Um, e-sports will definitely be a thing in, uh, the 2018 Special Olympics starting on
3844040	3845040	July 2nd.
3845040	3851100	Um, they're partnering with, uh, the Xbox division for, uh, the tournament.
3851100	3855840	And so there will be teams that are competing in rounds of Forza, motor sports seven.
3855840	3860560	Um, there will be, uh, the, the competitors have already been chosen.
3860560	3864280	There were eight qualifier events that took place at different Microsoft stores.
3864280	3870280	Um, speaking of biting on to things that other companies have done, um, and, uh, having,
3870280	3876560	uh, eight different, uh, teams that will consist of one athlete, um, with, and one without
3876560	3878000	an intellectual disability.
3878000	3884080	So there'll be in teams, um, and basically they're, they're like, you know, since so
3884080	3889740	many of their special athletes are avid gamers, this gives them the ability to have another
3889740	3892260	form to compete in.
3892260	3894900	So this website with the story has an autoplay videos.
3894900	3897460	No, I can't read the story while you're talking about it.
3897460	3898460	Sorry about that.
3898460	3900180	Well, I, I think it's cool.
3900180	3901180	Yeah.
3901180	3904740	No, it's really cool to see, you know, we've kind of wondered more and more when the Olympics
3904740	3908660	we're going to acknowledge, you know, video gaming as, you know, something that is a part
3908660	3909660	of it.
3909660	3914700	And the Special Olympics are the Olympics, you know, so, um, actually no, actually no,
3914700	3918340	they are Paralympics is the Olympics, right?
3918340	3922820	Special Olympics is a separate organization, but even so, the fact that they recognize
3922820	3928140	this as yet another forum, you know, and I think that it's great that the teams are going
3928140	3933260	to be, you know, one with an intellectual disability versus one with, you know, with
3933260	3937220	a team of people with both levels of disability.
3937220	3939500	And I think it's going to be pretty amazing.
3939500	3942740	I'm glad that they're doing it and hopefully they'll catch on more and more.
3942740	3949340	They'll maybe have more, like maybe just a special, you know, X games or something.
3949340	3951180	Not X games, but you know what I mean?
3951180	3952180	Sure.
3952180	3954420	Um, you know, and it's, we've had a lot of great stories in the past couple of weeks
3954420	3958180	about, you know, more and more accessibility for, uh, gamers.
3958180	3962280	Just last week we had the story about the Xbox controller that is designed with the,
3962280	3964220	you know, different able people in mind.
3964220	3965220	So I think that's really cool.
3965220	3966220	So, all right.
3966220	3967860	Um, let's move on.
3967860	3968860	Loki.
3968860	3969860	All right.
3969980	3975780	So we talked a little bit last week how Valve was kind of coming down on some of these visual
3975780	3979840	novel developers saying that their games are too risky or whatever, and then they kind
3979840	3981460	of walked it back a little bit.
3981460	3988180	Well, you know, just to be on the safe side, um, good old games is actually finding, um,
3988180	3991160	a lot of these publishers coming over their way.
3991160	3997580	So um, you know, with that being that, you know, good old games isn't necessarily cracking
3997580	4002900	down on the content like that Steam is, they basically put it, you know, this opportunity
4002900	4004860	couldn't have come at a better time.
4004860	4010580	Um, we've been speaking with GOG prior to the recent events about adding visual novels
4010580	4016020	as a genre to their retail platform, and with Valve now threatening the livelihoods of visual
4016020	4022000	novel developers everywhere, it's a huge relief to see GOG opening their doors to these games.
4022000	4029680	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at bognetwork.com,
4029680	4032560	use the passphrase, dungeon.
4032560	4033560	So that's pretty awesome.
4033560	4039280	And then Steam has now proven that it's growing unreliable, or it's growing unreliable for
4039280	4041360	small and independent developers.
4041360	4047120	So we are very grateful to have the next biggest retailer in the PC market welcoming visual
4047120	4049240	novels with open arms and an eye for quality.
4049240	4054160	Okay, but you know, there's that like petty part of me that's like, oh, so this is about
4054160	4057240	how good old games is willing to take the gaming garbage that Steam doesn't want to
4057240	4058240	have.
4058240	4061800	But I wouldn't necessarily call it garbage, though, like these games, it's not necessarily
4061800	4063600	that it's garbage is a harsh word.
4063600	4064600	I'm sorry.
4064600	4069600	Because let's be honest, like, Steam does have a lot of actual like, it would be considered
4069600	4072840	like shovelware bullshit, right?
4072840	4075400	That's where I was going to tie it together, but yes, okay.
4075400	4082240	So like, I have a problem with steam, saying, Oh, yeah, we want to curate this.
4082240	4088280	But not this other thing, this huge mile, like, pile of bullshit behind us, we're gonna
4088280	4090520	focus on this piece of it.
4090520	4095600	But like all these other games that don't even function properly.
4095600	4097720	Fuck that, you know, that's my problem.
4097720	4102700	It's like either gonna, you know, you're there to curate all of this or you're not are these
4102700	4104640	visual novels with titties?
4104640	4108640	Like is that because this plays into something that came up with steam last week, about how
4108640	4113480	they're cracking down on anime titties, um, some of them know that necessarily and to
4113480	4118600	be honest, like a lot of the ones that are released on Steam are censored.
4118600	4123080	But you can get an uncensored patch like through the developers website and play it like however
4123080	4124080	you want it.
4124080	4129320	But I don't I think that they're well aware if that was the issue that they build a sensor
4129320	4133780	this stuff, you know, for that marketplace, but I don't think that's the issue here.
4133780	4138500	It's they're just like, oh, well, all visual novels are the blame, you know, we're just
4138500	4142420	gonna blame all of them instead of actually visual novels are to blame for most of gaming's
4142420	4143420	problems.
4143420	4147220	Just I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4147220	4148220	So I don't know.
4148220	4150420	I mean, whatever.
4150420	4151420	You know what?
4151420	4152420	Who cares?
4152420	4153900	Like, I don't see the problem with it.
4153900	4161780	If that's something that you want to purchase, cool, but as long as it functions as a game,
4161780	4162780	then that's fine.
4162780	4167180	Like these things that literally like they don't have the executable for the game in
4167180	4171820	the download, you know, come on, maybe maybe you should pay attention to that shit and
4171820	4176040	fix that part, because that's what's making discoverability so hard is all this crap that's
4176040	4177040	on there.
4177040	4178660	Not, oh, hey, there's tons of visual novels.
4178660	4182340	But to be fair, there are a lot of visual novels that appear in the front page as well.
4182340	4185660	You know, and people do tend to kind of stay within one ecosystem.
4185660	4190020	I mean, I'm sure there's some that own a few games on Steam, a few games on GOG, a few
4190020	4193340	games on HIO, you know, and the different stuff that's out there.
4193340	4196640	But I think there's probably a lot of people that kind of tend to stay within one ecosystem.
4196640	4201940	So if GOG sees this opportunity to lure a fandom with visual novels, then, you know,
4201940	4206620	if they kind of get in the GOG universe, which GOG is a fine platform, you know, it has a
4206620	4211620	lot of the same things that, you know, Steam offers and some different stuff, too, especially
4211620	4215860	when it comes to the classic games, but, you know, they can kind of get people in their
4215860	4219020	ecosystem and then maybe the games that they want to buy that aren't just visual novels,
4219020	4222780	they're going to stick with GOG and it kind of gets more people there to compete with
4222780	4224260	Steam maybe a little more.
4224260	4225260	Yeah.
4225260	4226260	Yeah.
4226260	4227260	Interesting.
4227260	4228260	Anyway.
4228260	4229260	All right.
4229260	4231220	Well, let's move on and talk about programming your own game.
4231220	4232940	Maybe you want to write your own visual novel game.
4232940	4239160	Well, you soon can do that on the Nintendo Switch, thanks to an app called PucciCon Smile
4239160	4240820	Basic.
4240820	4241820	This is a coding app.
4241820	4246580	It was actually on the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U, although I must confess, I'd never
4246580	4247620	heard of it.
4247620	4252180	But Smile Basic was also known as Petite Computer, I think was another name for this software.
4252180	4253700	That I think was on the 3DS maybe?
4253700	4254700	It was.
4254700	4256020	It was on the 3DS and the Wii U.
4256020	4259580	It allows you to make games by coding in basic.
4259580	4265100	So you know, your whole Commodore 64 programming knowledge, your Apple IIe programming and
4265100	4266900	all that can come back.
4266900	4269340	So here, I'm going to write a sample program in basic.
4269340	4270340	Here we go.
4270340	4271340	Ready?
4271340	4276700	10, print, quote, OLR rules, end quote, enter.
4276700	4280340	20, go to 10, run.
4280340	4281340	There you go.
4281340	4283500	I wrote a basic program live on air.
4283500	4285020	And that's the type of thing you can actually...
4285020	4288300	Yeah, they have Smile Basic for the 3DS available now for 10 bucks.
4288300	4291000	Yeah, so this is something that's going to be coming to the Switch.
4291000	4296540	So it's not just stuff you can do portable, but you can also have things you can do on
4296540	4297620	the TV.
4297620	4302360	No word yet if you are able to transfer the save files.
4302360	4306060	Because I would think like, well, what if I write a really awesome program?
4306940	4308860	What if I want to send that to a friend?
4308860	4311940	Or is it going to have to be like the old school days where you're going to have to
4311940	4315460	type it out of the back of a magazine?
4315460	4318820	Because maybe that's going to be your only option for a petite computer.
4318820	4319820	Who knows?
4319820	4320820	So...
4320820	4321820	All right.
4321820	4323060	Anyway, I'm looking forward to that.
4323060	4324060	I think that's really cool.
4324060	4328460	I had no idea that was the thing on 3DS and Wii U, but I know a lot of us missed some
4328460	4329460	Wii U stuff.
4329460	4332780	So it's all getting a second chance over on the Switch.
4332780	4336420	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to the classic game in a few stories?
4336420	4338700	I have a thingy.
4338700	4339700	Not that kind of thingy.
4339700	4340700	Do you?
4340700	4341700	All right.
4341700	4342700	It's a personal thing.
4342700	4347300	Basically, there is a company that's receiving some backlash.
4347300	4353960	And honestly, I kind of think that it's well-deserved backlash because they are doing a game called
4353960	4358340	Active Shooter that takes place during a school shooting.
4358340	4363280	You play as either the SWAT team or as an active shooter in a school setting with potential
4363280	4365700	to play as a civilian as well.
4365700	4372500	You know, I can see where people right now are like, this is not something I'd like to
4372500	4373500	be playing.
4373500	4374500	I had one.
4374500	4375500	Okay.
4375500	4376500	I'm sorry.
4376500	4377500	I'm just saying.
4377500	4379540	The company putting it out is called Revived Games.
4379540	4386940	And basically, they put a disclaimer on there saying that it is just a simulation, not to
4386940	4388660	be taken seriously.
4388660	4392540	If you feel that you might hurt people, call 911, blah, blah, blah.
4392540	4397060	But the thing is, and what Allison says, it doesn't promote any sort of violence.
4397060	4401440	The thing is that with the game coming out when we have had, what is it, like 19 school
4401440	4404420	shootings to date?
4404420	4409240	And how many just, like there was that story about the four-year-old that shot his two-year-old
4409240	4413580	brother because he thought it was a fucking toy gun because his idiot asshole parents
4413580	4417460	didn't put their damn gun with the safety on and a fucking gun locker.
4417460	4420460	Sorry, I'm a little pissed off by that.
4420460	4425060	And you have historically on the show been a little bit of a, well, like you've said
4425060	4426380	you want a gun.
4426380	4427380	You've said that here on the show.
4427380	4429380	I was not at all anti-gun.
4429380	4430380	Right.
4430380	4433140	As long as you're fucking responsible with it.
4433140	4434340	Yes.
4434340	4437960	But I don't believe anyone needs a fucking assault weapon.
4437960	4443720	I don't think that anyone needs any semi-automatic or fully automatic weapons at all.
4443720	4447840	There's only one purpose for a military gun and that is to kill a human.
4447840	4449200	You don't need it to go hunting.
4449200	4451360	You will destroy that deer and the meat will be shitty.
4451360	4456840	What if I can't aim very well and you know, any quantity over quality.
4456840	4457840	Take up a new hobby.
4457840	4460480	Then you know what the fuck they should do is that they should make sure that anyone
4460480	4462480	who buys a gun goes through fucking training.
4462480	4465320	Like when you buy a car.
4465320	4470520	You could run over a shitload of people with a car, but no, we are required to be licensed
4470520	4473600	drivers who have gone through a year at least of training for it.
4473600	4475880	If you drive drunk, they take that right away.
4475880	4476880	Precisely.
4476880	4479760	Guns should have the same, you know, thing on it.
4479760	4484680	Anyway, not to, not to get too far from the story, but, but anyway, but to do a game like
4484680	4492200	this when this is such a big problem right now is highly insensitive at the best.
4492200	4499280	It's insensitive and you know, and it's in steam's, um, uh, PMP not to release any game
4499280	4506880	with the, um, uh, purpose to, to, you know, gain attention by shock value, which is kind
4506880	4507880	of what this is.
4507880	4511440	But you know, you know, the whole, like my perspective is that video games are art, right?
4511440	4512440	Art is commentary.
4512440	4513440	Shit isn't art.
4513440	4514680	It's a bad game.
4514680	4515680	I let you finish.
4515680	4516880	Can I finish?
4516880	4521300	So my whole thing is I'm not saying I'm not defending the game by any means, but could
4521300	4528340	this be that somebody feels the need to put this out there because we've become so desensitized
4528340	4530900	to what's happening in the culture.
4530900	4535340	Like, you know, all these shootings have happened, you know, ever since Sandy Hook, Vegas, all
4535340	4536340	this stuff.
4536340	4538740	And literally nothing has been done.
4538740	4539740	Nothing.
4539740	4541380	Thoughts and prayers ain't shit.
4541380	4543020	Nothing has been done.
4543020	4547240	And you know, no matter, no matter what your stance is on gun laws and all that stuff,
4547240	4551160	my whole thing is that they haven't even tried anything.
4551160	4552160	Nothing has been done.
4552160	4555680	I thought everybody agreed on this whole bump stock thing.
4555680	4556680	Nothing has been done.
4556680	4558120	Bump stocks are nothing anyway.
4558120	4559960	They're not legal in those states.
4559960	4560960	Yeah.
4560960	4561960	But nothing has been done.
4561960	4567760	So in a way, like when I first heard about this, I was like, is this maybe like a commentary
4567760	4572400	that like, well, since this is commonplace in our culture anyway, let's just make a game
4572400	4573480	about it.
4573480	4576800	You know, I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's shock value and all that.
4576800	4581040	It's just, you know, doing it because it can, but you know, there is a part of me that says
4581040	4585240	maybe there is maybe art is the wrong word.
4585240	4589160	Maybe there is an expression in here, but there's nothing on their website talking about
4589160	4590800	it being a political commentary.
4590800	4594640	Well then if they were going to put in, I gave them too much credit, I guess if they
4594640	4600080	were going to release this as some kind of commentary, then they should have made it
4600080	4602880	very clear on their website.
4602880	4608560	This is so that you can see what it's like to be in an active shooter situation when
4608560	4609920	your life is in danger.
4609920	4614920	This is so you can see what we accept as the norm in our society.
4614920	4620360	And if they were going to do it, it should only be from the civilian point of view.
4620360	4622640	And it should be something with no control.
4622640	4625280	You can't control anything in the game around you.
4625280	4630240	Some people are going to be so, but I mean, at the same time, again, we have done nothing
4630240	4631240	about it.
4631240	4634080	And like, how are you going to, how are you going to wake, wake people the fuck up to
4634080	4637160	do something about what's going on here?
4637160	4638720	Wait till it's one of their kids.
4638720	4644040	It's a congressman was shot at a baseball.
4644040	4645040	Am I not?
4645040	4646040	Nothing that happened.
4646040	4647040	There was like a baseball thing.
4647040	4648040	Yeah.
4648040	4649040	Like a congressman got shot.
4649040	4650160	Nothing has still been done.
4650160	4655600	Or the lady, the congresswoman who was under an assassination attempt, Arizona lady.
4655600	4661160	You know, the thing that the thing is is that, and honestly enough, it really is due to the
4661160	4662160	NRA.
4662160	4667520	The NRA was a tiny little organization in the 70s and started using the Second Amendment
4667520	4673400	and warping the words there of to make, to grow themselves in popularity and money.
4673400	4675440	And now they're as big as they are.
4675440	4680280	And they have married this idea with guns and patriotism.
4680280	4686640	And so it's why we have to even look at something stupid like this and go, wow, that's insensitive
4686640	4690320	because we live in a country where people don't do jack shit unless someone's lining
4690320	4692000	their pocket to do jack shit.
4692000	4696160	Guys, you don't chat at live.voggenover.com says, nah, the game is trash and the devs
4696160	4697160	are trash.
4697160	4700600	A race leader says, can we just overthrow the government and just install dark soccer
4700600	4701600	and Rob Roberts?
4701600	4704360	You need to make sure that you say in writing that that was a joke.
4704360	4706280	I didn't hear my name in there.
4706280	4707280	Yeah.
4707280	4708280	Do put, that was a joke.
4708280	4709640	You'll be secretary of state.
4709640	4712760	Also, you have to want the job and no thanks.
4712760	4719920	No, I don't want to lead this shit hole unless I'm like Khaleesi because seriously, if I
4719920	4724120	had my way, if I had my way, and again, this is probably never going to happen and I'm
4724120	4725600	not actively seeking it.
4725600	4726600	Commentary.
4726600	4727600	This is commentary.
4727600	4728600	This is commentary.
4728600	4730720	Iceland had a revolution about two years ago.
4730720	4735640	They overthrew their own government and rewrote their fucking government.
4735640	4738240	America's too fucking big to do this peacefully.
4738240	4739240	They did it peacefully on top of that.
4739240	4741640	And I think that's important to say, yes.
4741640	4746920	And in their entire, I think like last 50 years, there've been one police shooting of
4746920	4754360	any one and it was an active gunman situation and the cop was traumatic, traumatized by
4754360	4755360	it.
4755360	4764800	So I'm saying that America really is too big to govern, but nobody wants to do anything
4764800	4769280	differently because as long as they're comfortable and people have their distractions, fucking
4769280	4772500	go read 1984 and read Brave New World.
4772500	4774360	Both of these things were foretold.
4774360	4776760	Also commentary of its time.
4776760	4777760	Yeah.
4777760	4778760	Yeah.
4778760	4779760	So.
4779760	4780760	All right.
4780760	4781760	Anyway, tricky subject.
4781760	4782760	I know.
4782760	4787080	But you know, that's again, I think that's kind of where people, whether it be for shock
4787080	4791320	value because they're trash, because they're, they think it's art, whatever it is, you know,
4791320	4796880	I think that's where I'd be the queen and have a parliament or yes, I would, I would
4796880	4797880	be queen.
4797880	4798880	Liz seems to be doing okay.
4798880	4799880	Huh?
4799880	4800880	Liz seems to be doing okay.
4800880	4801880	Right.
4801880	4802880	You know, her last corgi died.
4802880	4803880	Oh, that's.
4804000	4809000	Well, she was breeding them all from her very first corgi, um, but she didn't want anyone
4809000	4811160	but her to handle her own corgis.
4811160	4812880	And so she let the last one die out.
4812880	4813880	All right.
4813880	4816640	Anyway, we got to move on just a couple more stories for you guys.
4816640	4819560	And then the classic game, we'll go back to simpler times of the classic game of the week,
4819560	4820560	but first Loki.
4820560	4821920	All right.
4821920	4827160	So, um, there's a new switch bundle that's available in Japan.
4827160	4830320	Now what makes us different is it's cheaper.
4830320	4835960	It's only 26,978 yen or about $246.
4835960	4837920	But it's missing a few things.
4837920	4842580	So what it's missing is of course, uh, the dock.
4842580	4852520	It's missing the power supply and I believe, oh, and then of course the, uh, joy con grip
4852520	4858540	that you would plug everything together and apparently, um, an HDMI cable.
4858540	4860880	So it doesn't include any of those.
4860880	4863900	The um, so what it does come with is the switch console.
4863900	4868540	You get two joy cons and then the little, uh, straps that go with it.
4868540	4874180	So there's no way to charge this thing unless you buy a USB three charger and there's definitely
4874180	4877280	no way to dock it cause you're in need of dock.
4877280	4883380	What I don't get though about this whole thing is the standard set actually is only 32,378
4883380	4885160	yen or $295.
4885160	4887960	So you really only saving about 50 bucks on it.
4887960	4891480	But the costs to replace all the items that are missing are more than $50.
4891480	4894680	So why the fuck would you do that?
4894680	4896840	It seems like a really terrible idea.
4896840	4897840	Yeah.
4897840	4902360	I, I mean I can understand why they might want to put the options out there and so forth,
4902360	4906880	especially when there's so much more like portable gaming in Japan, you know, because
4906880	4911820	again, the Vita is actually still successful there gaming does so well, but yeah, I would,
4911820	4915480	I would hope people might have like, I would think the only way like I could see this is
4915480	4920500	if they did include an AC adapter and then it could be like, Oh, this is like for like
4920500	4921500	your siblings.
4921500	4926380	So you have one doc in the house, I would say multiple kids in the house that, you know,
4926380	4931020	that way, you know, you can do that, but still it's nice to have the doc anyways to charge
4931020	4932020	the thing.
4932020	4937760	I mean, I, I, the doc really shouldn't cost $90 or whatever it is that ridiculous amount
4937760	4941480	of money for this piece of plastic and tiny little bit of hardware.
4941480	4943920	I just, I think it's stupid, but whatever.
4943920	4947500	It's not over here, so I'm not worried about it, but it is kind of annoying that they didn't
4947500	4951280	include like a lot of things that you kind of need at the very least.
4951280	4953920	I think they should have put a power supply in there, but after all, they didn't do they
4953920	4955480	sell three DS without power supply.
4955480	4956960	Oh yeah, they still do.
4956960	4957960	Yeah.
4957960	4961280	Cause there's so many power supplies already out there and there's third party ones and
4961280	4962280	all that stuff too.
4962280	4968420	And if I'm not mistaken, uh, the, the switch just charges on USB-C it does so, but the
4968420	4972880	charger that comes with though charges it much faster than like an average phone charger.
4972880	4975680	And those charters are still pretty expensive and yeah, I get it.
4975680	4979520	You have charters for your phones and stuff, but I don't know.
4979520	4981360	It's just, it seems annoying.
4981360	4988240	Just spend the extra money and then that we don't have to worry about missing this stuff,
4988240	4989240	I guess.
4989240	4993240	All right, well, uh, before we get into the classic game of the week this week and a game
4993240	4996980	that actually happened, let's talk about a game that didn't happen.
4996980	5000520	And it's, it's really sad because this would have been a sequel to final fantasy tactics,
5000520	5004680	which I mean, God, so many people love that game and they've continued to make final fantasy
5004680	5007360	tactics like what they had, the game boy advanced one.
5007360	5008360	Right.
5008360	5010040	And then they had, I think it's been on mobile at some point.
5010040	5014640	Um, if you play final fantasy 14, there's like a whole quest line now where they actually
5014640	5018800	have Ramza in it, you know, like they, they, or it's, I think it's, it's a descendant of
5018800	5022800	the original Rams or something, but anyway, I don't know how it all plays together.
5022800	5023800	That story.
5023800	5025400	I just, I just liked the shiny things.
5025400	5029280	But anyway, people love their fall fantasy tactics and it was, it was really such a,
5029280	5031400	such a great game of the PlayStation one era.
5031400	5035920	Um, so whatever, how, why didn't they just do like another final fantasy tactics advance?
5035920	5041040	Well, they were going to, uh, director Yasumi Matsuno said that there was a full sequel
5041040	5045400	plan for the original PlayStation and it was called final fantasy tactics two.
5045400	5050420	Uh, this was a plan project and it even has assets and some of those assets have hit the
5050420	5054200	internet this week and you can actually see, but unfortunately it didn't happen because
5054200	5057480	they weren't sure if they should outsource the game, which happens a lot.
5057680	5061120	I don't know if you guys know, but games get outsourced to other companies to do the art
5061120	5062120	and things like that.
5062120	5067280	Uh, or you know, if they should have kept it in house also, they were going from a swap
5067280	5073320	from a 3d project to like a 2d hexagon thing that was going to be the big twist is that
5073320	5074320	this was going to be a hexagon.
5074320	5079160	It's kind of like when a sieve sieve five went to sieve six and then now it's on a hexagon
5079160	5081600	grid or wait, was that sooner than that?
5081600	5083080	I'm, Oh my God.
5083080	5084080	It's been a long time.
5084080	5085080	You guys.
5085080	5088280	Sieve three to sieve four went from square to hexagon.
5088280	5090760	But anyway, it changed a lot.
5090760	5093960	Um, so the project did ultimately get canceled.
5093960	5094960	Unfortunately.
5094960	5099800	Um, don't know why square just didn't try to do something cause this game was so popular,
5099800	5102080	but it's probably too late now.
5102080	5103080	I don't know.
5103080	5105080	Let me ask that before we get to the classic game of the week.
5105080	5107920	Is it too late to do a final fantasy tactics?
5107920	5108920	Nope.
5108920	5109920	Never too late.
5109920	5115040	I totally even, and you wouldn't call it just a, well, it's like Castlevania, but you know,
5115040	5121200	you wouldn't call it, I didn't, I don't care for tactics games and I wouldn't mind a sequel.
5121200	5123920	I mean, I'm not going to play it, but yeah, that's the thing.
5123920	5127820	I don't play a lot of tactical games, but I'd play final fantasy tactics and it was
5127820	5132200	something about the job classes in that game were so well done and maybe because it did
5132200	5135480	have those ties to, you know, the classic final fantasy world and stuff.
5135480	5137320	That's part of what made it really cool.
5137320	5138320	I don't know.
5138320	5140320	So, all right.
5140320	5144920	Anyhow, well, let's take a trip down memory lane and check out a different classic game
5144920	5150040	because every week on this show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game
5150040	5155840	that she thinks, Hey, brats, you should be checking this shit out.
5155840	5160160	Check it out or, or else it's the classic game of the week.
5160160	5164840	Dark Sakura stepped into the gaming vault to find a game for you guys to play this week.
5164840	5165840	Dark Sakura.
5165840	5169480	I wonder if this is my first DS game.
5169480	5170480	I'm not sure.
5170480	5171480	Maybe not.
5171480	5172480	It might.
5172480	5173480	It very well might be.
5174040	5180040	The World Ends With You, which came out in, uh, uh, July 27th, 2007.
5180040	5184040	Well, I'll tell you what, it's a great first 3DS game if it is.
5184040	5186200	In the US it came out in April, 2008.
5186200	5193760	So here, 10 year old game, um, it is an action, uh, role play game, uh, with urban fantasy
5193760	5194760	elements.
5194760	5198160	It was done by Square Enix and Jupiter for the Nintendo DS.
5198160	5207200	It is set in Shibuya, um, and it is, uh, an art style that's inspired by Shibuya and
5207200	5209600	its, uh, local culture.
5209600	5213360	And it was also inspired by another game that Jupiter developed, Kingdom Hearts Chain of
5213360	5214360	Memories.
5214360	5223200	Um, you play as, uh, a character named Neku Sakuraba, um, and, uh, all of his friends,
5223200	5229040	they are, though, forced to participate in a game that's going to decide their own fate.
5229040	5235960	And it has, um, a very unique battle system that really uses the Nintendo DS to its best
5235960	5240720	capability, including their combat that takes place on both of the screens, and certain
5240720	5244160	attacks that are used with certain motions on the touch screen or by shouting into the
5244160	5245160	microphone.
5245160	5250800	Um, and of course, pop culture of, you know, of the day and age really play heavily into
5250800	5251800	the game.
5251800	5259000	Um, it has a great soundtrack, wonderful graphics, the gameplay is absolutely stunning, and of
5259000	5267600	course, um, the, uh, it had its own manga development as well, um, by, uh, Ishido Amano,
5267600	5271000	who was the, uh, writer and artist of the Kingdom Hearts manga.
5271000	5275000	Um, I think we're already getting somebody saying something in the chat room.
5275000	5281000	Oh, it's, uh, Raginator saying something that has nothing to do with the article.
5281200	5282200	Um, anyway.
5282200	5283200	Um, so...
5283200	5285200	And I don't think I said that, anyway.
5285200	5286200	Yeah.
5286200	5287200	I got my values.
5287200	5296600	Um, anyway, you have, um, like, uh, the real ground, which is normal life, and then you
5296600	5300400	have the underground, which is the alternate plane of existence.
5300400	5308720	Um, so the ones who are, are, I guess, the chosen dead go there and they play the Reaper's
5308720	5315120	Game, so they offer up a treasured possession to the game, and then they can, uh, you know,
5315120	5319520	basically play for it and can get brought back to life or transcend into a higher form
5319520	5320520	of existence.
5320520	5325520	If you go higher, you become a reaper who are the opponents in future games, so it just
5325520	5327520	really goes through and through and through.
5327520	5333120	Um, and of course, if you are in the underground, you are, uh, invisible to people in the real
5333120	5334920	ground, vice versa.
5334920	5339520	You send messages and you get your assignments through, like, your cell phone or you get
5339520	5348120	something imprinted on your hand, and, um, it just is, it's kind of a really neat, surrealist
5348120	5351320	kind of, you know, scenario in here.
5351320	5355320	Um, but it was, it's a really, really neat game.
5355320	5361320	Um, it has just a lot of elements to it, and it was, uh, I mean, basically for the, the
5361320	5365020	game is an action roleplay game, it's divided into three chapters that are based on the
5365020	5371220	three weeks that Neku is playing the Reaper's Game, um, and then each chapter is done by
5371220	5377520	day of the week, so, uh, it's just a really, really compelling game, I think.
5377520	5384720	Um, of course, you also, uh, can collect, uh, pins called psych pins that give you powers
5384720	5389320	while you're wearing them, and they're used for, uh, combat and different abilities in
5389320	5390320	combat.
5390320	5398020	So, um, like I said, it was developed by, uh, um, the same team that made, um, the Kingdom
5398020	5402920	Hearts series with input from Jupiter, the company that developed Kingdom Hearts Chain
5402920	5408820	of Memories, and, uh, it's been, I think, a good solid two years in development, and
5408820	5413820	they wanted it to be a game that could only be played on the DS, which, I mean, as you
5413820	5417620	can see, for anyone who's played it, as you can see from the combat, yeah, it is specific
5417620	5418620	to that.
5418620	5420220	The soundtrack is really good.
5420220	5427320	It was, uh, composed, uh, by, um, Takeharu Ishimoto, who, um, does music from across
5427320	5430020	various, uh, disciplines.
5430020	5434620	You've got rock, you have electronica, you've got hip-hop, it's just to fit the different,
5434620	5443620	you know, types of moods of living in Shibuya, and then, um, uh, the song in the end credits,
5443620	5448620	Lullaby For You, was done by, uh, a pop artist, uh, Jungri.
5448620	5454620	Um, the different artists in there, there's, like, uh, really, there's just a bunch of,
5454620	5460620	you know, uh, artists that are too many for me to really name, um, and they also used,
5460620	5467620	um, the, uh, Kyouseshu Soundstreamer for the compression, which is normally used for voice-overs,
5467620	5474620	but it's to make the, the songs fit on the game media while still having full, you know,
5474620	5476620	the full motion cutscenes and everything.
5476620	5480620	Um, well, I mean, they replaced the full motion with, like, flash style animations, so it's
5480620	5484620	supposed to have a high clarity and a really striking style.
5484620	5490620	Um, there also was The World Ends With You solo remix that was released on iOS, um, in
5490620	5498620	August 2012 and on Android on, uh, June 2014, and it's basically the same game, just, you
5498620	5501620	know, modified the combat for single screen.
5501620	5507620	Um, it also redid all the graphics in, uh, high-def sprites, and it's optimized to use
5507620	5509620	the retina display on iOS devices.
5509620	5514620	So, it was taken out for a short version because it stopped working with iOS 8, but now it
5514620	5517620	is back in the App Store as of 2015.
5517620	5523620	And then on the Switch, The World Ends With You final remix was announced in January 2018
5523620	5525620	to be released this year.
5525620	5531620	It is a Switch, uh, Switch release that allows you to use the Joy-Con in addition to a touchscreen,
5531620	5534620	and it has new scenarios to be added into the game.
5534620	5538620	Um, so, it got really, really great reviews.
5538620	5545620	Um, the first shipment of the game sold out, and just was one of the, I'd say, best sellers
5545620	5548620	for the DS, you know, when it came out.
5548620	5554620	So, still widely loved, widely played, um, even ten years later.
5554620	5556620	So, there's the game.
5556620	5557620	The World Ends With You.
5557620	5558620	Alright, great pick.
5558620	5561620	Uh, it's one of those games that you kind of go, wait, this shit's ten years old?
5561620	5562620	Oh my gosh.
5562620	5564620	Eleven, well, eleven technically.
5564620	5566620	Yeah, so there it is, your classic game of the week.
5566620	5569620	The World Ends With You.
5569620	5574620	Check that out on the DS or pretty soon on the Switch, or on the mobile devices as, uh,
5574620	5576620	Dark Soccer just explained to you.
5576620	5578620	So, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere.
5578620	5581620	We've got plenty more OLR to come, including the rapid-fire news.
5581620	5586620	Uh, maybe your emails, although we're having email bag problems, but we'll try to fix that.
5586620	5588620	And then, uh, more news, including, ooh, Lego stuff.
5588620	5589620	We'll get into that.
5589620	5594620	So, uh, all that and more when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5600620	5603620	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5603620	5610620	Live tonight, episode number 732 of our show for this May 27th, 2018, already in progress.
5610620	5613620	So, um, you know, it is Memorial Day weekend here in the States.
5613620	5619620	Uh, a big, uh, thank you and, uh, um, memorial to, uh, those who have, uh, given the ultimate sacrifice
5619620	5625620	so that, uh, we can continue to be free enough to do this show weeks on Sunday nights for you guys.
5625620	5627620	So, let's not forget what the long weekend is about.
5627620	5632620	Uh, also, I thought, uh, maybe we could take this opportunity to, uh, give you some updates on our privacy policy
5632620	5634620	since that's all the rage right now. No, I'm just kidding. We do.
5634620	5640620	What privacy policy? We don't, I mean, you sign up for accounts at VOG, but we don't really...
5640620	5643620	If you show us your pussies, we will post those pictures on the internet.
5643620	5645620	What? You mean cats. You mean cats.
5645620	5646620	Pussy cats.
5646620	5649620	She says that because she had Mr. Smoosh in her lap just a minute ago.
5649620	5651620	Did you get some pictures of Mr. Smoosh?
5651620	5652620	No, he got Wrigley.
5652620	5656620	Ah, yeah, he did. Sometimes he doesn't like to be, you know, that whole constricted thing, so.
5656620	5657620	But he likes...
5657620	5658620	And he did give me snuggles.
5658620	5660620	He likes you and I told you why he likes women.
5660620	5661620	Because boobs.
5661620	5663620	Because boobs. He's like, he's a ladies man.
5663620	5666620	Okay, so, get this conversation I had with my mom.
5666620	5667620	Okay.
5667620	5671620	She's like, how much weight you lose? I said, 87 pounds.
5671620	5675620	She's like, you lose any boob? No.
5675620	5676620	Just one boob.
5676620	5681620	Well, no, because a lot of times when women lose weight, they also lose boob size.
5681620	5682620	Sure. Sure.
5682620	5688620	I was like, no, I still have my shelf and the cats aren't complaining, so I was thinking of Mr. Smoosh.
5688620	5693620	And she's like, I don't even know what that means, but I'm mad.
5693620	5694620	So, whatever.
5694620	5700620	Well, at least she didn't say, I can see your dirty pillows.
5700620	5701620	That's a different reference.
5701620	5702620	Yes, it is.
5702620	5705620	They're all gonna laugh at you.
5705620	5707620	They're breasts, mother.
5707620	5713620	Anyway, I think that's my life goal is to star in a Carrie remake.
5713620	5716620	Yes, as a high schooler. I would still be a high schooler.
5716620	5719620	I actually see that second Carrie thing.
5719620	5722620	Oh, the one with Julia Moore?
5722620	5724620	It was actually not too terrible.
5724620	5728620	But then I saw the one that they were going to spin off into a Carrie TV series.
5728620	5731620	Oh, wasn't there a Carrie musical too?
5731620	5737620	I don't know, but I watched the one that was like the TV version and it actually was pretty good.
5737620	5740620	And I kind of dug the ending to it. I would have watched a series based on that.
5740620	5742620	And then there was Drew Carey.
5743620	5745620	No, that's different.
5745620	5747620	You know what I would like?
5747620	5751620	A sequel to Firestarter with Drew Barrymore now all grown up.
5751620	5753620	Wouldn't that be some shit?
5753620	5754620	Careful what you wish for.
5754620	5757620	I mean, reinventions of shit from the past is like all the rage.
5757620	5764620	I can't believe Charmed is coming back and it's not like it's not Shannon Doherty or any of those people.
5764620	5769620	Well, I mean, that's cool for diversity and all, but like Charmed hasn't been gone that long.
5769620	5771620	Well, they're also bringing back Sabrina.
5771620	5778620	But if I watch the new Sabrina, I haven't watched any of Riverdale, but I might have how many seasons is it?
5778620	5779620	Just two now.
5779620	5781620	I could probably catch up to that.
5781620	5784620	But I'm also like behind three seasons on Supernatural.
5784620	5786620	Can we less funny and more serious now or?
5786620	5788620	Oh, yeah, it's not going to be like that.
5788620	5790620	I don't mind because I would.
5790620	5795620	Well, and there's now the way we're daughters is coming out the spinoff of Supernatural,
5795620	5799620	which makes me mad because I would have wanted to spin off with Joe and her mama.
5799620	5801620	But no, they had to kill them.
5801620	5804620	Well, I imagine they got to be looking at ending Supernatural.
5804620	5806620	I mean, that's just been on over 10 years, hasn't it?
5806620	5808620	They're on season 11, I think just finished.
5808620	5812620	See, I think I mean, I don't know. Law and Order went for 20.
5812620	5815620	But I mean, I guess Supernatural has its fan base.
5815620	5817620	Jared's still pretty and so is his wife.
5817620	5820620	That's like the couple I have a crush, a couple crush on.
5820620	5823620	Oh, 13 just finished.
5823620	5827620	13 just finished. Oh, my God. They're saying season 13, a Supernatural just finished.
5827620	5829620	You want to know what's funny thing about Supernatural?
5829620	5831620	It was supposed to end after the fifth season.
5831620	5834620	The original writer wrote through five seasons.
5834620	5839620	The story wrapped up in season five, which is why season six was kind of weird.
5839620	5841620	Wasn't that kind of like Buffy was kind of like.
5841620	5849620	Yeah, well, I'm glad they ended Buffy after season seven, because even season seven was just kind of crap, except for the musical episode for the musical.
5849620	5853620	Well, that and I finally got my Buffy Spike action and I was pretty happy.
5853620	5857620	As that says, Supernatural is the only show that survived the WB.
5857620	5861620	That's right. Oh, my God. No, America's Top Model is still going to.
5861620	5863620	Oh, no, wait, was that UPN show?
5863620	5864620	I don't know.
5864620	5866620	But America's Top Model is still going.
5866620	5872620	Tyra Banks is back as I'm waiting for the inevitable because Top Model is now a VH1 show.
5872620	5876620	And now it's crazy because Drag Race kind of started like that.
5876620	5877620	America's Top Drag Race.
5877620	5880620	Well, Drag Race started as like a spoof of Top Model.
5880620	5885620	And now, in some ways, it's almost more in the pop culture lexicon than Top Model.
5885620	5891620	So, you know, we did have Raja doing Miss Tyra herself.
5891620	5892620	Smizing.
5892620	5894620	That's right. Raja was on Top Model.
5894620	5897620	No, she did Tyra Banks in Snatch Game.
5897620	5903620	No, but she was also she was some type of like stylist or something advisor in the early seasons of Top Model.
5903620	5906620	But still, she did Tyra and that made everything for her Snatch Game.
5906620	5908620	Yeah, it did. It did. Anyway.
5908620	5910620	All right. We got to move on.
5910620	5913620	Got to get back to some video games and some rapid fire news.
5913620	5916620	Quickly talking about some other things that have happened in the world of gaming.
5916620	5917620	We'll start with you, Loki.
5917620	5918620	Everything old is new again.
5918620	5923620	And Killer7 is coming to Steam this fall.
5923620	5925620	Yay.
5925620	5927620	It'll be optimized for PC.
5927620	5929620	Not much to optimize, though. It's pretty flat shaded.
5929620	5931620	So, but it is a cool game.
5931620	5933620	So looking forward to that.
5934620	5940620	And then along in the same lines, there's a new Leisure Suit Larry game coming out.
5940620	5944620	That's right. Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams Don't Dry.
5946620	5947620	It's been...
5947620	5951620	They totally missed an opportunity for a play on that old movie with Robin Williams.
5951620	5954620	The What Dreams May Come by calling it Wet Dreams May Come.
5954620	5955620	Come on.
5955620	5956620	No.
5956620	5957620	Come on.
5957620	5962620	It's supposed to be a parody of Dark Dreams Don't Die.
5962620	5966620	So, it looks cool.
5966620	5973620	I mean, it's a very, I don't know, it looks pretty.
5973620	5974620	The artwork is great.
5974620	5975620	Horrible.
5975620	5976620	Yeah, the last one was horrible.
5976620	5978620	This doesn't look like the last one.
5978620	5980620	I mean, it's definitely more of like, it's got that...
5980620	5982620	I'm assuming someone new has the license.
5982620	5983620	Yes.
5983620	5986620	Assemble Entertainment is the one that's putting it out.
5986620	5987620	It's actually on Steam.
5987620	5989620	That's how we kind of found out about it.
5989620	5990620	They're going to do...
5990620	5995620	It's going to be sold for 30 bucks and it's going to be coming out October 24th, I believe.
5997620	6001620	Yeah, so, you know, October 24th.
6001620	6003620	Interesting.
6003620	6009620	Yeah, I'm with Dungeon Buster in chat saying, after Magna Cum Laude, I'm surprised that anyone would do another one.
6009620	6011620	This looks different though.
6011620	6015620	It looks like an actual adventure game and the graphics are really good.
6015620	6017620	I mean, it's a legendary franchise.
6017620	6018620	It's worth trying again.
6018620	6020620	And I know the last one was kind of just a remake of the first one.
6020620	6024620	So this one, I think, is supposed to be just like its own, like, a brand new game.
6024620	6026620	So it'd be interesting to see.
6028620	6029620	Alright, anyway.
6029620	6033620	Let's move on to some other stories talking about 20XDX.
6033620	6036620	One of my... That's what I call it. 20XX. Or 20XX, I guess.
6036620	6038620	Anyway, 20XX...
6038620	6039620	20XDX.
6039620	6040620	I like 20XDX.
6040620	6043620	20XX is going to be coming to the Nintendo Switch.
6043620	6044620	That's awesome.
6044620	6046620	I'm surprised Capcom is going to let that happen.
6046620	6050620	But 20XX is different enough from Mega Man where it'll be different.
6050620	6051620	So that's really cool.
6051620	6054620	It's going to be coming out on July 10th.
6054620	6056620	So that's really not long.
6056620	6057620	If you've never played 20XX...
6057620	6059620	I've streamed this game a couple times.
6059620	6065620	Once I did it myself and then once my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness and I were co-streaming it.
6065620	6066620	It was a lot of fun.
6066620	6068620	So maybe we'll have to do that again if Delvin's out there listening.
6068620	6070620	But anyway, 20XX.
6070620	6073620	It's like a roguelike, but it's mixed with Mega Man and it's really cool.
6073620	6075620	And you can do, of course, full co-op.
6075620	6077620	You can do that on the couch or online.
6077620	6083620	So I guess you'll need Nintendo online service come September to be able to play 20XX online.
6083620	6084620	So pretty cool.
6084620	6087620	I will definitely probably double dip for 20XX.
6087620	6088620	Would you like that?
6088620	6090620	I will definitely probably double dip.
6090620	6093620	Anyway, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.
6093620	6102620	Even though we talked about that earlier, it should be noted that Europe on the Nintendo 3DS and worldwide on the Xbox One, a slight delay.
6102620	6106620	The European 3DS release is now on May 31st.
6106620	6110620	The Xbox One version worldwide on June 6th.
6110620	6114620	And Inti Creates taking responsibility for that, saying the mistake's on us.
6114620	6118620	We apologize to the fans affected by this from the bottom of our hearts.
6118620	6122620	And this is the first time we've ever done such a large-scale multi-platform, multi-region simultaneous release.
6122620	6129620	And we were unable to properly take into account how much time would be required to get each platform's online store set up in each region.
6129620	6131620	So they're doing a my bad on that.
6131620	6133620	Inti Creates has been on fire lately.
6133620	6137620	I mean, I know Mighty No. 9 was kind of, eh, but that Blaster Master game was fucking rad.
6137620	6140620	This game, I'm sure, is going to do very well for them.
6140620	6144620	So, you know, they're allowed a little mistake here and there where the game gets delayed.
6144620	6151620	I did pick a Blaster Master this week, so I did pick a Blaster Master Zero with all the DLC, so I have yet to play that, though.
6151620	6152620	Oh, you should. It's so fun.
6152620	6154620	Anyway, I love that.
6154620	6157620	Delvin just popped into the chat room. He must have been listening out there.
6157620	6159620	Hey, we definitely need to do that stream again, Rob.
6159620	6161620	Alright, you got it. It's a date.
6161620	6168620	ActDef says, in other news, I did four legendary Pokémon raids and I didn't catch a single one, but I'm now level 37.
6168620	6173620	I'm only, like, 100k XP into level 37, so you're right behind me, ActDef.
6173620	6177620	And I also have tried to catch Latias and still have not caught Latias.
6177620	6183620	And I'm actually kind of pissed that Ho-Oh came back, because now people don't want to do Latias anymore.
6183620	6186620	Because they're like, ooh, shiny Ho-Oh. That's the only one I want to spend my raid passes on.
6186620	6187620	It's a little irritating.
6187620	6189620	You don't need any shiny Ho-Ohs.
6189620	6193620	I'm actually pretty impressed that they didn't change the name, because that just means Phoenix.
6193620	6195620	No, no, no, not here.
6195620	6200620	So, anyway, that's where I'm at with my Pokémon GO.
6200620	6202620	Let's move on with some more stuff.
6202620	6206620	Actually, I should mention this quickly, since Pokémon GO randomly got brought up.
6206620	6210620	The Alolan stuff in Pokémon GO, that was something they announced was going to be happening.
6210620	6217620	So, instead of Gen 4 or Gen 5, they're going to just fast-forward to Gen 7's Alolan Gen 1 forms.
6217620	6226620	Which is the Exeggutor with the giant palm tree head, and the Persian that looks like Garfield.
6226620	6229620	The purple Nyasu.
6229620	6233620	Who looks like he's given someone some major side-eye.
6233620	6235620	Some of them are really pretty, though.
6235620	6238620	Like the Vulpix, that's like the snow Vulpix. Really pretty.
6238620	6241620	I just want the new Exeggutor with the ridiculously tall neck.
6241620	6243620	I can't wait to put that in a gym.
6243620	6248620	I think it should sit on the ground next to the gym, and then the head comes up and pops up in the gym.
6248620	6251620	I hate this stupid challenge where you have to do ten great throws, because I suck at them.
6251620	6253620	Oh, yeah, those things make you get them.
6253620	6254620	I've got like seven.
6254620	6258620	Isn't there like one, because I have, I don't, I'm not that far progressed through,
6258620	6264620	but to complete all of the Mythic ones, do you have to do, there's one that has an excellent throw or something like that?
6264620	6266620	You have to get an excellent one.
6266620	6270620	An excellent throw? No, it's, what you get from the Pokéstops is random.
6270620	6272620	I need one more Oddish or Bellsprout.
6272620	6273620	Oh, for the Mew.
6273620	6274620	The Mew, yeah.
6274620	6278620	For the Mew. You do have to do an excellent curveball in the last phase,
6278620	6282620	but because you have to do something where you have to feed fifty berries to Pokémon,
6282620	6285620	like not in gyms, you have to catch fifty berries.
6285620	6288620	Like, you just keep trying to do the excellent curveball, and eventually you'll get it.
6288620	6292620	It's really easy to do on giant Pokémon like Wailmer.
6292620	6295620	I'm trying to think of what else has a gigantic hitbox.
6295620	6299620	I've heard, uh, Taro, or Taurus or whatever, the...
6299620	6304620	Mmm, they're okay. I'm trying, there's something really common that also has a giant fucking hitbox that's pretty easy.
6304620	6306620	Wailmer is the one that comes to my mind.
6306620	6307620	That's my one shiny.
6307620	6309620	Oh really? I don't have a shiny Wailmer.
6309620	6311620	I caught it at my desk at work.
6311620	6315620	I mean, I was working and not playing Pokémon GO. I was on my break.
6315620	6318620	Ponyta does have a big hitbox, as that in our chatroom says.
6318620	6319620	That is one that you can do.
6319620	6322620	I don't ever remember getting an excellent throw on anything, so...
6322620	6324620	Just keep practicing and get it eventually.
6324620	6325620	Never.
6325620	6330620	I got an excellent curveball, like, I was just feeding the berry and doing it, and I got it on my second one.
6330620	6331620	Actually, ironically, I think it was Ponyta.
6331620	6333620	How are you supposed to get an excellent?
6333620	6337620	When the dot is really tiny, you just try to hit the dot.
6337620	6339620	Oh. That's it?
6339620	6340620	Yeah.
6340620	6342620	Because I usually just throw it when the thing's at its widest.
6342620	6346620	That's nice. So gray is when it's like at half, and then excellent is when it's almost gone.
6346620	6349620	I thought that's just how close to the center you get.
6349620	6351620	I thought that that was like your...
6351620	6353620	Oh, well, I've been doing it wrong this whole time.
6353620	6361620	I thought that was like your option of how to, like, how well, like, when you're doing bursting.
6361620	6364620	You know, like, it would increase your percentage.
6364620	6366620	That's what I was thinking it was, like, in Ingress.
6366620	6369620	So if it was full out, then that was supposed to be, like, your better chance.
6369620	6370620	I played Ingress today.
6370620	6373620	We tried to do a big triangle that would cover the city.
6373620	6375620	I need more stuff. I haven't wanted to play because I haven't...
6375620	6377620	I forgot to farm at Disneyland, too.
6377620	6379620	I got stuff. I need stuff.
6379620	6381620	All right. Anyway, let's move on.
6381620	6382620	I'm gonna take back work.
6382620	6387620	Yeah, stay on that because there's a player on the other team there that is very annoying with that portal.
6387620	6389620	I'll get him fired. I'm kidding.
6389620	6391620	All right. Moving on.
6391620	6392620	You've got some rap partners.
6392620	6394620	Which, by the way, my new friend, Dana...
6394620	6398620	I know. I know. She's the friend of me here locally. That's so funny.
6398620	6401620	Yeah, she's involved in an organization I'm involved in.
6401620	6403620	She still owes me a drink.
6403620	6406620	Let her know that. I want to cash in on that drink. We need to all get a drink at some point.
6406620	6408620	Add her on Facebook.
6408620	6411620	I don't... I'm so... You know I'm, like, really little on Facebook, though.
6411620	6413620	So? Do it anyway.
6413620	6415620	So, I guess it's my turn, right?
6415620	6416620	Yes, ma'am.
6416620	6421620	Okay, so there's a listing for Mega Man 11 on the PlayStation Store in Singapore.
6421620	6425620	Oh, Singapore. Sorry, that is a...
6425620	6428620	Great. And I forgot the name of the band.
6428620	6430620	Shona Knife. Shona Knife song.
6430620	6439620	Anyway, Capcom in their press release listed something about a double gear system that would allow you to boost Mega Man's speed and power for a
6439620	6443620	quote, new twist on the satisfying gameplay the series is known for.
6443620	6448620	So, we'll see what that is. Like, my brain's already going to kind of theories on this one.
6448620	6449620	Is it just Mighty No. 9?
6449620	6457620	I don't know. But would it be neat, like, if you had, like, a primary power as your weapon and a secondary power from another boss is, like...
6457620	6463620	Oh, that's right. Eleven's the really nice looking one that they have coming out. That's right. I forgot all about that.
6463620	6473620	But I would think, like, if you could equip, like, a second boss weapon and have that be, like, what powers, like, speed or, like, burst speed or ongoing running speed or something like that, that would be kind of cool.
6473620	6480620	Don't steal my ideas, Capcom. Unless it's the idea of actually putting out, like, more good games.
6480620	6491620	And then we have another character in ranked mode for Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo for the 30th anniversary collection and that is Akuma, also known as Goki.
6491620	6504620	And he's pretty much disallowed usually from Street Fighter tournaments, but he is in ranked battle now.
6504620	6510620	So there you go. Everyone cry because everyone's going to do nothing but play Goki. So there you go.
6510620	6518620	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some releases, some upcoming video games that you can soon find in your store, starting with the US. Loki.
6518620	6525620	Yeah, lots of stuff coming out. So we've got a game called Agony, which is a survivor horror game coming on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6525620	6533620	We have Fallen Legion, Rise to Glory, that's on the Switch. Harvest Moon, Light of Hope Special Edition on the Switch and PlayStation 4.
6533620	6542620	Ikaruga on the Switch. We have Legend of K anniversary on the Switch and now let's see some non-Switch games.
6542620	6549620	Well, at least this one. Sega Genesis Classics, that's going to be on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6550620	6556620	Then we have Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection on PC, the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6556620	6564620	And a game that I originally read completely wrong in my head as Yoshi's Island Express, but it's Yoku's Island Express.
6564620	6571620	And that's on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It'd just be weird if it was on non-Nintendo platforms.
6571620	6580620	And then we have Full Metal Panic, Fight, Who Dares Win, that's on PlayStation 4.
6580620	6585620	And Liar Princess and the Blind Prince on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.
6585620	6587620	That sounds like an odd couple.
6587620	6592620	It's the worst TV sitcom ever.
6592620	6599620	Yesterday's Origins on the Nintendo Switch and I believe that is it for this week.
6599620	6605620	I like the way you said Ikaruga, by the way. You're very excited. I don't know why, but Jamie will get this in my brain.
6605620	6611620	All I heard was Ivy Winters. Ikaruga.
6611620	6613620	I have no idea what you're talking about.
6613620	6615620	Oh, it's Drag Race.
6615620	6617620	That's what makes it funny. That's what makes it funny.
6617620	6620620	Ikaruga. That's what I'm going to say for now on.
6620620	6625620	Oh, no, no. Just say it right. Ikaruga. It's a fun word.
6625620	6627620	Ikaruga.
6627620	6633620	It is fun to say, though, just as a word. Ikaruga. It's a fun word. Kind of like undulating is fun to say.
6633620	6639620	Alright, some other fun things to say. Upcoming releases in Japan, including the same Full Metal Panic, Fight, Who Dares wins.
6639620	6641620	That same game is out in Japan this week.
6641620	6644620	BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle on PlayStation 4.
6644620	6649620	There is some new keyboard coming out, because remember the PlayStation 4 will rock a USB keyboard.
6650620	6654620	Also, Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 Plus.
6654620	6659620	Liar Princess and the Blind Prince also getting its release in Japan.
6659620	6661620	There's also a Famitsu Deluxe Pack.
6661620	6667620	And that BlazBlue is in all these different crystal sets, t-shirt packs, you name it.
6667620	6673620	Also in Japan this week on PlayStation 4, Shantae, you stay, half genie hero.
6673620	6674620	I knew you were going to do that.
6674620	6676620	How can you not, Shantae? Anyway.
6676620	6679620	But has Shantae ever cosplayed as Shantae?
6679620	6684620	Has Shantae ever played Ikaruga?
6684620	6687620	Has Shantae sashayed away?
6687620	6691620	I hate this show sometimes. Alright.
6691620	6693620	That's okay, sometimes we hate ourselves.
6693620	6697620	Anyway, I'm laughing so hard it's causing a coughing fit.
6697620	6701620	Hey, there's also games coming out on the PlayStation Vita, because they still love the Vita in Japan.
6702620	6704620	Including Liar Princess and the Blind Prince.
6704620	6708620	Sweet Pool, so you can play Pocket Pool with your PlayStation Vita.
6708620	6710620	I was thinking like it would be Gwenpool or something.
6710620	6716620	I thought it was just like a thing like, you know, you just swipe left or right depending on whether you thought the pool was nice.
6716620	6718620	Just a way to knock some balls around.
6718620	6723620	And then Cafe Culere is the other game that's coming out in Japan this week.
6723620	6727620	I don't know what they serve at Cafe Culere. I'm trying to see if it's a game that I recognize.
6727620	6728620	They serve fish, Rob.
6728620	6730620	They serve anime school girls.
6731620	6733620	Anime school boys that are kind of androgynous.
6733620	6736620	Okay, androgynous anime school children.
6738620	6740620	So what's the opposite of serving fish?
6740620	6747620	Fujishiro Mao is a second year high school student who loves sweets and wants to be a patissiere chef.
6747620	6748620	Is that like a pastry?
6748620	6749620	Patissiere.
6749620	6750620	Is that pastry?
6750620	6751620	It's pastry chef.
6751620	6752620	That's what I thought, pastry chef.
6752620	6758620	So anyway, God, this sounds complicated. Basically, like the love of the life is returning, blah, blah, blah.
6758620	6760620	There's a twin involved and good Lord.
6760620	6762620	It's a soap opera.
6762620	6765620	It's Cafe Drama for those of you that love Cafe Drama.
6765620	6770620	Oh my God, that almost is like the book I'm reading right now, which is not very well written, but kind of entertaining.
6770620	6777620	It's called Drag Queen about a gay lawyer who finds out he was adopted and meets his drag queen twin brother.
6777620	6781620	And lastly, on the Nintendo Switch this week, Blaze Blue is also out on the Switch.
6781620	6785620	And that liar princess and the blind prince also on the Switch.
6785620	6789620	Okay, MXC in chat says Sweet Pool is a boys love slash horror game.
6789620	6793620	What? Hold on, now I got to look that I just assumed it was a pool scene.
6793620	6795620	Oh, no, this is this is wow.
6795620	6800620	He's this is not that is not a that there there will be some balls around in this.
6800620	6802620	I'll play this one.
6802620	6804620	Hold up, hold up, hold up.
6804620	6810620	What is this where the dude is like erotically like grabbing the fence going like, is there a problem?
6811620	6815620	I don't know about you, but whenever I stand next to a chain link, I guess I have to have to.
6815620	6821620	You have to just you just thread your two fingers through the chain and just being like, I'm just this is my natural pose.
6821620	6825620	You have to be like Kelly Bundy in a music video.
6825620	6828620	If you're if you're listening on the podcast and this makes no sense to you, you need to look this up.
6828620	6832620	Sweet Pool, which I assumed was a pool game.
6832620	6836620	I assumed it was like an anime chibi chick like pool game.
6836620	6839620	Rob, this is Japanese releases.
6839620	6843620	Apparently, Yogi's missed a semester of school due to his poor health.
6843620	6848620	But now that he's back, he can't help but notice classmate Tetsuya's piercing gaze.
6848620	6853620	The boy's hard to read expressions and seeming lack of emotions give Yogi the creeps.
6853620	6859620	Yet when Tetsuya suddenly touches his neck, feelings of unbridled lust well up inside of him.
6859620	6862620	What the fuck does Japan get these games and we don't?
6862620	6867620	I think piercing gaze should be like a name of like a visual novel series.
6867620	6874620	I had no idea there was like subtle like I'm going to lend you some of my yaoi anime, OK?
6874620	6879620	Oh, my God. You need to see. I feel like I'm 40 and there's still so much of the world I haven't seen.
6879620	6882620	Ronma is so disappointed in you right now. Apparently.
6882620	6887620	Rob, you need to see where the corncob vibrator came from.
6887620	6890620	That's all corncob vibrator. It's a thing.
6890620	6892620	And it came from an anime.
6892620	6897620	MXC says Sweet Pool is getting released officially in English on PC.
6897620	6902620	Vita version, probably not. Well, I'm assuming this is going to be on GOG.
6902620	6905620	You know what? I think I think.
6905620	6908620	Why don't I live? If I could live stream that, I freaking would.
6908620	6913620	Because this is even better. There's a trailer.
6913620	6917620	It's so mysterious. You play that, Madeline.
6920620	6924620	Tell me what this is about. Don't show me the logo.
6924620	6927620	Fast forward through.
6927620	6931620	I'm adding this amazing list right now. Seventy five bucks. Game of the week.
6931620	6935620	Sweet pool. All right. He was eating an ice cream pop.
6935620	6939620	All right. Well, you know what? If sweet pool is not your thing, I'll play it.
6939620	6945620	Don't worry, because coming in June, love, love, which I always read as muff love.
6945620	6950620	It's coming out here, too. I was going to mention that, but I was going to wait till June.
6950620	6956620	All right. So if this is not your thing, muff love is next month.
6956620	6962620	All right. Moving on. How about the UK dark soccer? You have to take your eyes off that sweet pool for a minute.
6962620	6967620	Well, no, I was actually checking something else out on May twenty ninth.
6967620	6974620	We have Elboy for Switch and PlayStation agony for PlayStation and Xbox.
6974620	6978620	Also on the twenty ninth on the thirty first The Legend of K anniversary edition for Switch.
6978620	6987620	We have tennis world tour on June 1st and yesterday origins also on June 1st for Switch.
6987620	6992620	All right. Now, usually at this point in the show, we would get into the mailbag,
6992620	6996620	but we're having some server problems behind the scenes. So Jamie can't get in there tonight.
6996620	7003620	So we'll work on that and be back in there next week. Although I did peak and there was only one email in there from Robert M.
7003620	7006620	And we love hearing from him because we heard from him last week.
7006620	7011620	But it's one of those timeless questions that can be asked next week. So we'll we'll just roll that over to next week.
7011620	7016620	Sorry, Robert M. But what a tease, right? Gonna make you make wait one more week.
7016620	7022620	But blame these weird server problems we're having. But at the same time, our server space is graciously donated.
7022620	7026620	So you know what? Beggars can't be choosers. So once in a while, we just have to forego the mailbag.
7026620	7034620	You can still put emails in there for next time. And that's participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7034620	7041620	All right. Meanwhile, we've got some more news stories to cover before we get to the Skype line, which will be opened up at Orange Lounge Radio.
7041620	7044620	All one word. Loki, start us off.
7044620	7051620	All right. So, you know, of course, there's the whole hacking of these Switch consoles because there's no way to prevent it.
7052620	7067620	But apparently one person that was, you know, a big part of the homebrew community for the Nintendo Switch, Shiny Quagsire, has been banned from using the Switch online.
7067620	7073620	And basically got an error code saying the use of online services on this console is currently restricted by Nintendo.
7073620	7081620	Please contact customer service. And but it was weird, though, because his Switch is not hacked.
7081620	7088620	And so he got that. And basically, you know, he did, you know, reach out to Nintendo.
7088620	7092620	So thank you for patiently waiting for play on your situation.
7092620	7098620	Unfortunately, given that the information you provided will be unable to cancel your ban on your system.
7098620	7110620	Thank you, Nintendo, for doing that, because, well, I mean, that's a risk you take when you, you know, mess around with those systems.
7110620	7116620	I don't know. That's I mean, was it necessary? Maybe not. But we all know it's a risk you take. I guess.
7116620	7125620	Yeah. So but, you know, the people they really should be coming after, though, are some hackers that are affecting some games like Splatoon two.
7125620	7130620	So apparently there's been some hackers that have gone through and actually are cheating in the game.
7130620	7141620	They've tweaked the weapons to basically throw them out of balance, including massively updating the rate of fire of a weapon that's meant to be slow,
7141620	7148620	powerful blast that resemble hidden non-competitive weapons used in salmon or modes like salmon run and stuff like that.
7148620	7158620	There's videos, I guess, of them, you know, changing parameters as if, for example, eliminating the charge time on sniper rifles so they can fire it like a machine gun,
7158620	7169620	returning completely invisible and invulnerable. No word on whether you get I know that they're banning on some people using the modded firmwares,
7169620	7179620	but it's weird. I don't know. They haven't really been able to track all these down yet, but it's unfortunate to see this kind of stuff affecting things.
7179620	7184620	So hopefully they'll get on top of it. Yeah. And that's the stuff they really need to do something about.
7184620	7193620	You're right. Because, you know, when they ruin games like that online, like that can just like kill a game's online presence when you just know you're going to run into cheaters right away.
7194620	7202620	Well, now that they're in the online space, time to get used to it. It's been shit that Microsoft is fighting for years. So get used to it.
7202620	7205620	All right. Let's go over to Jamie with our next story.
7206620	7225620	Well, we have some Exceed games that are coming out. Actually, a good number to come out on Switch. We have Gal Metal, which looks like it is a rhythm game, rhythm music game.
7225620	7229620	Plus, I think the name is really awesome because it also kind of makes me think of Baby Metal.
7229620	7242620	We have, the game is also going to be coming out in Europe. We also have titles like Gungrave VR, Corpse Party 2, and Touhou Scarlet Curiosity, also confirmed by Exceed.
7242620	7250620	But, I mean, Gal Metal, though, looks really cool. It's a motion-controlled rhythm game, so you use the Joy-Con to lead a female band all the way through.
7250620	7258620	And just looking at the style, it's got that kind of neat cel-shaded style. So I'm really, really excited to play that one. I can't wait for it to come over.
7260620	7266620	I think people like the Exceed stuff and kind of the niche stuff that, you know, they do.
7266620	7269620	Switch seems like the perfect console to bring it on.
7269620	7271620	Yes. Switch is doing very well with a lot of that niche stuff.
7271620	7272620	Mm-hmm.
7272620	7282620	All right. Well, if that's it, then let's party like it's 1984. And you remember the Garbage Pail Kids? That's right, those infamous trading cards from the 1980s that I think stayed in the 80s.
7282620	7285620	These never really came back, did they ever? I think they kind of like stayed there.
7286620	7292620	If you don't know what they were, I guess you could just define them as like Mad Magazine level parodies.
7292620	7298620	Although, if you don't know what Garbage Pail Kids are, you probably don't know what Mad Magazine is either, so maybe I'm just dating myself.
7298620	7301620	But anyway, look it up. Google it.
7301620	7307620	Garbage Pail Kids were a trading card and sticker series, and now they're going to be a mobile game.
7307620	7309620	It is a card-collecting, role-playing game.
7309620	7314620	So if you like magic, Rage Nator, listen up. This might be up your alley. Maybe this will be a game that you'd be into.
7314620	7325620	You can virtual battle with cards from the original 1980s Garbage Pail Kids lineup, as well as more contemporary card series, because I had no idea these fucking things were still going.
7325620	7331620	Yeah, Dungeon Buster in chat says they were the anti-Cabbage Patch Kids. Yeah, so I'm kind of surprised they're still going.
7331620	7337620	But then again, Cabbage Patch Kids I think are still going, so I don't know. It's weird how those things kind of come around.
7337620	7345620	So anyway, the new mobile game is coming from Jago Studios and Topps. It's an RPG card battler. It will be available on iOS and Android.
7345620	7349620	If you want more information, gpkthegame.com.
7349620	7356620	Which makes me ask, what 80s craze do you think deserves to come back in gaming form?
7356620	7358620	Popples.
7358620	7364620	I would say you can't do that on television, is the 80s craze. I would like you to come back in video game form.
7364620	7367620	That'd have to be done like a WarioWare game.
7367620	7374620	Yeah, you have to escape the children's television sausage factory. And if you hit the wrong button, you get slimed.
7374620	7376620	Because you don't know?
7376620	7378620	Yeah, because you don't know. You have to fight barf.
7378620	7380620	That does not compute.
7380620	7383620	And there's escape from locker jokes.
7383620	7391620	Yes, perfect. Yeah, you can't do that on television would be a great one to come back. What do you think, Logie? 80s thing that should come back?
7392620	7394620	Laser tag.
7395620	7402620	Hold on now. That would be like me saying Gremlins. They already had Gremlins games. Although, I wouldn't mind my new Gremlins games.
7402620	7408620	They re-released the Gizmo doll. I had one when that movie came out though. And the McDonald's records.
7408620	7415620	Let's see. In chat, Dungeon Buster says, Gummy bears the RPG. Well, you get the Gummy ship in Kingdom Hearts.
7415620	7416620	So it's like close.
7416620	7417620	It's not the same.
7417620	7419620	You're right. It's not the same. I tried.
7419620	7423620	DDR Mike in chat. Wow, long time no see. DDR Mike. That's a blast from the past.
7423620	7427620	DDR Mike in chat says, Double Dare. Oh wait, it is coming back. That's right.
7427620	7429620	But not Mark Summers.
7429620	7432620	Yeah, he's doing color commentary on it. He's not hosting, but he's doing commentary.
7432620	7434620	Oh, okay. So they found a space for him. That's cool.
7434620	7435620	Yep.
7435620	7441620	Well, that's good because he, you know, he didn't like doing that at all. Because the OCD he had, he didn't like being the sloppy stuff.
7441620	7445620	So that's good that he has an off-hands role this time around.
7445620	7446620	Yeah.
7446620	7449620	That's cool. I miss unwrapped. That's, that's my Mark Summers jam.
7449620	7454620	Uh, let's see. Is that in chat says they made a new Teddy Rex spin and he's terrifying.
7454620	7456620	He is terrifying. Yes.
7456620	7461620	Carmen Sandiego says, is that a Netflix series for Carmen Sandiego? If I remember right, that came up on the show a few weeks ago.
7461620	7463620	That and I thought there was a movie too. Weren't they doing them?
7463620	7468620	I think so. I think so. So, uh, let's see. Oh, is that also suggest legends of the hidden temple?
7468620	7470620	It's getting a little more 90s.
7470620	7472620	That came back as a terrible movie.
7472620	7474620	They did a movie on Nickelodeon like a few years ago.
7474620	7479620	I don't know why, but they're doing a lot of the 90s stuff come back. Like I know Rocco's modern life has a movie coming out.
7479620	7486620	They're doing one for invader Zim. Um, there's something else from Keenan and Cal is still on Saturday night live.
7486620	7493620	Yeah. Still he actually, I think he is now like one of the longest, uh, longer than Daryl Hammond at this point.
7493620	7497620	Yeah. Wow. And what Tim Meadows was on there forever too. Yeah. He's one of the longest.
7497620	7502620	Um, yeah, I'm not surprised. Yeah. Host there. So interesting. All right. Who would have thought?
7502620	7509620	Yeah. Who would have thought? Uh, Keenan from Keenan and Cal. Where's Cal? Where's his Saturday night live moment or was he mad TV?
7509620	7516620	I think he was, he did have a cameo. They did a good burger bit. Oh, did they? Oh God. I don't think, I don't know.
7516620	7521620	All right. And Bobby Blackwell says he is the longest as of this year. So like this is, wow.
7521620	7526620	That's impressive. Daryl Hammond and Tim Meadows both are on that show for everything. Daryl Hammond a little bit longer, but yeah.
7526620	7533620	Wow. Okay. Cool. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on with a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the Skype line. Loki.
7533620	7541620	So this is awesome. Um, apparently coming out of the licensing expo, which I didn't even know was a thing.
7541620	7553620	Licensing expo 2018. Um, Activision Blizzard has announced they have partnered with Lego to produce Lego Overwatch sets with multiple sets and various price points.
7553620	7561620	All of which probably gonna be expensive because Lego is expensive. This is right up my alley though. Um, so we don't know what it's going to be.
7561620	7569620	It could be brickheads. It could be actual sets, but we'll see. I'm, I'm into Overwatch Legos. That's awesome.
7569620	7577620	That's something that Alan would really be into too. I think. Yeah. Cool. So I knew I've seen some like mocks that people have done for like characters that look pretty awesome.
7577620	7585620	I hope we get to build some of the stages like Volskaya industries and you know, all the, it would be cool. Yeah. Route 66. Yeah. You never know. It'd be awesome.
7585620	7593620	Anyway, sadly I have to end on a sad note this week because, um, you know, we did have, uh, some losses in the game industry this week.
7593620	7600620	So, um, I'm sure many of you on social media, um, heard that a total biscuit or John Bain, uh, did lose his battle with cancer this week.
7600620	7608620	Um, and, uh, that was all over Twitter. Um, his wife, Jenna, uh, actually posted on Twitter that a total biscuit, uh, passed on May 24th.
7608620	7619620	And, um, although I can't confess that I've, I'm like super familiar with his stuff. Um, I do know that he was big influential in the YouTube scene, uh, in the indie, you know, stuff.
7619620	7633620	He was big on like a PC gaming, like one of the things he liked to do, like he had a group like talking about the, they were, um, you know, like the FPS stuff, you know, making sure games were actually 60 FPS on like PC versions and stuff like that.
7633620	7641620	And just kind of keeping, you know, like, I love the, um, ethics and games and stuff like that in the gaming industry. He was kind of a proponent of that.
7642620	7655620	Um, but like, I know some people are kind of angry at him because of like his stances on like some gamer gate stuff, but I don't think he really got into the thick of his more of just like ethics, just actually keeping companies honest as far as,
7655620	7667620	yeah. The perception I got from that was that like, he actually was about the actual ethics side. And then when it was apparent that it was more than that, he was like, y'all are crazy. Like that's kind of, kind of, kind of what I got the gist that I got from that. Yeah.
7667620	7678620	But yeah, he has a, you know, I didn't follow him so closely. So, but like, you know, he's got his web series out there. I mean, there's the WTF stuff talking about different games, like, you know, bringing highlighting indie stuff.
7678620	7684620	He tried to do like his own steam curator page and stuff. There is highlight games there. So, I don't know.
7684620	7695620	Well, I think that the hardest part of this story is that he was only 33. I mean, you know, and I know there's like this big meme that's going around the internet right now about like when you're 35, you should.
7695620	7705620	And it's all these, like, it's this play on these articles out there that are like, you should have so much money saved for retirement. And everybody's looking at it going, I don't have a goddamn thing saved for retirement at 35.
7705620	7714620	So, like, there's a bunch of plays on that. But, you know, in, in, like, honestly, my first year, and it didn't even have anything to do with, with this, this unfortunate passing of cancer and so forth.
7714620	7723620	But, like, when I first saw that, I was like, you know, when you turn 35, you should be, like, happy that you got to be 35. Because, like, I know for me, I had that really scary incident when I was 30.
7723620	7730620	And I think we all have known people. Like, you know, I had a good friend of mine that passed away because of swine flu, and she was in her early 20s.
7730620	7731620	Don't ignore health issues.
7731620	7734620	It fucking sucks. So, you know, anyway.
7734620	7737620	Except we don't have universal health care.
7737620	7740620	No, we don't. And that's a whole nother thing.
7740620	7743620	Because they say they're pro-life, but they're really just pro-birth.
7743620	7751620	Anyway. So, as if that wasn't enough, I mean, that was, the gaming industry was, was devastated right there.
7751620	7756620	But then also, I don't know if you guys had heard this too, Ted Dabney passed away this week.
7756620	7761620	You may not know the name, but he co-founded Atari alongside Nolan Bushnell.
7761620	7763620	So, he passed this week as well.
7763620	7768620	Now, he was 81, which, you know, is a little more the age.
7768620	7772620	I still think anything like under 90 is, you know, sad.
7772620	7776620	And even, you know, sometimes when it's over 90, people are living longer in this day and age.
7776620	7782620	But regardless, at least you kind of go, okay, well 81 is kind of where the average life expectancy is right now.
7782620	7788620	So, but anyway, it is still tragic because he did pass, and he was one of the co-founders of Atari.
7789620	7795620	And who knows where gaming would be today without Atari and, you know, Pong and everything the 2600 brought us and all that.
7795620	7800620	So, news of his death was announced on Facebook by a video game historian.
7800620	7807620	Because I don't think this guy has been very much in the public eye since, you know, obviously Atari has really kind of gone behind the scenes.
7807620	7815620	But without Dabney, you know, he was crucial in creating Computer Space, which was basically the coin-operated version of Space War,
7815620	7818620	which then kind of made way for, you know, Atari to really come through.
7818620	7821620	So, anyhow, he passed away as well.
7821620	7826620	So, it has been a shitty week in the gaming world, that's for sure.
7826620	7833620	Anyhow, let's try to make things a little bit happier here and talk about whatever you would like to on our phones.
7833620	7837620	If you'd like to give us a call, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7837620	7840620	If you'd like to give us a call and talk about whatever might be on your mind this week.
7840620	7841620	Maybe there's something you're playing.
7841620	7845620	Maybe there's a news article we missed that you'd like to talk about, or who knows what.
7845620	7850620	Let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last-minute stories while we wait for the phones to light up here.
7850620	7854620	No, not really. It's been a pretty slow week.
7854620	7857620	Yeah, it's been a lighter week, I think, with Memorial Day on the horizon.
7857620	7859620	But we do have a call coming in. Let's get to it.
7859620	7860620	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7860620	7862620	Hey, this is Reginator.
7862620	7863620	Hey, what's on your mind, Reginator?
7863620	7866620	Not a whole lot.
7866620	7883620	Well, since you were talking about 80s revival a few minutes ago before you opened up the phone lines, I think I'll make the bulk of my call about that.
7883620	7900620	It's pretty much a given that most of us know that a lot of the video game spin-off media out there over the years hasn't been all that great.
7900620	7908620	Case in point, the infamous Super Mario Brothers movie that came out in the 90s is a prime example of that.
7909620	7933620	But still, even with that being said, are there any movies or TV shows based on gaming that you may have seen growing up that weren't like Casablanca level grade or Dr. Zhivago grade, but you still loved it anyway?
7933620	7939620	Absolutely. In fact, it's almost kind of timely because I would say the Super Mario Brothers Super Show with the Zelda cartoons on Fridays.
7939620	7947620	Like, you know, it wasn't going to win an Emmy, but it was a good time and it was stuff I remember as a kid.
7947620	7950620	And I really loved the Zelda cartoons especially. The Mario cartoons were decent too.
7950620	7955620	But the reason why I say it's timely is that I believe those just hit Netflix this week.
7955620	7960620	So if you wanted to catch up and you happen to be a Netflix person, you can catch up on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.
7960620	7962620	I know those are on there for a while. They've been on there for a while.
7962620	7964620	They've been on, I think, some of the other services. I don't think they were on Netflix.
7964620	7965620	No, they were.
7965620	7966620	Were they?
7966620	7967620	Because we've watched them.
7967620	7974620	Thank you for bringing up that show. Internet high five. In fact, I grew up watching that myself.
7975620	7987620	There's a, not to show anyone else's channels on Twitch, but there is a channel on Twitch called ConTV.
7987620	7997620	Every so often they do show that show on there as well. So that's something to watch if you don't have Netflix or whatever.
7997620	8003620	You know, otherwise I would say I was, but see, I was always a big fan and really still am of game shows.
8003620	8009620	You know, like the other thing that honestly comes to my mind is things like not just Nick Arcade, which is a little more nineties, but also, um, Starrcade.
8009620	8015620	Which is funny because, you know, you can think of Starrcade as that place that used to be a Disneyland that Jamie was referencing at the top of the show.
8015620	8017620	Or you can think of it as that.
8017620	8018620	That was Astrocade, Rob.
8018620	8020620	Oh, I thought you called it Starrcade. I thought it was Starrcade.
8020620	8021620	Astrocade.
8021620	8028620	Oh, okay. I thought it was. All right. Well, whatever. Well, anyway, Starrcade was an old game show from 81, 82.
8028620	8030620	It's supposed to be coming back.
8030620	8036620	They always say it's going to be coming back and then they never do. They still have a name to host, which I'm waiting for that call.
8036620	8037620	Wait for the call, y'all.
8037620	8042620	Uh, but, uh, they did, they did a Twitch marathon of that not that long ago.
8042620	8049620	They did every single episode of Starrcade I remember was to build hype for a Blu-ray set, I think, or something that they were going to be coming out with.
8049620	8054620	So, I mean, that was kind of gaming because like, what else do we have from that era?
8054620	8057620	Captain N, which admittedly I didn't watch a ton of that.
8057620	8059620	I'm aware it was the thing that exists and I knew of it.
8059620	8063620	But I don't think they showed it at a good time here on the local networks, if at all.
8063620	8070620	Yeah. Admittedly, I watched Captain N. I knew it wasn't great.
8070620	8076620	In fact, no, no, no, no, Mega Man and, uh, Pit.
8076620	8081620	Well, they called him, uh, uh, Kid Icarus on the show for whatever reason.
8081620	8086620	But that aside, I thought those two characters were a little bit of an annoying sight.
8086620	8097620	But you got to remember, they came out in the late 80s and there was, uh, there was, uh, you know, the prime of, uh, Nintendo's, you know, hype.
8097620	8100620	You know, they're kind of, they're kind of golden age, if you will.
8100620	8104620	So, you know, everyone had Nintendo fever.
8104620	8113620	So, you know, and there was a whole lot in terms of, uh, gaming, uh, gaming related shows on TV at the time.
8113620	8121620	So I kind of, you know, you know, granted bear that, you know, you know, even with the annoyances.
8121620	8129620	And still, even with that being said, you know, ignoring the annoyances, it was still somewhat decent, you know.
8129620	8135620	Yeah, somebody in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, vidpower says GameProTV was my jam.
8135620	8142620	You know, um, that guy, uh, JD Roth that hosted that, he went on to do, um, he was the co-creator.
8142620	8146620	I mean, he does a lot of trash TV now, like it's just like straight up trash TV.
8146620	8149620	He was the co-creator of The Biggest Loser on NBC, which is trash.
8149620	8156620	Uh, he hosted that unanimous reality show on Fox that I remember was like kind of a Big Brother knockoff.
8156620	8160620	It was super trash. Uh, and then, God, what else did he do?
8160620	8165620	It says right now he is currently the announcer of the ABC TV show Extreme Weight Loss.
8165620	8170620	Never seen it, but it's probably trash. So, just kind of interesting.
8170620	8177620	Yeah, you know, as long as I thought of it, granted, I'm not entirely sure if it would be considered retro or not.
8177620	8183620	But, you know, the Final Fantasy movies, especially the first one, The Spirits Within,
8183620	8187620	I know a lot of people like to hate on it and say, you know, in fact,
8187620	8190620	Ew, that's not a real Final Fantasy movie!
8190620	8192620	Hey, watch it, because that's exactly what I...
8192620	8196620	I don't hate on it, but my problem is, like, it just wasn't Final Fantasy at all.
8196620	8198620	They should have just called it The Spirit Within.
8198620	8201620	Yeah, well, the way I look at it is this.
8201620	8207620	You know, if you look at each of the, you know, all the actual Final Fantasy games,
8207620	8210620	for the most part, they're very, very different from each other.
8210620	8217620	Like, eight's very different from seven, nine's very different from eight, so on and so forth.
8217620	8221620	And, granted, there's certain common elements in the game.
8221620	8229620	It's like, you're gonna see chocobos, you're gonna see a character named Sid, so on and so forth.
8229620	8237620	And, you know, some of those elements are kind of cleverly hidden in the movie.
8237620	8243620	Like, the only way you'll see a chocobo is in the main character's pajamas.
8243620	8245620	Well, in my opinion, that's why it flopped.
8245620	8250620	It's because those things were so, like, subtle that, you know, like, they shouldn't have had to hide it.
8250620	8252620	You know what I mean?
8252620	8258620	That was my issue with it, but this is a debate that's, like, 15 years old at this point, so I'm only gonna slide.
8258620	8269620	Yeah, but, ultimately, my point is, you know, I took all my arguments into consideration,
8269620	8276620	and even with that being said, I still found the movie really, really great, despite the fact that a lot of people hate it.
8276620	8281620	Yeah, maybe it's one of those things I need to watch again, but, you know, I was expecting something Final Fantasy and it just kind of wasn't.
8281620	8287620	And I remember that, at that time, they were working on eight and the movie around the same time,
8287620	8295620	and I remember saying this before, and I'll say it again, it would have been maybe different if the movie had been Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy VIII had been the movie.
8295620	8304620	Because I think Final Fantasy VIII has a great story that is very Final Fantasy, but Final Fantasy VIII is probably the worst Final Fantasy game, in my opinion.
8304620	8313620	That's my opinion only. Final Fantasy VIII is, like, the worst of all Final Fantasy games because of its battle system and the junction draw thing and all that, like, ruins it,
8313620	8317620	and the scaling of the monsters and all that stuff, like, it's not a fun game, in my opinion.
8317620	8322620	Whereas the story's great. I would have liked Final Fantasy VIII to have just been a movie.
8322620	8330620	Yeah, well, you know, I look at it this way, you know, they tried something new with the junction system.
8330620	8335620	They'll pan out, well, no, but at least they had the balls to try something new.
8335620	8349620	I mean, you know, there's so many games out there, you know, your game publishers and developers out there that, you know, kind of churning out sequels after sequels without trying anything new,
8349620	8357620	and we complained that it's same old, same old cookie-colored games, you know, and we complained that it gets boring after a while.
8357620	8365620	You know, to Square's credit, they tried something new with VIII, and unfortunately, just one time it flapped, so...
8365620	8370620	But some people would, like, fight me on the street for saying that, so, you know, everybody's got their opinion.
8370620	8374620	Anyway, Rage Leader, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze in a couple more calls, but thanks for the call.
8374620	8376620	Sure, have a nice night.
8376620	8377620	Later, you too.
8377620	8378620	Here's a story.
8378620	8381620	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to call in. Yeah, you got a last minute story?
8381620	8383620	Yeah, I'm just trying to check the date on this article.
8384620	8392620	Yeah, this is recent, so apparently Samsung has to pay Apple $539 million for copying iPhone features.
8392620	8394620	Didn't Apple have to pay them?
8394620	8396620	No, this was from the appeal court.
8396620	8399620	No, no, no, not this week, but like a previous thing months ago.
8399620	8401620	Yeah, and it's looking like it's getting turned around.
8401620	8404620	So all these companies just sue the shit out of each other.
8404620	8408620	Yeah, but I just think it's absolutely hilarious.
8408620	8412620	Anyway, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8412620	8414620	Hey, this is Act Deaf.
8414620	8416620	Hey, Act Deaf, what's on your mind, buddy?
8416620	8419620	Well, I have a story I want to talk about.
8419620	8428620	Not something that you covered today, but something that happened or is happening right now in Mexico with video games.
8428620	8430620	Oh, please, what's going on?
8430620	8437620	Well, right now, there's somewhat contest. It's an initiative, more likely.
8437620	8443620	It's called Video Juegos Mx Mexico.
8443620	8445620	Sorry.
8445620	8455620	And it's a competition made by the ESA, the Entertainment Software Association, and also the government of Mexico.
8455620	8461620	Many private and public initiatives are industry leaders.
8461620	8473620	And it's a good initiative. It promotes the creation of video games and a bigger industry here in Mexico that's still growing.
8473620	8478620	But there's one thing about it, and that's the thing I don't like about it.
8478620	8492620	The prices, they're given out. There are three categories. There's a category for people under 17 years.
8492620	8499620	And the prices there are a video game console, so that's kind of okay.
8499620	8502620	For doing what? This is for making games?
8502620	8511620	For example, for the category for under 17, you have to develop an idea. Not necessarily the video game, but an idea.
8511620	8514620	Oh, okay. So like a treatment or something. Okay, alright.
8514620	8520620	But there's also a category for university or college students.
8520620	8531620	And now there's the development involved. They have to make a game. They have to make either a mobile game or a console or PC game.
8531620	8560620	The prices there are 25,000 pesos. Which right now, with the equivalency and all that, the conversions, it's around $1,200.
8560620	8574620	$1,200, yeah. So it's not enough. That's really not even to pay the scholarship for any person that goes to a private school.
8574620	8581620	They're the only places here in Mexico that offer a career in development for video games.
8581620	8592620	So the prices are not all that, it sounds like. What is their point with this? Are they just trying to get more folks in Mexico excited about game development?
8592620	8601620	Are they trying to figure out maybe the next big game idea is in Mexico? Trying to get more game design out of that? Is that what they're going for with this?
8601620	8615620	Yeah, they're trying to impose the industry. And basically, this is the third year they have done this. They have done it in 2015 and 2016. They skipped 2017 for some reason.
8615620	8626620	And they're doing this again. But that's not the only categories. There's a professional category for people already in the industry making games.
8627620	8638620	And the top prize, the best game in the contest is 100,000 pesos.
8638620	8641620	So that's going to be like $4,000 basically?
8641620	8647620	Around $4,000, $5,000 I think.
8648620	8649620	Yeah, $5,000.
8649620	8657620	But it would depend on how much time you spent on it. If you spent months and months creating this, all things considered, that's actually not that much money.
8657620	8675620	Yeah, again, and that's my problem with this. Because the prices are not exactly something that, at least for me, I wouldn't like to get this. No, I would like to actually get something else or something better.
8675620	8686620	It's a bummer that the organizations can't like, as a prize, we're going to get you connected with an international publisher for your game. That would be something really cool.
8687620	8703620	Yeah, the other prizes in the contest, at least for best video game, are also a trip to E3 in 2019 and an Autodesk license, which I don't really know about Autodesk. I don't know how it works.
8703620	8709620	But it's something, but it's not really that great, at least in my opinion.
8709620	8719620	Yeah, maybe in some ways, it's kind of about getting your name out there and getting noticed. I mean, for what it's worth, I'm sure whoever wins this competition, there will be news articles that will cover the game and so forth.
8719620	8735620	And if the game is available for download or for purchase somewhere at that point, maybe that would be good for it. But I get what you're saying. The prizes are not necessarily, I mean, only one person gets to win too. What about all the other people that spend their time on this?
8735620	8745620	So I don't know. Maybe this would be something that folks who already have games that they're working on, maybe something they can try to get in on to leverage their games a little more.
8745620	8755620	But I like that they're trying to do something to get people motivated in other countries, but I totally get what you're saying, ActDeaf. I'm not sure this is enough.
8756620	8766620	No, and you're right. It's a good initiative. It's not something like really, really bad. Because if people can take advantage of this, it's good.
8766620	8780620	And BobbingtonChat, for what it's worth, says 1,000 is actually a prize amount for game jams here in the US for first place. So it's in line with other things. So, you know, maybe at the end of the day, it's more about the exposure than it is about the actual cash prize.
8780620	8787620	Although let me ask you this. Do you know the game, or have heard of the game Militant?
8787620	8789620	No.
8789620	8799620	It's a game that is already available on Steam and PlayStation 4, and it won the first year of this initiative, of this contest.
8799620	8800620	Interesting.
8800620	8804620	So yeah, not exposure, I don't think so.
8804620	8813620	All right. Fair enough. All right, ActDeaf. Well, thanks for the call and, you know, the update on what's going on in places that aren't necessarily the ones where we live.
8813620	8814620	Thanks for having me.
8814620	8816620	Hey, no problem. Take care, buddy.
8816620	8817620	You too.
8817620	8824620	All right, bye bye. All right, Kaijuto kind of another thought there saying, may not look like a lot, but it's a great start. Sometimes you have to crawl before you fly.
8824620	8829620	Well, I mean, yes and no. I also get the perspective of, yeah, but I still have to support my family.
8829620	8838620	So, but you know, as far as that whole, like if I, if it's a hobby, if it's something I do in my spare time, you know, maybe this is a way to kind of elevate that hobby into a career.
8838620	8844620	I don't know. Anyway, with that, we are going to wrap up for the night and that's going to do it for calls.
8844620	8850620	But if you didn't get through, you can always still send us an email. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us an email.
8850620	8857620	We do read the tweets and all that as well. Twitter.com slash O L R. But I think for now we are going to wrap up and I always like to towards.
8857620	8859620	Wait, any other last minute stories? I don't want to.
8859620	8862620	I mean, we can talk about Battlefield five was announced this week.
8862620	8864620	Oh my God. We really didn't cover that anywhere else, did we?
8864620	8867620	I mean, it's fine. I mean, it's going to be World War Two this year.
8867620	8868620	Okay.
8868620	8872620	And then they're going to, um, one thing that they promised that there's not going to be a premium pass this time.
8872620	8882620	So you don't have any like DLC or anything like that. And there's not going to be any, um, loot boxes that are going to have, um, game affecting items in it.
8882620	8887620	So if there's anything that's going to be in the game, it's going to be cosmetic stuff, I guess.
8887620	8896620	Um, but, and they're not, I don't think they're doing battle rail. It didn't sound like they're doing battle rail and there's a single player campaign to take that call of duty.
8896620	8903620	So definitely a battlefield and call of duty are like different games this year. It's not just like the same fucking thing.
8903620	8908620	So interesting too, that it's EA that's doing the game where they kind of backed off of loot boxes.
8908620	8917620	Well, I trust EA as far as I can throw them in. I'm sorry. Like I still, there's going to be shady shit somewhere.
8917620	8923620	Fair enough. All right. Well, as I always say at the end of Orange Launch Radio, uh, thank you very much for supporting the show.
8923620	8927620	If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, or even if you hated it, maybe you know somebody that would like it.
8927620	8932620	So help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.
8932620	8936620	So make sure you tell a friend or whoever might be interested in this show.
8936620	8942620	Uh, also a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play, uh, goes a very long way.
8942620	8948620	And I always say that, and there's not a lot of new reviews that are popping up. So if you do have 15 seconds to write a review, I'd really appreciate it.
8948620	8950620	Do I need to pay for an advertisement?
8950620	8957620	Sure. If you're offered for free for me advertising, I didn't say it was free. I said free for me.
8957620	8965620	So actually I'm considering making little banners. So if anyone has a forum or something and wants to promote the show, yeah.
8965620	8972620	Um, hit me up. I'll probably have something done by the end of the week. Sweet. All right. Uh, and I think, I think that's, that's it for that.
8972620	8976620	So let's get around to final thoughts for the night. Uh, Loki, your final thought.
8976620	8983620	Um, my final thoughts, hopefully I'm going to get to play all this VR stuff that I downloaded on my PlayStation four because now it's all tricked out with VR stuff.
8983620	8986620	So we just need to play those things.
8986620	8994620	Uh, my final thought is I'm going to be back on Twitch tonight. I've been taking a month break because of the other game I was playing and, uh, just, you know, live stuff.
8994620	9001620	So I'll be excited to be back. So twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts. I appreciate all those for follow follows, subscribes, biddies, all that good stuff.
9002620	9010620	We're going to play Hyrule warriors tonight. My poll closed and Hyrule warriors one. So we'll be there soon. Last but not least, dark soccer, neurotypical people don't make sense.
9010620	9017620	And then I'm going to go harass your cat. Yeah. Mr. He's singing the song of his people. He's being a big, I've been fed, but I'm lying.
9017620	9022620	He's being a big baby. All right. That's it. Uh, we're out of here for the night. We will be back to do it in seven days.
9022620	9028620	So have a great week. And for those of you that have the day off tomorrow, have a good time staying up all night tonight. Bye everyone.
