00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
On the heels of the phase-out of the PSP, one Sony chief speaks about rethinking mobile. Given the portability of the Nintendo Switch as well, we may be at a significant pivot point for mobile gaming. This is just one subject on a full night of gaming news. Join us for the rest, starting right now in the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 732 of our show for this May 27th, 2018. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined once again, I missed her, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers in the house.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What'd you throw?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Everything I possibly could.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you threw a party, I was already at a party.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Old microphones, that's what I threw. I threw old microphones in the dumpster.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You know what was funny?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
With our new mics, I actually considered going out and ordering myself a Pro-Sure.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey, if you want, remember when Jason used to come to the show a lot? Our voiceover guy Jason, if you don't know who does the intro here, he would come to the show, he brought his own mic.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And he sounds great on it. His very bassy tones that make him such a good announcer sound great. By the way, he might be here next week.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, that'd be fun.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I should find where my Behringer mic went to.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But it was a good mic.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Anyway, it is a video game show, but I have to allow DarkSakura at least 30 seconds to talk about DragCon.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh my god, it was great.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You've been gone because you were at DragCon, so quickly, how is DragCon? If there's anything remotely video game related, you should probably bring that up too.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There is something, because my phone died right after DragCon and I lost some of my photos.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh no.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was very sad, including my ones with Maha Miller. I have my photos with BibleGirl666, who I've been following on Twitter. She's never been on Drag Race.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I love Drag.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I got to meet Karen from Finance, because my friend JJ has friends with her.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh nice.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I met Karen from Finance, who was a sweetheart.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She's Australian, right?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah. Latrice Royale, and JJ gave her edibles and she was wonderfully happy.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But get Victoria to finish the Where Are You Going With Your Money story.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Because she was at the season 4 thing and asked her, well Latrice said what happened after that. And it's not my story to tell.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Alright, that would be a reference.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You know the story though, right?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I remember when Victoria yelled at her from the stage.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And Latrice says somewhere sensual.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's right.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Something sensual happened.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So Shaking and Crying is the show I do with Victoria.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We've been on a little bit of hiatus, because I was on this special project that was taking way more of my time than it should have been.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then also, I had my allergy stuff. My voice was like gone.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It was really scary. So we've been off, but we should be back with Shaking and Crying this week.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I will get her to give me the whole story.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well, her sponge dress got us in to see Monet X Change.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Love it.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm still bitter, but I still love. I'm not mad at Cameron, but I'm bitter. I'll leave it that way.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I literally, you know how like, maybe this is going to be my DragCon Kojima event, but I ran into Ms. Cracker.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We both turned around at the same time and nearly ran face first into each other.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And I was like, hi. She's like, I'm sorry, I got to go. And ran off.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You know, because they have to bustle in between here and there.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sure.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So Friday, when we were back, I went to see Ms. Cracker.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I was like, you remember a girl in red glasses wearing a red, you know, who was rocking her inner Shirley Manson?

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That was you! That was me.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I also met Dita Ritz that night, who was also really nice.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You looked great, by the way.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Thank you. Thank you.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, I just, I got to hang out with Mayhem for a little bit.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Any game stuff in here?

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A little bit. A little bit. I'll get to it.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because I met Yuho Hamasaki.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I was like, the moment I found out about you, I was like, oh my god, is it Ayumi?

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And she's like, yeah, totally Ayumi fan.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I was like, so then are you a big fan of the Ayuro CD?

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She's like, yes, I am.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I was like, so then if we're going to go any further than that, then are you a Eurobeat fan in general?

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
She's like, yeah, I really like Eurobeat, you know, talking about the Initial D soundtrack.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was like, okay, cool.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So Yuho was really nice.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, so we got one drag queen that's an Initial D fan. Good.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The white horse was there, by the way.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
From the disco thing from All Stars.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A triumph car was there, that was really cool.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But there was a cosplay.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay, oh!

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So we had, what's the character with the chainsaw from Undertale?

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, I...

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That same cosplayer was at GamerX, by the way.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know exactly what you're talking about, but I don't remember the name of the character.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's not Comic or Sans, I know that.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We also had just a bunch of different...

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think you're thinking...

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Toriel?

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, Toriel.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, I didn't get to that part.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, not Toriel.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Toriel's the goat one.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The little goat.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This was the robot one with the chainsaw that has the heart on their face.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But anyway, you know,

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and, you know,

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Victoria walked in that, too.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There were just a few other really funny ones.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Mettaton.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Mettaton. That was it. Mettaton.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So, but it was...

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There was some cosplay.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh! There was Digimon cosplay.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This one queen.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I got this one picture.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did Mimi from Digimon.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And also, her name is

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Anyonka, because she misspelled it

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
when she first made the name back in the day and kept it.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But she does other video game and anime cosplay and drag.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And then there was an Anji woman there the next day,

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and that's one of the photos I lost.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I was so sad.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But yeah, there was also

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
just other cosplayers, like someone was there as

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Rudy Road from The Fifth Element.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Trixie was in Booty Shorts.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, Ruby Rod.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ruby Rod, sorry.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Trixie was in Booty Shorts buying for Morphe.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Alright, I gotta read some of these comments from chat.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Wait, one last one?

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright, one last one.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Freakin' Shangela comes in on a litter

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and sits on her throne

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
like the motherfuckin' Khaleesi she is.

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We do tape live, of course,

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
at The Voice of Geeks Network,

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
vognetwork.com, and you guys can chat along with us

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
where Nifty Swirl says,

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Maybe someday they'll reboot it.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, we didn't really get into all that.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Not according to what's been coming from Matt.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, here's the thing, obviously,

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
like, things are different now.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's just put it that way. Things are different now

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and I'm just gonna leave it at that.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But here's the thing, I think a lot of the concepts

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that were brought up with that,

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you know, expo and everything,

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
is bigger than any one person.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, so, you know,

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
because it says maybe they'll reboot it.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, you know, I mean, I don't think you meant it this way,

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
but I mean, you don't have to wait on any one person

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
or one group to do this.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Like, you can take these ideas

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and the idea that everybody should have a place

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to play video games and that it's not about

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
excluding straight white men.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's about making sure you're including everybody else

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
by welcoming folks to the table.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You know, here at OLR, we've talked about how OLR,

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the way we envision the show is that we're all sitting

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
at the big diner table after playing DDR

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and we're trying to welcome all people to our table, right?

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I still think that we should do diversity panels at conventions.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, so that's my thing, is that, you know,

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
if there is not going to be another GamerX,

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and maybe there will, I don't know.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I mean, obviously, things are different,

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
so it's gonna be interesting how that might work.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But why not inject a little bit of that into every convention?

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that would be something I would hope to see moving forward.

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And, you know, maybe it has already worked out a little bit.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Like PAX has done a very good job with, you know,

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
as critical as I am of that show sometimes on a bigger scale,

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the fact that they do the diversity lounge

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and that they do try to have that awareness there

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and that they do have some of those panels, you know, that's cool.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's, you know, a big step forward.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So that's, I guess those are my thoughts on that

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
because, of course, I was really sad just to see everything

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
that, you know, went down with GamerX,

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
but it's one of those things where I get it, you know?

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There's a lot more involved than what's on the surface.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sure, I'm sure.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And, you know, so, okay, you know, things are different now,

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so how can we proceed as a community?

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because those ideas were bigger than any one person or three people.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can start changes right in your own local convention.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's right. That's absolutely fucking right.

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
By the way, Bobby asked if I used the right hashtag

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
because he, DragCon, put out a thing that said don't use DragonCon.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, they actually had a Jinx monsoon in that video.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It looked like she was so fucking high when she did that video.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But, yeah, they had the whole don't use DragCon

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
because of autocorrect or whatever it was, use DragCon.

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Although they did acknowledge DragonCon is a real thing in Atlanta.

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, but I used my right hashtag, so everything was great.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And we did it in Disneyland the next day,

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and I had a sad moment, speaking of games.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The sign for the starkade is still up.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, we came out, they're doing Hyperspace Mountain right now,

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
which is pretty fun, I mean.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But, yeah, I stopped and looked up outside Star Trader,

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you know, where the starkade was,

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and I was telling JJ, who was also Miss Patsy Declined,

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
where the starkade was and what it used to be like,

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and then I looked up and I was like, oh, holy shit, there's the sign.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This was the starkade, and the whole thing's closed off now.

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So, you know, I pointed out like a few where things used to be,

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but there was the crappiest thing happened.

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We were going to do Big Thunder for our last ride,

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
when we got out from Blue Bayou.

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And so we had time, so we were going to do Hunter Mansion.

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hunter Mansion broke while we were in line.

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So then we went over to do our Fast Passes at Big Thunder.

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It broke down.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So we didn't get to go on Big Thunder at all.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then we went over to do Indy, and it broke down.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So our last...

212
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It cost 105 bucks to get a park offer for Disney.

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Excuse me. But we did Jungle Cruise for our last one.

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
With a tour guide who did not give a fuck.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In a good way or in a bad way?

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In a good way.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, good.

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
She started doing some of the jokes that they're not allowed to do.

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, good.

221
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Like, I'm going to tell you my favorite one of them.

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay. And then we have to introduce,

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
there is a third person on this show we have to introduce.

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
When you go by the snake, like right before you get to Trader Sam,

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
she's like, what kind of snake is this?

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She's like, I'll give you a clue. It starts with a P.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We're like, Python, no plastic.

228
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Because you're not supposed to break the 1800s joke book.

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Because I would have yelled penis.

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, girl.

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Alright, but I have issues.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
She was like, do you want the thing? Because you can do it too.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was like, will you let me?

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Look, we're ten minutes into the show, and we need to introduce,

235
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but of course we've missed you for the past couple weeks.

236
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And I did play a shitload of pinball on Friday, but I'll tell you about that later.

237
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Alright, we'll get into our gaming weeks.

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But first, we've got to get over to Tech Master Loki. Hi.

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hello.

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How are you?

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm here.

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You are here.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes, and you also have a new mic. It's new mic Monday, except it's Sunday.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, new mic Sunday.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Here at Studio OLR.

247
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
New mic on Sunday.

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How was your week? Did you do anything exciting?

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Have you been doing anything with your long weekend?

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Just having to deal with the kids.

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's been just annoying as fuck today.

252
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I heard about the breakfast incident.

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, it's been the whole day. It's just been whining.

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like, yesterday was whining about stuff, and then today has been whining about stuff.

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And God, I just don't want to deal with it anymore.

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, you're only locked in for about another, what, 13 years before they go off to college?

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can do it.

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, I hope they won't be whining like this then.

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Teenagers are worse, Loki. What are you talking about?

260
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Teenage boys.

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you sure?

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you sure?

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Teenage boys have to be taught what consent is.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Have to be taught, you know, things.

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Teenage boys are just as much of a problem as teenage girls, and I was a teenage girl once.

267
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't think those topics are going to be an issue for Loki's kids, but, you know, they've got to stop whining.

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Alright, anyway.

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We do, of course, again tape live on Sunday nights, and you can join us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's kind of quiet in there right now.

271
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't think a lot of comments on DragCon, except Sia Tabiri does say,

272
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Jinx would have been one of the queens who would have been more aware of what DragCon was than she seemed.

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Tatiana's a gamer.

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, there's a couple of the Drag Race alumni that'll, like, Dax exclamation points there every year,

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and some of the other, like, local, you know, people in Atlanta will be there, so.

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And I'll be there, so you should make plans to be in Atlanta Labor Day weekend.

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
By the way, I wanted to get a little pancake doll.

278
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, love it.

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And they were a hundred bucks.

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's too expensive.

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So, and I wasn't also going to wait in line for Alaska.

282
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But, next year, when I go to DragCon, I'm cosplaying a little pancake.

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You should.

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It is happening.

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Do it.

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Anyway, in two weeks, speaking of Atlanta, I do want to give a shout out to this,

288
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
because VOG Network is going to be sponsoring the weekend of June 8th and 9th,

289
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the Siege, or, no, sorry, not Siege.

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If I can even remember the name of it.

291
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Sorry, I got it confused with something else.

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Atlanta.

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No, it's something else, sorry.

294
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

295
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Different, different acronym.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Southern Fried Game Room Expo is the thing.

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's a five-hour flight for me.

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's why I'm not always the best at committing all these acronyms to memory.

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But the Southern Fried Game Room Expo is happening in Atlanta.

300
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And, you know, it's a lot like how we have California Extreme up here,

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
or that pinball thing that Jamie's going to talk about,

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
where they have, like, classic game stuff, and then, of course, they do panels.

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Our very own Bobby Blackwolf here at the network is going to be moderating a panel

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
with Billy Mitchell and Walter Day,

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and this is after many interesting things have happened with those two individuals,

306
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
so that panel is going to be a lot of fun.

307
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So check that out.

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So that is happening in the Atlanta area in just a couple of weekends.

309
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, thank you, Bobby. I got it.

310
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Are they doing a panel on MAME?

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I corrected myself.

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Are they doing a panel on MAME?

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, they don't know what it is, right?

314
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That is for Bobby to determine when he's going to be the one asking those questions.

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So check that out.

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What main version are you rocking in that cabinet over there?

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Anyway, would you say your favorite musical on Broadway is anti-MAME?

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Anyway, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This isn't, like, totally about video games,

320
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
but it's something that a lot of people are talking about in the gaming community.

321
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It came up on our Discord, which you can join our Discord community

322
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

323
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's all you need for the invite.

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And on the Discord, they were talking about this.

325
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It has to do with a nerdy show that I know a lot of people love, Doctor Who.

326
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And how it's a little bit adjacent to gaming

327
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
is the fact that they're going to be bringing it to Twitch.

328
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Now, Twitch is mostly known as a gaming live streaming platform

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
where you can play video games and people watch

330
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and, you know, build your audience and interact with them and all that good stuff.

331
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But, you know, more and more, Twitch has been getting into other stuff, too, right?

332
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Like, you know, we know that they do competitive esports like Overwatch League.

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's like you're watching something on ESPN or something,

334
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
but it's on Twitch and it's about a video game.

335
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Or even the more IRL stuff like talk shows like this one.

336
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Competitive eating sorts of things.

337
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Competitive eating while doing a talk show.

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, right, competitive eating while doing your talk show and all that.

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And, of course, Twitch and marathons, not completely unheard of

340
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because we had a Bob Ross marathon that was pretty legendary over there, right?

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know if you guys watched the Bob Ross marathon as much as I did,

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
but it's one of those rare instances where, like, chat was a good thing.

343
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Like, usually with a marathon like this, I'd be like,

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
don't fucking read the comments, don't read chat.

345
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's going to be a cesspool.

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But, like, the Bob Ross one was, like, really fucking good.

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because you know how Bob Ross is so quiet and timid when he paints

348
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and, you know, makes these happy little trees?

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I can't believe he was ever a drill sergeant.

350
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I know, right?

351
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, my God.

352
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But anyway, so he used to say, like,

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
oh, we're just going to dip this paintbrush in the water

354
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
then we're going to beat the devil out of that brush.

355
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We're going to beat the devil out of that brush.

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And then the whole chat would light up going, R.I.P. devil.

357
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Devil hacks.

358
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You know, like, all this stuff.

359
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Like, really funny shit.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So I'm very excited to see what happens when Doctor Who shows up on Twitch.

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Now, here's the thing.

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I think when most of you think of Doctor Who in these days,

363
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you're thinking of, like, David Tennant and, you know,

364
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
who are the other people that have played?

365
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Peter Capaldi and Christopher Eccleston, Matt Smith.

366
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Matt Smith.

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
OK, yeah.

368
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's one of those things, like, my train isn't derailed.

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
My train is just moving slowly tonight.

370
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Like, I'm thinking of things, like, five seconds after they leave my mouth.

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Anyway, so most people think of the newer Doctor Who stuff,

372
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but actually that is not a part of this marathon, OK?

373
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So that was the reboot that started in 2005 that's actually still going.

374
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But anyhow, so that's not a part of it.

375
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But Doctor Who actually started, what, 1963?

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, something like that.

377
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a very much older show.

378
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
With Mr. Hartnell.

379
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So the episodes that air between 1963 and 1989 are going to be on Twitch

380
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
starting on May 29th.

381
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What they're going to do, they're going to do an eight-hour block

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
three times a day.

383
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So if you miss something, you can catch it again.

384
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You have, like, a chance to catch it again before they're rotated out.

385
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I wonder if they're going to do any of the recovered footage

386
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
from the BBC purge during the second Doctor?

387
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, I heard about that. The ones that were lost.

388
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They found audio and then did animated versions to that audio.

389
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And then there were others that they tried to restore

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
that were people filming their televisions.

391
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
A few roles were recovered, but yeah, the BBC did a big purge

392
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
of, like, a lot of their old television episodes

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and some of it was Second Doctor.

394
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They have not said. They have not said if these episodes are a part of it or not.

395
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I just care about Fourth Doctor stuff, really.

396
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think that's where a lot of people are.

397
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They just want to see the Tom Baker stuff.

398
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And Sylvester McCoy, because I really freaking like Ace.

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
She's like one of my favorite companions.

400
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, 500 episodes from the show's classic period will be streamed.

401
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Eight hours of Who per day starting at 11 a.m. Pacific is when the block starts.

402
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And then that's going to be three times that it's going to be repeated.

403
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Also, prizes will be given out.

404
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
If you watch ten minutes of Doctor Who in a day,

405
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
you are entered into a drawing to win a Doctor Who fan pack

406
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that includes a TARDIS money box, a themed Monopoly set,

407
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and a Doctor Who doormat so you can walk all over your favorite Doctor.

408
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There's a grand prize as well, which is a trip to London Comic-Con,

409
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
so that's pretty cool.

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You know, I'm not, like, super into Doctor Who,

411
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
but I certainly don't dislike it.

412
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Like, I watched some of the Eccleston ones because that's where I decided to start.

413
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And it was good. I just, you know, me and watching TV,

414
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't always get to binge everything.

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And then I'll, like, start binging something,

416
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and then suddenly somebody's like, you have to watch 13 Reasons Why.

417
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Or you have to watch Stranger Things.

418
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, you do not have to watch 13 Reasons Why.

419
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Do you know how many people are telling me I need to watch that show?

420
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I haven't watched it yet.

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No, please, please don't support that show.

422
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It does terrible things and completely misrepresents suicide.

423
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, anyway, I have watched Stranger Things.

424
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That was the one I did. That was really good.

425
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And I still need to finish Queer Eye because there's a second season coming out.

426
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Some of those guys were at DragCon.

427
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, really?

428
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I didn't say anything.

429
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh, God.

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Every time I hit a trouble spot in my life, I just think,

431
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
WWJVND, what would Jonathan Van Ness do?

432
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I just think, what would Carson Kressley wear?

433
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
He would probably call something gorgeous.

434
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's gorgeous. It's gorgeous.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Anyway, over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com,

436
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Nifty Squirrel wants to know, is the fanny pack bigger on the inside?

437
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes, I hope so.

438
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's so funny because you know what fanny is everywhere else in the world?

439
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It means vagina.

440
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's vagina, right?

441
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes.

442
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So anyway, well, fanny is your bottom, is your booty.

443
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
At least if you are international, you did not know that that's what we take fanny to mean.

444
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But it's just like pants.

445
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I put on pants in the morning, but I'm thinking like jeans.

446
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Trousers.

447
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Or slacks, right?

448
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's pants to us.

449
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Pants everywhere else is your unders.

450
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah, your under thingies. So, kind of interesting.

451
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Not the thingies that go in your under thingies, but the thingies that go over your under under thingies.

452
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Which is, ironically, you know how some people really get bothered by the word moist and things like that?

453
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, you know what, underpants, I think that is the dumbest word. You sound like you're like three years old.

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's why you just call them pants.

455
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't lie.

456
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's also funny because then you can say, when we give someone a wedgie, you can say you pantsed someone.

457
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But that's just you pulled down your pants. You pulled down their pants.

458
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But you wedgie.

459
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Anyway.

460
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, whatever.

461
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh, forget it. Alright, look. We're going to move on.

462
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I wanted to ask you guys, though, about the Doctor Who stuff and this Twitch thing.

463
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, A, what do you think about this kind of direction for Twitch where we're seeing more and more non-gaming content on Twitch?

464
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is this the future of television?

465
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't hate it.

466
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You don't hate it?

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm not mad at it.

468
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm not mad at it either.

469
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's fine.

470
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You know, it's good. And the thing that I like is that it'll give people easy access to seeing the classic Who to see.

471
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Know your roots. Know your doctors.

472
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You know, I mean, yeah, Tom Baker made a cameo in one of the specials.

473
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You know, but still, you know, it's better to watch him as the doctor.

474
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Right.

475
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And, yeah.

476
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And that fantastic scarf and outfit.

477
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You know the BBC released that scarf pattern.

478
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, good.

479
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
To knit it.

480
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But, yeah, he had the hat.

481
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.

482
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And I mean, of course.

483
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It was an ensemble.

484
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It was an ordeal.

485
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And him and Lala Ward, which he actually married her after and then they got divorced.

486
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But it's just funny, you know, watching them together.

487
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And then it's just really.

488
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Go back and watch the seventh Doctor, though.

489
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh, my God.

490
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That is cranky, Doctor.

491
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And he is the best.

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Let me get to this chat comment and then I'll ask Loki your thoughts.

493
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
From Bobby in chat.

494
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's on before us here at Vogue is saying, I think it's interesting

495
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
that Twitch is reintroducing live TV viewing again, something we stopped doing with Netflix,

496
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Hulu and so forth.

497
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's a very good point is that the whole like community coming together and like chatting

498
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
about it is kind of like like Twitch has kind of done that where other people kind of started

499
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to do that.

500
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And then like the breaks got hit on it like and I'm thinking of like, remember when Netflix

501
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
had the party mode on 360 and then that got the plug pulled on it.

502
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But that was like a really fun thing to do with friends is to watch stuff together and

503
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
comment or TV, TV.

504
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I remember the we use little thing that they had where you could actually do the chat alongs

505
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and stuff with football games and American Idol.

506
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah, you probably don't remember it because Nintendo was horrible at promoting it.

507
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I can imagine that shit with Drag Race, though.

508
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, my God.

509
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Right.

510
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So that's what we needed.

511
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We need a Twitch Drag Race feed or something.

512
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Anyway.

513
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Right.

514
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Loki, what are your thoughts on Doctor Who coming to Twitch and like what that could

515
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
mean for the future of like television?

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's cool.

517
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I never watched Doctor Who.

518
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So, yeah, I don't know.

519
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'll check it out.

520
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'll watch it a little bit, even though I don't know a lot about the classic ones.

521
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah.

522
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I mean, it's neat that they're experimenting with that kind of stuff.

523
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I think we are.

524
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
For me, I think we are looking in a little bit of a way at the future of television because

525
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
there's more and more stuff that people can home grow in this day and age.

526
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So I can talk about this now.

527
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The project that I was doing for the past couple of weeks that kind of kept me away

528
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
from a lot of things is that I was playing one of my like online games.

529
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That's like the survivor esque type of game.

530
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But I had to keep it a secret because that was part of the whole twist was that I'm not

531
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
going to get too into the details because I kind of want to do an episode of this show

532
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
about it at some point with some of the people that live here locally that play them.

533
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But I got voted out really early.

534
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The game is supposed to run through like June.

535
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I was like the seventh person voted out.

536
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So I didn't even make the jury thing.

537
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But whatever.

538
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That's just because they're haters.

539
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But the reason why I bring that whole project up is because I think it's fascinating because

540
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
like when events are happening in the game, like challenges and tribal councils,

541
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
they're streaming them on Google Hangouts and people are watching them like it's like they

542
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
have this group.

543
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
There's like something like 700, 800 people in this Facebook group.

544
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And there's, you know, a good chunk of people that are like actually watching this shit

545
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
unfold live.

546
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And the reason why I bring that up is because like a lot more of like the television and

547
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
the programming stuff is homegrown.

548
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Right.

549
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So people aren't necessarily waiting for a new episode of Survivor to come on this week.

550
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
They're making their own fucking survivor or, you know, like people aren't waiting for

551
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
there to be a new gaming channel for a G4 replacement to show up.

552
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
One's never coming because Twitch, everybody has like their own thing.

553
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
So I think you're seeing more and more like what the future of television is going to

554
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
look like because basic cable is on notice, in my opinion.

555
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
They're like the room for basic cable is that window is dwindling because I think more

556
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and more people are kind of making their own shit.

557
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I don't think local television is ever particularly going away because local TV is still

558
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
going to keep us informed, especially when like bad shit is happening in town and people

559
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
need to see like, where is the hurricane?

560
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Where is the flood?

561
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Where is the volcano erupting?

562
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Like those types of things you still need like your local news for.

563
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's similar in a way, in my opinion, to what podcasts have done to traditional radio.

564
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Like podcasts have really kind of fucked up traditional radio in many ways.

565
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You know, it really kind of put a dent in satellite radio.

566
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They're all under one company now, right?

567
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Because people can kind of choose to listen to their own stuff.

568
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So it's very interesting to me how more and more media is getting more underground.

569
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Of course, this could open up a whole nother can of worms about, well, when you have amateur

570
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
media, there's no sense of responsibility, which is how we get into spreading news stories

571
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
that aren't necessarily real, right?

572
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Alternative facts, if you will.

573
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, but the major news networks do that too.

574
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So, I mean, yeah.

575
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So, I mean, but anyway, I don't want to go too far down that.

576
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
To be fair, their spread, their effect on, you know, the populace is they have a larger

577
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
viewership is probably greater than a podcast.

578
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Right.

579
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Well, but I mean, maybe because a lot of their viewership is a lot of older folks who don't

580
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
use, not only, but there's a lot of older folks that don't use technology.

581
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Like Loki, by the time we are the older generation, the ones that are over the age of 65, which

582
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
is only about 25 years away, you know, that using things like Twitch, using the internet

583
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
to get things that's going to be commonplace.

584
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's not going to be like a niche thing or something that only tech savvy people know

585
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
how to do.

586
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You know what I mean?

587
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah.

588
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So, anyway, looking at a chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Nifty Swirl says, ah, bummer, you got pork

589
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
chopped.

590
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
No, I wasn't the first one gone.

591
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I was more like Mayhem Miller.

592
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I was I should have went a lot further and I was like a fan favorite.

593
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Cut too soon.

594
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's I was I would prefer to be compared to Mayhem Miller, although I do love Mayhem,

595
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
though.

596
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah, it's perfect.

597
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's the perfect analogy.

598
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And Mayhem also was complete perfection in person.

599
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes.

600
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And which I am, too.

601
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I got to look at the feather dress in person.

602
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, I love it.

603
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That shit was hot.

604
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I love it.

605
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Let's see.

606
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Tiger Claw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the problem with Google Hangout, however,

607
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,400
if there is any copyrighted music playing in the background, it's going to nag you about

608
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,240
it since Google Hangout is archiving the stream to YouTube.

609
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,600
Well, that would just depend on the type of programming you're doing.

610
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,740
Like all the game stuff I was just referencing, like you don't really play music during that.

611
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:29,520
So there's no there's no need to, you know, watch that or no need to worry about copyright

612
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
with that.

613
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,000
But I I mean, that's also a problem on Twitch.

614
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,840
Like if you're going to sit there and play something like Heroes of the Storm all night

615
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
long.

616
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Excuse me.

617
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,000
And you get you get sick of the game audio or things like Warcraft.

618
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That's another big one.

619
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
World of Warcraft.

620
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,200
Like, you know, the music of World of Warcraft is great.

621
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,760
The first 500 times you hear it and then it's like, OK, maybe I'm going to mute the soundtrack

622
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,840
of World of Warcraft and play my own music.

623
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,740
So I mean, you can do that.

624
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,320
And I guess they use a DJ license or something so that the live feeds are unaffected.

625
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,140
But your broadcast will get muted if you have copyright music in it, which I'm sure you

626
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,440
all know is a big thing over on Twitch TV.

627
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
So anyway.

628
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,640
Whoo.

629
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,200
I guess I kind of went off track there on the Twitch and Doctor Who thing.

630
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,120
But I really do think it kind of all comes together about kind of like the future of

631
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,320
like where the concept of a TV network is growing.

632
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,520
And, you know, we're starting to grow more and more of our own stuff.

633
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,400
So I'll leave you with that.

634
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,360
Anyway, let's move on and talk about our video game weeks and the types of video games that

635
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,300
we have been playing this week.

636
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,120
So Dark Sakura, you got a little bit to catch up on, but any games you want to talk about

637
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,400
that you've been playing this week?

638
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,440
Kirby, Zelda Breath of the Wild.

639
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,200
And then I went to the Golden State Pinball Expo and played a shit ton of pinball.

640
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,680
And I'm going to go in order of what I played.

641
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,840
Played Baby Pac-Man, Mr. and Miss Pac-Man pinball.

642
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
These are all pinball by the way.

643
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,040
Black Rose, which is one of my favorites.

644
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Dialed in.

645
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
They had dialed in.

646
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,040
So I got to play it on one of the Jersey Jack tables.

647
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,440
Also got to play like this vertigo pinball thing, but it also had like double screen

648
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,480
or like extra long screen video games.

649
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,740
So one of them was Mappy.

650
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
So I played Mappy.

651
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,800
I apologize for this very important interruption, but Dark Sakura, did you want the decaf one

652
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,880
or did you want to choose from the other flavors that I have for coffee?

653
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,600
Coffee is a very important subject.

654
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,080
I will always interrupt this show to talk about coffee.

655
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,960
I really want actual caffeine, but I'm afraid about ulcers, but fuck it.

656
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
You live once.

657
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Do you have hazelnut?

658
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
So we want peppermint.

659
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,560
You want vanilla macadamia, vanilla buttercream or toasted graham.

660
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Oh, I do have hazelnut cream.

661
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
You want that?

662
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
I like hazelnut cream, please.

663
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
All right.

664
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
You got it.

665
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Now we resume with our gaming weeks.

666
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Okay.

667
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,400
I also played Centaur.

668
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,360
I played the Goldeneye table.

669
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,760
I played Starship Troopers, which is actually a really fun table.

670
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,120
I did play Doctor Who pinball that has one of the best multi balls to ever exist.

671
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,440
I played, the fuck is this one?

672
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,960
I think it's the Getaway.

673
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,520
I played Middle Earth, which is one of the seventies ones.

674
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,560
I played the Got Live Ninja Turtles table, which always sucks.

675
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,960
I of course played Lexi Lightspeed, which keep your eyes open for Lexi Lightspeed because

676
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,160
it's a modular table.

677
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,000
You're supposed to be able to rebuild the table with different rules.

678
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,160
And on the play field, it has like a video screen that interacts with the various targets

679
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
and everything.

680
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,800
So you can get one modular table and then switch out other tables and other programming

681
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
for it.

682
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,000
So it's pretty cool.

683
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,960
I also played...

684
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Which one is this?

685
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,280
I don't know which one this is.

686
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,840
Oh, this is Lost in Space.

687
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
It wasn't great.

688
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,860
I played Tron.

689
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,500
And then I saw a sticker that says, ask not for whom the ball rolls, it rolls for thee.

690
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Also played Ghostbusters, the new Ghostbusters, which is pretty nice.

691
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,300
It was just funny.

692
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:07,900
If you look in their headquarters, they have a picture of a pinball table that's the same

693
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,820
pinball table that was in the firehouse in the movie.

694
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,940
So it's pretty cool.

695
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,300
I played Aerosmith, which I do nothing but play the Sweet Emotion mode on that one anyway.

696
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,660
Which is an appropriate thing to do.

697
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,780
I played one called TX Sector.

698
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,420
I played The Hobbit, which is a slow ass table.

699
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:32,700
I mean, Jersey Jack does some good tables, but this one was slow as fuck to play and

700
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
not as much fun.

701
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,780
I played Beat Time, which is the one based on the Beatles.

702
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:45,800
I did not get to play one of the new ones.

703
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
What was it?

704
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Houdini.

705
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,000
One of the newest ones to come out.

706
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,240
And then they had the Iron Maiden machines.

707
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,100
But oh, I also played Guardians of the Galaxy, which was a really fun table.

708
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,700
That's like their new one, huh?

709
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,700
One of the newer ones.

710
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,760
But actually the newest one that came out was Iron Maiden and it was okay.

711
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I didn't play it.

712
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Sorry.

713
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,840
I have to deviate real quick because now that you're talking about all this pinball, like

714
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,120
one of the big stories that you missed in the couple of weeks you were gone was that

715
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,480
the pinball arcade.

716
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Is that the one?

717
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,580
I can't, there's always like multiple.

718
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,220
So they're losing like a ton of those licenses.

719
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,100
They're losing, what was it, Midway, Bali.

720
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,380
They're losing those.

721
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,240
And so you have until the end of June to pick up everything you want.

722
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,100
There's not going to be any sales because that's a violation of their license agreement.

723
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Like are you sad to see those go or are you just playing the virtual one?

724
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,240
So I wasn't fun for me.

725
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,140
I guess that is kind of a dumb question for you because you and husband are in the position

726
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,340
where you can collect the real things.

727
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,260
Or we know people who have them.

728
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,660
And I'll be honest, I really don't enjoy playing virtual pinball that much.

729
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Really?

730
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,020
Even the, um, the, the big like virtue, like the main pinball thing that they actually

731
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,620
lay down on a vertical TV.

732
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,580
Yeah, because it's really fucking weird to tilt them.

733
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,220
It just doesn't, it's just not as much when you don't get the right feedback.

734
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,340
Tilt is always weird on a virtual thing.

735
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,440
That's one thing that is like impossible to get right.

736
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,820
And see, for me, it's almost impossible for me to tilt a table.

737
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,100
Usually the way that I knock the, um, the ball back into play is I just give it a smack

738
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
on the side.

739
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Yeah.

740
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
Same.

741
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,300
And it's usually enough, but Dan shakes it.

742
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,420
I don't shake the whole table.

743
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,380
So getting a tilt is really hard for me.

744
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,500
I mean, I wouldn't say I've never tilted before, but, but I have.

745
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
I've tilted.

746
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,940
But you know, but I am still playing Ragnarok.

747
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,860
I'm still playing Pokemon Go and that's about it.

748
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,180
All right.

749
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,180
A lot of fucking pinball.

750
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,460
And I took pictures of everything that I took so that I, that I played so I could put it

751
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,020
on my thing for today that I played all those pins.

752
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
All right.

753
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
You got it.

754
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,100
Uh, going to chat at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby says, I spent that money to buy all

755
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
the packs.

756
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,020
Uh, for someone who can't play the real thing.

757
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
I liked it.

758
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,300
I only play real pinball tables once a year.

759
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,500
Uh, and then the VPC caps I want to get, have a tilt button on either side so I won't have

760
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
to shake my table.

761
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,100
Well, I mean, it's, it's hard because you know, a button, it's just not going to be

762
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,580
quite that same feeling as the actual physics of shaking it.

763
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,180
But I also get it like you may not want to put that type of stress on your table, but

764
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,740
that is kind of part of pinball.

765
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,100
I mean, believe it or not, tilting machine is kind of without tilting it and getting

766
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,260
the error is kind of part of it.

767
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,340
That's why the tables, the legs are the way that they are.

768
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,480
They are firm steel that are meant to be shaken and the tilt mechanism inside for anyone who

769
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,700
doesn't know it is a weighted pendulum that is a perfectly balanced pendulum with, um,

770
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,620
a charged plate in a circle around it.

771
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,600
And so when it hits, it'll give you a warning, but when it's a full knock, it'll give you

772
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
a full tilt.

773
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Yeah.

774
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,760
So that is how it works.

775
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
To be fair.

776
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,840
These things that we're talking about are like advanced pinball.

777
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,560
Like most people that play pinball aren't going to be in the notion.

778
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,400
Like I would say beginner pinball is when you're still hitting both flipper buttons

779
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,480
at the same time for everything.

780
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Which is fine.

781
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
I mean, that's fine.

782
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
That's like beginner DDR.

783
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
When you go back to the center.

784
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Oh my God.

785
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
I was thinking the same thing.

786
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
That's like beginner DDR.

787
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,120
The first thing you have to learn about DDR is to like, don't, you don't always have to

788
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
go back to the center.

789
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,320
Well, the first thing you need to learn from DDR watching my kids is that you have to hit

790
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,960
more than just the top arrow and you have to kind of look at the screen when you're

791
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,100
doing it because you can't just stand there and just keep tapping the top arrow and expect

792
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
to beat the level.

793
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,940
But the, the, you know, the great thing about, about pinball for me is that physicality to

794
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
it.

795
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,900
And so that's why I just don't get the same feel with the virtual tables.

796
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,740
I mean, I liked playing, you know, Revenge of the Gator and all that because that was

797
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,740
how that was meant to be played or Sonics pinball, Pokemon pinball, but they were designed

798
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,740
that way.

799
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,740
They were never full size tables.

800
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,580
They had that fantasy element to it and things that wouldn't like, or a devil's crush or

801
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,260
alien crush.

802
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,300
Those things wouldn't happen on a legit pinball table.

803
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:11,540
So, but, you know, if it's a legit pinball and it doesn't and they make a virtual version

804
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,060
of it, like it was fine before we could, you know, get these tables or new people who had

805
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,060
them.

806
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
That was kind of the only way we could.

807
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
Right.

808
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
But now.

809
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Which you realize is where most people are at.

810
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,220
But now pinball is really such a growing, um, you know, it's, it's gaining its popularity

811
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,220
again.

812
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,220
The love has come back.

813
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,780
We've got companies returning and I even wonder if part of these licensed failures could

814
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,780
possibly be that maybe some of those companies might be thinking of, cause I mean, um, midway

815
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:43,740
and uh, Williams have licensed their tables to stern and to some of the, um, the ones

816
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,460
rebuilding them.

817
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,100
So it could be, I mean, we may even, who knows, maybe we'll see a return of Williams pinball.

818
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Who knows?

819
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
All right.

820
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,540
Anyway, let's move on to Loki and your gaming week.

821
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Um, I played no pinball this week.

822
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
No, it's all good.

823
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,860
It's all good.

824
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:06,140
And so, um, I did play those some new stuff, so I did try because I was looking for more

825
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:12,340
games for the switch, so I ended up downloading a few and one of those being a bloodstain

826
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:21,340
curse of the moon, which is a kind of retro, like it's very much like Castlevania three

827
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,620
and it's, um, yeah, I mean, it's a good game.

828
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:31,540
It's very much, it looked like it could be an NES game and I've enjoyed quite a bit of

829
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
it.

830
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,420
So definitely check it out cause you can switch between players or let's sort of like, I guess

831
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,620
Castlevania three, cause I think Castlevania three you couldn't switch in real time, but

832
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,820
this you can, you can actually switch between your characters in real time, which is kind

833
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,820
of cool.

834
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,620
Um, but yeah, I mean like every, all the enemies in the game, like dude, this is like totally

835
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,620
Castlevania.

836
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,380
Like this is just such a ripoff of the Castlevania.

837
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,380
Granted.

838
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,340
Yeah, I know it's the same people, but it's like, dude.

839
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,340
It's exactly.

840
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,780
It's like reskinning Castlevania and calling it something else.

841
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
To be fair.

842
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,460
That's kind of what a lot of people want though.

843
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,560
You know, like, yeah, I'm not complaining.

844
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
It's a great game.

845
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,540
I mean, it was, it's a great game.

846
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,300
So not complaining, but I'm just like, Oh man, enemies just like this one and the other

847
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,380
game and it's like, it's exactly the same.

848
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,060
There's food in the walls and stuff.

849
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,740
And so yeah, whatever.

850
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,740
It's all good.

851
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,580
Um, you know, if Konami ain't going to do it, you know what?

852
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,580
Yeah.

853
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,580
So, um, definitely check that out.

854
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,100
I've been asking, when do we get an old school Castlevania game yet?

855
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,100
Here you go.

856
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Here you go.

857
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
Yeah, it's great.

858
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,100
10 bucks.

859
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,100
Can't be it.

860
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Yeah.

861
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,180
You should get, if you put 28 or more down, you should get a code for this retro one.

862
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,580
But the problem is the codes are like delayed.

863
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,860
So like I'm waiting on my switch code, but like I know people that still just went and

864
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,460
bought it anyway, but I'm like, no, I'm going to wait on my switch code.

865
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,900
But I think they gave backers like a temporary steam code so that you could check it out

866
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,660
no matter where you're like copy is supposed to be.

867
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,660
Anyway.

868
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,740
It's good.

869
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,740
So definitely check it out.

870
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:02,580
And then my S my son had their friends over, so they wanted to do PlayStation VR.

871
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,500
So I got more PlayStation VR stuff, but none of them played any of the new games that he

872
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,340
wanted to play the same old shit that the key plane.

873
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,140
So we played a little bit of, um, what do you let your children play until dawn?

874
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Rush your blood.

875
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,420
I wanted to let them do that, but they don't know.

876
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,500
No, the one I wanted to let them play a surgeon simulator, but that would unfortunately be

877
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,660
a little inappropriate, but they would love it.

878
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,020
They would, they would eat that shit.

879
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:32,740
But no, the, the more, the most violent game they played was, um, super hot VR.

880
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,460
And they liked, they liked because like that game, there's no way to like, I can't figure

881
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,980
out how to restart the progress.

882
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,460
So they had to play like where I left off in the game.

883
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,620
Um, and so the one that I left off on, you start off, I think in like a helicopter maybe

884
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,620
or something.

885
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
I don't know.

886
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,320
It's like some elevated area and you have to punch a guy.

887
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,540
And so they kept cock punching the dude over and over and, um, shooting things.

888
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,420
But yeah, they had fun with that.

889
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,480
And then we also, I picked up, um, fruit ninja VR, which that's a pretty easy one from the

890
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
play.

891
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,560
Um, and then what else?

892
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,160
And then we did a job simulator, you know, the old standby, but like I had like a bunch

893
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,340
of stuff and stuff that I like almost accidentally started for them, like accounting plus, no,

894
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,940
that's not, that's not a kid's game right there.

895
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:30,100
Um, but yeah, I, my wife's like, well, you know, can I try that?

896
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,260
You know, joking them like, yeah, you can, you can play until dawn rush of blood.

897
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,460
She didn't want to do that.

898
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,460
Is that it?

899
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,380
And I also have Skyrim VR, which I haven't got a chance to play yet, but I have it cause

900
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,240
I got a half off when they were doing that sale last week at GameStop.

901
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,040
So aside from that, um, just basically, uh, Super Mario Odyssey and then on Pokemon Go

902
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,020
because you know, we've, they've had the kind of cycling stuff out.

903
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,880
So I've been just evolving stuff.

904
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
That's it.

905
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
All right.

906
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
Uh, my gaming week.

907
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,200
So, um, I, I, my project came to an end when a bunch of people half my age voted me off

908
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
the Island.

909
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,360
Um, so that's, that's that, but, uh, it, it opened up my free time to play more video

910
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
games again.

911
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,840
Um, so I was able to, you guys don't even know like how much time you spend, but it's

912
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,520
like nonstop Skype calls.

913
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,600
Like is, are they going to turn on you?

914
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Are they going to turn on you?

915
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Are you going to stick with me?

916
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Are you going to do this?

917
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,000
I guess it's like nonstop, but it's actually a lot of fun.

918
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,120
It really like, it sounds ridiculous, but like the psychological psychology games, like

919
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,640
if you like shit, like, like mafia and werewolf and stuff and conventions, like it's basically

920
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,440
that, like just on a much bigger scale.

921
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,400
Anyway, that's all I'll say about that until I'm able to get some of the players here on

922
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,600
the building, kind of like we did the Ingers episode and we'll do a, we'll do an orgy

923
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,600
episode.

924
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,680
Um, not to be confused with orgy.

925
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
That's much different.

926
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
This is an orgy episode.

927
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,800
Um, anyhow, so video games, I picked back up final fantasy 14.

928
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,280
I kind of slowed down on that the past couple of months because I sort of wore out that

929
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,600
last patch, but they came out with patch 4.3 in this past week.

930
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,300
So it's kind of reinvigorated me to go back in there and, Oh, I got a new, a dungeon unlock

931
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,300
and check out.

932
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,660
I really like the way they did the new dungeons and they referenced geomancers from back in

933
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,860
like final fantasy tactics are like, even though they're not a playable class, like

934
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,000
the enemies are geomancers and they ring the bells and it like makes the area that you're

935
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,440
in completely change.

936
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
So it's really cool.

937
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
Um, I like that.

938
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,100
Uh, and then, um, yeah, just unlocking some of the other features, like you get to rebuild

939
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,640
Doma castle.

940
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,700
It's one of those weird things where like Doma castle exists in final fantasy 14, but

941
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,780
it's not necessarily the same Doma from final fantasy six.

942
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,400
It's just like, what if this concept existed in a different time and place?

943
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,440
Like kind of like how final well fancy games do with like Sid and chocobos, right?

944
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,620
So they took Doma castle and kind of put it there.

945
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,720
And so that's a big part is you get to rebuild Doma.

946
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,380
So I had to do a lot of questing for that.

947
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,420
So that was some time in fall of SC 14.

948
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,380
Um, and then I also played some Nintendo switch.

949
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,920
Um, I checked out a game kind of randomly.

950
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,500
I noticed it was the number one selling game in the store and it was an indie game.

951
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,380
It was beating a bunch of other stuff.

952
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,220
And uh, I'd heard some friends talking about it on Twitter.

953
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,220
So I was like, what the hell?

954
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,220
I'm going to pick this up.

955
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,220
So it's called wizard of legend.

956
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,220
Yeah.

957
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,220
I saw that.

958
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,360
I almost bought it by having it's, it's not bad.

959
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,800
Like it doesn't handhold you a lot.

960
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,460
Like you really have to kind of learn some things the hard way.

961
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,180
It is a rogue like, okay.

962
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,180
At its core.

963
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,800
Um, but even if you're like one of those people's like, I hate rogue likes, like, you know,

964
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,260
check out some videos, see what you think about this one, because you know, a lot of

965
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:40,380
it is about kind of like how you build your book of moves before you go out into the world

966
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,040
and you can collect these different arcana basically.

967
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,620
So like maybe you do like an earth punch or a fire punch and like, or these different

968
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,980
moves, like the beams can be fire or lightning, but then I mean it's, it's much more intricate

969
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,980
than that.

970
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,220
It's not just like, Oh, it's the same beam, but a different element.

971
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,460
No, like the ice one will like go out and freeze monster then come back.

972
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,580
The fire one kind of does a funky pattern.

973
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,700
You know, the thunder one will like suspend bullets in midair, you know, like they all

974
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,940
have their own little like things that they do.

975
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,280
So you kind of like can build that book, but they didn't, they didn't really explain the

976
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,280
whole concept.

977
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,700
So I'll just, I'll help you all out if you decide to check this out.

978
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,220
So the little like chaos emeralds, I think they're called either that or I'm confused

979
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,620
to get with Sonic the Hedgehog little chaos emeralds.

980
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,860
That's what you use to like buy new spells that are permanent for your book that you

981
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,580
can take each time in there.

982
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,220
And that's, that's like, you want to grab, those persist even amongst death.

983
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,920
Gold will lose when you die and gold is how you temporarily buy stuff in the dungeons.

984
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,740
So you might run across shopkeepers in the dungeons that are like, do you want to buy

985
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,480
this spell or do you want to buy this enhancement for your spell?

986
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,380
You can spend gold on that, but it will only last during the dungeon.

987
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,480
So it's kind of interesting.

988
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,600
It feels a little bit like in some ways Diablo-y to me because all the dungeons are like randomly

989
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,940
generated and so they're never going to be the same and you know, kind of like the way

990
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,860
that you fight and stuff looks a little Diablo-y.

991
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,260
So I'm into it.

992
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,540
I like it, you know, especially for like a, what was it, $15, $20 indie title.

993
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,540
Yeah.

994
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,540
It's, it's, you know, it's cool.

995
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,980
And apparently it has local co-op, which is cool, but I haven't really been able to test

996
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,980
that yet.

997
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,940
So there's that.

998
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,500
I also picked up Mega Man collection one and two.

999
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,500
I just haven't played it yet.

1000
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,700
So not a lot else to say on that, but I did pick up and I did play a little bit of Hyrule

1001
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,660
warriors last night because I'm, I didn't bother playing it when it was on Wii U.

1002
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,700
I didn't bother playing it when it was on 3DS.

1003
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,860
So finally I was like, all right, this, this is probably going to be the last time they

1004
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,420
do it and this will be the everything edition.

1005
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,880
So I'm going to buy it this time.

1006
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,860
So I did and I'm, I'm liking it quite a bit.

1007
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,940
Like I've only played the first two regular levels.

1008
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,140
Then I went into the adventure mode, which is the one that looks like the 8-bit Zelda

1009
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,140
a little bit.

1010
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,060
And I did a little bit of that cause I want to explore it.

1011
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,460
I'll play some more after the show tonight on my Twitch channel.

1012
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,220
I think last, last I checked my vote on my Twitter, that was the one that was leading

1013
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,220
by about 20%.

1014
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,780
So I think I'm going to be doing Hyrule warriors after the show tonight.

1015
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,540
So I'll show you a little more of that game over on my Twitch channel.

1016
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,460
It's twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, all one word.

1017
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,540
But I love the feeling of just hacking through thousands of enemies at once.

1018
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,340
And I think it's really cool how you can play as Link, but in the first stage you get to

1019
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,620
be Zelda a little bit, or you can be Impa or I just got a stage with Sheik in it.

1020
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:18,080
So it's cool that you can play all these different characters.

1021
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,180
And then I like that it's not just like run to the other side of the battlefield and hack

1022
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,620
as many things as you can, like you have to kind of manage everything that's going

1023
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,820
on in the battlefield.

1024
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,100
And part of how you manage it is you can flip between your characters really quick.

1025
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,780
So it's like, you might get an alert, like you have this base under attack in the top

1026
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,780
left.

1027
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,420
Okay, well Impa is up there in the top left, so I'm going to flip over to Impa and then

1028
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,660
I'll have her take the base back and get rid of, okay, now I'll go back to Link who is

1029
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,360
kind of going through the main objectives.

1030
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,860
So I kind of like how you have to juggle that a little bit and manage that is pretty cool.

1031
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,300
And that's only in the first couple of levels.

1032
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,900
Like I only can imagine how much harder this gets.

1033
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,720
And I have played a little bit of Dynasty Warriors and it is fucking Dynasty Warriors

1034
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,620
with a Zelda skin, but that's okay.

1035
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,180
Like there's probably a lot of people who haven't played Dynasty Warriors but probably

1036
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,920
will because it's Link and Zelda now and it's cool, I enjoy it.

1037
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,620
So yeah, Hyrule Warriors, I'm liking it so far.

1038
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,240
Let's check in again after another week and see if I've actually continued with it and

1039
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,240
played more.

1040
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,220
Based on the fact that this is the Definitive Edition, it sure seems like there is an awful

1041
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,580
lot to do.

1042
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,920
Like those two modes I named are only like two of like five or six modes that are in

1043
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,920
it.

1044
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,460
I mean, there's just crazy amounts of stuff to unlock and things like that.

1045
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,260
So go into our chat at live.vognetware.com.

1046
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:40,500
Vidpower says those blank warriors games, because I guess Fire Emblem has one too, are

1047
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,940
great stress relievers.

1048
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,940
Yes.

1049
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,740
Like I said, it's very satisfying to just chop through like 2000 monsters and you just

1050
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,940
feel like such a badass.

1051
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,320
So yeah, I'm a fan.

1052
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,180
I'm a fan of Hyrule Warriors so far.

1053
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,980
I'm almost a little sad I slept on it before but then again at the same time, I'm kind

1054
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:01,620
of glad that like this edition that I bought is like, this is all you need.

1055
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,340
It's the Definitive Edition.

1056
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,760
That is until, you know, it goes the way of like Super Street Fighter 2 and then we get

1057
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:15,280
like, it's Hyrule Warriors Turbo Championship Super Mega Definitive Collection.

1058
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,280
So we'll see.

1059
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,280
Hopefully not.

1060
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,260
Alright, that's it for my Game of the Week.

1061
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:24,120
Let's talk about some announcements of which I don't have an awful lot, but I will mention

1062
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,060
that we will not be here at the very last week in June.

1063
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:34,520
We will not be here June 24th, but we will be here June 17th for our 16th birthday.

1064
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,500
So who's going to be buying us a car?

1065
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,420
It's OLR's My Sweet Sixteen coming to you on June 17th.

1066
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,960
We need to watch the sweet 17th birthday comic extravaganza by Strongbad.

1067
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,440
I just hope there's a cake.

1068
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,720
That's all a person should get for the birthday cake.

1069
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,240
Should I get us a bunt cake?

1070
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,160
Or as I called it when I was a kid, a butt cake?

1071
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
A butt cake.

1072
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
You know what?

1073
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,160
Any cake.

1074
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,620
Bakers can't be choosers.

1075
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:06,320
So when a cake is made for me, all I ask is that it's not a cake with like mayonnaise

1076
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,320
as frosting.

1077
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,320
Ice cream cake?

1078
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
Mmm.

1079
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,320
Ice cream cake.

1080
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
I can't eat ice cream anymore.

1081
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
Oh my God.

1082
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,920
Shane was just telling me, because Shane just had a birthday and he was telling me about

1083
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,240
a cake he got that had like banana ice cream in it and it was like graham cracker crust.

1084
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,480
Oh yeah, something for Shane.

1085
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,040
Oh, it sounded so good.

1086
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,040
Anyway.

1087
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,520
Because Christy gave him banana pocky and it's at my house.

1088
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Oh, nice.

1089
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,520
So, all right.

1090
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,440
Anyway, uh, let's get into some other video game news.

1091
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,880
We have, it hasn't been a huge gaming news week, but there's a, there's a few things

1092
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,880
to talk about.

1093
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,880
Right?

1094
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Logie?

1095
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,880
Yeah.

1096
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,880
The Vita might be coming back.

1097
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,880
No, no.

1098
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,880
That's not the case.

1099
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,880
Uh, no.

1100
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,720
Apparently there's a new chief of Sony Interactive Entertainment, uh, John Cadara, who's been

1101
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,960
kind of speaking his mind about the PlayStation brand and talking about, uh, the possibility

1102
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,800
of a portable system making a return and basically saying, you know, Hey, Sony portable gaming

1103
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,480
could come back.

1104
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,440
You know, if they remember that the console actually exists, um, basically put it in my

1105
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,360
opinion rather than separating portable gaming from consoles, it's necessary to continue

1106
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,900
thinking of portal gaming as one method to deliver more gaming experiences, exploring

1107
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,560
what our customers want from portable.

1108
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,920
Um, we want to think about many options.

1109
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:31,480
It sounds like they just want to copy the switch based on that comment, but we'll see.

1110
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,200
We'll see what happens.

1111
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,960
It would be neat to see something like the switch that's more powerful.

1112
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,200
Do you think Sony's going to just straight up copy the switch?

1113
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,160
I mean, we kind of got into this a little bit last week when we talked about, you know,

1114
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:46,760
the Vita dying basically officially, uh, the fact that Sony kind of like almost had it

1115
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,420
like with the Vita TV and the fact that, you know, you could pick something up and then

1116
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,420
play it on your TV.

1117
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,280
Like they, well, they kind of were really close.

1118
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,960
I don't think that the next system is going to be something like that because they talking

1119
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,360
that right now the leaked, I don't know if it's leaked, but like the, the specs or the

1120
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,120
thought was that it's going to be something that's based off the AMD Ryzen chip.

1121
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,280
So I don't think that would necessarily lend itself to a portable console cause I think,

1122
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,120
I mean they're pretty low powered, but it's, I don't think you can get it quite low enough

1123
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,480
to have good battery life.

1124
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,280
Well some folks will really be down for that.

1125
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,820
She Hulk in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says PlayStation and Xbox need to be able

1126
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,940
to take the console on the road like the switch.

1127
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,960
It is a no brainer.

1128
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,080
So I mean, but look at what Nintendo had to sacrifice in order to get the form factor

1129
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,080
and everything.

1130
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,200
You have to sacrifice some power to be able to get it that small and that portable.

1131
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Fair enough.

1132
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,740
But you know, in a few more years, technology will have caught up quite a bit.

1133
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:49,960
You know, that, that, that switch consoles just as powerful as a PlayStation three or,

1134
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
you know, it's, it's lasted.

1135
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,400
It's actually a little more powerful than that, right?

1136
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,120
So you know, those guys can still pack a punch for being a little portable, you know, essentially

1137
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,120
a portable system.

1138
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:03,560
So yeah, you know, and how much, I mean, are we looking at with PlayStation five that every

1139
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,520
single game is going to be fully 4k?

1140
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,040
I mean, you think games are expensive to develop now?

1141
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,160
Like there's, there's gotta be a point where we can like, I almost feel like in some ways

1142
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,300
the PlayStation four was not the hugest step up from the PlayStation three.

1143
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,880
Like we were used to seeing like the one to the two and the two to the three were like

1144
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,880
big steps up.

1145
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,200
But the three to the four step was not as big.

1146
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,200
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1147
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,200
Duh.

1148
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,280
Of course you can tell the difference between PlayStation four and PlayStation three.

1149
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,080
But I mean, you know, I think that technology of what you can do on a screen, we're almost

1150
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,960
starting to plateau a little bit.

1151
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,960
Yeah.

1152
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,240
You know, and I know we've, we've, we've said this since the days of the Atari 2,600.

1153
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,400
Remember when the NES first came out when we were kids and it was like playing something

1154
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,520
like Super Mario brothers two was like, Oh my God, it's like an actual cartoon on my

1155
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,520
television.

1156
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
This is like a real cartoon, you know?

1157
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,040
And it's like, no, I don't think I ever said that.

1158
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,040
I did.

1159
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,000
I remember I was like, how much better can graphics get?

1160
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's a fucking cartoon.

1161
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,280
I didn't say fucking when I was a kid, well, maybe I did, but it's like, it's a cartoon

1162
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
on my television.

1163
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,440
Like how much better can we get than that?

1164
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,160
And then, you know, here we are now at PlayStation four, but it's like, you know, okay, we can

1165
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,320
go to full on four K 60 frame a second games, but you know how expensive those are going

1166
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,320
to be to make.

1167
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,680
Well, that's why I don't think necessarily it's going to be that it's going to, I mean,

1168
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,680
graphics will be one thing, but I think it's going to be more of how we interact with games,

1169
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,520
you know, pushing more of the augmented reality, the more haptics and that kind of stuff.

1170
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:33,040
Cause that, you know, you look at like a PlayStation VR, the graphics aren't that much better than,

1171
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,040
you know, most things.

1172
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,760
I mean, the displays aren't as good as like a, you know, a TV or something, but it's that

1173
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,520
immersion that you feel from it.

1174
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,520
You can't replicate that outside of VR.

1175
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,680
So I think once that becomes more mainstream, that's going to be the way things are going

1176
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,680
to go.

1177
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:56,500
Uh, looking at chat at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwell says, uh, I was the same way

1178
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:04,140
on the jump from PS3 to PS4 until I got a PS Pro on 4k PS3 and PS4 were both 1080p gaming.

1179
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,720
So that's why the jump didn't look as good.

1180
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,940
We didn't jump any resolution.

1181
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,180
Well, maybe not in my own house, but I've seen PlayStation 4 on 4k.

1182
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,180
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1183
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,580
Yes, it looks fucking great.

1184
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:18,780
But you know, again, like the PS3 was like already pretty fucking good, you know, and

1185
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,760
I don't expect that making every single game 4k is going to be, I mean, that just sounds

1186
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,080
like it's expensive unless, I don't know, maybe there's going to be ways to automate

1187
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,720
that more and maybe make it easier on the artists who do it, but it just seems like

1188
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,400
you think you wait a long time for games now, wait until they all have to be 4k and 120

1189
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
frames a second.

1190
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,960
Like it's just, it's going to be crazy.

1191
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,960
So I don't know.

1192
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,960
That's just my thought.

1193
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,360
Um, vidpower in chat says, I think the biggest graphical jump was from N64 to GameCube.

1194
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,360
Well, yeah, but that was also Nintendo's big jump from the cartridge format to the disc

1195
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,360
format.

1196
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,120
If you can wipe the Vaseline off the screen, you know, then yeah, anything looks great.

1197
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,600
Uh, dungeon buster says, I think it comes down mostly to the games.

1198
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,160
I can't imagine horizon zero dawn on the PS3 looking as it does or God of war.

1199
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,520
I don't have a PS4 pro, but both games look amazing to me regardless.

1200
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,840
Just just to be clear, cause I want to make sure I'm not coming off the wrong way.

1201
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,680
I'm not saying that the PS4 isn't noticeably better than the PlayStation three.

1202
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,680
Of course it is.

1203
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:20,480
I'm just saying that step, it doesn't feel like as huge of a step as it did from 1 to

1204
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,720
DVD to Blu Ray.

1205
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,800
It wasn't so, you know, noticeable.

1206
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:31,280
Well, it's noticeable, but it's not as noticeable as it was when we went from VHS to the right.

1207
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,280
That's for sure.

1208
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,280
Yeah.

1209
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,280
I'll give you that.

1210
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,280
I'll give you that.

1211
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,160
So anyway, um, those are just my thoughts on that.

1212
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,000
So um, w w do you think Sony is going to do something with the portable stuff or they

1213
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
don't?

1214
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,800
I don't think it anytime soon.

1215
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
All right.

1216
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:54,240
Well, last week on the show, we talked about how, um, steam was planning to bring a mobile,

1217
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,240
uh, steam link basically to cell phones.

1218
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,360
We talked a little bit about this last week, how they were planning this for Android and

1219
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,360
iOS.

1220
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,840
Well, a little monkey wrench got thrown in the plans this week because Apple blocked

1221
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,960
steam's plan to extend the video games to iPhones.

1222
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:16,240
Apple blocked steam from being onto the stores, uh, not incredibly sure the why behind it

1223
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,680
because I think they got kind of a generic sort of email that was like, you know, it

1224
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,600
doesn't, uh, it doesn't gel with Apple policies basically.

1225
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,360
So people are kind of left to think, is it because the marketplace, like Apple wasn't

1226
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,080
okay with that, but apparently steam disabled the marketplace for that, like they saw that

1227
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,760
one coming and they disabled it.

1228
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,840
So apparently that's not the problem.

1229
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,820
Um, but maybe you're offering a platform that's going to compete with something that's a service

1230
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,440
that's already offered.

1231
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:49,480
So basically Apple TV, not Apple TV including, there's also the app store.

1232
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,760
Well but remember they disabled purchasing in the steam thing, so it wasn't going to

1233
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,480
be right, but it was still going to be a competitor.

1234
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,160
Yeah, so that's fine.

1235
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,480
Just disabled max support then out of steam.

1236
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
No.

1237
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,720
Oh, you think valve should just go to war?

1238
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,400
Hey, you want gaming on your, that's not going to happen because they actually have a very

1239
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,560
large number of user base that's, that's on Mac.

1240
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,560
Yeah.

1241
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,280
I was going to say, don't hurt the users that already bought the games and stuff.

1242
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,600
That would be shooting their profits.

1243
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,360
I'm all for petty Crocker.

1244
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,280
Don't get me wrong, but that may not be the best move to do there.

1245
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:27,480
But you know, but if they are planning on doing like a portal three or something, uh,

1246
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,760
if valve wanted to be petty, they could be like the Mac version will be out six weeks

1247
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,760
later.

1248
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,040
Oh, but maybe we could push it to get it out earlier if Apple could do this one little

1249
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,760
thing for us.

1250
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,760
But here's the thing.

1251
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,760
Yeah.

1252
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,640
And, and they don't negotiate with terrorists.

1253
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,840
You're saying here's the thing.

1254
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,440
I kind of don't think the whole phone thing was that big of a deal anyway.

1255
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,960
Like I know we were talking about it on the show last week.

1256
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,320
Like I was like, Oh, that's kind of neat, but like, would I really use it?

1257
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:59,280
Like how I would like to know the actual like numbers percentage wise of steam users that

1258
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:05,040
actually use a steam link, either the phone or cause I have one I'm like, and the problem

1259
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,120
is like, I've never wanted to just set it up to play on the TV and well, Android is

1260
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,640
going to have this app.

1261
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:19,120
So I think you already, yeah, I have it on my phone and I have it on my, um, my Android

1262
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,120
TV.

1263
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,640
So, but yet I've never used either one.

1264
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,640
I thought about it.

1265
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,760
I'm like, Oh, that'd be kind of cool.

1266
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,680
I used my steam link for like a month sparingly and then that's it.

1267
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,220
Like I haven't really used it since.

1268
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,920
So, but like I said on the show last week, like I'm not going to play civilization six

1269
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,960
on my phone.

1270
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,960
That's redonkulous.

1271
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,480
Like that's not, that's not going to be fun.

1272
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,200
It's not like playing that from the bed on my no button device phone.

1273
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,840
Like that's not going to be fun switch.

1274
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,840
That's fun.

1275
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,840
I can still play that embedded.

1276
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:51,560
It feels just like playing it on TV, but, um, maybe watching movies out of the steam

1277
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,560
marketplace or something.

1278
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,120
But how many of those do I really like to don't think about your phone necessarily.

1279
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,720
Think about like if you have a tablet, it's better because you can use as a screen prop

1280
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,400
that Alan has an Android tablet.

1281
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,120
So he can whip out a Bluetooth controller and you can just play on it like a screen.

1282
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,120
Yeah.

1283
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,160
That'd be the point.

1284
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,400
If you have a computer that you can sit down in a comfy chair and just do the same shit,

1285
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,240
but whatever, you know, it's flexibility and we didn't have to pay for it.

1286
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:21,080
Uh, bonds double six and chat talking about the whole petty stuff that our little fan

1287
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,680
fic there, uh, bonds double six says when mommy and daddy fight, the kids suffer.

1288
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,680
It's true.

1289
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,880
We don't want, we don't want people to suffer cause they get in a fight.

1290
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,800
Um, let's see, uh, Brad from pod culture talking about the steam link says mine is collecting

1291
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,800
dust.

1292
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,440
Hate, hate, hate that damn controller.

1293
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,680
You can use like any Bluetooth controller with those things now or even like an Xbox

1294
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,360
wire controller and stuff like that.

1295
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,960
I mean, um, I just haven't bothered to set it up yet or maybe it did and I just forgot

1296
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,960
about it.

1297
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,400
I know I have it somewhere.

1298
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,920
It may be hooked up and I just completely forgot about it.

1299
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,920
Yeah.

1300
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,620
So I, so I mean this is a surprising to hear.

1301
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,640
Maybe they'll work something out.

1302
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,640
I don't know.

1303
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,140
But at the same time, was I really going to use this anyway?

1304
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,400
To be honest, probably not.

1305
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:09,880
Like now if I could use cellular data to like stream my steam stuff over, sell to my phone.

1306
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,880
But how garbage is that?

1307
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,960
I was like, yeah, that'd be terrible.

1308
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,700
Before y'all jump in there and chat going, that would look like shit, Rob.

1309
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,200
It's like, it's, that's kind of the joke.

1310
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,980
Like I know it's not going to look that great, but hey, you know what?

1311
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:29,080
I remember a time when this show started that we were on dial up friendly radio and look

1312
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,160
how far internet speeds have come in just that time.

1313
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,160
So you know what, there's going to come a time when cellular speeds, they're almost

1314
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,160
stable.

1315
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,160
I know, right?

1316
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,600
Hey, you remember the Vita?

1317
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,720
Remember how the Vita had a three G version?

1318
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,720
Yeah.

1319
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:46,440
Remember how you can remember then the coin, the phrase asynchronous multiplayer.

1320
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,440
Yeah.

1321
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,440
Yeah.

1322
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:54,120
I'm trying to think of one Vita game that let me play over the three G connection coming

1323
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,120
up short.

1324
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,040
Just it just didn't work so well anyway.

1325
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,040
There you go.

1326
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,000
Well anyway, if you have an Android device, uh, you could check out the steam app if,

1327
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,800
if you think it's something you'd benefit from.

1328
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,160
I mean, I don't know, again, I'm not going to be sitting there playing portal two on

1329
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,160
my tablet.

1330
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,120
Pretty much any multiplayer game you play over three G is going to be asynchronous multiplayer.

1331
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:20,160
If I played more of those visual novel games, like, um, dream daddy, dream daddy, I could

1332
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,160
play from the comfort of my bed or I guess, I guess I'm going to be playing in my bed.

1333
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,560
I'd have to be playing something a little more like coming out on top or something a

1334
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,480
little more like a, you know, top shelf, if you know what I'm saying.

1335
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,480
All right.

1336
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:38,120
It clearly is going to have to be genital jousting.

1337
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,320
I was going to say, what about the bottom shelf?

1338
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,080
Maybe that's what Apple's issue was with some of those adult games.

1339
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:50,840
No, because Apple is just being petty because they want a piece of that money.

1340
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,760
He could be a company has a right to stop anything that's going to be any type of competition

1341
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,240
with services that they already offer.

1342
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,760
It's not, Microsoft has done it before in the past.

1343
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,980
We've seen other companies do the same things.

1344
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,980
It's really business.

1345
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:09,920
This is going to give ammunition to the anti Apple crowd and they're all idiots.

1346
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,240
I think people are free to make whatever choice they want, even if it's the wrong one.

1347
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,520
I think that's objective.

1348
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,320
And I think, I think you, I think you know better than that because like there's more

1349
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,720
than one opinion.

1350
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,480
So anyone who hates anything just on principle alone is an idiot.

1351
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,320
Well, but when they ban certain things from things, that's, that's what it is.

1352
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:35,560
If someone's going to hate something, they're going to already hate it.

1353
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,080
There's no adding fuel to something that already exists.

1354
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,640
All right, let's move on.

1355
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,640
Let's change topics.

1356
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,760
I think you actually have the next story, Dark Sakura.

1357
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,960
I do.

1358
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,560
Um, so you know, e gaming is a thing.

1359
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:53,160
It's been, uh, e-sports has been big and bigger and growing and growing.

1360
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:58,360
So now the Special Olympics USA is going to host a video game tournament.

1361
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:04,040
Um, e-sports will definitely be a thing in, uh, the 2018 Special Olympics starting on

1362
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,040
July 2nd.

1363
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:11,100
Um, they're partnering with, uh, the Xbox division for, uh, the tournament.

1364
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:15,840
And so there will be teams that are competing in rounds of Forza, motor sports seven.

1365
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,560
Um, there will be, uh, the, the competitors have already been chosen.

1366
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,280
There were eight qualifier events that took place at different Microsoft stores.

1367
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:30,280
Um, speaking of biting on to things that other companies have done, um, and, uh, having,

1368
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:36,560
uh, eight different, uh, teams that will consist of one athlete, um, with, and one without

1369
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,000
an intellectual disability.

1370
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,080
So there'll be in teams, um, and basically they're, they're like, you know, since so

1371
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:49,740
many of their special athletes are avid gamers, this gives them the ability to have another

1372
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,260
form to compete in.

1373
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,900
So this website with the story has an autoplay videos.

1374
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,460
No, I can't read the story while you're talking about it.

1375
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,460
Sorry about that.

1376
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,180
Well, I, I think it's cool.

1377
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,180
Yeah.

1378
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:04,740
No, it's really cool to see, you know, we've kind of wondered more and more when the Olympics

1379
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:08,660
we're going to acknowledge, you know, video gaming as, you know, something that is a part

1380
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,660
of it.

1381
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:14,700
And the Special Olympics are the Olympics, you know, so, um, actually no, actually no,

1382
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,340
they are Paralympics is the Olympics, right?

1383
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,820
Special Olympics is a separate organization, but even so, the fact that they recognize

1384
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:28,140
this as yet another forum, you know, and I think that it's great that the teams are going

1385
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:33,260
to be, you know, one with an intellectual disability versus one with, you know, with

1386
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:37,220
a team of people with both levels of disability.

1387
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,500
And I think it's going to be pretty amazing.

1388
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,740
I'm glad that they're doing it and hopefully they'll catch on more and more.

1389
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:49,340
They'll maybe have more, like maybe just a special, you know, X games or something.

1390
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,180
Not X games, but you know what I mean?

1391
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,180
Sure.

1392
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,420
Um, you know, and it's, we've had a lot of great stories in the past couple of weeks

1393
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:58,180
about, you know, more and more accessibility for, uh, gamers.

1394
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:02,280
Just last week we had the story about the Xbox controller that is designed with the,

1395
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,220
you know, different able people in mind.

1396
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,220
So I think that's really cool.

1397
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,220
So, all right.

1398
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,860
Um, let's move on.

1399
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:08,860
Loki.

1400
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,860
All right.

1401
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:15,780
So we talked a little bit last week how Valve was kind of coming down on some of these visual

1402
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,840
novel developers saying that their games are too risky or whatever, and then they kind

1403
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,460
of walked it back a little bit.

1404
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:28,180
Well, you know, just to be on the safe side, um, good old games is actually finding, um,

1405
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,160
a lot of these publishers coming over their way.

1406
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:37,580
So um, you know, with that being that, you know, good old games isn't necessarily cracking

1407
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:42,900
down on the content like that Steam is, they basically put it, you know, this opportunity

1408
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,860
couldn't have come at a better time.

1409
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:50,580
Um, we've been speaking with GOG prior to the recent events about adding visual novels

1410
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:56,020
as a genre to their retail platform, and with Valve now threatening the livelihoods of visual

1411
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:02,000
novel developers everywhere, it's a huge relief to see GOG opening their doors to these games.

1412
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,680
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at bognetwork.com,

1413
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,560
use the passphrase, dungeon.

1414
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,560
So that's pretty awesome.

1415
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:19,280
And then Steam has now proven that it's growing unreliable, or it's growing unreliable for

1416
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,360
small and independent developers.

1417
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:27,120
So we are very grateful to have the next biggest retailer in the PC market welcoming visual

1418
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,240
novels with open arms and an eye for quality.

1419
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:34,160
Okay, but you know, there's that like petty part of me that's like, oh, so this is about

1420
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,240
how good old games is willing to take the gaming garbage that Steam doesn't want to

1421
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,240
have.

1422
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,800
But I wouldn't necessarily call it garbage, though, like these games, it's not necessarily

1423
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,600
that it's garbage is a harsh word.

1424
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,600
I'm sorry.

1425
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,600
Because let's be honest, like, Steam does have a lot of actual like, it would be considered

1426
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,840
like shovelware bullshit, right?

1427
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,400
That's where I was going to tie it together, but yes, okay.

1428
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:02,240
So like, I have a problem with steam, saying, Oh, yeah, we want to curate this.

1429
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:08,280
But not this other thing, this huge mile, like, pile of bullshit behind us, we're gonna

1430
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,520
focus on this piece of it.

1431
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:15,600
But like all these other games that don't even function properly.

1432
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,720
Fuck that, you know, that's my problem.

1433
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,700
It's like either gonna, you know, you're there to curate all of this or you're not are these

1434
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,640
visual novels with titties?

1435
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,640
Like is that because this plays into something that came up with steam last week, about how

1436
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,480
they're cracking down on anime titties, um, some of them know that necessarily and to

1437
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:38,600
be honest, like a lot of the ones that are released on Steam are censored.

1438
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,080
But you can get an uncensored patch like through the developers website and play it like however

1439
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,080
you want it.

1440
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:49,320
But I don't I think that they're well aware if that was the issue that they build a sensor

1441
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,780
this stuff, you know, for that marketplace, but I don't think that's the issue here.

1442
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:58,500
It's they're just like, oh, well, all visual novels are the blame, you know, we're just

1443
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,420
gonna blame all of them instead of actually visual novels are to blame for most of gaming's

1444
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,420
problems.

1445
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,220
Just I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1446
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,220
So I don't know.

1447
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,420
I mean, whatever.

1448
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,420
You know what?

1449
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,420
Who cares?

1450
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:13,900
Like, I don't see the problem with it.

1451
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:21,780
If that's something that you want to purchase, cool, but as long as it functions as a game,

1452
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,780
then that's fine.

1453
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:27,180
Like these things that literally like they don't have the executable for the game in

1454
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:31,820
the download, you know, come on, maybe maybe you should pay attention to that shit and

1455
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:36,040
fix that part, because that's what's making discoverability so hard is all this crap that's

1456
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,040
on there.

1457
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,660
Not, oh, hey, there's tons of visual novels.

1458
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:42,340
But to be fair, there are a lot of visual novels that appear in the front page as well.

1459
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,660
You know, and people do tend to kind of stay within one ecosystem.

1460
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:50,020
I mean, I'm sure there's some that own a few games on Steam, a few games on GOG, a few

1461
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,340
games on HIO, you know, and the different stuff that's out there.

1462
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:56,640
But I think there's probably a lot of people that kind of tend to stay within one ecosystem.

1463
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,940
So if GOG sees this opportunity to lure a fandom with visual novels, then, you know,

1464
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:06,620
if they kind of get in the GOG universe, which GOG is a fine platform, you know, it has a

1465
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:11,620
lot of the same things that, you know, Steam offers and some different stuff, too, especially

1466
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:15,860
when it comes to the classic games, but, you know, they can kind of get people in their

1467
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:19,020
ecosystem and then maybe the games that they want to buy that aren't just visual novels,

1468
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,780
they're going to stick with GOG and it kind of gets more people there to compete with

1469
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,260
Steam maybe a little more.

1470
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,260
Yeah.

1471
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,260
Yeah.

1472
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,260
Interesting.

1473
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,260
Anyway.

1474
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,260
All right.

1475
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,220
Well, let's move on and talk about programming your own game.

1476
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,940
Maybe you want to write your own visual novel game.

1477
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:39,160
Well, you soon can do that on the Nintendo Switch, thanks to an app called PucciCon Smile

1478
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,820
Basic.

1479
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,820
This is a coding app.

1480
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:46,580
It was actually on the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U, although I must confess, I'd never

1481
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,620
heard of it.

1482
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:52,180
But Smile Basic was also known as Petite Computer, I think was another name for this software.

1483
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,700
That I think was on the 3DS maybe?

1484
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,700
It was.

1485
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,020
It was on the 3DS and the Wii U.

1486
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:59,580
It allows you to make games by coding in basic.

1487
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:05,100
So you know, your whole Commodore 64 programming knowledge, your Apple IIe programming and

1488
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,900
all that can come back.

1489
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,340
So here, I'm going to write a sample program in basic.

1490
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,340
Here we go.

1491
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,340
Ready?

1492
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:16,700
10, print, quote, OLR rules, end quote, enter.

1493
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,340
20, go to 10, run.

1494
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,340
There you go.

1495
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,500
I wrote a basic program live on air.

1496
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,020
And that's the type of thing you can actually...

1497
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,300
Yeah, they have Smile Basic for the 3DS available now for 10 bucks.

1498
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,000
Yeah, so this is something that's going to be coming to the Switch.

1499
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,540
So it's not just stuff you can do portable, but you can also have things you can do on

1500
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:37,620
the TV.

1501
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:42,360
No word yet if you are able to transfer the save files.

1502
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,060
Because I would think like, well, what if I write a really awesome program?

1503
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,860
What if I want to send that to a friend?

1504
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:51,940
Or is it going to have to be like the old school days where you're going to have to

1505
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,460
type it out of the back of a magazine?

1506
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:58,820
Because maybe that's going to be your only option for a petite computer.

1507
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:59,820
Who knows?

1508
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:00,820
So...

1509
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:01,820
All right.

1510
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,060
Anyway, I'm looking forward to that.

1511
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,060
I think that's really cool.

1512
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:08,460
I had no idea that was the thing on 3DS and Wii U, but I know a lot of us missed some

1513
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,460
Wii U stuff.

1514
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,780
So it's all getting a second chance over on the Switch.

1515
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,420
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to the classic game in a few stories?

1516
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,700
I have a thingy.

1517
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,700
Not that kind of thingy.

1518
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,700
Do you?

1519
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,700
All right.

1520
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,700
It's a personal thing.

1521
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:27,300
Basically, there is a company that's receiving some backlash.

1522
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:33,960
And honestly, I kind of think that it's well-deserved backlash because they are doing a game called

1523
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,340
Active Shooter that takes place during a school shooting.

1524
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,280
You play as either the SWAT team or as an active shooter in a school setting with potential

1525
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,700
to play as a civilian as well.

1526
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:52,500
You know, I can see where people right now are like, this is not something I'd like to

1527
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,500
be playing.

1528
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,500
I had one.

1529
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,500
Okay.

1530
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
I'm sorry.

1531
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,500
I'm just saying.

1532
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,540
The company putting it out is called Revived Games.

1533
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:06,940
And basically, they put a disclaimer on there saying that it is just a simulation, not to

1534
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,660
be taken seriously.

1535
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:12,540
If you feel that you might hurt people, call 911, blah, blah, blah.

1536
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:17,060
But the thing is, and what Allison says, it doesn't promote any sort of violence.

1537
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,440
The thing is that with the game coming out when we have had, what is it, like 19 school

1538
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,420
shootings to date?

1539
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:29,240
And how many just, like there was that story about the four-year-old that shot his two-year-old

1540
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:33,580
brother because he thought it was a fucking toy gun because his idiot asshole parents

1541
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:37,460
didn't put their damn gun with the safety on and a fucking gun locker.

1542
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,460
Sorry, I'm a little pissed off by that.

1543
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:45,060
And you have historically on the show been a little bit of a, well, like you've said

1544
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,380
you want a gun.

1545
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,380
You've said that here on the show.

1546
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,380
I was not at all anti-gun.

1547
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,380
Right.

1548
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,140
As long as you're fucking responsible with it.

1549
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,340
Yes.

1550
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:57,960
But I don't believe anyone needs a fucking assault weapon.

1551
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:03,720
I don't think that anyone needs any semi-automatic or fully automatic weapons at all.

1552
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:07,840
There's only one purpose for a military gun and that is to kill a human.

1553
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,200
You don't need it to go hunting.

1554
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,360
You will destroy that deer and the meat will be shitty.

1555
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,840
What if I can't aim very well and you know, any quantity over quality.

1556
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,840
Take up a new hobby.

1557
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,480
Then you know what the fuck they should do is that they should make sure that anyone

1558
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,480
who buys a gun goes through fucking training.

1559
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,320
Like when you buy a car.

1560
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:30,520
You could run over a shitload of people with a car, but no, we are required to be licensed

1561
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,600
drivers who have gone through a year at least of training for it.

1562
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,880
If you drive drunk, they take that right away.

1563
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:36,880
Precisely.

1564
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,760
Guns should have the same, you know, thing on it.

1565
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:44,680
Anyway, not to, not to get too far from the story, but, but anyway, but to do a game like

1566
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:52,200
this when this is such a big problem right now is highly insensitive at the best.

1567
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:59,280
It's insensitive and you know, and it's in steam's, um, uh, PMP not to release any game

1568
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:06,880
with the, um, uh, purpose to, to, you know, gain attention by shock value, which is kind

1569
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,880
of what this is.

1570
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:11,440
But you know, you know, the whole, like my perspective is that video games are art, right?

1571
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,440
Art is commentary.

1572
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,440
Shit isn't art.

1573
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,680
It's a bad game.

1574
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,680
I let you finish.

1575
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,880
Can I finish?

1576
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,300
So my whole thing is I'm not saying I'm not defending the game by any means, but could

1577
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:28,340
this be that somebody feels the need to put this out there because we've become so desensitized

1578
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:30,900
to what's happening in the culture.

1579
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:35,340
Like, you know, all these shootings have happened, you know, ever since Sandy Hook, Vegas, all

1580
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,340
this stuff.

1581
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:38,740
And literally nothing has been done.

1582
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:39,740
Nothing.

1583
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,380
Thoughts and prayers ain't shit.

1584
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,020
Nothing has been done.

1585
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:47,240
And you know, no matter, no matter what your stance is on gun laws and all that stuff,

1586
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,160
my whole thing is that they haven't even tried anything.

1587
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,160
Nothing has been done.

1588
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,680
I thought everybody agreed on this whole bump stock thing.

1589
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,680
Nothing has been done.

1590
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,120
Bump stocks are nothing anyway.

1591
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,960
They're not legal in those states.

1592
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,960
Yeah.

1593
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:01,960
But nothing has been done.

1594
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:07,760
So in a way, like when I first heard about this, I was like, is this maybe like a commentary

1595
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,400
that like, well, since this is commonplace in our culture anyway, let's just make a game

1596
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,480
about it.

1597
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,800
You know, I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's shock value and all that.

1598
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,040
It's just, you know, doing it because it can, but you know, there is a part of me that says

1599
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,240
maybe there is maybe art is the wrong word.

1600
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,160
Maybe there is an expression in here, but there's nothing on their website talking about

1601
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,800
it being a political commentary.

1602
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,640
Well then if they were going to put in, I gave them too much credit, I guess if they

1603
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:40,080
were going to release this as some kind of commentary, then they should have made it

1604
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,880
very clear on their website.

1605
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:48,560
This is so that you can see what it's like to be in an active shooter situation when

1606
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,920
your life is in danger.

1607
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,920
This is so you can see what we accept as the norm in our society.

1608
01:16:54,920 --> 01:17:00,360
And if they were going to do it, it should only be from the civilian point of view.

1609
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,640
And it should be something with no control.

1610
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,280
You can't control anything in the game around you.

1611
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:10,240
Some people are going to be so, but I mean, at the same time, again, we have done nothing

1612
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,240
about it.

1613
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,080
And like, how are you going to, how are you going to wake, wake people the fuck up to

1614
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,160
do something about what's going on here?

1615
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,720
Wait till it's one of their kids.

1616
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:24,040
It's a congressman was shot at a baseball.

1617
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,040
Am I not?

1618
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,040
Nothing that happened.

1619
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,040
There was like a baseball thing.

1620
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,040
Yeah.

1621
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,040
Like a congressman got shot.

1622
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,160
Nothing has still been done.

1623
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,600
Or the lady, the congresswoman who was under an assassination attempt, Arizona lady.

1624
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,160
You know, the thing that the thing is is that, and honestly enough, it really is due to the

1625
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,160
NRA.

1626
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:47,520
The NRA was a tiny little organization in the 70s and started using the Second Amendment

1627
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:53,400
and warping the words there of to make, to grow themselves in popularity and money.

1628
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,440
And now they're as big as they are.

1629
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:00,280
And they have married this idea with guns and patriotism.

1630
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:06,640
And so it's why we have to even look at something stupid like this and go, wow, that's insensitive

1631
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,320
because we live in a country where people don't do jack shit unless someone's lining

1632
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,000
their pocket to do jack shit.

1633
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,160
Guys, you don't chat at live.voggenover.com says, nah, the game is trash and the devs

1634
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,160
are trash.

1635
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,600
A race leader says, can we just overthrow the government and just install dark soccer

1636
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,600
and Rob Roberts?

1637
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,360
You need to make sure that you say in writing that that was a joke.

1638
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,280
I didn't hear my name in there.

1639
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,280
Yeah.

1640
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,280
Do put, that was a joke.

1641
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,640
You'll be secretary of state.

1642
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,760
Also, you have to want the job and no thanks.

1643
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:39,920
No, I don't want to lead this shit hole unless I'm like Khaleesi because seriously, if I

1644
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,120
had my way, if I had my way, and again, this is probably never going to happen and I'm

1645
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,600
not actively seeking it.

1646
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,600
Commentary.

1647
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,600
This is commentary.

1648
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,600
This is commentary.

1649
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,720
Iceland had a revolution about two years ago.

1650
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:55,640
They overthrew their own government and rewrote their fucking government.

1651
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,240
America's too fucking big to do this peacefully.

1652
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,240
They did it peacefully on top of that.

1653
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,640
And I think that's important to say, yes.

1654
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:06,920
And in their entire, I think like last 50 years, there've been one police shooting of

1655
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:14,360
any one and it was an active gunman situation and the cop was traumatic, traumatized by

1656
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,360
it.

1657
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:24,800
So I'm saying that America really is too big to govern, but nobody wants to do anything

1658
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,280
differently because as long as they're comfortable and people have their distractions, fucking

1659
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,500
go read 1984 and read Brave New World.

1660
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,360
Both of these things were foretold.

1661
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,760
Also commentary of its time.

1662
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:37,760
Yeah.

1663
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,760
Yeah.

1664
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,760
So.

1665
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,760
All right.

1666
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,760
Anyway, tricky subject.

1667
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,760
I know.

1668
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:47,080
But you know, that's again, I think that's kind of where people, whether it be for shock

1669
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,320
value because they're trash, because they're, they think it's art, whatever it is, you know,

1670
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:56,880
I think that's where I'd be the queen and have a parliament or yes, I would, I would

1671
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,880
be queen.

1672
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:58,880
Liz seems to be doing okay.

1673
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,880
Huh?

1674
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,880
Liz seems to be doing okay.

1675
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,880
Right.

1676
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,880
You know, her last corgi died.

1677
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:03,880
Oh, that's.

1678
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Well, she was breeding them all from her very first corgi, um, but she didn't want anyone

1679
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,160
but her to handle her own corgis.

1680
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,880
And so she let the last one die out.

1681
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,880
All right.

1682
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,640
Anyway, we got to move on just a couple more stories for you guys.

1683
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,560
And then the classic game, we'll go back to simpler times of the classic game of the week,

1684
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,560
but first Loki.

1685
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,920
All right.

1686
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:27,160
So, um, there's a new switch bundle that's available in Japan.

1687
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,320
Now what makes us different is it's cheaper.

1688
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,960
It's only 26,978 yen or about $246.

1689
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,920
But it's missing a few things.

1690
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,580
So what it's missing is of course, uh, the dock.

1691
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:52,520
It's missing the power supply and I believe, oh, and then of course the, uh, joy con grip

1692
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:58,540
that you would plug everything together and apparently, um, an HDMI cable.

1693
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,880
So it doesn't include any of those.

1694
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,900
The um, so what it does come with is the switch console.

1695
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:08,540
You get two joy cons and then the little, uh, straps that go with it.

1696
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:14,180
So there's no way to charge this thing unless you buy a USB three charger and there's definitely

1697
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:17,280
no way to dock it cause you're in need of dock.

1698
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:23,380
What I don't get though about this whole thing is the standard set actually is only 32,378

1699
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:25,160
yen or $295.

1700
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,960
So you really only saving about 50 bucks on it.

1701
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,480
But the costs to replace all the items that are missing are more than $50.

1702
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,680
So why the fuck would you do that?

1703
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,840
It seems like a really terrible idea.

1704
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,840
Yeah.

1705
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,360
I, I mean I can understand why they might want to put the options out there and so forth,

1706
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:46,880
especially when there's so much more like portable gaming in Japan, you know, because

1707
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,820
again, the Vita is actually still successful there gaming does so well, but yeah, I would,

1708
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:55,480
I would hope people might have like, I would think the only way like I could see this is

1709
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:00,500
if they did include an AC adapter and then it could be like, Oh, this is like for like

1710
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,500
your siblings.

1711
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,380
So you have one doc in the house, I would say multiple kids in the house that, you know,

1712
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:11,020
that way, you know, you can do that, but still it's nice to have the doc anyways to charge

1713
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,020
the thing.

1714
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:17,760
I mean, I, I, the doc really shouldn't cost $90 or whatever it is that ridiculous amount

1715
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,480
of money for this piece of plastic and tiny little bit of hardware.

1716
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,920
I just, I think it's stupid, but whatever.

1717
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,500
It's not over here, so I'm not worried about it, but it is kind of annoying that they didn't

1718
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:31,280
include like a lot of things that you kind of need at the very least.

1719
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,920
I think they should have put a power supply in there, but after all, they didn't do they

1720
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,480
sell three DS without power supply.

1721
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,960
Oh yeah, they still do.

1722
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:37,960
Yeah.

1723
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,280
Cause there's so many power supplies already out there and there's third party ones and

1724
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,280
all that stuff too.

1725
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:48,420
And if I'm not mistaken, uh, the, the switch just charges on USB-C it does so, but the

1726
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:52,880
charger that comes with though charges it much faster than like an average phone charger.

1727
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,680
And those charters are still pretty expensive and yeah, I get it.

1728
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,520
You have charters for your phones and stuff, but I don't know.

1729
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,360
It's just, it seems annoying.

1730
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:08,240
Just spend the extra money and then that we don't have to worry about missing this stuff,

1731
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,240
I guess.

1732
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:13,240
All right, well, uh, before we get into the classic game of the week this week and a game

1733
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,980
that actually happened, let's talk about a game that didn't happen.

1734
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:20,520
And it's, it's really sad because this would have been a sequel to final fantasy tactics,

1735
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,680
which I mean, God, so many people love that game and they've continued to make final fantasy

1736
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,360
tactics like what they had, the game boy advanced one.

1737
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,360
Right.

1738
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,040
And then they had, I think it's been on mobile at some point.

1739
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,640
Um, if you play final fantasy 14, there's like a whole quest line now where they actually

1740
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,800
have Ramza in it, you know, like they, they, or it's, I think it's, it's a descendant of

1741
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,800
the original Rams or something, but anyway, I don't know how it all plays together.

1742
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,800
That story.

1743
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,400
I just, I just liked the shiny things.

1744
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:49,280
But anyway, people love their fall fantasy tactics and it was, it was really such a,

1745
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,400
such a great game of the PlayStation one era.

1746
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,920
Um, so whatever, how, why didn't they just do like another final fantasy tactics advance?

1747
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,040
Well, they were going to, uh, director Yasumi Matsuno said that there was a full sequel

1748
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,400
plan for the original PlayStation and it was called final fantasy tactics two.

1749
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:10,420
Uh, this was a plan project and it even has assets and some of those assets have hit the

1750
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:14,200
internet this week and you can actually see, but unfortunately it didn't happen because

1751
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,480
they weren't sure if they should outsource the game, which happens a lot.

1752
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,120
I don't know if you guys know, but games get outsourced to other companies to do the art

1753
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,120
and things like that.

1754
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:27,280
Uh, or you know, if they should have kept it in house also, they were going from a swap

1755
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:33,320
from a 3d project to like a 2d hexagon thing that was going to be the big twist is that

1756
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,320
this was going to be a hexagon.

1757
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:39,160
It's kind of like when a sieve sieve five went to sieve six and then now it's on a hexagon

1758
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,600
grid or wait, was that sooner than that?

1759
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,080
I'm, Oh my God.

1760
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,080
It's been a long time.

1761
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,080
You guys.

1762
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,280
Sieve three to sieve four went from square to hexagon.

1763
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,760
But anyway, it changed a lot.

1764
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,960
Um, so the project did ultimately get canceled.

1765
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:54,960
Unfortunately.

1766
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:59,800
Um, don't know why square just didn't try to do something cause this game was so popular,

1767
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,080
but it's probably too late now.

1768
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,080
I don't know.

1769
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,080
Let me ask that before we get to the classic game of the week.

1770
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,920
Is it too late to do a final fantasy tactics?

1771
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:08,920
Nope.

1772
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:09,920
Never too late.

1773
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:15,040
I totally even, and you wouldn't call it just a, well, it's like Castlevania, but you know,

1774
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:21,200
you wouldn't call it, I didn't, I don't care for tactics games and I wouldn't mind a sequel.

1775
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,920
I mean, I'm not going to play it, but yeah, that's the thing.

1776
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,820
I don't play a lot of tactical games, but I'd play final fantasy tactics and it was

1777
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:32,200
something about the job classes in that game were so well done and maybe because it did

1778
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,480
have those ties to, you know, the classic final fantasy world and stuff.

1779
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,320
That's part of what made it really cool.

1780
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,320
I don't know.

1781
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,320
So, all right.

1782
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,920
Anyhow, well, let's take a trip down memory lane and check out a different classic game

1783
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:50,040
because every week on this show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game

1784
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:55,840
that she thinks, Hey, brats, you should be checking this shit out.

1785
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,160
Check it out or, or else it's the classic game of the week.

1786
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,840
Dark Sakura stepped into the gaming vault to find a game for you guys to play this week.

1787
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,840
Dark Sakura.

1788
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,480
I wonder if this is my first DS game.

1789
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,480
I'm not sure.

1790
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,480
Maybe not.

1791
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,480
It might.

1792
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,480
It very well might be.

1793
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:20,040
The World Ends With You, which came out in, uh, uh, July 27th, 2007.

1794
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:24,040
Well, I'll tell you what, it's a great first 3DS game if it is.

1795
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,200
In the US it came out in April, 2008.

1796
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:33,760
So here, 10 year old game, um, it is an action, uh, role play game, uh, with urban fantasy

1797
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,760
elements.

1798
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:38,160
It was done by Square Enix and Jupiter for the Nintendo DS.

1799
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:47,200
It is set in Shibuya, um, and it is, uh, an art style that's inspired by Shibuya and

1800
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,600
its, uh, local culture.

1801
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,360
And it was also inspired by another game that Jupiter developed, Kingdom Hearts Chain of

1802
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,360
Memories.

1803
01:26:54,360 --> 01:27:03,200
Um, you play as, uh, a character named Neku Sakuraba, um, and, uh, all of his friends,

1804
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:09,040
they are, though, forced to participate in a game that's going to decide their own fate.

1805
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:15,960
And it has, um, a very unique battle system that really uses the Nintendo DS to its best

1806
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:20,720
capability, including their combat that takes place on both of the screens, and certain

1807
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:24,160
attacks that are used with certain motions on the touch screen or by shouting into the

1808
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,160
microphone.

1809
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:30,800
Um, and of course, pop culture of, you know, of the day and age really play heavily into

1810
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,800
the game.

1811
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:39,000
Um, it has a great soundtrack, wonderful graphics, the gameplay is absolutely stunning, and of

1812
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:47,600
course, um, the, uh, it had its own manga development as well, um, by, uh, Ishido Amano,

1813
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,000
who was the, uh, writer and artist of the Kingdom Hearts manga.

1814
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Um, I think we're already getting somebody saying something in the chat room.

1815
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Oh, it's, uh, Raginator saying something that has nothing to do with the article.

1816
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,200
Um, anyway.

1817
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,200
Um, so...

1818
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,200
And I don't think I said that, anyway.

1819
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,200
Yeah.

1820
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,200
I got my values.

1821
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:16,600
Um, anyway, you have, um, like, uh, the real ground, which is normal life, and then you

1822
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,400
have the underground, which is the alternate plane of existence.

1823
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:28,720
Um, so the ones who are, are, I guess, the chosen dead go there and they play the Reaper's

1824
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:35,120
Game, so they offer up a treasured possession to the game, and then they can, uh, you know,

1825
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,520
basically play for it and can get brought back to life or transcend into a higher form

1826
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,520
of existence.

1827
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:45,520
If you go higher, you become a reaper who are the opponents in future games, so it just

1828
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,520
really goes through and through and through.

1829
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:53,120
Um, and of course, if you are in the underground, you are, uh, invisible to people in the real

1830
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,920
ground, vice versa.

1831
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,520
You send messages and you get your assignments through, like, your cell phone or you get

1832
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:08,120
something imprinted on your hand, and, um, it just is, it's kind of a really neat, surrealist

1833
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:11,320
kind of, you know, scenario in here.

1834
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:15,320
Um, but it was, it's a really, really neat game.

1835
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:21,320
Um, it has just a lot of elements to it, and it was, uh, I mean, basically for the, the

1836
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:25,020
game is an action roleplay game, it's divided into three chapters that are based on the

1837
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:31,220
three weeks that Neku is playing the Reaper's Game, um, and then each chapter is done by

1838
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:37,520
day of the week, so, uh, it's just a really, really compelling game, I think.

1839
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:44,720
Um, of course, you also, uh, can collect, uh, pins called psych pins that give you powers

1840
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,320
while you're wearing them, and they're used for, uh, combat and different abilities in

1841
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,320
combat.

1842
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:58,020
So, um, like I said, it was developed by, uh, um, the same team that made, um, the Kingdom

1843
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:02,920
Hearts series with input from Jupiter, the company that developed Kingdom Hearts Chain

1844
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:08,820
of Memories, and, uh, it's been, I think, a good solid two years in development, and

1845
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,820
they wanted it to be a game that could only be played on the DS, which, I mean, as you

1846
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:17,620
can see, for anyone who's played it, as you can see from the combat, yeah, it is specific

1847
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:18,620
to that.

1848
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,220
The soundtrack is really good.

1849
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:27,320
It was, uh, composed, uh, by, um, Takeharu Ishimoto, who, um, does music from across

1850
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:30,020
various, uh, disciplines.

1851
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:34,620
You've got rock, you have electronica, you've got hip-hop, it's just to fit the different,

1852
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:43,620
you know, types of moods of living in Shibuya, and then, um, uh, the song in the end credits,

1853
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:48,620
Lullaby For You, was done by, uh, a pop artist, uh, Jungri.

1854
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:54,620
Um, the different artists in there, there's, like, uh, really, there's just a bunch of,

1855
01:30:54,620 --> 01:31:00,620
you know, uh, artists that are too many for me to really name, um, and they also used,

1856
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:07,620
um, the, uh, Kyouseshu Soundstreamer for the compression, which is normally used for voice-overs,

1857
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:14,620
but it's to make the, the songs fit on the game media while still having full, you know,

1858
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:16,620
the full motion cutscenes and everything.

1859
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:20,620
Um, well, I mean, they replaced the full motion with, like, flash style animations, so it's

1860
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:24,620
supposed to have a high clarity and a really striking style.

1861
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:30,620
Um, there also was The World Ends With You solo remix that was released on iOS, um, in

1862
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:38,620
August 2012 and on Android on, uh, June 2014, and it's basically the same game, just, you

1863
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:41,620
know, modified the combat for single screen.

1864
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:47,620
Um, it also redid all the graphics in, uh, high-def sprites, and it's optimized to use

1865
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,620
the retina display on iOS devices.

1866
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:54,620
So, it was taken out for a short version because it stopped working with iOS 8, but now it

1867
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:57,620
is back in the App Store as of 2015.

1868
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:03,620
And then on the Switch, The World Ends With You final remix was announced in January 2018

1869
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:05,620
to be released this year.

1870
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:11,620
It is a Switch, uh, Switch release that allows you to use the Joy-Con in addition to a touchscreen,

1871
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,620
and it has new scenarios to be added into the game.

1872
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:18,620
Um, so, it got really, really great reviews.

1873
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:25,620
Um, the first shipment of the game sold out, and just was one of the, I'd say, best sellers

1874
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:28,620
for the DS, you know, when it came out.

1875
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:34,620
So, still widely loved, widely played, um, even ten years later.

1876
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,620
So, there's the game.

1877
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,620
The World Ends With You.

1878
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,620
Alright, great pick.

1879
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:41,620
Uh, it's one of those games that you kind of go, wait, this shit's ten years old?

1880
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,620
Oh my gosh.

1881
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,620
Eleven, well, eleven technically.

1882
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:46,620
Yeah, so there it is, your classic game of the week.

1883
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:49,620
The World Ends With You.

1884
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:54,620
Check that out on the DS or pretty soon on the Switch, or on the mobile devices as, uh,

1885
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,620
Dark Soccer just explained to you.

1886
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:58,620
So, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere.

1887
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:01,620
We've got plenty more OLR to come, including the rapid-fire news.

1888
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:06,620
Uh, maybe your emails, although we're having email bag problems, but we'll try to fix that.

1889
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:08,620
And then, uh, more news, including, ooh, Lego stuff.

1890
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:09,620
We'll get into that.

1891
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:14,620
So, uh, all that and more when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1892
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:23,620
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1893
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:30,620
Live tonight, episode number 732 of our show for this May 27th, 2018, already in progress.

1894
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:33,620
So, um, you know, it is Memorial Day weekend here in the States.

1895
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:39,620
Uh, a big, uh, thank you and, uh, um, memorial to, uh, those who have, uh, given the ultimate sacrifice

1896
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:45,620
so that, uh, we can continue to be free enough to do this show weeks on Sunday nights for you guys.

1897
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,620
So, let's not forget what the long weekend is about.

1898
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:52,620
Uh, also, I thought, uh, maybe we could take this opportunity to, uh, give you some updates on our privacy policy

1899
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,620
since that's all the rage right now. No, I'm just kidding. We do.

1900
01:33:54,620 --> 01:34:00,620
What privacy policy? We don't, I mean, you sign up for accounts at VOG, but we don't really...

1901
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:03,620
If you show us your pussies, we will post those pictures on the internet.

1902
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:05,620
What? You mean cats. You mean cats.

1903
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:06,620
Pussy cats.

1904
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:09,620
She says that because she had Mr. Smoosh in her lap just a minute ago.

1905
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:11,620
Did you get some pictures of Mr. Smoosh?

1906
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:12,620
No, he got Wrigley.

1907
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:16,620
Ah, yeah, he did. Sometimes he doesn't like to be, you know, that whole constricted thing, so.

1908
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:17,620
But he likes...

1909
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:18,620
And he did give me snuggles.

1910
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:20,620
He likes you and I told you why he likes women.

1911
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:21,620
Because boobs.

1912
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,620
Because boobs. He's like, he's a ladies man.

1913
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:26,620
Okay, so, get this conversation I had with my mom.

1914
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,620
Okay.

1915
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,620
She's like, how much weight you lose? I said, 87 pounds.

1916
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:35,620
She's like, you lose any boob? No.

1917
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:36,620
Just one boob.

1918
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:41,620
Well, no, because a lot of times when women lose weight, they also lose boob size.

1919
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:42,620
Sure. Sure.

1920
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:48,620
I was like, no, I still have my shelf and the cats aren't complaining, so I was thinking of Mr. Smoosh.

1921
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:53,620
And she's like, I don't even know what that means, but I'm mad.

1922
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:54,620
So, whatever.

1923
01:34:54,620 --> 01:35:00,620
Well, at least she didn't say, I can see your dirty pillows.

1924
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:01,620
That's a different reference.

1925
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,620
Yes, it is.

1926
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:05,620
They're all gonna laugh at you.

1927
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,620
They're breasts, mother.

1928
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:13,620
Anyway, I think that's my life goal is to star in a Carrie remake.

1929
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:16,620
Yes, as a high schooler. I would still be a high schooler.

1930
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:19,620
I actually see that second Carrie thing.

1931
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:22,620
Oh, the one with Julia Moore?

1932
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,620
It was actually not too terrible.

1933
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:28,620
But then I saw the one that they were going to spin off into a Carrie TV series.

1934
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:31,620
Oh, wasn't there a Carrie musical too?

1935
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:37,620
I don't know, but I watched the one that was like the TV version and it actually was pretty good.

1936
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:40,620
And I kind of dug the ending to it. I would have watched a series based on that.

1937
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,620
And then there was Drew Carey.

1938
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:45,620
No, that's different.

1939
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:47,620
You know what I would like?

1940
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:51,620
A sequel to Firestarter with Drew Barrymore now all grown up.

1941
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,620
Wouldn't that be some shit?

1942
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:54,620
Careful what you wish for.

1943
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:57,620
I mean, reinventions of shit from the past is like all the rage.

1944
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:04,620
I can't believe Charmed is coming back and it's not like it's not Shannon Doherty or any of those people.

1945
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:09,620
Well, I mean, that's cool for diversity and all, but like Charmed hasn't been gone that long.

1946
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:11,620
Well, they're also bringing back Sabrina.

1947
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:18,620
But if I watch the new Sabrina, I haven't watched any of Riverdale, but I might have how many seasons is it?

1948
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,620
Just two now.

1949
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,620
I could probably catch up to that.

1950
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:24,620
But I'm also like behind three seasons on Supernatural.

1951
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,620
Can we less funny and more serious now or?

1952
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,620
Oh, yeah, it's not going to be like that.

1953
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,620
I don't mind because I would.

1954
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:35,620
Well, and there's now the way we're daughters is coming out the spinoff of Supernatural,

1955
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:39,620
which makes me mad because I would have wanted to spin off with Joe and her mama.

1956
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:41,620
But no, they had to kill them.

1957
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:44,620
Well, I imagine they got to be looking at ending Supernatural.

1958
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,620
I mean, that's just been on over 10 years, hasn't it?

1959
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:48,620
They're on season 11, I think just finished.

1960
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:52,620
See, I think I mean, I don't know. Law and Order went for 20.

1961
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:55,620
But I mean, I guess Supernatural has its fan base.

1962
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:57,620
Jared's still pretty and so is his wife.

1963
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:00,620
That's like the couple I have a crush, a couple crush on.

1964
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:03,620
Oh, 13 just finished.

1965
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:07,620
13 just finished. Oh, my God. They're saying season 13, a Supernatural just finished.

1966
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:09,620
You want to know what's funny thing about Supernatural?

1967
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:11,620
It was supposed to end after the fifth season.

1968
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:14,620
The original writer wrote through five seasons.

1969
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:19,620
The story wrapped up in season five, which is why season six was kind of weird.

1970
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:21,620
Wasn't that kind of like Buffy was kind of like.

1971
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:29,620
Yeah, well, I'm glad they ended Buffy after season seven, because even season seven was just kind of crap, except for the musical episode for the musical.

1972
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:33,620
Well, that and I finally got my Buffy Spike action and I was pretty happy.

1973
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:37,620
As that says, Supernatural is the only show that survived the WB.

1974
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:41,620
That's right. Oh, my God. No, America's Top Model is still going to.

1975
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:43,620
Oh, no, wait, was that UPN show?

1976
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:44,620
I don't know.

1977
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:46,620
But America's Top Model is still going.

1978
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:52,620
Tyra Banks is back as I'm waiting for the inevitable because Top Model is now a VH1 show.

1979
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:56,620
And now it's crazy because Drag Race kind of started like that.

1980
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,620
America's Top Drag Race.

1981
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:00,620
Well, Drag Race started as like a spoof of Top Model.

1982
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:05,620
And now, in some ways, it's almost more in the pop culture lexicon than Top Model.

1983
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:11,620
So, you know, we did have Raja doing Miss Tyra herself.

1984
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:12,620
Smizing.

1985
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:14,620
That's right. Raja was on Top Model.

1986
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:17,620
No, she did Tyra Banks in Snatch Game.

1987
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:23,620
No, but she was also she was some type of like stylist or something advisor in the early seasons of Top Model.

1988
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:26,620
But still, she did Tyra and that made everything for her Snatch Game.

1989
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:28,620
Yeah, it did. It did. Anyway.

1990
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,620
All right. We got to move on.

1991
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:33,620
Got to get back to some video games and some rapid fire news.

1992
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:36,620
Quickly talking about some other things that have happened in the world of gaming.

1993
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:37,620
We'll start with you, Loki.

1994
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,620
Everything old is new again.

1995
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:43,620
And Killer7 is coming to Steam this fall.

1996
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:45,620
Yay.

1997
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:47,620
It'll be optimized for PC.

1998
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:49,620
Not much to optimize, though. It's pretty flat shaded.

1999
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,620
So, but it is a cool game.

2000
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,620
So looking forward to that.

2001
01:38:54,620 --> 01:39:00,620
And then along in the same lines, there's a new Leisure Suit Larry game coming out.

2002
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:04,620
That's right. Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams Don't Dry.

2003
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:07,620
It's been...

2004
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:11,620
They totally missed an opportunity for a play on that old movie with Robin Williams.

2005
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:14,620
The What Dreams May Come by calling it Wet Dreams May Come.

2006
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:15,620
Come on.

2007
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:16,620
No.

2008
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:17,620
Come on.

2009
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:22,620
It's supposed to be a parody of Dark Dreams Don't Die.

2010
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:26,620
So, it looks cool.

2011
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:33,620
I mean, it's a very, I don't know, it looks pretty.

2012
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:34,620
The artwork is great.

2013
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:35,620
Horrible.

2014
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:36,620
Yeah, the last one was horrible.

2015
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:38,620
This doesn't look like the last one.

2016
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,620
I mean, it's definitely more of like, it's got that...

2017
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:42,620
I'm assuming someone new has the license.

2018
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:43,620
Yes.

2019
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,620
Assemble Entertainment is the one that's putting it out.

2020
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:47,620
It's actually on Steam.

2021
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,620
That's how we kind of found out about it.

2022
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,620
They're going to do...

2023
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:55,620
It's going to be sold for 30 bucks and it's going to be coming out October 24th, I believe.

2024
01:39:57,620 --> 01:40:01,620
Yeah, so, you know, October 24th.

2025
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,620
Interesting.

2026
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:09,620
Yeah, I'm with Dungeon Buster in chat saying, after Magna Cum Laude, I'm surprised that anyone would do another one.

2027
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,620
This looks different though.

2028
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:15,620
It looks like an actual adventure game and the graphics are really good.

2029
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:17,620
I mean, it's a legendary franchise.

2030
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:18,620
It's worth trying again.

2031
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:20,620
And I know the last one was kind of just a remake of the first one.

2032
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:24,620
So this one, I think, is supposed to be just like its own, like, a brand new game.

2033
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,620
So it'd be interesting to see.

2034
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:29,620
Alright, anyway.

2035
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:33,620
Let's move on to some other stories talking about 20XDX.

2036
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:36,620
One of my... That's what I call it. 20XX. Or 20XX, I guess.

2037
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,620
Anyway, 20XX...

2038
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:39,620
20XDX.

2039
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:40,620
I like 20XDX.

2040
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:43,620
20XX is going to be coming to the Nintendo Switch.

2041
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,620
That's awesome.

2042
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:46,620
I'm surprised Capcom is going to let that happen.

2043
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:50,620
But 20XX is different enough from Mega Man where it'll be different.

2044
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:51,620
So that's really cool.

2045
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:54,620
It's going to be coming out on July 10th.

2046
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:56,620
So that's really not long.

2047
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,620
If you've never played 20XX...

2048
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:59,620
I've streamed this game a couple times.

2049
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:05,620
Once I did it myself and then once my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness and I were co-streaming it.

2050
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:06,620
It was a lot of fun.

2051
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:08,620
So maybe we'll have to do that again if Delvin's out there listening.

2052
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,620
But anyway, 20XX.

2053
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:13,620
It's like a roguelike, but it's mixed with Mega Man and it's really cool.

2054
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,620
And you can do, of course, full co-op.

2055
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:17,620
You can do that on the couch or online.

2056
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:23,620
So I guess you'll need Nintendo online service come September to be able to play 20XX online.

2057
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,620
So pretty cool.

2058
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:27,620
I will definitely probably double dip for 20XX.

2059
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:28,620
Would you like that?

2060
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:30,620
I will definitely probably double dip.

2061
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:33,620
Anyway, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.

2062
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:42,620
Even though we talked about that earlier, it should be noted that Europe on the Nintendo 3DS and worldwide on the Xbox One, a slight delay.

2063
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:46,620
The European 3DS release is now on May 31st.

2064
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:50,620
The Xbox One version worldwide on June 6th.

2065
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:54,620
And Inti Creates taking responsibility for that, saying the mistake's on us.

2066
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:58,620
We apologize to the fans affected by this from the bottom of our hearts.

2067
01:41:58,620 --> 01:42:02,620
And this is the first time we've ever done such a large-scale multi-platform, multi-region simultaneous release.

2068
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:09,620
And we were unable to properly take into account how much time would be required to get each platform's online store set up in each region.

2069
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,620
So they're doing a my bad on that.

2070
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:13,620
Inti Creates has been on fire lately.

2071
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:17,620
I mean, I know Mighty No. 9 was kind of, eh, but that Blaster Master game was fucking rad.

2072
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:20,620
This game, I'm sure, is going to do very well for them.

2073
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:24,620
So, you know, they're allowed a little mistake here and there where the game gets delayed.

2074
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:31,620
I did pick a Blaster Master this week, so I did pick a Blaster Master Zero with all the DLC, so I have yet to play that, though.

2075
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:32,620
Oh, you should. It's so fun.

2076
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,620
Anyway, I love that.

2077
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:37,620
Delvin just popped into the chat room. He must have been listening out there.

2078
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:39,620
Hey, we definitely need to do that stream again, Rob.

2079
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:41,620
Alright, you got it. It's a date.

2080
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:48,620
ActDef says, in other news, I did four legendary Pokémon raids and I didn't catch a single one, but I'm now level 37.

2081
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:53,620
I'm only, like, 100k XP into level 37, so you're right behind me, ActDef.

2082
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:57,620
And I also have tried to catch Latias and still have not caught Latias.

2083
01:42:57,620 --> 01:43:03,620
And I'm actually kind of pissed that Ho-Oh came back, because now people don't want to do Latias anymore.

2084
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:06,620
Because they're like, ooh, shiny Ho-Oh. That's the only one I want to spend my raid passes on.

2085
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:07,620
It's a little irritating.

2086
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:09,620
You don't need any shiny Ho-Ohs.

2087
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:13,620
I'm actually pretty impressed that they didn't change the name, because that just means Phoenix.

2088
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,620
No, no, no, not here.

2089
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:20,620
So, anyway, that's where I'm at with my Pokémon GO.

2090
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:22,620
Let's move on with some more stuff.

2091
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:26,620
Actually, I should mention this quickly, since Pokémon GO randomly got brought up.

2092
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:30,620
The Alolan stuff in Pokémon GO, that was something they announced was going to be happening.

2093
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:37,620
So, instead of Gen 4 or Gen 5, they're going to just fast-forward to Gen 7's Alolan Gen 1 forms.

2094
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:46,620
Which is the Exeggutor with the giant palm tree head, and the Persian that looks like Garfield.

2095
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:49,620
The purple Nyasu.

2096
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:53,620
Who looks like he's given someone some major side-eye.

2097
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:55,620
Some of them are really pretty, though.

2098
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:58,620
Like the Vulpix, that's like the snow Vulpix. Really pretty.

2099
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:01,620
I just want the new Exeggutor with the ridiculously tall neck.

2100
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,620
I can't wait to put that in a gym.

2101
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:08,620
I think it should sit on the ground next to the gym, and then the head comes up and pops up in the gym.

2102
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,620
I hate this stupid challenge where you have to do ten great throws, because I suck at them.

2103
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:13,620
Oh, yeah, those things make you get them.

2104
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:14,620
I've got like seven.

2105
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:18,620
Isn't there like one, because I have, I don't, I'm not that far progressed through,

2106
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:24,620
but to complete all of the Mythic ones, do you have to do, there's one that has an excellent throw or something like that?

2107
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:26,620
You have to get an excellent one.

2108
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:30,620
An excellent throw? No, it's, what you get from the Pokéstops is random.

2109
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:32,620
I need one more Oddish or Bellsprout.

2110
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:33,620
Oh, for the Mew.

2111
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:34,620
The Mew, yeah.

2112
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:38,620
For the Mew. You do have to do an excellent curveball in the last phase,

2113
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:42,620
but because you have to do something where you have to feed fifty berries to Pokémon,

2114
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:45,620
like not in gyms, you have to catch fifty berries.

2115
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:48,620
Like, you just keep trying to do the excellent curveball, and eventually you'll get it.

2116
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:52,620
It's really easy to do on giant Pokémon like Wailmer.

2117
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:55,620
I'm trying to think of what else has a gigantic hitbox.

2118
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:59,620
I've heard, uh, Taro, or Taurus or whatever, the...

2119
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:04,620
Mmm, they're okay. I'm trying, there's something really common that also has a giant fucking hitbox that's pretty easy.

2120
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:06,620
Wailmer is the one that comes to my mind.

2121
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:07,620
That's my one shiny.

2122
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:09,620
Oh really? I don't have a shiny Wailmer.

2123
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:11,620
I caught it at my desk at work.

2124
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:15,620
I mean, I was working and not playing Pokémon GO. I was on my break.

2125
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:18,620
Ponyta does have a big hitbox, as that in our chatroom says.

2126
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:19,620
That is one that you can do.

2127
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,620
I don't ever remember getting an excellent throw on anything, so...

2128
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,620
Just keep practicing and get it eventually.

2129
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:25,620
Never.

2130
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:30,620
I got an excellent curveball, like, I was just feeding the berry and doing it, and I got it on my second one.

2131
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:31,620
Actually, ironically, I think it was Ponyta.

2132
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:33,620
How are you supposed to get an excellent?

2133
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:37,620
When the dot is really tiny, you just try to hit the dot.

2134
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:39,620
Oh. That's it?

2135
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:40,620
Yeah.

2136
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:42,620
Because I usually just throw it when the thing's at its widest.

2137
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:46,620
That's nice. So gray is when it's like at half, and then excellent is when it's almost gone.

2138
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:49,620
I thought that's just how close to the center you get.

2139
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:51,620
I thought that that was like your...

2140
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:53,620
Oh, well, I've been doing it wrong this whole time.

2141
01:45:53,620 --> 01:46:01,620
I thought that was like your option of how to, like, how well, like, when you're doing bursting.

2142
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:04,620
You know, like, it would increase your percentage.

2143
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:06,620
That's what I was thinking it was, like, in Ingress.

2144
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:09,620
So if it was full out, then that was supposed to be, like, your better chance.

2145
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,620
I played Ingress today.

2146
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:13,620
We tried to do a big triangle that would cover the city.

2147
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:15,620
I need more stuff. I haven't wanted to play because I haven't...

2148
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,620
I forgot to farm at Disneyland, too.

2149
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,620
I got stuff. I need stuff.

2150
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:21,620
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

2151
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:22,620
I'm gonna take back work.

2152
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:27,620
Yeah, stay on that because there's a player on the other team there that is very annoying with that portal.

2153
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,620
I'll get him fired. I'm kidding.

2154
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,620
All right. Moving on.

2155
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,620
You've got some rap partners.

2156
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:34,620
Which, by the way, my new friend, Dana...

2157
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:38,620
I know. I know. She's the friend of me here locally. That's so funny.

2158
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:41,620
Yeah, she's involved in an organization I'm involved in.

2159
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:43,620
She still owes me a drink.

2160
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:46,620
Let her know that. I want to cash in on that drink. We need to all get a drink at some point.

2161
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,620
Add her on Facebook.

2162
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:51,620
I don't... I'm so... You know I'm, like, really little on Facebook, though.

2163
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:53,620
So? Do it anyway.

2164
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,620
So, I guess it's my turn, right?

2165
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,620
Yes, ma'am.

2166
01:46:56,620 --> 01:47:01,620
Okay, so there's a listing for Mega Man 11 on the PlayStation Store in Singapore.

2167
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:05,620
Oh, Singapore. Sorry, that is a...

2168
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:08,620
Great. And I forgot the name of the band.

2169
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:10,620
Shona Knife. Shona Knife song.

2170
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:19,620
Anyway, Capcom in their press release listed something about a double gear system that would allow you to boost Mega Man's speed and power for a

2171
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:23,620
quote, new twist on the satisfying gameplay the series is known for.

2172
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:28,620
So, we'll see what that is. Like, my brain's already going to kind of theories on this one.

2173
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:29,620
Is it just Mighty No. 9?

2174
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:37,620
I don't know. But would it be neat, like, if you had, like, a primary power as your weapon and a secondary power from another boss is, like...

2175
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:43,620
Oh, that's right. Eleven's the really nice looking one that they have coming out. That's right. I forgot all about that.

2176
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:53,620
But I would think, like, if you could equip, like, a second boss weapon and have that be, like, what powers, like, speed or, like, burst speed or ongoing running speed or something like that, that would be kind of cool.

2177
01:47:53,620 --> 01:48:00,620
Don't steal my ideas, Capcom. Unless it's the idea of actually putting out, like, more good games.

2178
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:11,620
And then we have another character in ranked mode for Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo for the 30th anniversary collection and that is Akuma, also known as Goki.

2179
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:24,620
And he's pretty much disallowed usually from Street Fighter tournaments, but he is in ranked battle now.

2180
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:30,620
So there you go. Everyone cry because everyone's going to do nothing but play Goki. So there you go.

2181
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:38,620
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some releases, some upcoming video games that you can soon find in your store, starting with the US. Loki.

2182
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:45,620
Yeah, lots of stuff coming out. So we've got a game called Agony, which is a survivor horror game coming on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2183
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:53,620
We have Fallen Legion, Rise to Glory, that's on the Switch. Harvest Moon, Light of Hope Special Edition on the Switch and PlayStation 4.

2184
01:48:53,620 --> 01:49:02,620
Ikaruga on the Switch. We have Legend of K anniversary on the Switch and now let's see some non-Switch games.

2185
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:09,620
Well, at least this one. Sega Genesis Classics, that's going to be on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2186
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:16,620
Then we have Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection on PC, the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2187
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:24,620
And a game that I originally read completely wrong in my head as Yoshi's Island Express, but it's Yoku's Island Express.

2188
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:31,620
And that's on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It'd just be weird if it was on non-Nintendo platforms.

2189
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:40,620
And then we have Full Metal Panic, Fight, Who Dares Win, that's on PlayStation 4.

2190
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:45,620
And Liar Princess and the Blind Prince on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

2191
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:47,620
That sounds like an odd couple.

2192
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:52,620
It's the worst TV sitcom ever.

2193
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:59,620
Yesterday's Origins on the Nintendo Switch and I believe that is it for this week.

2194
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:05,620
I like the way you said Ikaruga, by the way. You're very excited. I don't know why, but Jamie will get this in my brain.

2195
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:11,620
All I heard was Ivy Winters. Ikaruga.

2196
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:13,620
I have no idea what you're talking about.

2197
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:15,620
Oh, it's Drag Race.

2198
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:17,620
That's what makes it funny. That's what makes it funny.

2199
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:20,620
Ikaruga. That's what I'm going to say for now on.

2200
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:25,620
Oh, no, no. Just say it right. Ikaruga. It's a fun word.

2201
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:27,620
Ikaruga.

2202
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:33,620
It is fun to say, though, just as a word. Ikaruga. It's a fun word. Kind of like undulating is fun to say.

2203
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:39,620
Alright, some other fun things to say. Upcoming releases in Japan, including the same Full Metal Panic, Fight, Who Dares wins.

2204
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:41,620
That same game is out in Japan this week.

2205
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:44,620
BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle on PlayStation 4.

2206
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:49,620
There is some new keyboard coming out, because remember the PlayStation 4 will rock a USB keyboard.

2207
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:54,620
Also, Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 Plus.

2208
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:59,620
Liar Princess and the Blind Prince also getting its release in Japan.

2209
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:01,620
There's also a Famitsu Deluxe Pack.

2210
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:07,620
And that BlazBlue is in all these different crystal sets, t-shirt packs, you name it.

2211
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:13,620
Also in Japan this week on PlayStation 4, Shantae, you stay, half genie hero.

2212
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:14,620
I knew you were going to do that.

2213
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:16,620
How can you not, Shantae? Anyway.

2214
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:19,620
But has Shantae ever cosplayed as Shantae?

2215
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:24,620
Has Shantae ever played Ikaruga?

2216
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:27,620
Has Shantae sashayed away?

2217
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:31,620
I hate this show sometimes. Alright.

2218
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:33,620
That's okay, sometimes we hate ourselves.

2219
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:37,620
Anyway, I'm laughing so hard it's causing a coughing fit.

2220
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:41,620
Hey, there's also games coming out on the PlayStation Vita, because they still love the Vita in Japan.

2221
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:44,620
Including Liar Princess and the Blind Prince.

2222
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:48,620
Sweet Pool, so you can play Pocket Pool with your PlayStation Vita.

2223
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,620
I was thinking like it would be Gwenpool or something.

2224
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:56,620
I thought it was just like a thing like, you know, you just swipe left or right depending on whether you thought the pool was nice.

2225
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,620
Just a way to knock some balls around.

2226
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:03,620
And then Cafe Culere is the other game that's coming out in Japan this week.

2227
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:07,620
I don't know what they serve at Cafe Culere. I'm trying to see if it's a game that I recognize.

2228
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,620
They serve fish, Rob.

2229
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:10,620
They serve anime school girls.

2230
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:13,620
Anime school boys that are kind of androgynous.

2231
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:16,620
Okay, androgynous anime school children.

2232
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:20,620
So what's the opposite of serving fish?

2233
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:27,620
Fujishiro Mao is a second year high school student who loves sweets and wants to be a patissiere chef.

2234
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:28,620
Is that like a pastry?

2235
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:29,620
Patissiere.

2236
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:30,620
Is that pastry?

2237
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:31,620
It's pastry chef.

2238
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,620
That's what I thought, pastry chef.

2239
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:38,620
So anyway, God, this sounds complicated. Basically, like the love of the life is returning, blah, blah, blah.

2240
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:40,620
There's a twin involved and good Lord.

2241
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:42,620
It's a soap opera.

2242
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:45,620
It's Cafe Drama for those of you that love Cafe Drama.

2243
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:50,620
Oh my God, that almost is like the book I'm reading right now, which is not very well written, but kind of entertaining.

2244
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:57,620
It's called Drag Queen about a gay lawyer who finds out he was adopted and meets his drag queen twin brother.

2245
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:01,620
And lastly, on the Nintendo Switch this week, Blaze Blue is also out on the Switch.

2246
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:05,620
And that liar princess and the blind prince also on the Switch.

2247
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:09,620
Okay, MXC in chat says Sweet Pool is a boys love slash horror game.

2248
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:13,620
What? Hold on, now I got to look that I just assumed it was a pool scene.

2249
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,620
Oh, no, this is this is wow.

2250
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:20,620
He's this is not that is not a that there there will be some balls around in this.

2251
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,620
I'll play this one.

2252
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,620
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

2253
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:30,620
What is this where the dude is like erotically like grabbing the fence going like, is there a problem?

2254
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:35,620
I don't know about you, but whenever I stand next to a chain link, I guess I have to have to.

2255
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:41,620
You have to just you just thread your two fingers through the chain and just being like, I'm just this is my natural pose.

2256
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:45,620
You have to be like Kelly Bundy in a music video.

2257
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:48,620
If you're if you're listening on the podcast and this makes no sense to you, you need to look this up.

2258
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:52,620
Sweet Pool, which I assumed was a pool game.

2259
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:56,620
I assumed it was like an anime chibi chick like pool game.

2260
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:59,620
Rob, this is Japanese releases.

2261
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:03,620
Apparently, Yogi's missed a semester of school due to his poor health.

2262
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:08,620
But now that he's back, he can't help but notice classmate Tetsuya's piercing gaze.

2263
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:13,620
The boy's hard to read expressions and seeming lack of emotions give Yogi the creeps.

2264
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:19,620
Yet when Tetsuya suddenly touches his neck, feelings of unbridled lust well up inside of him.

2265
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:22,620
What the fuck does Japan get these games and we don't?

2266
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:27,620
I think piercing gaze should be like a name of like a visual novel series.

2267
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:34,620
I had no idea there was like subtle like I'm going to lend you some of my yaoi anime, OK?

2268
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:39,620
Oh, my God. You need to see. I feel like I'm 40 and there's still so much of the world I haven't seen.

2269
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:42,620
Ronma is so disappointed in you right now. Apparently.

2270
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:47,620
Rob, you need to see where the corncob vibrator came from.

2271
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:50,620
That's all corncob vibrator. It's a thing.

2272
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:52,620
And it came from an anime.

2273
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:57,620
MXC says Sweet Pool is getting released officially in English on PC.

2274
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:02,620
Vita version, probably not. Well, I'm assuming this is going to be on GOG.

2275
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:05,620
You know what? I think I think.

2276
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:08,620
Why don't I live? If I could live stream that, I freaking would.

2277
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:13,620
Because this is even better. There's a trailer.

2278
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:17,620
It's so mysterious. You play that, Madeline.

2279
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:24,620
Tell me what this is about. Don't show me the logo.

2280
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:27,620
Fast forward through.

2281
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:31,620
I'm adding this amazing list right now. Seventy five bucks. Game of the week.

2282
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:35,620
Sweet pool. All right. He was eating an ice cream pop.

2283
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:39,620
All right. Well, you know what? If sweet pool is not your thing, I'll play it.

2284
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:45,620
Don't worry, because coming in June, love, love, which I always read as muff love.

2285
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:50,620
It's coming out here, too. I was going to mention that, but I was going to wait till June.

2286
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:56,620
All right. So if this is not your thing, muff love is next month.

2287
01:55:56,620 --> 01:56:02,620
All right. Moving on. How about the UK dark soccer? You have to take your eyes off that sweet pool for a minute.

2288
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:07,620
Well, no, I was actually checking something else out on May twenty ninth.

2289
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:14,620
We have Elboy for Switch and PlayStation agony for PlayStation and Xbox.

2290
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:18,620
Also on the twenty ninth on the thirty first The Legend of K anniversary edition for Switch.

2291
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:27,620
We have tennis world tour on June 1st and yesterday origins also on June 1st for Switch.

2292
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:32,620
All right. Now, usually at this point in the show, we would get into the mailbag,

2293
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:36,620
but we're having some server problems behind the scenes. So Jamie can't get in there tonight.

2294
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:43,620
So we'll work on that and be back in there next week. Although I did peak and there was only one email in there from Robert M.

2295
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:46,620
And we love hearing from him because we heard from him last week.

2296
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:51,620
But it's one of those timeless questions that can be asked next week. So we'll we'll just roll that over to next week.

2297
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:56,620
Sorry, Robert M. But what a tease, right? Gonna make you make wait one more week.

2298
01:56:56,620 --> 01:57:02,620
But blame these weird server problems we're having. But at the same time, our server space is graciously donated.

2299
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:06,620
So you know what? Beggars can't be choosers. So once in a while, we just have to forego the mailbag.

2300
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:14,620
You can still put emails in there for next time. And that's participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2301
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:21,620
All right. Meanwhile, we've got some more news stories to cover before we get to the Skype line, which will be opened up at Orange Lounge Radio.

2302
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:24,620
All one word. Loki, start us off.

2303
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:31,620
All right. So, you know, of course, there's the whole hacking of these Switch consoles because there's no way to prevent it.

2304
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:47,620
But apparently one person that was, you know, a big part of the homebrew community for the Nintendo Switch, Shiny Quagsire, has been banned from using the Switch online.

2305
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:53,620
And basically got an error code saying the use of online services on this console is currently restricted by Nintendo.

2306
01:57:53,620 --> 01:58:01,620
Please contact customer service. And but it was weird, though, because his Switch is not hacked.

2307
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:08,620
And so he got that. And basically, you know, he did, you know, reach out to Nintendo.

2308
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:12,620
So thank you for patiently waiting for play on your situation.

2309
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:18,620
Unfortunately, given that the information you provided will be unable to cancel your ban on your system.

2310
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:30,620
Thank you, Nintendo, for doing that, because, well, I mean, that's a risk you take when you, you know, mess around with those systems.

2311
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:36,620
I don't know. That's I mean, was it necessary? Maybe not. But we all know it's a risk you take. I guess.

2312
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:45,620
Yeah. So but, you know, the people they really should be coming after, though, are some hackers that are affecting some games like Splatoon two.

2313
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:50,620
So apparently there's been some hackers that have gone through and actually are cheating in the game.

2314
01:58:50,620 --> 01:59:01,620
They've tweaked the weapons to basically throw them out of balance, including massively updating the rate of fire of a weapon that's meant to be slow,

2315
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:08,620
powerful blast that resemble hidden non-competitive weapons used in salmon or modes like salmon run and stuff like that.

2316
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:18,620
There's videos, I guess, of them, you know, changing parameters as if, for example, eliminating the charge time on sniper rifles so they can fire it like a machine gun,

2317
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:29,620
returning completely invisible and invulnerable. No word on whether you get I know that they're banning on some people using the modded firmwares,

2318
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:39,620
but it's weird. I don't know. They haven't really been able to track all these down yet, but it's unfortunate to see this kind of stuff affecting things.

2319
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:44,620
So hopefully they'll get on top of it. Yeah. And that's the stuff they really need to do something about.

2320
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:53,620
You're right. Because, you know, when they ruin games like that online, like that can just like kill a game's online presence when you just know you're going to run into cheaters right away.

2321
01:59:54,620 --> 02:00:02,620
Well, now that they're in the online space, time to get used to it. It's been shit that Microsoft is fighting for years. So get used to it.

2322
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:05,620
All right. Let's go over to Jamie with our next story.

2323
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:25,620
Well, we have some Exceed games that are coming out. Actually, a good number to come out on Switch. We have Gal Metal, which looks like it is a rhythm game, rhythm music game.

2324
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:29,620
Plus, I think the name is really awesome because it also kind of makes me think of Baby Metal.

2325
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:42,620
We have, the game is also going to be coming out in Europe. We also have titles like Gungrave VR, Corpse Party 2, and Touhou Scarlet Curiosity, also confirmed by Exceed.

2326
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:50,620
But, I mean, Gal Metal, though, looks really cool. It's a motion-controlled rhythm game, so you use the Joy-Con to lead a female band all the way through.

2327
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:58,620
And just looking at the style, it's got that kind of neat cel-shaded style. So I'm really, really excited to play that one. I can't wait for it to come over.

2328
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:06,620
I think people like the Exceed stuff and kind of the niche stuff that, you know, they do.

2329
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:09,620
Switch seems like the perfect console to bring it on.

2330
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:11,620
Yes. Switch is doing very well with a lot of that niche stuff.

2331
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:12,620
Mm-hmm.

2332
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:22,620
All right. Well, if that's it, then let's party like it's 1984. And you remember the Garbage Pail Kids? That's right, those infamous trading cards from the 1980s that I think stayed in the 80s.

2333
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:25,620
These never really came back, did they ever? I think they kind of like stayed there.

2334
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:32,620
If you don't know what they were, I guess you could just define them as like Mad Magazine level parodies.

2335
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:38,620
Although, if you don't know what Garbage Pail Kids are, you probably don't know what Mad Magazine is either, so maybe I'm just dating myself.

2336
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:41,620
But anyway, look it up. Google it.

2337
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:47,620
Garbage Pail Kids were a trading card and sticker series, and now they're going to be a mobile game.

2338
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:49,620
It is a card-collecting, role-playing game.

2339
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:54,620
So if you like magic, Rage Nator, listen up. This might be up your alley. Maybe this will be a game that you'd be into.

2340
02:01:54,620 --> 02:02:05,620
You can virtual battle with cards from the original 1980s Garbage Pail Kids lineup, as well as more contemporary card series, because I had no idea these fucking things were still going.

2341
02:02:05,620 --> 02:02:11,620
Yeah, Dungeon Buster in chat says they were the anti-Cabbage Patch Kids. Yeah, so I'm kind of surprised they're still going.

2342
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:17,620
But then again, Cabbage Patch Kids I think are still going, so I don't know. It's weird how those things kind of come around.

2343
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:25,620
So anyway, the new mobile game is coming from Jago Studios and Topps. It's an RPG card battler. It will be available on iOS and Android.

2344
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:29,620
If you want more information, gpkthegame.com.

2345
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:36,620
Which makes me ask, what 80s craze do you think deserves to come back in gaming form?

2346
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:38,620
Popples.

2347
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:44,620
I would say you can't do that on television, is the 80s craze. I would like you to come back in video game form.

2348
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:47,620
That'd have to be done like a WarioWare game.

2349
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:54,620
Yeah, you have to escape the children's television sausage factory. And if you hit the wrong button, you get slimed.

2350
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:56,620
Because you don't know?

2351
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,620
Yeah, because you don't know. You have to fight barf.

2352
02:02:58,620 --> 02:03:00,620
That does not compute.

2353
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:03,620
And there's escape from locker jokes.

2354
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:11,620
Yes, perfect. Yeah, you can't do that on television would be a great one to come back. What do you think, Logie? 80s thing that should come back?

2355
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:14,620
Laser tag.

2356
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:22,620
Hold on now. That would be like me saying Gremlins. They already had Gremlins games. Although, I wouldn't mind my new Gremlins games.

2357
02:03:22,620 --> 02:03:28,620
They re-released the Gizmo doll. I had one when that movie came out though. And the McDonald's records.

2358
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:35,620
Let's see. In chat, Dungeon Buster says, Gummy bears the RPG. Well, you get the Gummy ship in Kingdom Hearts.

2359
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:36,620
So it's like close.

2360
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:37,620
It's not the same.

2361
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:39,620
You're right. It's not the same. I tried.

2362
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:43,620
DDR Mike in chat. Wow, long time no see. DDR Mike. That's a blast from the past.

2363
02:03:43,620 --> 02:03:47,620
DDR Mike in chat says, Double Dare. Oh wait, it is coming back. That's right.

2364
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:49,620
But not Mark Summers.

2365
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:52,620
Yeah, he's doing color commentary on it. He's not hosting, but he's doing commentary.

2366
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:54,620
Oh, okay. So they found a space for him. That's cool.

2367
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:55,620
Yep.

2368
02:03:55,620 --> 02:04:01,620
Well, that's good because he, you know, he didn't like doing that at all. Because the OCD he had, he didn't like being the sloppy stuff.

2369
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:05,620
So that's good that he has an off-hands role this time around.

2370
02:04:05,620 --> 02:04:06,620
Yeah.

2371
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:09,620
That's cool. I miss unwrapped. That's, that's my Mark Summers jam.

2372
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:14,620
Uh, let's see. Is that in chat says they made a new Teddy Rex spin and he's terrifying.

2373
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:16,620
He is terrifying. Yes.

2374
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:21,620
Carmen Sandiego says, is that a Netflix series for Carmen Sandiego? If I remember right, that came up on the show a few weeks ago.

2375
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:23,620
That and I thought there was a movie too. Weren't they doing them?

2376
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:28,620
I think so. I think so. So, uh, let's see. Oh, is that also suggest legends of the hidden temple?

2377
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:30,620
It's getting a little more 90s.

2378
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:32,620
That came back as a terrible movie.

2379
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:34,620
They did a movie on Nickelodeon like a few years ago.

2380
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:39,620
I don't know why, but they're doing a lot of the 90s stuff come back. Like I know Rocco's modern life has a movie coming out.

2381
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:46,620
They're doing one for invader Zim. Um, there's something else from Keenan and Cal is still on Saturday night live.

2382
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:53,620
Yeah. Still he actually, I think he is now like one of the longest, uh, longer than Daryl Hammond at this point.

2383
02:04:53,620 --> 02:04:57,620
Yeah. Wow. And what Tim Meadows was on there forever too. Yeah. He's one of the longest.

2384
02:04:57,620 --> 02:05:02,620
Um, yeah, I'm not surprised. Yeah. Host there. So interesting. All right. Who would have thought?

2385
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:09,620
Yeah. Who would have thought? Uh, Keenan from Keenan and Cal. Where's Cal? Where's his Saturday night live moment or was he mad TV?

2386
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:16,620
I think he was, he did have a cameo. They did a good burger bit. Oh, did they? Oh God. I don't think, I don't know.

2387
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:21,620
All right. And Bobby Blackwell says he is the longest as of this year. So like this is, wow.

2388
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:26,620
That's impressive. Daryl Hammond and Tim Meadows both are on that show for everything. Daryl Hammond a little bit longer, but yeah.

2389
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:33,620
Wow. Okay. Cool. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on with a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the Skype line. Loki.

2390
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:41,620
So this is awesome. Um, apparently coming out of the licensing expo, which I didn't even know was a thing.

2391
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:53,620
Licensing expo 2018. Um, Activision Blizzard has announced they have partnered with Lego to produce Lego Overwatch sets with multiple sets and various price points.

2392
02:05:53,620 --> 02:06:01,620
All of which probably gonna be expensive because Lego is expensive. This is right up my alley though. Um, so we don't know what it's going to be.

2393
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:09,620
It could be brickheads. It could be actual sets, but we'll see. I'm, I'm into Overwatch Legos. That's awesome.

2394
02:06:09,620 --> 02:06:17,620
That's something that Alan would really be into too. I think. Yeah. Cool. So I knew I've seen some like mocks that people have done for like characters that look pretty awesome.

2395
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:25,620
I hope we get to build some of the stages like Volskaya industries and you know, all the, it would be cool. Yeah. Route 66. Yeah. You never know. It'd be awesome.

2396
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:33,620
Anyway, sadly I have to end on a sad note this week because, um, you know, we did have, uh, some losses in the game industry this week.

2397
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:40,620
So, um, I'm sure many of you on social media, um, heard that a total biscuit or John Bain, uh, did lose his battle with cancer this week.

2398
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:48,620
Um, and, uh, that was all over Twitter. Um, his wife, Jenna, uh, actually posted on Twitter that a total biscuit, uh, passed on May 24th.

2399
02:06:48,620 --> 02:06:59,620
And, um, although I can't confess that I've, I'm like super familiar with his stuff. Um, I do know that he was big influential in the YouTube scene, uh, in the indie, you know, stuff.

2400
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:13,620
He was big on like a PC gaming, like one of the things he liked to do, like he had a group like talking about the, they were, um, you know, like the FPS stuff, you know, making sure games were actually 60 FPS on like PC versions and stuff like that.

2401
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:21,620
And just kind of keeping, you know, like, I love the, um, ethics and games and stuff like that in the gaming industry. He was kind of a proponent of that.

2402
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:35,620
Um, but like, I know some people are kind of angry at him because of like his stances on like some gamer gate stuff, but I don't think he really got into the thick of his more of just like ethics, just actually keeping companies honest as far as,

2403
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:47,620
yeah. The perception I got from that was that like, he actually was about the actual ethics side. And then when it was apparent that it was more than that, he was like, y'all are crazy. Like that's kind of, kind of, kind of what I got the gist that I got from that. Yeah.

2404
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:58,620
But yeah, he has a, you know, I didn't follow him so closely. So, but like, you know, he's got his web series out there. I mean, there's the WTF stuff talking about different games, like, you know, bringing highlighting indie stuff.

2405
02:07:58,620 --> 02:08:04,620
He tried to do like his own steam curator page and stuff. There is highlight games there. So, I don't know.

2406
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:15,620
Well, I think that the hardest part of this story is that he was only 33. I mean, you know, and I know there's like this big meme that's going around the internet right now about like when you're 35, you should.

2407
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:25,620
And it's all these, like, it's this play on these articles out there that are like, you should have so much money saved for retirement. And everybody's looking at it going, I don't have a goddamn thing saved for retirement at 35.

2408
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:34,620
So, like, there's a bunch of plays on that. But, you know, in, in, like, honestly, my first year, and it didn't even have anything to do with, with this, this unfortunate passing of cancer and so forth.

2409
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:43,620
But, like, when I first saw that, I was like, you know, when you turn 35, you should be, like, happy that you got to be 35. Because, like, I know for me, I had that really scary incident when I was 30.

2410
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:50,620
And I think we all have known people. Like, you know, I had a good friend of mine that passed away because of swine flu, and she was in her early 20s.

2411
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:51,620
Don't ignore health issues.

2412
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:54,620
It fucking sucks. So, you know, anyway.

2413
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:57,620
Except we don't have universal health care.

2414
02:08:57,620 --> 02:09:00,620
No, we don't. And that's a whole nother thing.

2415
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:03,620
Because they say they're pro-life, but they're really just pro-birth.

2416
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:11,620
Anyway. So, as if that wasn't enough, I mean, that was, the gaming industry was, was devastated right there.

2417
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:16,620
But then also, I don't know if you guys had heard this too, Ted Dabney passed away this week.

2418
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:21,620
You may not know the name, but he co-founded Atari alongside Nolan Bushnell.

2419
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:23,620
So, he passed this week as well.

2420
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:28,620
Now, he was 81, which, you know, is a little more the age.

2421
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:32,620
I still think anything like under 90 is, you know, sad.

2422
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:36,620
And even, you know, sometimes when it's over 90, people are living longer in this day and age.

2423
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:42,620
But regardless, at least you kind of go, okay, well 81 is kind of where the average life expectancy is right now.

2424
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:48,620
So, but anyway, it is still tragic because he did pass, and he was one of the co-founders of Atari.

2425
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:55,620
And who knows where gaming would be today without Atari and, you know, Pong and everything the 2600 brought us and all that.

2426
02:09:55,620 --> 02:10:00,620
So, news of his death was announced on Facebook by a video game historian.

2427
02:10:00,620 --> 02:10:07,620
Because I don't think this guy has been very much in the public eye since, you know, obviously Atari has really kind of gone behind the scenes.

2428
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:15,620
But without Dabney, you know, he was crucial in creating Computer Space, which was basically the coin-operated version of Space War,

2429
02:10:15,620 --> 02:10:18,620
which then kind of made way for, you know, Atari to really come through.

2430
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:21,620
So, anyhow, he passed away as well.

2431
02:10:21,620 --> 02:10:26,620
So, it has been a shitty week in the gaming world, that's for sure.

2432
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:33,620
Anyhow, let's try to make things a little bit happier here and talk about whatever you would like to on our phones.

2433
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:37,620
If you'd like to give us a call, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2434
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:40,620
If you'd like to give us a call and talk about whatever might be on your mind this week.

2435
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:41,620
Maybe there's something you're playing.

2436
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:45,620
Maybe there's a news article we missed that you'd like to talk about, or who knows what.

2437
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:50,620
Let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last-minute stories while we wait for the phones to light up here.

2438
02:10:50,620 --> 02:10:54,620
No, not really. It's been a pretty slow week.

2439
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:57,620
Yeah, it's been a lighter week, I think, with Memorial Day on the horizon.

2440
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:59,620
But we do have a call coming in. Let's get to it.

2441
02:10:59,620 --> 02:11:00,620
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2442
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:02,620
Hey, this is Reginator.

2443
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:03,620
Hey, what's on your mind, Reginator?

2444
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:06,620
Not a whole lot.

2445
02:11:06,620 --> 02:11:23,620
Well, since you were talking about 80s revival a few minutes ago before you opened up the phone lines, I think I'll make the bulk of my call about that.

2446
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:40,620
It's pretty much a given that most of us know that a lot of the video game spin-off media out there over the years hasn't been all that great.

2447
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:48,620
Case in point, the infamous Super Mario Brothers movie that came out in the 90s is a prime example of that.

2448
02:11:49,620 --> 02:12:13,620
But still, even with that being said, are there any movies or TV shows based on gaming that you may have seen growing up that weren't like Casablanca level grade or Dr. Zhivago grade, but you still loved it anyway?

2449
02:12:13,620 --> 02:12:19,620
Absolutely. In fact, it's almost kind of timely because I would say the Super Mario Brothers Super Show with the Zelda cartoons on Fridays.

2450
02:12:19,620 --> 02:12:27,620
Like, you know, it wasn't going to win an Emmy, but it was a good time and it was stuff I remember as a kid.

2451
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:30,620
And I really loved the Zelda cartoons especially. The Mario cartoons were decent too.

2452
02:12:30,620 --> 02:12:35,620
But the reason why I say it's timely is that I believe those just hit Netflix this week.

2453
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:40,620
So if you wanted to catch up and you happen to be a Netflix person, you can catch up on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

2454
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:42,620
I know those are on there for a while. They've been on there for a while.

2455
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:44,620
They've been on, I think, some of the other services. I don't think they were on Netflix.

2456
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:45,620
No, they were.

2457
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:46,620
Were they?

2458
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:47,620
Because we've watched them.

2459
02:12:47,620 --> 02:12:54,620
Thank you for bringing up that show. Internet high five. In fact, I grew up watching that myself.

2460
02:12:55,620 --> 02:13:07,620
There's a, not to show anyone else's channels on Twitch, but there is a channel on Twitch called ConTV.

2461
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:17,620
Every so often they do show that show on there as well. So that's something to watch if you don't have Netflix or whatever.

2462
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:23,620
You know, otherwise I would say I was, but see, I was always a big fan and really still am of game shows.

2463
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:29,620
You know, like the other thing that honestly comes to my mind is things like not just Nick Arcade, which is a little more nineties, but also, um, Starrcade.

2464
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:35,620
Which is funny because, you know, you can think of Starrcade as that place that used to be a Disneyland that Jamie was referencing at the top of the show.

2465
02:13:35,620 --> 02:13:37,620
Or you can think of it as that.

2466
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:38,620
That was Astrocade, Rob.

2467
02:13:38,620 --> 02:13:40,620
Oh, I thought you called it Starrcade. I thought it was Starrcade.

2468
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:41,620
Astrocade.

2469
02:13:41,620 --> 02:13:48,620
Oh, okay. I thought it was. All right. Well, whatever. Well, anyway, Starrcade was an old game show from 81, 82.

2470
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:50,620
It's supposed to be coming back.

2471
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:56,620
They always say it's going to be coming back and then they never do. They still have a name to host, which I'm waiting for that call.

2472
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:57,620
Wait for the call, y'all.

2473
02:13:57,620 --> 02:14:02,620
Uh, but, uh, they did, they did a Twitch marathon of that not that long ago.

2474
02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:09,620
They did every single episode of Starrcade I remember was to build hype for a Blu-ray set, I think, or something that they were going to be coming out with.

2475
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:14,620
So, I mean, that was kind of gaming because like, what else do we have from that era?

2476
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:17,620
Captain N, which admittedly I didn't watch a ton of that.

2477
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:19,620
I'm aware it was the thing that exists and I knew of it.

2478
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:23,620
But I don't think they showed it at a good time here on the local networks, if at all.

2479
02:14:23,620 --> 02:14:30,620
Yeah. Admittedly, I watched Captain N. I knew it wasn't great.

2480
02:14:30,620 --> 02:14:36,620
In fact, no, no, no, no, Mega Man and, uh, Pit.

2481
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:41,620
Well, they called him, uh, uh, Kid Icarus on the show for whatever reason.

2482
02:14:41,620 --> 02:14:46,620
But that aside, I thought those two characters were a little bit of an annoying sight.

2483
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:57,620
But you got to remember, they came out in the late 80s and there was, uh, there was, uh, you know, the prime of, uh, Nintendo's, you know, hype.

2484
02:14:57,620 --> 02:15:00,620
You know, they're kind of, they're kind of golden age, if you will.

2485
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:04,620
So, you know, everyone had Nintendo fever.

2486
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:13,620
So, you know, and there was a whole lot in terms of, uh, gaming, uh, gaming related shows on TV at the time.

2487
02:15:13,620 --> 02:15:21,620
So I kind of, you know, you know, granted bear that, you know, you know, even with the annoyances.

2488
02:15:21,620 --> 02:15:29,620
And still, even with that being said, you know, ignoring the annoyances, it was still somewhat decent, you know.

2489
02:15:29,620 --> 02:15:35,620
Yeah, somebody in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, vidpower says GameProTV was my jam.

2490
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:42,620
You know, um, that guy, uh, JD Roth that hosted that, he went on to do, um, he was the co-creator.

2491
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:46,620
I mean, he does a lot of trash TV now, like it's just like straight up trash TV.

2492
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:49,620
He was the co-creator of The Biggest Loser on NBC, which is trash.

2493
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:56,620
Uh, he hosted that unanimous reality show on Fox that I remember was like kind of a Big Brother knockoff.

2494
02:15:56,620 --> 02:16:00,620
It was super trash. Uh, and then, God, what else did he do?

2495
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:05,620
It says right now he is currently the announcer of the ABC TV show Extreme Weight Loss.

2496
02:16:05,620 --> 02:16:10,620
Never seen it, but it's probably trash. So, just kind of interesting.

2497
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:17,620
Yeah, you know, as long as I thought of it, granted, I'm not entirely sure if it would be considered retro or not.

2498
02:16:17,620 --> 02:16:23,620
But, you know, the Final Fantasy movies, especially the first one, The Spirits Within,

2499
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:27,620
I know a lot of people like to hate on it and say, you know, in fact,

2500
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:30,620
Ew, that's not a real Final Fantasy movie!

2501
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:32,620
Hey, watch it, because that's exactly what I...

2502
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:36,620
I don't hate on it, but my problem is, like, it just wasn't Final Fantasy at all.

2503
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:38,620
They should have just called it The Spirit Within.

2504
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:41,620
Yeah, well, the way I look at it is this.

2505
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:47,620
You know, if you look at each of the, you know, all the actual Final Fantasy games,

2506
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:50,620
for the most part, they're very, very different from each other.

2507
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:57,620
Like, eight's very different from seven, nine's very different from eight, so on and so forth.

2508
02:16:57,620 --> 02:17:01,620
And, granted, there's certain common elements in the game.

2509
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:09,620
It's like, you're gonna see chocobos, you're gonna see a character named Sid, so on and so forth.

2510
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:17,620
And, you know, some of those elements are kind of cleverly hidden in the movie.

2511
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:23,620
Like, the only way you'll see a chocobo is in the main character's pajamas.

2512
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:25,620
Well, in my opinion, that's why it flopped.

2513
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:30,620
It's because those things were so, like, subtle that, you know, like, they shouldn't have had to hide it.

2514
02:17:30,620 --> 02:17:32,620
You know what I mean?

2515
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:38,620
That was my issue with it, but this is a debate that's, like, 15 years old at this point, so I'm only gonna slide.

2516
02:17:38,620 --> 02:17:49,620
Yeah, but, ultimately, my point is, you know, I took all my arguments into consideration,

2517
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:56,620
and even with that being said, I still found the movie really, really great, despite the fact that a lot of people hate it.

2518
02:17:56,620 --> 02:18:01,620
Yeah, maybe it's one of those things I need to watch again, but, you know, I was expecting something Final Fantasy and it just kind of wasn't.

2519
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:07,620
And I remember that, at that time, they were working on eight and the movie around the same time,

2520
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:15,620
and I remember saying this before, and I'll say it again, it would have been maybe different if the movie had been Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy VIII had been the movie.

2521
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:24,620
Because I think Final Fantasy VIII has a great story that is very Final Fantasy, but Final Fantasy VIII is probably the worst Final Fantasy game, in my opinion.

2522
02:18:24,620 --> 02:18:33,620
That's my opinion only. Final Fantasy VIII is, like, the worst of all Final Fantasy games because of its battle system and the junction draw thing and all that, like, ruins it,

2523
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:37,620
and the scaling of the monsters and all that stuff, like, it's not a fun game, in my opinion.

2524
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:42,620
Whereas the story's great. I would have liked Final Fantasy VIII to have just been a movie.

2525
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:50,620
Yeah, well, you know, I look at it this way, you know, they tried something new with the junction system.

2526
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:55,620
They'll pan out, well, no, but at least they had the balls to try something new.

2527
02:18:55,620 --> 02:19:09,620
I mean, you know, there's so many games out there, you know, your game publishers and developers out there that, you know, kind of churning out sequels after sequels without trying anything new,

2528
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:17,620
and we complained that it's same old, same old cookie-colored games, you know, and we complained that it gets boring after a while.

2529
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:25,620
You know, to Square's credit, they tried something new with VIII, and unfortunately, just one time it flapped, so...

2530
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:30,620
But some people would, like, fight me on the street for saying that, so, you know, everybody's got their opinion.

2531
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:34,620
Anyway, Rage Leader, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze in a couple more calls, but thanks for the call.

2532
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:36,620
Sure, have a nice night.

2533
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:37,620
Later, you too.

2534
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:38,620
Here's a story.

2535
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:41,620
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to call in. Yeah, you got a last minute story?

2536
02:19:41,620 --> 02:19:43,620
Yeah, I'm just trying to check the date on this article.

2537
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:52,620
Yeah, this is recent, so apparently Samsung has to pay Apple $539 million for copying iPhone features.

2538
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:54,620
Didn't Apple have to pay them?

2539
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:56,620
No, this was from the appeal court.

2540
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:59,620
No, no, no, not this week, but like a previous thing months ago.

2541
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:01,620
Yeah, and it's looking like it's getting turned around.

2542
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:04,620
So all these companies just sue the shit out of each other.

2543
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:08,620
Yeah, but I just think it's absolutely hilarious.

2544
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:12,620
Anyway, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2545
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:14,620
Hey, this is Act Deaf.

2546
02:20:14,620 --> 02:20:16,620
Hey, Act Deaf, what's on your mind, buddy?

2547
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:19,620
Well, I have a story I want to talk about.

2548
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:28,620
Not something that you covered today, but something that happened or is happening right now in Mexico with video games.

2549
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:30,620
Oh, please, what's going on?

2550
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:37,620
Well, right now, there's somewhat contest. It's an initiative, more likely.

2551
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:43,620
It's called Video Juegos Mx Mexico.

2552
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:45,620
Sorry.

2553
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:55,620
And it's a competition made by the ESA, the Entertainment Software Association, and also the government of Mexico.

2554
02:20:55,620 --> 02:21:01,620
Many private and public initiatives are industry leaders.

2555
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:13,620
And it's a good initiative. It promotes the creation of video games and a bigger industry here in Mexico that's still growing.

2556
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:18,620
But there's one thing about it, and that's the thing I don't like about it.

2557
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:32,620
The prices, they're given out. There are three categories. There's a category for people under 17 years.

2558
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:39,620
And the prices there are a video game console, so that's kind of okay.

2559
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:42,620
For doing what? This is for making games?

2560
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:51,620
For example, for the category for under 17, you have to develop an idea. Not necessarily the video game, but an idea.

2561
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:54,620
Oh, okay. So like a treatment or something. Okay, alright.

2562
02:21:54,620 --> 02:22:00,620
But there's also a category for university or college students.

2563
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:11,620
And now there's the development involved. They have to make a game. They have to make either a mobile game or a console or PC game.

2564
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:40,620
The prices there are 25,000 pesos. Which right now, with the equivalency and all that, the conversions, it's around $1,200.

2565
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:54,620
$1,200, yeah. So it's not enough. That's really not even to pay the scholarship for any person that goes to a private school.

2566
02:22:54,620 --> 02:23:01,620
They're the only places here in Mexico that offer a career in development for video games.

2567
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:12,620
So the prices are not all that, it sounds like. What is their point with this? Are they just trying to get more folks in Mexico excited about game development?

2568
02:23:12,620 --> 02:23:21,620
Are they trying to figure out maybe the next big game idea is in Mexico? Trying to get more game design out of that? Is that what they're going for with this?

2569
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:35,620
Yeah, they're trying to impose the industry. And basically, this is the third year they have done this. They have done it in 2015 and 2016. They skipped 2017 for some reason.

2570
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:46,620
And they're doing this again. But that's not the only categories. There's a professional category for people already in the industry making games.

2571
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:58,620
And the top prize, the best game in the contest is 100,000 pesos.

2572
02:23:58,620 --> 02:24:01,620
So that's going to be like $4,000 basically?

2573
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:07,620
Around $4,000, $5,000 I think.

2574
02:24:08,620 --> 02:24:09,620
Yeah, $5,000.

2575
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:17,620
But it would depend on how much time you spent on it. If you spent months and months creating this, all things considered, that's actually not that much money.

2576
02:24:17,620 --> 02:24:35,620
Yeah, again, and that's my problem with this. Because the prices are not exactly something that, at least for me, I wouldn't like to get this. No, I would like to actually get something else or something better.

2577
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:46,620
It's a bummer that the organizations can't like, as a prize, we're going to get you connected with an international publisher for your game. That would be something really cool.

2578
02:24:47,620 --> 02:25:03,620
Yeah, the other prizes in the contest, at least for best video game, are also a trip to E3 in 2019 and an Autodesk license, which I don't really know about Autodesk. I don't know how it works.

2579
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:09,620
But it's something, but it's not really that great, at least in my opinion.

2580
02:25:09,620 --> 02:25:19,620
Yeah, maybe in some ways, it's kind of about getting your name out there and getting noticed. I mean, for what it's worth, I'm sure whoever wins this competition, there will be news articles that will cover the game and so forth.

2581
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:35,620
And if the game is available for download or for purchase somewhere at that point, maybe that would be good for it. But I get what you're saying. The prizes are not necessarily, I mean, only one person gets to win too. What about all the other people that spend their time on this?

2582
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:45,620
So I don't know. Maybe this would be something that folks who already have games that they're working on, maybe something they can try to get in on to leverage their games a little more.

2583
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:55,620
But I like that they're trying to do something to get people motivated in other countries, but I totally get what you're saying, ActDeaf. I'm not sure this is enough.

2584
02:25:56,620 --> 02:26:06,620
No, and you're right. It's a good initiative. It's not something like really, really bad. Because if people can take advantage of this, it's good.

2585
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:20,620
And BobbingtonChat, for what it's worth, says 1,000 is actually a prize amount for game jams here in the US for first place. So it's in line with other things. So, you know, maybe at the end of the day, it's more about the exposure than it is about the actual cash prize.

2586
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:27,620
Although let me ask you this. Do you know the game, or have heard of the game Militant?

2587
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:29,620
No.

2588
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:39,620
It's a game that is already available on Steam and PlayStation 4, and it won the first year of this initiative, of this contest.

2589
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:40,620
Interesting.

2590
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:44,620
So yeah, not exposure, I don't think so.

2591
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:53,620
All right. Fair enough. All right, ActDeaf. Well, thanks for the call and, you know, the update on what's going on in places that aren't necessarily the ones where we live.

2592
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:54,620
Thanks for having me.

2593
02:26:54,620 --> 02:26:56,620
Hey, no problem. Take care, buddy.

2594
02:26:56,620 --> 02:26:57,620
You too.

2595
02:26:57,620 --> 02:27:04,620
All right, bye bye. All right, Kaijuto kind of another thought there saying, may not look like a lot, but it's a great start. Sometimes you have to crawl before you fly.

2596
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:09,620
Well, I mean, yes and no. I also get the perspective of, yeah, but I still have to support my family.

2597
02:27:09,620 --> 02:27:18,620
So, but you know, as far as that whole, like if I, if it's a hobby, if it's something I do in my spare time, you know, maybe this is a way to kind of elevate that hobby into a career.

2598
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:24,620
I don't know. Anyway, with that, we are going to wrap up for the night and that's going to do it for calls.

2599
02:27:24,620 --> 02:27:30,620
But if you didn't get through, you can always still send us an email. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us an email.

2600
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:37,620
We do read the tweets and all that as well. Twitter.com slash O L R. But I think for now we are going to wrap up and I always like to towards.

2601
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:39,620
Wait, any other last minute stories? I don't want to.

2602
02:27:39,620 --> 02:27:42,620
I mean, we can talk about Battlefield five was announced this week.

2603
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:44,620
Oh my God. We really didn't cover that anywhere else, did we?

2604
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:47,620
I mean, it's fine. I mean, it's going to be World War Two this year.

2605
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:48,620
Okay.

2606
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:52,620
And then they're going to, um, one thing that they promised that there's not going to be a premium pass this time.

2607
02:27:52,620 --> 02:28:02,620
So you don't have any like DLC or anything like that. And there's not going to be any, um, loot boxes that are going to have, um, game affecting items in it.

2608
02:28:02,620 --> 02:28:07,620
So if there's anything that's going to be in the game, it's going to be cosmetic stuff, I guess.

2609
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:16,620
Um, but, and they're not, I don't think they're doing battle rail. It didn't sound like they're doing battle rail and there's a single player campaign to take that call of duty.

2610
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:23,620
So definitely a battlefield and call of duty are like different games this year. It's not just like the same fucking thing.

2611
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:28,620
So interesting too, that it's EA that's doing the game where they kind of backed off of loot boxes.

2612
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:37,620
Well, I trust EA as far as I can throw them in. I'm sorry. Like I still, there's going to be shady shit somewhere.

2613
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:43,620
Fair enough. All right. Well, as I always say at the end of Orange Launch Radio, uh, thank you very much for supporting the show.

2614
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:47,620
If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, or even if you hated it, maybe you know somebody that would like it.

2615
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:52,620
So help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.

2616
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:56,620
So make sure you tell a friend or whoever might be interested in this show.

2617
02:28:56,620 --> 02:29:02,620
Uh, also a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play, uh, goes a very long way.

2618
02:29:02,620 --> 02:29:08,620
And I always say that, and there's not a lot of new reviews that are popping up. So if you do have 15 seconds to write a review, I'd really appreciate it.

2619
02:29:08,620 --> 02:29:10,620
Do I need to pay for an advertisement?

2620
02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:17,620
Sure. If you're offered for free for me advertising, I didn't say it was free. I said free for me.

2621
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:25,620
So actually I'm considering making little banners. So if anyone has a forum or something and wants to promote the show, yeah.

2622
02:29:25,620 --> 02:29:32,620
Um, hit me up. I'll probably have something done by the end of the week. Sweet. All right. Uh, and I think, I think that's, that's it for that.

2623
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:36,620
So let's get around to final thoughts for the night. Uh, Loki, your final thought.

2624
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:43,620
Um, my final thoughts, hopefully I'm going to get to play all this VR stuff that I downloaded on my PlayStation four because now it's all tricked out with VR stuff.

2625
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:46,620
So we just need to play those things.

2626
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:54,620
Uh, my final thought is I'm going to be back on Twitch tonight. I've been taking a month break because of the other game I was playing and, uh, just, you know, live stuff.

2627
02:29:54,620 --> 02:30:01,620
So I'll be excited to be back. So twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts. I appreciate all those for follow follows, subscribes, biddies, all that good stuff.

2628
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:10,620
We're going to play Hyrule warriors tonight. My poll closed and Hyrule warriors one. So we'll be there soon. Last but not least, dark soccer, neurotypical people don't make sense.

2629
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:17,620
And then I'm going to go harass your cat. Yeah. Mr. He's singing the song of his people. He's being a big, I've been fed, but I'm lying.

2630
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:22,620
He's being a big baby. All right. That's it. Uh, we're out of here for the night. We will be back to do it in seven days.

2631
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:28,620
So have a great week. And for those of you that have the day off tomorrow, have a good time staying up all night tonight. Bye everyone.

2632
02:30:28,620 --> 02:30:37,620
