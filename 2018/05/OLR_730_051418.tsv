0	28000	This week, Wal-Mart Canada may have let the cat out of the bag listing handfuls of titles possibly to be officially announced at E3. Strangely, all of them could be easily guessed, minor typos notwithstanding. That's just one headline, stay tuned for plenty more people-powered discussion starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, May the 13th, 2018 with episode number 730 of our show.
46000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts or you might follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. Joining me, sadly not tonight, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but if you were listening last week, you heard our little tangent about DragCon and that's where she is at tonight.
60000	70000	So she's been putting a lot of pictures over on her Instagram and all that stuff so it looks like she's having a great time and I'm sure she'll tell us a little bit about it next week, although I don't think there's a lot of video game content to announce.
70000	77000	But I think maybe some TV stuff, I don't know. Anyway, but join me here in studio to hold down the fort this week. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
77000	78000	Hello.
78000	79000	Hey Loki, how are you?
79000	80000	I'm fine.
80000	83000	Yeah, good. How's things going well for you?
83000	94000	Sure, I've been driving around town trying to scour Lego deals. The problem is there's some inventory sites online that aren't exactly accurate.
94000	112000	And so there was one they had was the Destiny's Bounty, which is the Ninjago ship from the movie, which is normally like $160 set, but they were closing it out at certain locations at Walmart for $40.
112000	124000	So I was like, shit, I want to get that for $40 because that's a steal. But all the locations that supposedly had it in stock, and it's been that way for weeks now, don't have it.
125000	131000	It's funny you bring that up because I still don't have that Tron Lego set that came out like a few weeks ago.
131000	132000	You got to get it from the Lego store.
132000	143000	I know. Yeah, that one has to come from official channels. Well, so let me backtrack a little bit because to set up the story, I need to wish all of our mothers out there a happy Mother's Day, all the mommy gamers out there.
143000	156000	And of course, if you consider yourself a mother, if that is for a child or you got a single parent situation going on, then all the people who consider themselves mothers and mommy gamers, I hope you all are having a fantastic day today.
156000	165000	So I say that because even though those of you that have listened to the show for a while know that I lost my mom last year, that the party must go on, so to speak.
165000	172000	So we had like a family thing in Old Town today with my dad and my sister and myself and Alan.
172000	177000	So while we were there, we went over to, you know, how some of the like Old Town shops can be very kitschy here.
178000	183000	Let's look like candy barrel stores and souvenir like sock stores.
183000	190000	There's so many socks stores and find a license plate with your name on it that says, you know, beautiful Sacramento or license plate. Exactly.
190000	195000	Those types of things. So anyway, there was a little story that there's actually kind of a neat store there.
195000	199000	It's the same place that has like the retro arcade games for 50 cents a pop.
199000	207000	Even though I kind of laugh like my God, trying to play like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from, you know, the 90s on 50 cents a credit.
207000	213000	But I got to say, those machines are in great condition. Like sometimes you see classic games and a few of them are like really run down.
213000	218000	I will give this store props like I don't know who's maintaining those cabinets, but they're doing a great job because they're all great.
218000	223000	They're probably still getting that kind of money. It's like, well, we could charge 25 cents, but people are paying 50 cents.
223000	227000	Well, it's all tourists and you get kids in there and kids like mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy.
227000	232000	So, you know, because that's what kids do, right? Look, it's what your kids do. Yes.
232000	237000	It's what they do. So, so they get, you know, here's 50 cents. Shut up. Right.
237000	241000	And then that'll get you maybe 45 seconds on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or whatever it is. But anyway.
241000	248000	So they also have Legos and like other this store is set up like a Disney souvenir shop or like you can walk from one store.
249000	258000	I think it's like all five stores like owned by the same people because you can walk like from the nerdy store to the like a painting store with nerdy stuff in it to the end.
258000	264000	It's like candy. I think there's a candy thing too because everything in old town is candy. And so like you can kind of walk through it kind of like a Disneyland.
264000	270000	That must be the old costume shop that they had there because they had one. Not Evangel, not Evangelions. That's still there.
270000	274000	Oh, is it? Okay. Yeah. Because I remember that one had kind of where you can walk next door to.
274000	280000	Yes. But that was because it was all the same store basically. Yeah. No, this one is some other, I don't know what it used to be. I don't remember.
280000	286000	So I feel like it might've been like a mall of stores before. And so maybe they've converted it into this. But anyway.
286000	290000	So they had the Legos there and Alan started looking and I'm like, Oh, what are you looking for?
290000	296000	He's like, I'm trying to get you the Tron thing. And I'm like, well, I think that's only at the official sources, sadly.
296000	301000	Because those contest winners, that's what they're for, right? They're not going to go into mass production or anything like that.
301000	307000	Yeah. They don't really put those in. Well, that's not necessarily true because you do see a lot of those.
307000	312000	They still carry those at Barnes and Noble. So you will have those there, but you don't see them very spread out.
312000	319000	I think the Tron one though is exclusive to Shop at Home, the Lego Shop at Home and their website and the Lego stores.
319000	326000	Yeah. That's why I just ordered it from the website. And honestly, it's an okay set. I have mine on display.
326000	335000	But it's just like, it took me like 30 minutes to put it together and I was just like, well, it's one of the things I just want to own for the novelty, for the fact that it's Tron.
335000	341000	You know what I mean? So it is cool. But like I've put together, you know, many better sets.
341000	346000	Loki, maybe if they sell enough of those, Disney will make a third movie.
346000	350000	Yeah, I don't think so. I can dream. Damn it. I can dream.
350000	361000	Hi to our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who's back this week.
361000	365000	So welcome back, Bobby. And happy belated birthday, Bobby Black Wolf.
365000	366000	Yes, happy birthday.
366000	370000	Because I forgot to say it on your show because I got all flustered because I swore on the Bobby Black Wolf show.
370000	373000	And Bobby has a wholesome family show that you can listen to on the speakers.
373000	374000	Even I know that.
374000	383000	Yeah. And I know you don't. And I said a very brown word on his show that he will not have to go back and censor. So sorry about that.
383000	389000	So but here at OLR, we we are. What was the tweet that Donovan sent us earlier?
389000	398000	We're the Tarantino's of the podcasting with our language. So, you know, what the fuck ever. Anyway.
398000	403000	So Bobby Black Wolf is in chat saying yes, Tarantino's the John Waters.
403000	411000	They are. They are in Lego stores. They had a bunch of the hard to find women in NASA sets on the shelf before the holidays.
411000	420000	That's really cool. Go to Barnes and Noble. They have all that stuff. And they're clearing out their Batman, their Lego Batman stuff for the movie, which I was like, no, I'm not going to buy any of those.
420000	425000	But but Toys R Us is probably kind of a shit toys arrest. I mean, no, no offense.
425000	428000	Well, I mean, Loki, they're kind of fucked already.
428000	436000	Well, but yeah, well, they're kind of fucked because they never lower their prices on stuff and everything's retail, even like with the discounts, it becomes like higher than retail.
436000	445000	So just forget it. But yeah, you can get the women in NASA. They have the new blind bag sets. Those are all at Barnes and Noble.
445000	451000	Bobby in chat also says, I enjoyed putting together the set, the Tron set. So there's a there's a positive.
451000	453000	Maybe I'm just spoiled when it comes to that.
454000	459000	You're just stubborn. All right. Let's see other comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
459000	465000	Tigerclaw, since I brought up Ninja Turtles, of course, Tigerclaw had to be like, wait, wait, I got your Turtles nudes, dude.
465000	473000	Tigerclaw says, speaking of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the finalists for that Ninja Turtles Splatfest is set for May 18th.
473000	478000	Team Raphael versus Team Donnie. So that's that's where it ended up.
478000	484000	Or is it just Team Raph now? See, obviously, I haven't watched cartoons since the 90s. I don't I disavow all the new stuff.
484000	490000	It's the 90 cartoon forever for me. But obviously, Team Donnie in that situation or Donatello.
490000	494000	Sometimes stuff grows like especially the new DuckTales cartoon. Not bad.
494000	497000	OK, David Tennant's Uncle Scrooge in that, right?
497000	503000	I think so. Yeah. So that's that's already some points right there. I don't have anything against new cartoons.
503000	511000	I just got I bear I barely have time to watch like the shows that I'm supposed to be watching, let alone, you know, add cartoons into that.
511000	518000	So, well, anyway, let's see other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
518000	524000	Let's see. YYR says Legos were five percent off when everything else was 10 to 20 percent off.
524000	528000	I haven't looked. What are discounts at now? I don't know. I haven't bothered with the whole thing.
528000	531000	I almost went over there today, but I didn't. There's nothing going to be there.
531000	540000	Do you know how many vultures participate in those sales? Like people that are going to wait for that type of steal to just flip it on eBay or something or save them for a couple of years, then put them on eBay.
540000	543000	You know, things like that. Like, I just I don't feel like dealing with the professional.
543000	546000	There's not going to there's no way that's going you can get better deals everywhere else.
546000	551000	And I mean, honestly, well, we talked about this when the when the news first came out, the Toys R Us is going to go under.
551000	561000	We talked about the fact that when it's really 10 to 20 percent off, like keep an eye out to make sure you really are getting a good deal because sometimes they jack up the prices.
561000	569000	But usually it's going to go for the manufactured suggested retail price, which almost all chains are selling under that because they're all trying to outdo each other.
569000	573000	Not so much with Legos. I mean, like when I think that's why they're not discounted.
573000	584000	In fact, the fact that they are Legos and they know that is the ticket item, like you can go to like any Walmart or Target and get, you know, sets that are normally sixty dollars MSRP for forty eight or forty dollars.
584000	592000	Or, you know, you do get a discount on that all the time, which is why I'm looking for stuff even lower than that, but never on the big sets.
592000	597000	It seems like there's a couple chatter saying it's 30 to 50 percent now. So it's starting to get a lot of Legos.
597000	599000	Definitely not Legos.
599000	609000	Fair enough. All right. Well, we could talk about Legos all night long. Yeah, I think there'd probably be a lot of room in the universe for a Lego podcast. I'm sure there's got to be a Lego podcast out there.
609000	610000	Yeah, dozens.
610000	617000	Actually, YouTube channels will be where it's at for Legos. I don't know if that translates as well to a podcast. I'm sure someone's doing it and doing it well.
617000	618000	Yeah, dozens of those too.
618000	627000	But the YouTube channels, I'm sure are crazy. Anyway, let's talk about what's going on in video games and really starting off this week with our kickoff topic tonight.
627000	633000	Some really big news on a really big company we've been waiting for for a really long time. So let's...
633000	635000	Is it big news, though? Is it?
635000	637000	Read the goddamn story, Logie.
637000	644000	I'm just saying. So Nintendo has finally unveiled what Nintendo Online is going to be.
644000	651000	So guess what? So first off, let's talk about the pricing. So pricing, one month, only four bucks. Not bad.
651000	658000	Logie, I think your mic is cutting in and out. Sorry there. I don't know if that... Are we having mic problems again? I'm going to freaking scream. All right.
658000	662000	Does Toys R Us sell mics? Because we could probably buy some there.
663000	670000	Seriously. All right. Well, with Miss Dark Sakura being out this week, I guess we will just have to borrow her setup here.
670000	676000	And while I get that all ready to go, I will probably just have to pick up some new microphones this week.
676000	683000	Her mic, I don't know if her mic is in much better condition. If it'll reach. Hold on. Don't pull too hard on that. There.
683000	685000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
685000	687000	OK, try now, Logie.
687000	688000	Hello.
688000	689000	There we go. Much better.
689000	692000	You're probably going to need to turn me, well, down or up. I don't know.
692000	694000	I think you're fine for right now. I'll futz the volume.
694000	695000	I'm going to turn this one off.
695000	696000	Yes, please do.
696000	700000	And shove this over here. And maybe not remember that it's wrapped around my laptop.
700000	701000	All right.
701000	707000	Thankfully not wrapped around the glass of water I have right here next to my laptop ever so responsibly.
707000	710000	Anyways, Nintendo Online, where are we left?
710000	711000	Nintendo Online.
711000	712000	The joy of live radio, folks.
712000	714000	So yes, as broken as our microphone is.
714000	722000	So Nintendo Online, they're going to offer one month for $3.99, three months for $7.99.
722000	725000	Or you can get a whopping 12 months for $20.
725000	729000	While that doesn't seem like it's very much compared to the competition out there.
729000	731000	Let's see what you get for that kind of money.
731000	733000	So. Oh, and then I forgot to mention.
733000	741000	If you also want to sign up for a family plan, which allows you to have eight different profiles across a bunch of different switches.
741000	744000	That's only $34 or $35 a year.
744000	745000	So that's not bad.
745000	747000	So what do you get with that?
747000	752000	So starting off, you get, of course, access to play games online.
752000	757000	You get cloud backup saves or cloud backups for your saves.
757000	762000	And then they have you get access to the Nintendo Online phone app.
762000	767000	And then, of course, you know, the thing everybody is waiting for.
767000	769000	What about all those virtual console games?
769000	770000	What are we doing virtual console?
770000	775000	Well, they have the NES classic game service, which I guess is launching with that.
775000	781000	They're going to offer games that you can play multiplayer across the Internet.
781000	786000	And they're going to have 20 titles and going to be adding more as it goes along.
786000	792000	So the first few titles that they've got, they have soccer, tennis, Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers,
792000	797000	Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. 3.
798000	801000	And then there's supposed to be more.
801000	802000	They'll be announced later.
802000	810000	And those are going to, I guess, be in lieu of other console games.
810000	812000	And, of course, this is supposed to be coming out in September.
814000	818000	So you're not too big on this, Loki.
818000	820000	I mean, what a surprise, you and Nintendo not getting along.
820000	824000	I don't know. I'm not as cold on this as you.
824000	833000	I'm actually pleasantly surprised that instead of them just doing virtual console and charging five bucks a pop, like we've kind of had.
833000	836000	I mean, and they've also said virtual console gone.
836000	838000	This is there is no more virtual console.
838000	840000	This is what they haven't really said.
840000	841000	This is the replacement.
841000	844000	But you can all read into that is that Nintendo online is where they're going.
844000	851000	And this would also explain why, you know, Neo Geo for some time has in case been doing those arcade archive partnerships.
851000	853000	Sega's got their Sega Aegis thing going on.
853000	861000	So I would expect third parties, at least other consoles, you know, where the Wii played Genesis and other stuff.
861000	866000	You can expect the other consoles that were not Nintendo's family not going to be a part of this ever.
866000	869000	Third party games to be determined, I suppose.
869000	878000	But anyway, my point is, instead of charging five bucks a pop again for this stuff, it seems like if I'm reading this right,
878000	882000	and I guess there's still room for interpretation, but if I'm reading this right, they're moving to a Netflix model.
882000	886000	Which I think everybody's kind of been asking for, right?
886000	888000	So why are you mad, though?
888000	891000	I'm mad because this is only a few games.
891000	893000	They could be offering a lot more that's available.
893000	895000	And like, I would have purchased them right away.
895000	897000	And I don't care if they're five dollars each.
897000	901000	Yeah, it's expensive, but I would have bought them so that I could have them on my system.
901000	902000	Because this...
902000	909000	See, but here, even if they did the five dollars each, it would have only been, it always was the drip fed titles.
909000	911000	Why wouldn't it still be the drip fed titles?
911000	916000	The reason why they're doing it this way is to keep you sucked into that Nintendo Online month after month.
916000	918000	Because you'll have something to look forward to.
918000	920000	At some point when the wells get dry, they'll say,
920000	925000	Let's see what they offer, because I just, I think, you know, that they have 20 titles or whatever at launch.
925000	928000	Let's see how quickly they're putting titles in there.
928000	933000	Because if it's gonna be like, oh, we're adding like four a month or something like that, that's still not that great.
933000	936000	I mean, I don't know. I just expected better.
936000	941000	And on top of that, it's awfully nice of them to have no way to back up your saves,
941000	944000	despite the fact that the system has goddamn USB ports on there.
944000	949000	But oh, but if you pay us $20 a year, we'll allow you to back them up to the cloud.
949000	952000	Then gee, that's a little bit of pay gating for that stuff.
952000	953000	That's ridiculous.
953000	959000	All the other console systems out there allow you to back up your saves without having to subscribe to a service?
959000	960000	What the fuck?
960000	963000	No, Microsoft doesn't do that.
963000	967000	Oh shit, I can dump my saves to a memory card.
967000	970000	Oh, a memory card. Oh, I thought you meant the cloud.
970000	974000	No, I'm not talking about the cloud. Fine, they can gate that shit. I don't need that.
974000	979000	But I'm talking about actually being able to dump them to a thumb drive or something like that.
979000	980000	Oh, I see, I see.
980000	983000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
983000	990000	Bobby's saying it's PlayStation Plus only, you can't access cloud, but he said he's not talking about the cloud, so fine.
990000	996000	But I do want to point out over chat, Rama says it's $20 a year, I failed to see the issue.
996000	1001000	JD says I'm extremely looking forward to expanding my family on Nintendo for just $4 a person.
1001000	1007000	And Bobby Blackwell says this is literally exactly what everyone asked for in 2006 when Virtual Console launched.
1007000	1010000	Loki, I kind of tend to agree.
1010000	1017000	Like, why is this? Especially considering that they're going back and adding online play.
1017000	1022000	So they are modifying these ROMs, or you know, making sure that they're going to work in an emulator like this.
1022000	1024000	And I didn't fucking ask them to do that.
1024000	1025000	I did.
1026000	1027000	Well then fine.
1027000	1028000	I said back in the days of the week.
1028000	1035000	That's fine, and they can have their ROMs with their multiplayer in this online service and then sell me this shit that's one player that I can play locally.
1035000	1040000	That's all I want. They can do that now. You can't tell me that I can't fucking emulate NES games.
1040000	1041000	I just-
1041000	1043000	They can fucking emulate NES games.
1043000	1048000	Okay, so let me- I have to admit, I'm a little surprised at this.
1048000	1052000	So what if we're now looking one year from now?
1052000	1057000	So let's say this thing launches in September, so we'll say September 2019.
1057000	1062000	And we'll say they have put out five games a month from that time period.
1062000	1068000	That would be 20 to start, 60 additional games, 80 games in the library now at that point.
1068000	1069000	Are you still going to say Baja Humbug?
1069000	1071000	Yes I am, because they're NES games.
1071000	1076000	What if I want Super Nintendo games? Nintendo 64 games? What if I want DS games?
1076000	1080000	Or whatever else they're going to offer on virtual- what was virtual console.
1080000	1081000	There's a lot of other consoles.
1081000	1084000	80 games across all their platforms is not enough.
1084000	1090000	When they had, I don't have time to play the two games I bought in the last month.
1090000	1092000	Where am I going to play 80 games?
1093000	1095000	And if you don't have time to do that, then it doesn't matter.
1095000	1099000	Here's my thing, is their offering is pitiful, but the price is pitiful too, so it doesn't matter.
1099000	1102000	So you're paying for almost nothing, and you're getting almost nothing.
1102000	1105000	So that's fine if you're happy with it. I'm not happy with it.
1105000	1110000	As a person that bought a Switch, I wanted to immediately be able to download those games.
1110000	1116000	I would have easily dumped another $100 or $150 in virtual console games,
1116000	1119000	to get the same games that my son was playing back onto the system.
1119000	1121000	But now, that's not even an option.
1121000	1126000	So my other option, I guess at this point, if I want to be able to play those things,
1126000	1130000	is, well, I guess I gotta go to piracy, because they're not offering them on their platform.
1132000	1134000	So, because this is a show where every gamer has a voice,
1134000	1138000	and I know some of you Nintendo fans are probably a little huffy at what Loki is saying right now,
1138000	1142000	part of the reason I'm, you know, indulging this is because,
1142000	1144000	A, he's not the only one saying this.
1144000	1148000	I've got into the same kind of discussion on Twitter with somebody else,
1148000	1150000	so I know he's not the only one saying it.
1150000	1154000	And B, I will give you that, that that is a decent perspective,
1154000	1157000	where your son was getting used to these games on the Wii U,
1157000	1161000	so, you know, when, you know, backwards compatibility,
1161000	1165000	let's say, on Microsoft's ecosystem is pretty rich,
1165000	1169000	why can't, you know, we know that there's not much that goes in a virtual console emulator,
1169000	1172000	why can't they just unleash the floodgates, and what they put out on Wii U,
1172000	1175000	and even Wii, they just put out on Switch?
1175000	1178000	I'll tell you how it's gonna go. Here's exactly how it's gonna go.
1178000	1179000	Okay.
1179000	1182000	They have already an unpatchable exploit for the system,
1182000	1185000	you're just gonna get a fucking emulator and be able to dump whatever you want in there,
1185000	1190000	and that'll satiate anybody that's looking to play a bunch of ROMs on their Switch.
1190000	1192000	Because Nintendo isn't gonna step up to the game.
1192000	1197000	I think, yeah, it's nice that they added online multiplayer to some ROMs and stuff,
1197000	1200000	but dude, come on.
1200000	1204000	Emulators on PC have had online play for decades.
1204000	1207000	Like, what is the fucking problem?
1207000	1209000	To be fair, it's kinda jank.
1209000	1214000	Like, in the early days especially, like, it was not, I don't know,
1214000	1218000	I haven't, honestly, I haven't dinked around with emulators in a long time.
1218000	1221000	And maybe that's because companies are making it easier and easier to just,
1221000	1224000	eh, push A to support, you know, whatever, buy the thing.
1224000	1228000	Like, I don't feel the need to go to emulators as strongly as I used to.
1228000	1229000	That whole type of thing.
1229000	1232000	So maybe, to be fair, I haven't been up and up on the online technologies in the emulator.
1232000	1236000	But I remember when it was first out on, what is it, SNES 9X, all those years ago,
1236000	1241000	and that, it was kinda, it was there, but it was like, eh, wasn't that great?
1241000	1244000	Like, I get it, that they're offering the service if you want to pay for this.
1244000	1246000	Like, say, what if I didn't want to play multiplayer?
1246000	1249000	You know, wouldn't it be nice to have an option to be able to purchase these ROMs
1249000	1254000	to have them, you know, before their release on the service?
1254000	1258000	Like, I mean, with this argument, basically saying, well, it's okay,
1258000	1261000	because these are all gonna be on this online service, like Netflix,
1261000	1265000	so you're saying I just never need the, why even sell movies at the store anymore?
1265000	1267000	Because we have Netflix, you know, what's the point?
1267000	1269000	Why even buy any of that stuff?
1269000	1273000	Because it's available on Netflix, or at least it'll eventually be on Netflix.
1273000	1275000	Just don't buy movies anymore.
1275000	1277000	You know, YYR has a decent counterpoint.
1277000	1280000	Seriously, though, before it was buying games outright.
1280000	1282000	Now it's a monthly service.
1282000	1284000	But hashtag, why not both?
1284000	1290000	And Act F says, my co-host in my podcast, cheap plug for GFMCast.com,
1290000	1294000	there you go, it's good times, are in the same boat as Loki, so it's a legit concern.
1294000	1297000	Yeah, no, I mean, you can get mad at Loki all you want,
1297000	1300000	because he's, you know, not thrilled about this,
1300000	1304000	but there's a lot of gamers out there that are feeling the same thing going on.
1304000	1307000	I can support the why not both methodology.
1307000	1310000	Well, there's also a part of me that says, well, wait a minute,
1310000	1312000	am I reading too much into this?
1312000	1317000	That Nintendo does plan to have this 80-game catalog
1317000	1321000	on Netflix-style Nintendo thing by next September.
1321000	1327000	Or is this the 20 games that will be playable Netflix-style now?
1327000	1332000	And then as new games come in, old games go out.
1332000	1335000	Oh, but if you want to keep that old game, $5.
1335000	1337000	Possible.
1337000	1341000	I mean, I know, I'm tinfoil-hatting a little bit.
1341000	1344000	I'm just saying, why are they making this so difficult for me to give you money?
1344000	1346000	I mean, what is the problem here?
1346000	1350000	Sorry, just real quick, the reason why I'm going tinfoil-hat on that
1350000	1352000	is because my mind is a little bit still hung up on
1352000	1354000	when they first announced this whole thing a long time ago
1354000	1357000	and they said, one free game a month, or whatever it was.
1357000	1359000	Which is stupid, I was like, okay.
1359000	1363000	Well, so clearly plans have changed a little bit, but, you know, that's, anyway.
1363000	1365000	So that's where my little tinfoil-hatting comes from.
1365000	1371000	I just, whatever, you know what, I'm sure I'll pay for the service just to play online.
1371000	1373000	I'm not really looking forward to this stuff, though.
1373000	1376000	I mean, it's disappointing.
1376000	1378000	It's just constant disappointment with them.
1378000	1382000	It's like, we've been waiting for them to launch Virtual Console on this platform forever now.
1382000	1386000	And now they're just like, well, fuck you guys, we're not doing it, we're just gonna do this.
1386000	1388000	This is what you guys want.
1388000	1392000	Well, you know what, it's okay to have a service.
1392000	1396000	Like, for example, PlayStation Now.
1396000	1399000	PlayStation Now, I can pay for that service
1399000	1403000	and I have access to a library of different games that I can play.
1403000	1408000	Many of which I can also purchase on the PlayStation Store.
1408000	1410000	Why can't we do that?
1410000	1412000	So you want both, like what I said.
1412000	1414000	Why not? What's the harm in doing that?
1414000	1420000	No, honestly, that I think is the happy middle ground where we can all agree,
1420000	1424000	whether people agree with you or not, that maybe both would be even better.
1424000	1428000	Because, you know, with the PlayStation Now, there's a fair point in there,
1428000	1431000	is that how many of us are actually subscribed to PlayStation Now right now?
1431000	1434000	Or Microsoft Service? I know I'm not, I don't think you are.
1434000	1437000	I doubt Dark Soccer is, because I don't think she's mentioned it before.
1437000	1439000	Is she on EA's thing?
1439000	1442000	I can't remember, but maybe, well, if she was, she probably isn't anymore.
1442000	1445000	She may have got it for the Mass Effect thing and then dropped it,
1445000	1447000	but I'll have to ask her and let her speak for herself.
1447000	1454000	But anyway, you know, so maybe people do want to kind of buy this
1454000	1458000	so that they quote unquote own it, but then at the same time,
1459000	1462000	there's a lot of digital stuff I'm buying on PlayStation 3,
1462000	1465000	and it's like, well, I used to buy on PlayStation 3,
1465000	1468000	and it's like, well, as my PlayStation's over there collecting dust,
1468000	1470000	there's really no way for me to play it anymore,
1470000	1473000	because PlayStation 4 won't really support any of it.
1473000	1476000	Well, that's dumb too, but you know, that's a whole other argument.
1476000	1479000	Which I would be way more excited about PlayStation Now
1479000	1484000	if it would just give me access to the stuff I bought before,
1484000	1487000	and yes, it should give that to me for free,
1487000	1490000	or at least for being a PlayStation Plus subscriber.
1490000	1492000	If they want to gate that behind PlayStation Plus,
1492000	1495000	because bandwidth for streaming, then fine, fine.
1495000	1498000	Bandwidth for streaming isn't free, fine, do that.
1498000	1501000	Anyway, I didn't mean to make the Nintendo thing a PlayStation thing,
1501000	1504000	but I guess there are some similarities, for what it's worth.
1504000	1510000	I'm still, maybe that's how they got rid of some of the lag for multiplayer.
1510000	1513000	Maybe something about that you're like streaming the games,
1513000	1515000	I guess that would probably be more lag.
1515000	1517000	Maybe like you and the person you're playing with
1517000	1519000	are streaming the games from a central computer,
1519000	1521000	but I guess that would be more lag, not less.
1521000	1523000	Like the emulator, you're talking about NES ROMs?
1523000	1524000	Yeah.
1524000	1528000	Dude, those are like a few K, that would transfer instantaneously.
1528000	1532000	I mean, you could download the whole ROM in a fraction of a second,
1532000	1536000	I don't think any lag is going to be coming from downloading that ROM.
1536000	1538000	Fair enough, I guess I'm overthinking it.
1538000	1543000	Let's see, go into chat for more comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
1543000	1545000	Bobby Blackwolf does point out, remember early on,
1545000	1547000	they said it was Super Nintendo games with online play.
1547000	1550000	When Switch was announced, they said it would be Super Nintendo games with online play.
1550000	1556000	So, your concern about there not being any Super Nintendo games right now may be short-lived.
1556000	1559000	I think this is exactly what Nintendo's doing.
1559000	1562000	They did this when they first rolled out Virtual Console on the Wii,
1562000	1566000	they did this when they rolled out on the Wii U, and they're doing it now.
1566000	1570000	Okay, so I guess I'll look forward to Super Nintendo games in 2020 or some bullshit.
1570000	1572000	I don't think it'll be that long.
1572000	1576000	Okay, well, we'll see what a year from now what's actually out.
1576000	1580000	I don't trust them to be on time with any of this stuff.
1580000	1582000	I think September is going to be the Nintendo thing,
1582000	1585000	and that's going to be their push through the holiday,
1585000	1591000	and then probably next year, either summer or whenever they kind of want to wake people up,
1591000	1594000	they'll put out Super Nintendo as the next wave.
1594000	1600000	But what's not going to happen is something now in this little,
1600000	1603000	like where do things fit in now, is Mother 3.
1603000	1609000	And A, I know that's not Super Nintendo, that was Game Boy Advance, right?
1609000	1612000	There's another system.
1612000	1615000	And there's no reason this maybe wouldn't grow into that at some point.
1615000	1620000	Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, especially with the Switch being portable as well, it's possible.
1620000	1627000	But if they release Mother 3, wouldn't they be able to just charge 10 bucks for that as a standalone game?
1627000	1631000	Why would Mother 3 be on a service like this?
1631000	1633000	It's never going to be on the platform, period.
1633000	1635000	So, I mean, it's a non-issue, but it's...
1635000	1637000	That's true. Keep on dreaming, right?
1637000	1639000	It's never going to happen.
1639000	1642000	Nintendo doesn't know that the consumer wants that.
1642000	1644000	They fucking know. They don't care.
1644000	1648000	So it's never going to be on the platform anyways.
1648000	1653000	But to that point, you're like, oh, NES is going to launch now,
1653000	1655000	and then later on it'll be Super Nintendo, then fuck.
1655000	1659000	Then if I'm going to get Mario 64, then I'm just going to have to wait.
1659000	1661000	I mean, what's the point?
1661000	1664000	Why do I even want to mess with their stupid service at this point?
1664000	1668000	It's dumb. At this point, it should be not...
1668000	1670000	Why is it taking so long?
1670000	1673000	They'll put multiplayer in a fucking NES game.
1673000	1678000	Like, this boggles my fucking brain that they can't figure out how to program...
1678000	1682000	Dude, there's so many emulators out there that do this shit better.
1682000	1687000	Like, I've seen Wii U emulators that are so goddamn sophisticated,
1687000	1688000	I can purchase...
1688000	1692000	Wii emulators, they can purchase games from the fucking online store.
1692000	1697000	I mean, why is it that they can't take an old-ass game
1697000	1702000	that can run on anything and add multiplayer to it?
1702000	1704000	People have figured out how to do this shit.
1704000	1706000	It's not a priority for them.
1706000	1709000	And honestly, if this is what's stopping this stuff coming out,
1709000	1712000	is adding these extra features, that's cool.
1712000	1714000	Sell that as something separate.
1714000	1717000	Call them Nintendo-enhanced titles or something like that.
1717000	1720000	Or the NES Classic or the SNES Classic,
1720000	1721000	because that's where my mind's going,
1721000	1724000	is that maybe part of this is conflict of interest with those things.
1724000	1727000	They don't want to put out all the same games that are already available on those devices,
1727000	1729000	because they want to sell those devices.
1729000	1734000	And maybe that is Nintendo's MO for how you're going to buy games that you want to keep.
1735000	1741000	Because, and low-key, get mad at the people for buying those things like fucking crazy,
1741000	1744000	because it showed that that works.
1744000	1748000	And this is something I'm just processing out loud and thinking out loud,
1748000	1750000	because I didn't even think of it until you said,
1750000	1751000	why are they doing this?
1751000	1754000	And I'm like, well, maybe they still want to push those NES Classics.
1754000	1757000	And I'm thinking of that tweet, that late-breaking news we just saw
1757000	1758000	before we went live tonight,
1758000	1763000	that the NES Classic reproduction hit shelves June 29th.
1763000	1766000	And they said that and the SNES are going to be available throughout the rest of the year.
1766000	1767000	Yeah, but here's the problem.
1767000	1768000	So that's what they don't want to compete with.
1768000	1770000	That argument doesn't make any sense to me,
1770000	1773000	because that doesn't mean I wouldn't buy that system anyways.
1774000	1777000	You're saying that you can't sell me Virtual Console games,
1777000	1781000	because that'll stop me from buying an SNES Classic or something like that.
1781000	1783000	That's not even going to...
1783000	1785000	I've already purchased these games on the Wii U.
1785000	1788000	I should actually not have to pay for these again anyway,
1788000	1789000	since I've already bought them the first time.
1789000	1792000	I bought them several times on the Wii and the Wii U.
1792000	1796000	So, I mean, I would purchase them again on the Switch,
1796000	1799000	and I'd probably still purchase one of those Classic systems.
1799000	1801000	That doesn't make any sense.
1801000	1803000	All this is basically saying to me, bottom line,
1803000	1805000	is to make an end to this argument.
1805000	1807000	Just remember, we've got people in chat saying,
1807000	1809000	Loki is salty as fuck tonight.
1809000	1810000	That's from Brad from Pop Culture.
1810000	1813000	I'm just going to have to fucking go to piracy,
1813000	1815000	because they're making it too fucking hard to give them money.
1815000	1816000	So fuck them.
1816000	1817000	I'm not giving them money.
1817000	1819000	I'm just going to pirate the shit out of it.
1820000	1823000	I have to disagree strongly with that.
1823000	1825000	I don't think that's the way to go.
1825000	1827000	But it is what it is.
1827000	1831000	Okay, show me a way to purchase the Nintendo 64 game on the Switch.
1831000	1833000	I can't.
1833000	1834000	I can't this year.
1834000	1837000	I probably can't next year, and probably the year after that.
1837000	1840000	Do you want me to give you the answer Don Mattrick would have gave you?
1841000	1843000	Go buy a Wii U.
1845000	1847000	That's the answer Don Mattrick would have gave you.
1847000	1848000	Go buy a Wii U.
1848000	1851000	Or no, because you're not supporting that system anymore.
1851000	1858000	Why are you physically unable to put a system that can be emulated on a Raspberry Pi?
1858000	1860000	That's the thing.
1860000	1863000	The Raspberry Pi is going to outsell the stupid NES classics.
1863000	1866000	So Bobby in chat says, Loki, you're already at piracy.
1866000	1868000	You already pirated it all.
1868000	1874000	So people who might be a little ragey that you would say you're going to piracy with all that,
1874000	1877000	but you kind of like, to be fair, you haven't.
1877000	1880000	You do support this stuff when it's available.
1880000	1882000	You did it on Wii U.
1882000	1884000	I did. I purchased tons of virtual console games.
1884000	1890000	Okay, so piracy is not always the answer for you, and I think that's an important point to make very clear.
1890000	1895000	Let's see, I was going to read this other stuff in chat before we got on that tangent.
1895000	1898000	At live.vognetwork.com, where were we?
1898000	1902000	Oh, YYR says they've added multiplayer and are making a big deal about it,
1902000	1905000	but several games in the initial batch, such as Donkey Kong and Super Mario Brothers,
1905000	1907000	are not two-player simultaneous.
1907000	1912000	And Bobby Blackwolf points out, hence controller sharing, I mean, Zelda's in the list.
1912000	1914000	Help me get through this boss.
1914000	1918000	Yeah, I mean, that would be kind of fun that you can kind of pass the controller.
1918000	1920000	You can kind of do that on PlayStation 4 right now.
1920000	1923000	And that's something that you can only do with PlayStation Plus.
1923000	1929000	I think you can watch for free, but to actually take the controller requires PlayStation Plus.
1929000	1930000	And I've done that before.
1930000	1933000	I think that's how I played Monster Hunter, was I was like,
1933000	1936000	well, I don't really want to, I want to see if I like this first.
1936000	1939000	So a friend of mine fired it up, and I was able to take over his game for a little bit,
1939000	1941000	see how I liked it.
1941000	1942000	So.
1942000	1944000	But I mean, I don't know.
1944000	1948000	Games from 1987 and so forth aren't maybe the same Try Before You Buy thing,
1948000	1952000	but I still think that's, I think, I think when it comes to streaming,
1952000	1956000	like, I'm just thinking about, like, I've been on a little break from streaming for a little bit
1956000	1958000	because I've had other projects going on.
1958000	1961000	But when I do come back to streaming, and I will,
1961000	1964000	you know, I've been doing a lot of streaming, so like my buddy Delvin,
1964000	1969000	and I'm like, oh my God, there's like so much potential here to do like co-streaming
1969000	1975000	in a game like Super Mario Brothers 3 that was like, that was like the game to play.
1975000	1978000	You know, I remember going over to a friend's house and having to sleep over
1978000	1982000	and we would stay up until like four in the morning playing Super Mario Brothers 3
1982000	1985000	and passing the controller or, you know, and doing the fighting on the square
1985000	1988000	and like all that stuff, trying to beat the hard levels.
1988000	1990000	You know, now it's like, oh, cool, I can do that streaming,
1990000	1994000	but like across a great distance, like I'm, I'm like so jazzed about that.
1994000	1997000	Yeah, hopefully Nintendo, hopefully Nintendo doesn't pull a YouTube
1997000	2000000	and decide that they're going to copyright strike everybody
2000000	2002000	that's not part of their partner's program.
2002000	2007000	That's a whole nother problem, I guess, but so far they haven't,
2007000	2011000	at least with just, oh, just with TV, good Lord.
2011000	2013000	I went really old school for a minute there.
2013000	2019000	Twitch TV, they haven't so far, and maybe it's something about the live versus recorded.
2019000	2026000	I'm not sure they can in the same way because it's live versus recorded.
2026000	2028000	That does change a lot.
2028000	2032000	Look at Twitch's policy on the music streaming.
2032000	2036000	When you play music during a stream, if it's copyright music, you can play it live,
2036000	2039000	but it'll be muted on your broadcast after the fact
2039000	2041000	because it's the whole live versus recorded.
2041000	2043000	So I'm not sure that Nintendo could do anything about live.
2043000	2047000	I guess I should try to be hopeful, but I'm just not expecting much from Nintendo.
2047000	2049000	So we'll just leave it at that.
2049000	2051000	Yeah. All right.
2051000	2054000	Let's, ooh, a lot to digest there.
2054000	2056000	So we're going to hear more at E3, right?
2056000	2059000	We're going to hear the other 10, the back 10 at E3?
2059000	2061000	All right, I mean.
2061000	2063000	But like, okay, let's like, sorry.
2063000	2064000	No, it's fine.
2064000	2066000	It's a big topic.
2066000	2069000	So then why even put out NES Classic Games
2069000	2074000	if we're going to have the NES Classic Edition coming back out on June 29th?
2074000	2078000	I mean, wouldn't that drive away sales from the NES Classic Edition
2078000	2082000	if I can just pay $20 and get access to all these different games?
2082000	2084000	I mean, that's the argument you guys were making earlier.
2084000	2086000	Well, this is the way I'm going to get to that stuff,
2086000	2091000	so wouldn't that be detrimental to their service?
2091000	2094000	Perhaps. There's another factor at play,
2094000	2098000	and that is that Nintendo fans will probably collect a lot of it.
2098000	2101000	But I am kind of sitting here going,
2101000	2106000	do I really need an NES Classic, especially with this coming out soon?
2106000	2110000	One thing to consider, though, is that this won't be around forever,
2110000	2113000	and we're going to have another example of that later on in the stories,
2113000	2116000	how games can kind of come and go like that,
2116000	2119000	so this won't necessarily be around forever.
2119000	2123000	But the NES Classic is something that will.
2123000	2125000	It is a piece of hardware that will be around forever,
2125000	2130000	but will it play on televisions that they make in 50 years?
2130000	2131000	Probably not.
2131000	2134000	There will probably be a new standard besides HDMI then at that point,
2134000	2136000	so you have to get an old-ass converter or something.
2136000	2138000	I don't know. I don't know.
2138000	2142000	But anyway, let's see.
2142000	2145000	Going in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
2145000	2146000	Bobby Blackwell says,
2146000	2150000	There are people who want an NES Classic but don't want a Switch.
2150000	2153000	My stepmom-in-law would never get a Switch,
2153000	2155000	but she loves the NES and SNES Classics.
2155000	2158000	So maybe it's a very particular audience
2158000	2161000	that wants to do the retro stuff they remember as a kid,
2161000	2164000	but they don't really play stuff now.
2164000	2166000	There is definitely an audience for that,
2166000	2169000	but I kind of think the response to these systems
2169000	2171000	has been much larger than that.
2171000	2174000	The people buying the Atari flashbacks, the Intellivisions,
2174000	2178000	those things may be a little more what I mentioned a minute ago,
2178000	2181000	and your few collectors here and there too.
2181000	2185000	But NES Classics, SNES Classics have been much bigger than that.
2185000	2187000	I just think they're leaving money on the table.
2187000	2190000	They could easily just sell it and...
2190000	2191000	And at the end of the day,
2191000	2194000	this is where your frustration comes from the most, right?
2194000	2197000	You view this as Nintendo leaving money on the table.
2197000	2199000	Yeah, because, like, just sell your damn shit.
2199000	2201000	Why do I have to jump through all these hoops?
2201000	2204000	Like, seriously, to get an SNES Classic,
2204000	2206000	I can't find them in stores.
2206000	2208000	I'm not gonna pay a scalper for this shit.
2208000	2212000	Like, why are you making it so hard for me to give you money
2212000	2215000	for this stuff that I want, and why does it have to be...
2215000	2218000	I don't want my virtual console games, if you will,
2218000	2221000	to be on a hardware system that's attached to my TV.
2221000	2225000	Why can't I put them on the Switch to take it with me if I want to?
2225000	2229000	Why are you making this so fucking hard is the problem.
2229000	2232000	But as far as, like, SNES Classics aren't hard to find now,
2232000	2234000	and soon NES Classics, that'll be resolved too.
2234000	2237000	I hope those NES Classics, since we're talking about this,
2237000	2240000	don't require an online connection to play them,
2240000	2243000	because that's gonna be a fucking annoying piece of shit
2243000	2245000	if I have to be always connected to the internet.
2245000	2246000	Why would they?
2246000	2248000	Because it's an online service.
2248000	2250000	Because it's streaming.
2250000	2251000	Oh, you mean the Switch?
2251000	2253000	You're switching topics on me.
2253000	2255000	I'm talking about the NES Classic hardware thing.
2255000	2257000	No, I'm talking about the Switch now.
2257000	2260000	So I hope that's not gonna be a situation.
2260000	2263000	Hopefully they're smart enough to avoid that.
2263000	2266000	Because the Switch's biggest thing is the whole, like,
2266000	2268000	click, pick it up and go.
2268000	2270000	I don't see Nintendo making a move like that.
2270000	2272000	I mean, for multiplayer, I mean, duh,
2272000	2274000	yes, you're gonna have to be online for any of that.
2274000	2276000	Maybe if there's leaderboards and stuff,
2276000	2280000	maybe there'll be some type of online connection for integrity.
2280000	2282000	But as far as, like, being able to pick it up
2282000	2283000	and take it on the go,
2283000	2287000	especially when you look at other markets like Japan,
2287000	2289000	where picking it up and taking it on the go on your commute
2289000	2291000	or something is actually kind of a big deal,
2291000	2294000	I don't see them chaining it to online
2294000	2298000	in the sense that, like, playing Diablo on PC is chained online.
2298000	2300000	All right. Well, I hope that's the case.
2300000	2303000	Yeah. All right.
2303000	2306000	Anyway, let's move on.
2306000	2309000	I know we could probably fill three hours just talking about this,
2309000	2312000	but there's actually been quite a bit of other gaming news this week,
2312000	2313000	and we will get into that.
2313000	2316000	But I want to get into how was your gaming week
2316000	2318000	and what types of video games have you been playing this week?
2318000	2320000	So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2320000	2322000	It was all right. I played more Mario Odyssey,
2322000	2325000	so I'm quite a ways through that.
2325000	2328000	And then I actually did try out a little bit of...
2328000	2331000	I can't help but laugh that...
2331000	2335000	And maybe some of the Nintendo fans can kind of have a Google at this, too,
2335000	2338000	is that after you've just read the book at Nintendo,
2338000	2339000	how was your gaming week?
2339000	2340000	I played Mario Odyssey.
2340000	2342000	I just... I love it.
2342000	2343000	It's not a read.
2343000	2345000	Is anybody listening to my actual argument?
2345000	2347000	Like, I don't understand why this is confusing to anybody.
2347000	2348000	My question...
2348000	2351000	Like, my whole argument is that I can't give Nintendo money.
2351000	2353000	What is so confusing about this?
2353000	2355000	All right. We'll leave it at that.
2355000	2358000	I don't understand why people are so confused or think it's funny.
2358000	2362000	I'm saying I want to pay them more for more of their services,
2362000	2364000	but they're not selling those services,
2364000	2366000	so I can't purchase them.
2366000	2367000	I'll let you have the final word at that.
2367000	2368000	There it is.
2368000	2372000	Anyways, so I did try a little bit of Minecraft on the Switch,
2372000	2374000	and well, it's Minecraft on the Switch.
2374000	2375000	I was surprised with their...
2375000	2377000	Like, it doesn't seem like it's as updated as the other stuff,
2377000	2380000	but I know that they have more updates coming,
2380000	2382000	so I'll just wait for them to catch up on that,
2382000	2384000	but it's still fun.
2384000	2386000	And then, um...
2386000	2387000	What else?
2387000	2388000	Um...
2388000	2390000	Pokemon Go a little bit.
2390000	2391000	I'm playing that.
2391000	2392000	And...
2392000	2394000	A little bit of StepMania, actually.
2394000	2397000	And, of course, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.
2397000	2399000	Um, StepMania more so,
2399000	2401000	I'm actually looking at, um,
2401000	2405000	more of converting my cabinet over to a StepMania cabinet now.
2405000	2408000	So I did purchase a new J-Pack,
2408000	2412000	because I had to replace the one in my candy cab
2412000	2414000	to have that working, because I guess it died.
2414000	2416000	It just doesn't display anything anymore,
2416000	2418000	but I know the display works.
2418000	2422000	It's just not working with the, um, J-Pack.
2422000	2424000	So I bought two to replace that.
2424000	2427000	One to replace the one that's in there,
2427000	2430000	and one for the Dance Dance Revolution machine.
2430000	2433000	And then eventually, um...
2433000	2435000	Whenever I finally decide to do that,
2435000	2438000	then I'll buy the light board for the, um,
2438000	2439000	Dance Dance Revolution machine.
2439000	2441000	I think they call it a mini-made or something like that.
2441000	2444000	It's basically to hook up the lighting to StepMania.
2444000	2446000	So I'll eventually get to that.
2446000	2449000	I've been trying to find a small computer to go in there.
2449000	2453000	I'm looking for maybe, like, either, like, a NUC, um,
2453000	2457000	or, like, some micro-ITX system or something to build in there,
2457000	2458000	because I wanted it to be really small.
2458000	2461000	Ideally, if I could swing it,
2461000	2465000	I want to actually have it where it's both the arcade cabinet
2465000	2468000	and the StepMania machine at one time,
2468000	2469000	so I can flip between the two.
2469000	2471000	So I'm going to see if there's a way to rig that.
2471000	2473000	I think with my setup, because I actually do have...
2473000	2475000	It's an LCD monitor in there,
2475000	2477000	so it runs through a converter anyways.
2477000	2479000	So, which makes it nice,
2479000	2482000	because then I don't have to worry about an arcade VGA card
2482000	2483000	or anything like that.
2483000	2485000	Um, it's all HD, so I can do all that.
2485000	2488000	But, um, if I have a way I can switch between the two,
2488000	2489000	that would be nice,
2489000	2492000	because I don't want to, like, completely modify everything
2492000	2494000	if I want to sell it down the road or, you know,
2494000	2497000	want to downgrade to a different mix or something like that.
2497000	2501000	I want it to be flexible in that sense, so we'll see.
2502000	2503000	That's it.
2503000	2504000	That's it.
2504000	2505000	Um, my gaming week.
2505000	2508000	Um, actually, not a lot for me to talk about.
2508000	2509000	I've been working on some other projects
2509000	2511000	that have nothing to do with video games or podcasts,
2511000	2512000	so I've been really busy,
2512000	2514000	so I haven't had a lot of time to game.
2514000	2518000	But I still have been doing progress on Diablo III,
2518000	2521000	and I was playing that with Grandpa from...
2521000	2523000	Well, I would say Grandpa from Hoard House,
2523000	2525000	but he's also Captain Matt on Starboard Power Coupling.
2525000	2527000	Uh, I've been playing a little bit with him online,
2527000	2529000	because I finally convinced him, I was like,
2529000	2531000	you should roll a Seasons character, and he did,
2531000	2533000	and I guess he found some really high-level players
2533000	2534000	to, like, really carry him.
2534000	2536000	So now he's kind of carrying me a little bit,
2536000	2538000	because his Paragon level's, like, through the roof for the season.
2538000	2539000	So he's been helping me out.
2539000	2542000	I'm up to, um, Paragon 310, I think,
2542000	2543000	as a last check now for the season.
2543000	2546000	So, um, you know, still working through that.
2546000	2547000	And, uh, yeah.
2547000	2550000	Uh, honestly, besides Diablo,
2550000	2552000	I played a little bit on Switch this week,
2552000	2554000	just, you know, because it's the nice little console
2554000	2558000	I can kind of pick up and, uh, take into bed with me.
2558000	2560000	Uh, but, um, that's, that's really it.
2560000	2563000	I, I don't know if I ever talked about this game at length on the, uh, show,
2563000	2568000	but I got this, um, reimagining, if you will, of Lode Runner.
2568000	2570000	That's the L-O-D-E Runner, you know, the classic game.
2570000	2573000	They have, like, a new Lode Runner on Nintendo Switch.
2573000	2576000	And the cool thing about it is that it has, like,
2576000	2580000	user-made levels that you can, uh, do and put online.
2580000	2583000	And you can also redo the sprites in the game.
2583000	2585000	And so, like, people have put up these sprites
2585000	2587000	where you can kind of turn the main little hero character
2587000	2589000	into, like, Samus and things like that.
2589000	2591000	So it's some neat little things.
2591000	2593000	Um, I, I don't think it's quite as,
2593000	2595000	I mean, like, if you've not seen this,
2595000	2597000	you, uh, dial back your expectations a little bit
2597000	2600000	because you are kind of confined, you know,
2600000	2602000	to, to what all you can do in these levels and things.
2602000	2604000	It's not like Mario Maker by any means.
2604000	2607000	I mean, Lode Runner back in the day was a very, very simple game.
2607000	2610000	But it is still kind of cool that you can, you know,
2610000	2612000	kind of have this functionality, uh, in a Switch game right now.
2612000	2616000	On a, you know, what I think was $10, $15 download title.
2616000	2618000	So, and I think it's also cool that they have
2618000	2620000	some of the retro levels in there, too.
2620000	2622000	Uh, so they can do, like, some kind of, like,
2622000	2624000	sprite switch-ups and they, they let you do some of the retro levels.
2624000	2625000	So that's pretty fun, too.
2625000	2627000	So they throw on, like, some online leaderboards
2627000	2628000	and some other stuff.
2628000	2630000	So if you remember that game, uh, from, you know,
2630000	2632000	way back in the day, uh, fondly like I do,
2632000	2634000	then that's, that's something that might be worth
2634000	2636000	a little bit of your time, is that new, uh, Lode Runner re-imagining.
2636000	2637000	I can't remember the full name of it.
2637000	2639000	Lode Runner Reloaded or something like that?
2639000	2640000	I don't know what it is.
2640000	2643000	It's the Lode Runner, but it's on the, uh, Nintendo Switch.
2643000	2645000	And that's one of those things where I can play that game
2645000	2647000	for, like, 30 seconds.
2647000	2649000	You know, I, it's, it's a little, like, bite-sized game.
2649000	2651000	Maybe not 30 seconds, but, like, 5 minutes.
2651000	2653000	You know, get through one level and then,
2653000	2655000	yay, I did something, I feel accomplished.
2655000	2659000	So, um, outside of that, uh, Pokemon Go,
2659000	2661000	tiny bit of Ingress, but not a lot.
2661000	2663000	Like, really, when I've been gaming on the phone,
2663000	2664000	it's been a lot more Pokemon Go.
2664000	2666000	I'm really close to level 37.
2666000	2668000	I've been trying to get those new shinies
2668000	2670000	and not having a lot of luck, and it's really pissing me off
2670000	2672000	because, like, everybody else I know has those new shinies.
2672000	2673000	It's like, ah.
2673000	2674000	What new shinies?
2674000	2678000	Uh, Makahita, the little, little guy that looks like King Hippo.
2678000	2679000	That guy.
2679000	2680000	Oh.
2680000	2681000	And...
2681000	2682000	Were there shinies in those?
2682000	2683000	There are now.
2683000	2684000	They started it with the fighting event,
2684000	2685000	because they, they've been...
2685000	2686000	Oh, I caught so many of those.
2686000	2687000	Yeah, that's why.
2687000	2688000	I haven't even recycled any that...
2688000	2689000	There's, there's been a fighting event going on.
2689000	2690000	Right, yeah, I know that.
2690000	2691000	No, the system will stop you.
2691000	2693000	The system will warn you if you're gonna recycle a shiny.
2693000	2695000	Just, like, if you try to do a favorite or something like that
2695000	2696000	or a legendary.
2696000	2698000	Uh, so you, you can't accidentally throw one of those away.
2698000	2702000	Uh, and then it's that and the little, the little monkey fighting guy
2702000	2705000	is also, um, a shiny right now.
2705000	2706000	The Manky?
2706000	2707000	No, not Manky.
2707000	2708000	The other one from Gen 3.
2708000	2711000	Med, Med, Medi, Medi, Meditite?
2711000	2712000	Meditate?
2712000	2713000	Meditate?
2713000	2714000	Something like that?
2714000	2715000	I think I know which one you're talking about.
2715000	2716000	Yeah.
2716000	2717000	Thank you.
2717000	2719000	Act F says Meditite is the one that has it.
2719000	2721000	So, yeah, but sadly I can't find those, uh,
2721000	2723000	I can't find those shinies.
2723000	2725000	It's, it's extraordinarily frustrating.
2725000	2728000	And I still can't catch a Latias either,
2728000	2730000	which they just flipped Latios for Latias.
2730000	2733000	And, uh, I, I did a triple raid the other day.
2733000	2735000	We did three back to back.
2735000	2736000	Couldn't catch one of them.
2736000	2737000	Ugh.
2737000	2738000	That was frustrating.
2738000	2740000	And then just because I've been busy with other stuff,
2740000	2742000	I haven't been doing Pokemon raid as much.
2742000	2747000	I have a frickin' EX pass for tomorrow at, like, 12 o'clock.
2747000	2749000	But it's like, uh, I have this thing called work
2749000	2751000	and I gotta kinda do that.
2751000	2754000	Uh, I know that's lunchtime, but, like,
2754000	2756000	I gotta get all the way to the park and back.
2756000	2758000	It's, like, I don't know about that.
2758000	2761000	So, that was weird that they started doing EX raids on Monday,
2761000	2763000	but, anyway.
2763000	2767000	I guess maybe they thought they wanted to mix it up a little bit
2767000	2772000	because, um, some people work on Saturday and Sunday,
2772000	2774000	so maybe they're thinking to mix it up a little bit,
2774000	2776000	but, I don't know, I find it a little bit irritating.
2776000	2780000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
2780000	2782000	As far as housekeeping goes, I don't have a lot for you guys
2782000	2785000	because we should be here live pretty much every week,
2785000	2786000	pretty consistently.
2786000	2788000	We should be here Memorial Day weekend.
2788000	2790000	I don't see us taking that weekend off.
2790000	2793000	I'll check with the co-host, make sure nothing's going on.
2793000	2796000	But the next show we would have off would be June 24th.
2796000	2798000	I'll be out of town on June 24th, so.
2798000	2800000	Otherwise, follow us on Twitter for all latest updates.
2800000	2802000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2802000	2804000	Let's get into gaming news, Loki.
2804000	2809000	So, Microsoft has offered gift, or gaming,
2809000	2812000	or you can actually gift games to other people.
2812000	2815000	So it's like the first modern console to actually offer that.
2815000	2819000	Um, of course, you know, that's been something that's been available on,
2819000	2821000	you know, Steam for the longest time.
2821000	2825000	But now you can actually do that on the Xbox One as well.
2825000	2827000	Um, so that's kind of cool.
2827000	2829000	And there are a few restrictions.
2829000	2833000	They said, um, gifting full-price games is unlimited.
2833000	2837000	And only two discounted games can be gifted within a 14-day period.
2838000	2840000	And up to ten overall.
2841000	2846000	So, um, the games also have to be redeemed in the country that they were purchased in.
2847000	2849000	That's kind of cool that they offer that.
2849000	2852000	Um, my worry, though, with Microsoft at least,
2852000	2855000	is, you know, you remember people were hacking,
2855000	2857000	and I guess that's more EA, though,
2857000	2860000	but people were hacking, you know, Microsoft accounts and stuff
2860000	2865000	to basically buy those, uh, card packs and stuff like that.
2865000	2868000	So, what's to stop somebody from, like, you know,
2868000	2871000	hacking your account to buy some games for themselves and gift them?
2871000	2876000	Well, but then it would be very obvious whose account they went to,
2876000	2880000	and that would be a whole, uh, very easily traceable, I think, Loki.
2880000	2881000	I guess, but...
2881000	2883000	And you could make that same argument about, like, Steam today,
2883000	2886000	and I don't think that's happening a lot a lot, at least nobody I know.
2886000	2889000	That'd be my only concern, but other than that, I mean, yeah, that's cool.
2889000	2892000	I wish all of them offered that kind of service, but...
2893000	2895000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
2895000	2897000	I'm reading your comments a lot tonight, Bobby.
2897000	2899000	I think he's catching up on being gone for a few weeks.
2899000	2901000	Uh, Bobby says, I've gifted Xbox One games.
2901000	2903000	I bought the digital code from Amazon and sent it.
2903000	2905000	I suppose that's an option.
2905000	2907000	That is absolutely...
2907000	2911000	Guess what? That trick also works on, like, PlayStation 4 cards,
2911000	2913000	uh, and, like, Nintendo.
2913000	2915000	You know, with Amazon, you can actually just ship a physical game
2915000	2917000	to somebody else's house and say it's a gift,
2917000	2919000	and you did it all digitally.
2919000	2921000	It's not instantaneous.
2921000	2923000	And other companies, I should say, not just Amazon,
2923000	2927000	but other companies, too, because not everything has to be Amazon.
2927000	2929000	Can you do that, like, was it like the Amazon,
2929000	2931000	was it Amazon Now is what they call that?
2931000	2932000	You know, where you, like...
2932000	2934000	Oh, yeah, where they come to your house in, like, two hours?
2934000	2937000	Yeah, can you, like, ship that to somebody and then instantly...
2937000	2940000	Um, I don't know if you can do it to somebody else. I haven't tried.
2940000	2942000	I have used that service for myself,
2942000	2945000	and I know you can get video games, like, day of release and stuff.
2945000	2947000	You can get video games through that.
2947000	2951000	Um, but, uh, I've never tried to send it to somebody else.
2951000	2955000	But I've used regular Amazon to send regular stuff to somebody else.
2955000	2959000	I sent, like, when we had, at my old company, we had Boss's Day,
2959000	2962000	but my boss was in the Los Angeles area at the time,
2962000	2967000	so we sent something to the admin assistant in the L.A. office
2967000	2970000	through Amazon and put the note,
2970000	2972000	Happy Boss's Day, to our boss at the time.
2972000	2974000	So you can do that.
2974000	2977000	It's really easy when you use one of those gift registries,
2977000	2981000	because shout-out to Mel B, a friend of the show,
2981000	2985000	and his wife, also, Mel, because they had a baby.
2985000	2988000	And I don't know, I don't remember if we called that out last week or the week before,
2988000	2991000	but I'll shout it out every week, because I love those guys.
2991000	2994000	I love that kid, so props to them.
2994000	2997000	But they did a gift registry thing, and I was able to ship my gift,
2997000	3000000	just, oh, click that, buy, goes right to their house.
3000000	3001000	Nice.
3001000	3003000	Yeah, anyway.
3003000	3005000	Let's see.
3005000	3008000	Chat over at live.vog network.com, Bobby Blackwell says,
3008000	3010000	My reading registry was on Amazon.
3010000	3012000	People send us stuff from it a lot.
3012000	3014000	Let's see, Sia Tabiri says,
3014000	3018000	My uncle gave me the Sam and Max games for PC the same way.
3018000	3020000	There's that, too.
3020000	3022000	All right.
3022000	3025000	Anyway, so game gifting, that's the thing you can do on Xbox One.
3025000	3029000	So now can I put my wish list up on, like, my,
3029000	3031000	why do I keep going to Justin TV?
3031000	3034000	Like, my brain is stuck in 2007 tonight.
3034000	3037000	I could put my wish list up on Twitch TV,
3037000	3042000	and you could just go buy me games to stream right there.
3042000	3044000	That would be pretty cool. I'd be into that.
3044000	3046000	All right, anyway.
3046000	3049000	I guess that's what people already do, anyway, through, like, Amazon.
3049000	3052000	But I was thinking it would be even more direct with an Xbox One list.
3052000	3053000	All right.
3053000	3055000	Well, anyhow, it looks like there could be a spoiler alert
3055000	3059000	for types of video games that you might digitally buy someone on the Xbox One.
3059000	3061000	This coming year,
3061000	3065000	Walmart Canada unleashed a whole lot onto their websites
3065000	3069000	for unannounced games for their pre-order listings.
3069000	3072000	Some of these games are things that we kind of knew were coming,
3072000	3077000	such as Dragon Quest II, which I think is Builders II.
3077000	3081000	Why would it be the original Dragon, why would that be Dragon Quest Builders II?
3081000	3083000	Unless there's something, I don't know.
3083000	3085000	Let's see, what else in here do we already know about?
3085000	3088000	A new Assassin's Creed game. We knew that was happening, right?
3088000	3091000	What? I thought they were taking a year off, though.
3091000	3094000	Well, most things in this list are things that, like,
3094000	3096000	of course they're going to happen at some point.
3096000	3098000	Maybe they weren't. Maybe that was another year, though.
3098000	3099000	Just Cause 4.
3099000	3102000	Forza Horizon 5 is on this list,
3102000	3106000	but that's also a little weird because wouldn't the next game be Forza Horizon 4?
3106000	3108000	So, hmm, that was on the list.
3108000	3113000	Lego DC Villains, now that's a pretty specific call-out on that list.
3113000	3117000	Borderlands 3, which tons of people have been speculating for this year.
3117000	3119000	Anyway, it's about time.
3119000	3123000	Rage 2, which Bethesda's been...
3123000	3128000	Well, that, I think, is going to be announced very soon.
3128000	3130000	Well, Bethesda's been having a little fun with this leak,
3130000	3135000	because they went to Twitter and started putting pink graffiti all over this
3135000	3137000	and started doing a little, like,
3137000	3140000	Hey, Walmart Canada, you missed some things, and all this stuff.
3140000	3143000	But, like, the fact that that official Twitter account
3143000	3146000	then proceeded to clear all the other tweets off the timeline,
3146000	3148000	except for that, is a little bit like...
3148000	3152000	Well, there's another countdown tweet or something that they have, too,
3152000	3154000	so that's going to be announced in a few days, I think.
3154000	3159000	Yeah. So, anyway, this was all there.
3159000	3163000	Some folks thinking, why would Forza Horizon be happening so soon?
3163000	3168000	Because, supposedly, the Forza Horizon studio is said to be working on Fable 4.
3168000	3171000	No reason they didn't send it off to yet another studio.
3171000	3175000	They didn't pass off Horizon to somebody else to just make a new game in 3's engine.
3175000	3177000	You know?
3177000	3181000	And I'm a sucker for that series. I'll probably buy it.
3181000	3183000	Doesn't really matter who makes it.
3183000	3185000	Is it going to have the kick-ass soundtrack?
3185000	3188000	Is it the same, like, awesome graphics and arcade gameplay and all that?
3188000	3190000	I'll probably buy it. It's going to be very hard to miss that.
3190000	3192000	I'll get it on PC.
3192000	3196000	Yeah. And Bobby Blackwolf points out, studios do work on multiple games at a time.
3196000	3200000	That is true. Studios are capable of working on more than one game at a time.
3200000	3202000	It does happen.
3202000	3206000	So, yeah, Dragon Quest 2, again, also called out as weird.
3206000	3209000	It could be Heroes 2. I forgot about that.
3209000	3215000	It could be Heroes 2, Builders 2, which was already confirmed in a Nintendo Switch thing, right?
3215000	3219000	Because they put out Builders 1 on Switch and they confirmed Builders 2 is coming to Switch, right?
3219000	3221000	I don't remember.
3221000	3223000	I feel like that's a thing they did.
3223000	3225000	And then it could be Dragon Quest 11.
3225000	3227000	But, yeah, anyway.
3227000	3229000	So there you go.
3229000	3232000	Some lists from Walmart Canada.
3232000	3234000	There were also some games that we knew about.
3234000	3240000	Metroid Prime 4, Beyond Good and Evil 2, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which maybe indicates it is this year.
3240000	3242000	Who knows?
3242000	3244000	So what do you think?
3244000	3246000	Something to this?
3246000	3254000	Is there any kind of app where they're filling up their database to get those pre-orders because GameStop would let you pre-order a PlayStation 5 today if you want?
3254000	3256000	Well, no.
3256000	3260000	I don't think that they're just filling up their database with bogus information.
3260000	3262000	I think that they probably have...
3262000	3271000	Maybe they're doing planning for fourth quarter stuff and so they're adding stuff that they probably weren't supposed to be adding stuff to the database or weren't supposed to be making it public.
3271000	3274000	So probably some of it's legit, but it's...
3274000	3277000	You have limited insight from your past experience in the distribution world.
3277000	3281000	Now, granted, I know you never did Walmart, but would you guys get titles?
3281000	3285000	You did because that's when the whole Katamari shit happened.
3285000	3289000	Yes, we know when stuff's coming out well before it comes out.
3289000	3291000	Usually they could have...
3291000	3303000	Which for those that are newer to the show, one of the points when this show was on all the blogs is when we had a little insider information that there was a game called Beautiful Katamari coming out.
3303000	3305000	On the 360.
3305000	3308000	And it hadn't been reported anywhere else yet.
3312000	3314000	And it caused some headaches.
3314000	3315000	It caused some headaches.
3315000	3316000	That's in the past.
3316000	3317000	It is in the past.
3317000	3319000	I'm free to talk about whatever now because I don't know shit.
3319000	3321000	Yeah, you can talk about shit. You can talk about whatever you want now.
3321000	3323000	But no, so they had...
3323000	3327000	There could be different planning things.
3327000	3329000	I'm trying to think. I know they do.
3329000	3336000	There's a couple different events that go on throughout the early part of the year before E3 usually.
3336000	3338000	There's...
3338000	3340000	Oh, what's the PlayStation one?
3340000	3344000	There's the PlayStation 1 destination PlayStation.
3344000	3347000	And then there's a Microsoft event that they hold as well.
3348000	3357000	And that's more of a retail partner event that they do to kind of plan strategies, work out deals for different incentives and stuff like that.
3357000	3360000	That's where you get your pre-order bonus stuff worked out and stuff.
3360000	3365000	So it could be that some information that they got from one of those.
3365000	3369000	They may have had like, okay, here's our roadmap for 2018 or whatever.
3369000	3370000	And it had some titles on it.
3370000	3374000	They may not have been given the full details of when stuff's coming out.
3374000	3382000	But they had a list and so someone jumped the gun and put all that in their database so that they could, I don't know, do something.
3382000	3388000	And unfortunately, usually they get called out on it and they have to pull it back and someone gets in trouble.
3388000	3393000	So it's likely that that's what the case is.
3393000	3400000	It's something like that where here's the stuff that we have coming and maybe they put it in the system.
3400000	3406000	Typically, they won't just like put things that are complete rumor and speculation in there.
3406000	3408000	Not to say it's impossible, though.
3409000	3414000	I'm looking at some of the funny tweets that happened as a response to this.
3414000	3422000	Somebody had tweeted one of the guys that's on the team that makes Doom with Pete, where's the next Doom?
3422000	3425000	And he responded, go buy a Magic 8-Ball at Walmart and ask it.
3425000	3432000	So I think some people in the industry had their feathers a little ruffled with this information.
3432000	3434000	Let me ask this question.
3434000	3438000	I'm going to do a little 180 on this story a little bit, but I want to open this up to chat as well.
3438000	3439000	I want your thoughts on this.
3439000	3440000	And not just Bobby.
3440000	3441000	I want all your thoughts.
3441000	3443000	We love Bobby, but I've been reading him a lot tonight.
3443000	3445000	All you guys, I want to know your thoughts on this.
3445000	3449000	Do we still need to have these types of secrets in the industry?
3449000	3452000	Why is the game industry so fucking secretive?
3452000	3457000	Because they don't want to spoil their announcements.
3457000	3459000	But what's the big deal?
3459000	3460000	The movie industry.
3460000	3465000	I mean, the game industry is not what it was all these years ago, you know, and so forth.
3465000	3469000	And yes, I also understand it makes years upon years upon years to make a game.
3469000	3470000	I get that.
3470000	3476000	But we know what Marvel Disney films are coming out for the next three years.
3476000	3478000	We know that already.
3478000	3485000	So, what's the big fucking deal if we know, like, Square Enix, I'll pick on them for no good reason.
3485000	3488000	What's the problem if we know their trajectory for the next three years?
3488000	3489000	Well, we do for some of it.
3489000	3491000	I mean, we know that some stuff's coming.
3491000	3496000	But thankfully, unlike, you know, movies, they don't tend to delay movies a ton.
3496000	3501000	Whereas games just keep on rolling, keep on coming.
3501000	3503000	Like, when the fuck is Crackdown coming down?
3503000	3505000	They move movies around all the time.
3505000	3506000	I understand that.
3506000	3512000	That's an art in itself, is the art of the release date and predicting box office and all that.
3512000	3517000	And how one movie moving will have a snowball effect on everything else.
3517000	3518000	I don't know.
3518000	3521000	I think that they want to keep some stuff as a surprise.
3521000	3528000	And, you know, that way competition can have as little time as possible to react to things.
3528000	3530000	I mean, I don't know.
3530000	3535000	Why do they do anything, honestly?
3535000	3541000	The YYR in chat says, if you announce a game too early, how are you going to build hype?
3541000	3543000	It stalls and sputters.
3543000	3544000	Well, but the movie industry's doing it.
3544000	3547000	They do it with posters hung up at the movie theater.
3547000	3552000	They do it with, you know, little stills, production stills that come out from the set.
3552000	3557000	And, oh my gosh, somebody snapped a picture of what Captain Marvel looks like because she was seen on set and all this stuff.
3557000	3559000	Like, that's kind of where that hype, interviews, things like that.
3559000	3563000	The thing is, they don't want their, like, they're doing these announcements soon.
3563000	3569000	They're doing these at E3, and they just don't want to have it spoiled already because it's supposed to be exciting.
3569000	3572000	People get hyped up, like, oh my god, I didn't know that was coming, you know.
3572000	3578000	Yeah, but if the trailer's really fun, like, let's say something like Rage 2, which maybe some people, if they're hearing that, are kind of going,
3578000	3582000	okay, that makes sense, but maybe not something they would have predicted that Bethesda would have done.
3582000	3586000	Like, I think we talked lightly about what could be Bethesda's thing.
3586000	3590000	And if it's Rage 2, the only bummer about, I'm going to tell you the real bummer about Rage 2, though,
3590000	3596000	is that means it's probably that and not Elder Scrolls 6, which was kind of like what I was trying to get hyped for this year.
3596000	3600000	No, it's not. Rage 2 is not going to be their big game. Rage wasn't even a big game.
3600000	3606000	Rage is like, oh, it's supposed to be such a revolutionary engine, and everyone's like, yeah, but the game's not very good.
3606000	3609000	I don't know. I don't think that's going to be a big deal.
3609000	3617000	And Bobby Blackwell points out, again with a good comment, because needling Loki tonight, Ready Player One was delayed.
3618000	3620000	It was, but it was so worth it.
3622000	3624000	And that happens to some video games, too, right?
3624000	3630000	Like, I think we've gotten to the point where, like, Nintendo delays a game and we're like, alright, well, just make it good.
3630000	3632000	Right? Zelda Breath of the Wild, case in point.
3632000	3637000	That game got delayed so they could put it on the Switch as well, and anybody complaining about that now?
3637000	3641000	Nope, because that game is fucking fire, right?
3641000	3645000	And, you know, if this new Smash Brothers gets delayed so they can get it right, you think people,
3645000	3648000	people will probably complain there's, you know, for a little bit, there's nothing out at Christmas,
3648000	3652000	but at the same time, when that game comes out, all the complaining is going to stop.
3652000	3659000	Yeah, you better stop complaining. You got, you got this generous offering of virtual, I mean, sorry, not virtual console games.
3659000	3661000	I thought we were done.
3661000	3664000	We're never done. This is going to go on for months.
3664000	3666000	Next story, Loki.
3667000	3671000	Anyways, let's switch topics here.
3671000	3675000	I agree with Dr. C. Oh, here we go again. No, no, putting the break on.
3675000	3679000	I need, I need a little light or something. Well, that doesn't really work for a podcast.
3679000	3685000	Maybe I need a sound effect. I need something for when Loki starts that fucking, I need like a stop sound effect or something.
3685000	3690000	Is there like a funny sound effect of somebody going like, stop, or something?
3690000	3694000	It's like me during the week with the kids.
3694000	3699000	Just stop. I don't care about whatever Power Rangers thing you're showing me.
3699000	3703000	It's like, I get it. Yes. There were different seasons. Yes.
3703000	3707000	These Power Rangers was different. Yes, I get it. I've seen. Stop.
3707000	3711000	Like just trying to sit here. I have a headache because you kids just keep talking to me.
3711000	3715000	All right. Star Trek, red alert sound.
3715000	3719000	Okay. That's the best suggestion I see so far. Chat like a little like that.
3719000	3723000	Like that is hilarious. Star Trek red alert sound. I'm going to see what I can do about that.
3723000	3728000	All right. In the meantime, Loki is going to switch topics and we're going to talk about the PlayStation four.
3728000	3738000	So the PlayStation four, you may remember that they just did a release of the remastered version of Parappa the rapper and hackers gonna hack.
3738000	3744000	And so hackers discovered that, hey, guess what? That Parappa the rapper version that's on the PlayStation four.
3744000	3750000	Yeah, it's actually just running the 2006 PSP version through a PSP emulator.
3751000	3760000	And as a result, hackers have now jail who have jailbroken PlayStation fours are seeing what other games they can run through that emulator.
3760000	3767000	So they've actually run games like Loco Roco, Potapon.
3767000	3771000	You know, some other it looks like.
3771000	3778000	Yeah, it was a they're saying that maybe that they can do some homebrew products or projects with it, like him playing.
3778000	3783000	There's a PSP HD or something like that.
3783000	3796000	That's interesting. And so the one thing the emulator does do that's different than other things is it's possible to swap out original textures from the UMD version of the game with a higher resolution one.
3796000	3803000	So that's why, despite the fact that the PSP version of Parappa the rapper looked different on the PSP, it was the older graphics.
3803000	3808000	The remastered version is more well, it's higher resolution graphics.
3808000	3811000	So that's interesting that they could do something like that.
3811000	3818000	Did they only look at Parappa or did they look at like Patapon because that was also on PSP and they also brought that to PlayStation four.
3818000	3821000	So I'm sure the same party trick being used.
3821000	3827000	No, they only looked at Parappa the rapper, they did get Patapon to run on that emulator.
3827000	3829000	So, uh huh.
3829000	3832000	It's interesting, but.
3832000	3837000	Yeah, and they even have a screenshot that's showing, you know, Patapon on there.
3837000	3843000	So it makes the question once again, it's like, OK, you have this emulator that's capable of running these PSP games.
3843000	3846000	Why can't they purchase these games?
3846000	3852000	Oh, I'm sorry. You can't because PlayStation now.
3852000	3854000	Yes.
3854000	3856000	Awesome.
3856000	3858000	It's not going to get me to stop there.
3858000	3862000	I'm going to let him continue on this because it's Sony for a change.
3862000	3864000	So go ahead. Go ahead.
3864000	3867000	No, that's all I had. I mean, it's just frustrating.
3867000	3870000	And actually, and to be fair, I actually kind of agree.
3870000	3873000	Like, you know, you can give Nintendo all that shit.
3873000	3879000	But hold up, because here is Sony like showing, look, we could do PSP on the PlayStation four,
3879000	3882000	but we're only going to do it in these particular circumstances.
3882000	3885000	Like, to be fair, they need to get.
3885000	3887000	But we've been giving this shit for forever for this.
3887000	3892000	We know damn well the PlayStation four can run PS one and PS two games.
3892000	3893000	They just don't want to let you.
3893000	3896000	Of course they can. A PSP can run PlayStation one games.
3896000	3902000	They could probably take a PlayStation one game emulated through the PSP emulator
3902000	3904000	and then run it through the PlayStation four.
3904000	3908000	Let's emulate the PSP, which is emulating the PlayStation one.
3908000	3910000	I'll press all the graphics.
3910000	3913000	All right.
3913000	3920000	Let's move on and continue a discussion on Sony talking about what they have in plans for store for E3 this year.
3920000	3924000	It sounds like E3 for Sony might be a little bit different this year.
3924000	3929000	How would you feel about a different tone for one of the big three press conferences this year?
3929000	3931000	Is the tone going to be backwards compatibility?
3931000	3933000	Because what's the tone going to be?
3933000	3935000	What's the tonal shift going to be in here?
3935000	3937000	More games that are going to announce it.
3937000	3939000	I don't know when they're coming out.
3939000	3941000	They've had so many games they've announced.
3941000	3942000	Shut up.
3942000	3944000	Let me tell you more about what it is.
3944000	3945000	All right.
3945000	3947000	So you guys are going to be so mad you gave me that sound effect.
3947000	3948000	All right.
3948000	3950000	So this was in the PlayStation blog cast.
3950000	3956000	And what happened is that Sony is taking kind of a different angle on how we're bringing it out
3956000	3962000	and trying to refresh and remake and reignite what used to be called a press conference for E3.
3962000	3969000	So in this PlayStation blog cast, Sean Layden, of course the CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America,
3969000	3980000	said that there will be deep dives into Death Stranding, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel's Spider-Man, and The Last of Us Part II.
3980000	3984000	There will be no hardware announcement at E3 this year.
3984000	3988000	So those of you hoping for the PlayStation 5 this early, I think were...
3988000	3989000	No.
3989000	3991000	No, it was never going to happen this early.
3991000	3993000	Those of you that were hoping for the Vita 2.
3993000	3994000	No.
3994000	3995000	Vita what?
3995000	3996000	Yeah, exactly.
3996000	3997000	Exactly.
3997000	4003000	So how would you feel about maybe instead of like announcement, announcement, announcement, which was kind of like Sony's biggest year,
4003000	4008000	maybe Sony's going to do a little bit more of a deep dive and spend more time with certain games,
4008000	4011000	which it sounds to me if they're going to do a deep dive with Death...
4011000	4013000	I don't know why I keep using that term, but that's what comes to mind.
4013000	4019000	If they're going to go further with Death Stranding, that tells me it's going to finally be some fucking playable footage.
4019000	4022000	So we know, what the fuck is this game?
4022000	4023000	Right?
4023000	4027000	Because that's the thing I've been reading this game for is that, okay, look, I get it.
4027000	4029000	A plus cast, A plus talent.
4029000	4030000	Wow, it looks like a mindfuck. Cool.
4030000	4031000	Okay, yes.
4031000	4032000	Oh, pregnant man.
4032000	4033000	This is crazy.
4033000	4034000	What the fuck?
4034000	4036000	You know, okay, where's the fucking game?
4036000	4037000	Right?
4037000	4038000	The same thing I have with No Man's Sky.
4038000	4039000	I'd be fine with...
4039000	4041000	So it sounds like we'll get to see the fucking game this E3.
4041000	4042000	Some of these games, some of them I just don't really care about.
4042000	4045000	Some of them I just don't really care to see a deep dive in like Spider-Man.
4045000	4048000	I mean, we've seen enough deep dives in that already.
4048000	4051000	There must be DLC or something happening for...
4051000	4052000	Well, Spider-Man's not out yet.
4052000	4053000	Oh, that's right.
4053000	4054000	So that's coming out in September.
4054000	4055000	That's one of the big games in the show.
4055000	4057000	But still though, I've seen so much gameplay footage of it.
4057000	4058000	It's like, I get it.
4058000	4061000	It's a cool looking game, but do we really need this?
4061000	4064000	I mean, I guess they do because it's a first party title, so why not?
4064000	4065000	But...
4065000	4071000	Last of Us Part II though, if that game is out this year, if that's Sony's big holiday release for this year,
4071000	4076000	it totally makes sense where that's going to be their number one breadwinner at E3 this year.
4076000	4078000	It's going to be Last of Us Part II for sure.
4078000	4079000	Because I'm sure a ton of people...
4079000	4081000	Death Stranding would be amazing.
4081000	4087000	They're kind of both there, but Death Stranding, again, this is not going to be Death Stranding's first show at the rodeo.
4087000	4091000	I also understand it's not the first time for Last of Us Part II, but I feel like one of them has been teased...
4091000	4094000	Or the other zombie game that they had that who knows what it's called.
4094000	4095000	Was that the Ghost of Tsushima?
4095000	4096000	I don't remember which one that was.
4096000	4097000	No, that was the Ghost of Tsushima.
4097000	4098000	That was...
4098000	4099000	Is it Days Gone?
4099000	4100000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4100000	4102000	That was the one they showed twice last year, right?
4102000	4103000	They were like, here it is.
4103000	4105000	And then they were like, here's the beginning.
4105000	4107000	We're going to show more of Days Gone.
4107000	4109000	It was like, okay, clearly something was deleted here.
4109000	4112000	Red Dead 2.
4112000	4115000	Yeah, Red Dead 2 was deleted from this part of the presentation.
4115000	4122000	Anyway, also they do say that Sony is going to focus on third-party publishers and indie studios.
4122000	4125000	It will be June 11th at 6 o'clock, of course.
4125000	4129000	And everywhere where you watch these things like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4129000	4131000	Probably not Mixer.
4131000	4133000	It's probably the one place you won't be able to see this is Mixer.
4133000	4135000	And I'm not shading Mixer.
4135000	4137000	It's just that Mixer is Microsoft's thing.
4137000	4140000	I would hope that they're doing something with VR.
4140000	4143000	I mean, can I get a new...
4143000	4147000	I think it would be great if you could watch the Sony thing in VR.
4147000	4148000	That would be cool.
4148000	4152000	Since we got to go that one year, that one year we got to go see the press thing live.
4152000	4153000	At least for me.
4153000	4155000	I got to see it that one year live.
4155000	4157000	And I don't even remember.
4157000	4158000	What was the big thing?
4158000	4160000	Bobby, what was the thing they announced that year?
4160000	4162000	We went to the PlayStation thing.
4162000	4164000	It was not the big year.
4164000	4176000	It was not that year where everybody's like scream-crying at Last of Us and Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Shenmue 3 and all that shit.
4176000	4180000	It was not that year, but it was like the year before or the year after.
4180000	4186000	It was the year that they had Entwined was the very first thing they announced.
4186000	4189000	That was the game that was like... I just remember being there for that.
4189000	4191000	Anyways, somebody can look at that.
4191000	4194000	Just tell me what year Entwined came out. That was the year we were there.
4194000	4201000	So anyway, the reason why I say that is that what you don't really get sitting at home watching it,
4201000	4203000	at least when it was in that venue.
4203000	4204000	Now, they've moved venues since then.
4204000	4209000	That was when it was at the old Olympic Coliseum, was this event.
4209000	4212000	And so it was like all around you.
4212000	4217000	You had the trailer on the big screen, but if you looked to the left, you'd see stills.
4217000	4219000	If you looked to the right, you'd see more stills.
4219000	4222000	There'd be lasers, lights, all around for the ambiance.
4222000	4225000	And I think that would actually translate very well into VR.
4225000	4228000	If Sony wanted to do a VR presentation.
4228000	4231000	But can they stream VR video?
4231000	4235000	That would be pretty cool if they pulled that off.
4236000	4242000	Alright, Bobby says Far Cry 4 first gameplay, No Man's Sky's debut,
4242000	4246000	and Destiny launching on PlayStation 4 first. That was all 2014.
4246000	4250000	I think that was the last year I did E3. It was 2014.
4252000	4255000	There it is. So I think a VR experience would be very cool.
4255000	4259000	Yes, an Uncharted 4 closed out the show. Yes, I remember that now. I remember.
4259000	4260000	I remember.
4261000	4264000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade,
4264000	4267000	use the passphrase, truck.
4267000	4272000	Alright, just another story for you, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
4272000	4274000	But Loki is going to start this off.
4274000	4279000	So this isn't uncommon with different software companies and stuff like that.
4279000	4286000	But Seem, they're basically having a bug bounty, offering white hat hackers
4287000	4295000	to find vulnerabilities with the service, and offering payouts for those that can document that stuff.
4295000	4302000	So it's interesting. Apparently, they're using the CVSS system,
4302000	4309000	so the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, and based on the success the hackers have,
4309000	4318000	they will be earning between $200 to up to $2,000 per each exploit that they can report on.
4318000	4327000	So I mean, it's interesting. It's nice to see that they're taking steps to try to improve security and stuff.
4327000	4331000	But yeah, it's not unheard of.
4331000	4337000	I mean, I know you don't go as into the weeds with hacking as to what it probably takes to do this stuff,
4337000	4340000	but I'm kind of surprised you've never tried your hand at some of this stuff.
4340000	4341000	I don't know what I'm doing.
4341000	4343000	It's a little too hard mode, huh?
4343000	4348000	Yeah, I don't care. Why would I want to do that?
4348000	4354000	Well, it's nice to hear a little financial incentive for some of the folks that want to make sure your information is secure,
4354000	4359000	and your games and all that, especially in this day and age where it seems like every other day
4359000	4362000	some company's having a fucking breach of information, right?
4362000	4368000	And then the thing that really kills me is when the company that's supposed to hold all your information had a breach of information.
4368000	4370000	That was like Equifax, right?
4370000	4374000	Or yeah, or they were going to be like, oh, by the way, that breach is even bigger.
4374000	4376000	Oh, and by the way, that breach was even bigger.
4376000	4378000	Oh, did I mention it was even bigger?
4378000	4384000	So it is kind of nice because Steam did have an issue, I still remember, a while ago.
4384000	4389000	Didn't they have a breach where you were getting pages that weren't your own and all this stuff?
4389000	4391000	That happened at the end of last year.
4391000	4393000	That's more of a mistake than a breach.
4393000	4397000	Well, anyway, so it's nice to see that they are trying to take measures to prevent that
4397000	4402000	and get some of the hackers to do some good things with their skills when it comes to hacking.
4402000	4405000	Skills that admittedly we do not have here at Orange Mountains Radio.
4405000	4406000	Nope.
4406000	4412000	But we do have the skills once a week to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that we want to talk about tonight.
4413000	4417000	Because you should be playing this game. It's the classic game of the week.
4417000	4423000	And once a week, excuse me, once a week, every week during the month, except the time she does peripherals,
4423000	4429000	Dark Soccer jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking this game out.
4429000	4433000	But, well, Dark Soccer's not here tonight. She's hanging out with drag queens.
4433000	4435000	Choices.
4435000	4439000	So, anyway, I'm going to be picking the classic game of the week tonight.
4439000	4441000	And I picked one that I hope you guys will enjoy.
4442000	4450000	Maybe some of you will recognize a port, a very infamous port of this game, just from the lovely opening tune.
4450000	4457000	Because the music in this game, when it finally got music, was so freaking good.
4457000	4463000	Because the port of SimCity on the Super Nintendo was so good.
4463000	4466000	And that's what I picked for the classic game of the week tonight is SimCity.
4466000	4473000	So, I do want to technically say SimCity was on a ton, the original SimCity was on, like, 20 different platforms.
4473000	4477000	Super Nintendo was one of them. It was probably the only, like, console.
4477000	4479000	Well, I don't know. The Game Boy Advance got it, I think.
4479000	4484000	But, like, SimCity goes all the way back to the Commodore 64.
4484000	4487000	SimCity goes back to, like, PC DOS.
4487000	4491000	SimCity was on the ZX Spectrum. It was, like, on every system at the time.
4491000	4494000	So, but Super Nintendo was just one of the more memorable ones.
4494000	4499000	And it makes for a better soundtrack to listen to in the background while I talk a little bit about SimCity.
4499000	4502000	Because, obviously, this was the game that started a series.
4502000	4506000	This, I mean, SimCity is why we have The Sims today.
4506000	4508000	I mean, this is all, what it all comes from.
4508000	4516000	And SimCity was so successful, we had, what, SimEarth, SimAnt, we got all the fucking SimTowers, SimTower, all that stuff.
4516000	4518000	Anyway, what is SimCity? What do you do in SimCity?
4518000	4528000	Well, SimCity, which was released in February of 1989, was, and I think the first version was Commodore 64, if I'm not mistaken.
4528000	4531000	I have to, yeah, the first version was the Commodore 64.
4531000	4535000	It was developed in 1985, but not published for another four years.
4535000	4539000	So you know it's near and dear to my heart because it was a Commodore 64 game.
4539000	4542000	So, in SimCity, of course, you're trying to build a city.
4542000	4546000	And it was different because it was a little more sandboxy.
4546000	4552000	You didn't really have a specific goal, like, you didn't, like, there was no win condition, per se.
4552000	4555000	At least the goal wasn't to just destroy my city all the time with Godzilla.
4555000	4556000	And maybe that was your goal.
4556000	4558000	So, it depended.
4558000	4563000	I think when they finally put it on the Super Nintendo, it was like, oh, you get little rewards for being like a metropolis and things like that.
4563000	4566000	So they did try to put some goals and gamify it a little more.
4566000	4569000	But, in the original SimCity, it was just, you know, it was a little more of a sandbox.
4569000	4572000	It was, you know, build this city up and manage it.
4573000	4575000	So, as you build your city, you can build power plants.
4575000	4582000	And probably the biggest, you know, element was that you could zone areas as commercial, industrial, or residential.
4582000	4584000	And you can add parks and things like that.
4584000	4587000	And you can even get in there and change the tax rate.
4587000	4589000	Make sure everything's getting power.
4589000	4593000	Build light rail, rail systems, as well as roads.
4593000	4595000	Other ways to enhance your cities.
4595000	4601000	So, as you do this, and probably why people love this game, is that you would actually see your city grow.
4601000	4604000	And that you would see little houses in your residential district.
4604000	4608000	And then those houses would turn into mid-rises, which would turn into high-rises.
4608000	4611000	And you would start to see your city get bigger and bigger.
4611000	4614000	And sometimes the commercial buildings would be churches or hospitals.
4614000	4616000	You don't really know what they are until they show up.
4616000	4618000	And I think that was part of the fun of the game.
4618000	4622000	Well, I thought you could actually put down either fire departments or police.
4622000	4623000	Some of them, yeah.
4623000	4626000	Fire departments, police departments specifically were like special things.
4626000	4632000	But I think when it came to things like hospitals and churches, at least in the first version of the game, you couldn't place those.
4632000	4634000	They were just commercial things.
4634000	4635000	Got it.
4635000	4638000	Yeah, and sometimes a strip mall might show up. You just don't know.
4638000	4646000	So, anyway, the industrial areas, the more of them you have, the more pollution you get.
4646000	4649000	You have too much pollution, it keeps the residential people away.
4649000	4652000	You keep the residential people away, then the commercial people don't want to develop.
4653000	4658000	So there's this interesting kind of like rock-paper-scissors thing that goes on in trying to build your city efficiently.
4658000	4660000	And everybody has their own way to build it.
4660000	4666000	So, anyway, later on when they did this for the Super Nintendo, you got even more special shit.
4666000	4668000	You could do a mayor's mansion, you could do a casino.
4668000	4671000	So the Super Nintendo kind of threw a Mario statue I think was there too.
4671000	4674000	They threw some extra stuff in to kind of spice it up.
4674000	4677000	Especially because the Super Nintendo version wasn't until the mid-90s.
4677000	4679000	So this game was a few years old at that point.
4679000	4681000	So they wanted to spice it up a little bit and give it that Nintendo touch.
4682000	4689000	However, the big part of this game where people got really crazy with it is kind of where Loki's talking about.
4689000	4691000	You might have disasters.
4691000	4698000	Your town could flood, you could have a tornado, there might be a fire or an earthquake or a monster attack.
4698000	4700000	Like Godzilla attacks your town.
4700000	4701000	Or a nuclear meltdown.
4701000	4705000	Yeah, or a nuclear meltdown, which can happen to your power plant every so often.
4705000	4710000	I should also say with the monster attack in the Super Nintendo version again, what we're hearing in the background,
4710000	4713000	Bowser would be the monster that would attack your city.
4713000	4716000	So that was really cute, the way they incorporated all that.
4716000	4719000	There were also scenarios that you could play.
4719000	4724000	And so that was a little more of the game where you had these goal-centered scenarios that were timed.
4724000	4729000	So for example, I think they had a town that was just a road running through the town.
4729000	4734000	And your goal was to build up that town to 100,000 people in so much time.
4734000	4739000	Or there's a nuclear meltdown that's going to happen in this city and you've got to clean it all up.
4739000	4743000	Or Godzilla's about to attack Tokyo, which, yes, was one of the scenarios.
4743000	4746000	And you have to make sure your city recovers from that and so forth.
4746000	4749000	So it's kind of fun that they have those different scenarios.
4749000	4755000	SimCity was made by Will Wright, infamous designer, and this is part of the reason why he's an infamous designer.
4755000	4757000	Where did he come up with the idea from?
4757000	4761000	It actually came from when he was working on the game Raid on Bungeling Bay.
4761000	4762000	I don't know if I'm saying that right.
4763000	4767000	I always say Bungeling Bay, even though it makes it sound like, you bungled up the bay again!
4770000	4773000	Caitlin, you bungled it up again!
4773000	4779000	Anyway, so Raid on Bungeling Bay was the game he was doing and he kind of found as he was making the game,
4779000	4781000	the map editor was the best part.
4781000	4785000	And in fact, probably very few people remember Raid on Bungeling Bay.
4785000	4786000	I have no idea what that is.
4786000	4790000	It was on the NES, it was like a little shooter game, but you would fly down these little maps.
4790000	4793000	And so Will Wright had to make all those little cities that you were flying over.
4793000	4795000	So he was like, well this is the best part!
4797000	4802000	So anyway, he developed this game and he made it on Commodore 64.
4802000	4806000	It was done in 85, but it was not published until 1989.
4806000	4810000	The original working title of the game was Micropolis.
4810000	4812000	Micropolis, I think is how you would say it.
4812000	4815000	Micropolis. It's micropolis, micropolis.
4815000	4818000	The game could not be won or lost, which made it a little bit unique.
4818000	4821000	And game publishers for that reason didn't really care for it.
4821000	4824000	Finally, Broderbund to the rescue.
4824000	4827000	That's right, the character behind such games as the Print Shop.
4827000	4829000	And publishing the Guardian Legend on the NES.
4829000	4833000	Broderbund saved the day and published the title when Will Wright proposed it.
4833000	4836000	And there you go, that was that.
4836000	4842000	So SimCity then signed to Maxis to a distribution deal for both the initial games.
4842000	4846000	And then SimCity came out for Amiga, Macintosh, IBM, Commodore 64.
4846000	4848000	I mean, it was just everywhere is where it was.
4848000	4850000	Now it's on iOS too, if you want.
4851000	4855000	So anyway, the Super Nintendo version, I gotta talk about that a little bit.
4855000	4858000	It had its own ideas. Bowser, of course, became Godzilla.
4858000	4864000	Once the city gets to 500,000 people, you get a Mario statue that you can put in the city.
4864000	4870000	There's special buildings like casinos, large parks, amusement parks, expo centers.
4870000	4873000	Some of these came in the sequel, SimCity 2000.
4873000	4877000	You can also do a bank, and that will allow you to take out a loan of $10,000.
4877000	4880000	But you have to pay it back before you can take out another loan.
4880000	4883000	So that's kind of interesting, that was a little feature there.
4883000	4888000	So anyway, it ended up being a million seller, and it was Nintendo's player's choice.
4888000	4893000	Also cute about this, the doctor that would help you through the game was named Dr. Wright.
4893000	4895000	As a little bit of a nod to Will Wright.
4895000	4898000	So that's why he's named Dr. Wright, is after the creator of the game.
4898000	4900000	So, pretty neat.
4900000	4903000	If you want to check out Micropolis, you can do that.
4903000	4910000	Because in January 2008, the source code was released under the free GPL3 license.
4910000	4912000	So, yeah, that's pretty cool.
4912000	4916000	So if you want to see the Micropolis source code, it's already been translated to C++ and so forth.
4916000	4923000	So, Micropolis, you can pretty much do whatever you want, but you can't call it SimCity because of EA's trademarks.
4923000	4928000	Because what I'm not going to talk about is what happened to SimCity years later.
4928000	4930000	We're going to just focus on the original.
4930000	4932000	No one wants to remember that.
4932000	4934000	Keep a memory of the good times.
4934000	4937000	This game won awards upon awards upon awards.
4937000	4941000	Best entertainment, best educational, best simulation.
4941000	4945000	This game won a shit ton of awards because, I mean, it left a legacy.
4945000	4950000	Here you go. Do you want to know what Sim games came out after SimCity?
4950000	4951000	You ready?
4951000	4952000	Sure.
4952000	4954000	See if you can name them all.
4954000	4967000	SimEarth, SimFarm, SimTown, SimCopter, SimAnt, SimLife, SimIsle, SimTower, SimPark, SimSafari, Streets of SimCity, and The Sims.
4967000	4971000	By the way, did you know they made a Simsville and a SimMars that they never released?
4974000	4976000	There was a lot of fucking Sims.
4976000	4982000	And probably my favorite in that entire list is SimAnt, which will have to be a classic game of the week another week.
4982000	4985000	Because I could talk another 15 minutes about SimAnt.
4985000	4991000	I should note SimEarth, though, was probably the biggest little spin-off game that they had that was kind of like the next one that happened.
4991000	4996000	Not to be confused with the direct sequels, but SimEarth was kind of like the next one that happened.
4996000	5000000	And SimEarth, they also did on Super Nintendo at one point.
5000000	5002000	And it was really complicated.
5002000	5006000	I think that's why it probably didn't do as well, because it was a lot harder to understand.
5006000	5010000	You know what I mean? These games were really crazy.
5010000	5017000	Anyway, I should talk about some sequels that came out after SimCity.
5017000	5028000	There was SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4, which had an expansion called Rush Hour, and then the reboot in 2013 that we don't talk about.
5028000	5039000	Because EA, once again, and as we talk about EA's bad decisions in 2018, EA made a very bad decision in 2013 that I believe caused Maxis to go under, if I'm not mistaken.
5039000	5040000	If I'm not mistaken, right?
5040000	5041000	Yes.
5041000	5043000	Yeah, because that's what EA has done. Anyway.
5045000	5054000	But SimCity, the original game, has left quite its legacy on gaming and was absolutely noteworthy to bring up tonight on the show.
5054000	5058000	So there it is, your classic game of the week, SimCity.
5059000	5071000	However, I could really, really, really not stop talking about this until I talk about the port of SimCity that was released on CD-ROM in 1994 by Interplay Productions.
5071000	5079000	When they upped it to 256 color graphics, new music and sound effects, and full motion video.
5079000	5088000	That's right. Full motion. Horrible, horrible full motion video interspersed in for when certain things would happen to your town.
5091000	5093000	And it was pretty ridiculous.
5094000	5096000	We need to locate her someday.
5096000	5105000	Find the actual people that did some of the full motion videos and all that?
5105000	5106000	SimCity Action News.
5106000	5110000	Let's see. For example, here's what happens if you build too many nuclear power plants.
5110000	5112000	Watch residential zoning two...
5112000	5117000	Uh oh. That was supposed to be from the enhanced CD-ROM. I don't know if that was...
5117000	5122000	Oh yeah, it's like a full motion video from the CD-ROM. Oh no, here it is, here it is. This is the video I was looking for.
5122000	5140000	These full motion videos ran at like five frames a second.
5140000	5147000	Finally in the news, 90 year old Yancy Kornblatz was arrested last night for flashing for the 79th time.
5147000	5152000	Kornblatz told the court that he was going to retire, but decided to stick it out one more year.
5155000	5161000	We've just received an emergency report that a serious meltdown has occurred at the SimCity nuclear power plant.
5161000	5165000	Plant may reach critical mass at any moment and explode.
5165000	5170000	Above all, do not panic. Repeat, do not panic. Stay calm.
5170000	5176000	Even though radiation may fear our flesh and turn us all into slipping slices of human spam, everything will be just peaking.
5176000	5178000	Do not panic.
5178000	5182000	They've gotta have, I gotta imagine that...
5182000	5183000	Who is she?
5183000	5193000	They have to have, like I bet if we find somehow, through the magic of eBay, a boxed copy of that, they've gotta have like an instruction manual.
5194000	5195000	That has all the people in it.
5195000	5196000	Yeah, that's a good point.
5196000	5198000	Just no one probably is like, who the fuck would want me to pick one?
5198000	5203000	I know, I'd send this email to somebody's agent and they'd be like, the fuck?
5205000	5210000	Who wants to talk about SimCity from 24 years ago?
5213000	5216000	God damn it, here at Orange Lounge Radio, we do.
5216000	5218000	We're asking the hard hand questions here.
5218000	5220000	We would record all of the bumpers.
5220000	5223000	Oh, SSJ100Matt thinks he has a name.
5225000	5231000	Because I feel, this has come up on OLR before, so somebody probably already did this research.
5231000	5234000	Oh my god, it is, this is it, this is the name.
5234000	5236000	This is her, Stephanie Fargo.
5236000	5240000	Alright, yep, because she's got an actress, she's got one credit to her name.
5240000	5245000	And that is the SimCity enhanced CD-ROM as Carol Davenport, the SimAction news anchor.
5245000	5248000	So we have a name, I'll do my best to track her down.
5248000	5250000	Thank you IMDB.
5251000	5254000	She's gotta have a Twitter, everybody's got a Twitter, right?
5255000	5258000	Anyway, alright, thank you SSJ100Matt.
5258000	5263000	SSJ100Matt said we already did this, we tracked this down a while ago, and that was as far as we got as we got a name.
5263000	5267000	So, I just, it's been 730 episodes y'all, I don't remember everything.
5267000	5274000	Alright, we're gonna take a break, but when we come back there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to look forward to, including rapid fire news.
5274000	5276000	We're gonna talk about what's in stores this week.
5276000	5285000	Get to the mailbag, your emails, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we'll also get to the Skype line at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
5285000	5290000	We'll get to all that and more when we come back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5297000	5303000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight, episode number 730 of our show, already in progress.
5303000	5310000	Myself and Loki here in studio with you, DarkSakura, she has the night off, she is visiting DragCon, not to be confused with DragGunCon,
5310000	5317000	which is coming up over Labor Day weekend, where I will be in the Atlanta area, and I'm very much looking forward to that.
5317000	5323000	Anyhow, I think we're gonna get back into some rapid fire news at this point, so Loki, why don't you start us off?
5323000	5326000	Alright, so hey, Bloodstained's coming out sooner than you thought.
5326000	5332000	Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, which is actually an 8-bit spinoff of Bloodstained.
5332000	5339000	But it's coming out May 24th on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Vita, Switch, and Steam.
5339000	5347000	And it's also very similar looking to Castlevania 3, they're even gonna have the ability to switch between characters as well,
5347000	5351000	but it keeps that kind of retro NES art style to it.
5351000	5360000	So I'm looking forward to checking that out, because, yeah, looking forward to the actual main game too, eventually, whenever that comes out.
5360000	5363000	But hey, this one's out in a couple weeks, so look for that.
5363000	5371000	And then, you may remember, with the Switch coming out, they had different means to be able to play the Switch.
5371000	5378000	One is tabletop mode, and it has a really janky-ass kickstand in the back that doesn't really cut it.
5378000	5382000	And if you wanna charge while you're using that kickstand, well, you better just fucking forget it.
5382000	5385000	So Nintendo's decided that, hey, let's go ahead and put out-
5385000	5388000	Loki, how else am I gonna play on the rooftop?
5388000	5391000	Well, the way I have to do it-
5391000	5394000	Remember the first Switch commercial? How else am I gonna play on the rooftop?
5394000	5402000	Yes. So, they have a new stand now that you can actually lean your Switch against that allows it to charge as well.
5402000	5414000	So you can get that stand from Nintendo. It's an official adjustable charging stand for 20 bucks, or one of the many unofficial ones that are available now as well, which is what I'm using.
5414000	5423000	And this doesn't actually- it doesn't look like it- it literally plugs into it, but I don't see that it includes another AC adapter plug or anything like that.
5423000	5428000	I think it's just more of a moving the plug around.
5428000	5435000	So it's kind of like a little piece of plastic, but that also kind of extends- moves the plug around a little bit to help you out, basically.
5435000	5437000	I don't know. I think I got my-
5437000	5438000	How much do they want for it?
5438000	5442000	20 bucks. Coming out July 13th if you're interested in that.
5442000	5448000	Alright. One of those games you might be playing in tabletop mode on your Switch is Runner 3.
5448000	5453000	That is, of course, Bit.Trip Runner 3, but now I guess they just shortened it now. It's just Runner 3.
5453000	5456000	So, for whatever reason, they've shortened the name of the series.
5456000	5460000	The series is pretty fun. I remember the first game was good, and then that second game was out, like, everywhere.
5460000	5465000	They had out, like, every system, and I think it was a giveaway game at one point on PlayStation Plus or one of those.
5465000	5469000	But anyhow, there are going to be some characters that are going to show up in this game.
5469000	5475000	Some guest characters that I think are pretty interesting, including Eddie Riggs from Brutal Legend.
5475000	5480000	Kind of- kind of a throwback, because Brutal Legend, yeah, that was like a one and done kind of series there.
5480000	5483000	Shovel Knight will be a playable character in the game.
5483000	5484000	Practically in all the games now.
5484000	5488000	Yeah, that's pretty rad, though. But here's the other one that is crazy for a playable character.
5488000	5493000	Charles Martinet, the voice of Mario, will be a playable character.
5493000	5496000	No, no, no, no, no, no. Not Charles Martinet voicing something? Not Mario?
5496000	5502000	It's actually- actually Charles Martinet is the character, and you can even see the little-
5502000	5506000	But he's not new to the series. He did the voicing in part two.
5506000	5511000	So, kind of- kind of random, but hilarious, so that's pretty great.
5511000	5516000	Anyhow, obviously, of course, you know that Charles Martinet voices Mario, Luigi, Waluigi, Wario.
5516000	5519000	And he was the narrator, of course, in Bit.Trip Runner 2.
5519000	5524000	So, he is jumping on in to the series, ba-dum-bum.
5524000	5529000	And one more rapid-fire news story for you, and I just- I couldn't get through an episode of Orange Launch Radio
5529000	5534000	and not acknowledge the hard-working talents of Dark Tetsuya behind the scenes.
5534000	5541000	And I know he is extremely jazzed about- so, shout-out to Dark Tetsuya when I mentioned La Mulana 2.
5541000	5543000	He's probably this game's biggest fan.
5543000	5548000	And La Mulana 2 is going to be coming out during the summer on PC and Mac.
5548000	5552000	Yeah, there was a Kickstarter campaign for this game back in 2014.
5552000	5556000	And so, here it is. La Mulana 2 is finally here all these years.
5556000	5560000	So, you can check out a teaser that is available online, and the game will be out soon.
5560000	5567000	It looks a lot like the first one, but it's probably going to be really fucking hard as well, but I think it'll be really fun.
5567000	5569000	So, check that out.
5569000	5575000	Let's travel around and check out what is in stores this week, starting with the US.
5575000	5578000	Yes, so we have a few things coming out this week.
5578000	5584000	So, starting off with Battle Chasers Nightwar, and that's going to be coming out on the Switch.
5584000	5589000	Little Witch Academia Chamber of Time on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5589000	5594000	Shin Megami Tensei Strange Journey Redux on 3DS.
5594000	5598000	We have a game called Far Lone Sails on PC.
5598000	5601000	The Banner Saga is coming out on the Switch.
5601000	5605000	Yonder the Cloud Catcher Chronicles, also on the Switch.
5605000	5608000	Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition on the Switch.
5608000	5612000	And Little Nightmares Complete Edition on the Switch.
5612000	5614000	That's it.
5614000	5618000	Alright, well last week was a holiday week in Japan, so things had slowed down significantly.
5618000	5623000	But we do have some releases finally back on target this week, starting on May 17th.
5623000	5627000	We're going to see in Japan Caligula Overdose is out on the PlayStation 4.
5627000	5629000	That is going to be out this week.
5629000	5636000	Sadly, the Vita doesn't get that, but they do get a game called Amasutsumi is coming out from Prototype.
5636000	5638000	That is also on May 17th.
5638000	5641000	And then checking out the Nintendo Switch, nothing.
5641000	5643000	There's no Nintendo Switch releases this week.
5643000	5645000	I'm not sure if they have anything on the 3DS either.
5645000	5647000	They're still kind of trickling in a little bit on the 3DS.
5647000	5649000	No, not in Japan this week.
5649000	5652000	So it's pretty light, but they are coming right off a holiday week in Japan right now.
5652000	5654000	So that's what Japan looks like.
5654000	5656000	Are you able to do the UK for us, Loki?
5656000	5658000	Yeah, I'm going to attempt to do that.
5658000	5660000	So let's see here.
5660000	5665000	Out in the UK, we've got Hitman Definitive Edition.
5665000	5667000	The Day One Steelbook Edition.
5667000	5671000	That's out on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
5671000	5674000	They also have the regular Definitive Edition as well.
5674000	5678000	And what else do we have here?
5678000	5683000	Looks like Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition also making its way out there as well.
5683000	5689000	And State of Decay 2 Ultimate Edition.
5689000	5692000	That's coming out as well on the Xbox One.
5692000	5698000	And also I see they are doing steel work for that one as well.
5699000	5704000	And one more here.
5704000	5708000	So we've got Dragon Crown Pro Hardened Edition.
5708000	5710000	That's coming out.
5710000	5713000	And Dragon Crown, if you remember from last week, we talked about it.
5713000	5715000	Big anime for us, yes.
5715000	5717000	That's the game.
5717000	5723000	And they're also getting Battle Chasers Night Wall as well on the Switch.
5723000	5726000	And it looks like that's about it.
5727000	5731000	Alright, let's go to the mailbag because every week we invite you to email us.
5731000	5737000	Participate at Orangelauntrader.com if you want to participate with our show and send us some lovely love mail.
5737000	5741000	Or I guess you could send a hate mail, but I don't like hate mail.
5741000	5743000	I don't think you should send that.
5743000	5745000	Send love mail instead.
5745000	5747000	Or just send mail.
5747000	5749000	If you're not a lover or a hater, just send mail.
5749000	5753000	Anyway, we've got one email tonight, but I'll take it.
5753000	5756000	It's from our old friend YYR.
5756000	5758000	We love hearing from YYR here at OLR.
5758000	5761000	And starts off as YYR usually does, saying,
5761000	5763000	Hello, LR!
5763000	5766000	Just doing my usual-ish thing of addressing a few things from last week's show.
5766000	5769000	Rob, you mentioned playing Streets of Rage for a bit and then losing interest.
5769000	5771000	Here's my advice.
5771000	5773000	First of all, forget the first game.
5773000	5776000	Streets of Rage 2 is better in absolutely every respect, so play that.
5776000	5778000	And don't just play it willy-nilly.
5778000	5781000	Try to complete the game without continues.
5781000	5785000	Don't require that you learn your character's complete moveset and try to maximize your score.
5785000	5787000	Higher score means more extra lives.
5787000	5792000	The best designed beat-em-ups give you lots of tough spots to work through and make you think on your feet in order to win.
5792000	5796000	Streets of Rage 2 is a great game, and if you do stick with it, I'm sure you'll have a great time.
5796000	5798000	You know, I should have clarified last week.
5798000	5801000	I do know that Streets of Rage 2 is the better game.
5801000	5804000	I don't know why I felt the need to play one first.
5804000	5806000	I think it's just that whole thing of like, you know,
5806000	5810000	when you're going to sit down and watch all the movies, you start with the first one.
5811000	5813000	First, appreciate how good the second one is.
5813000	5814000	Yes, it's something like that.
5814000	5817000	And I didn't really anticipate spending a lot of time with Streets of Rage.
5817000	5822000	I think it's one of those things that we do with classic games and, you know, with emulation.
5822000	5825000	And maybe this, you know, not to get the red alert noise out,
5825000	5829000	but maybe this ties in a little bit to Nintendo's whole thing and the Netflix thing,
5829000	5833000	is that sometimes I'll play a game for like, you know, 30 seconds.
5833000	5835000	And then it's like, oh, okay.
5835000	5838000	It's like I got a little sample out of the frozen yogurt machine.
5838000	5841000	I got a little sample of what I wanted. I got to taste it. I'm good.
5841000	5844000	I remember this. Now, granted, I played a little more than that.
5844000	5848000	A Streets of Rage 1, but I don't know. Sometimes you just want a little taste.
5848000	5855000	I'm just super excited that Nintendo's releasing Soccer and Tennis as some of their titles,
5855000	5860000	because I know I couldn't miss playing Soccer or Tennis.
5860000	5865000	Well, you know what just came out on Arcade Archives was 10 Yard Fight.
5865000	5867000	How about that first football release?
5867000	5869000	That's better than Soccer or Tennis.
5869000	5872000	I'm loading up the red alert. I'm loading up. All right.
5872000	5875000	We need to continue with YYRS email, which says, on another note,
5875000	5880000	yes, I'm pretty sure that Dave and Busters has gotten rid of all their Derby Owners Club setups
5880000	5882000	at every location by now.
5882000	5883000	Womp womp.
5883000	5886000	But if you miss it, I have a game recommendation for you.
5886000	5892000	Dust off your 3DS, head to the eShop, and buy Pocket Card Jockey by Game Freak.
5892000	5894000	Yes, the same developer as Pokemon.
5894000	5899000	Pocket Card Jockey is basically a fusion of Derby Owners Club and Solitaire.
5899000	5904000	Don't even ask, well, how the hell does that work? Just know that it's awesome.
5904000	5908000	I was obsessed with it for probably about six months straight back when it came out.
5908000	5911000	It cost $7, and it's worth far more.
5911000	5915000	There's a demo available, but don't even bother. Just buy it and play it obsessively.
5915000	5916000	You're welcome.
5916000	5919000	You know, that's the same thing I would say about Super Multitasking.
5919000	5921000	Just buy it and play it obsessively.
5921000	5923000	There you go, YYRS. Shout out for you.
5923000	5927000	I had not heard of this game. I know Game Freak does stuff that's not Pokemon,
5927000	5931000	because they also did that Harmonite game on 3DS, and that's pretty good.
5931000	5934000	So I don't know how I missed this Pocket Card Jockey,
5934000	5937000	but your recommendation carries a lot of weight with me, YYR.
5937000	5938000	I will strongly consider that.
5938000	5941000	Do I get to name the horses? That's the most important part.
5941000	5947000	It's not fun if I can't whip the horses named after things that, you know, need some whipping.
5947000	5951000	I'll mention one more thing from last week that you guys might not have noticed.
5951000	5955000	Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze came out last week on the Switch for $60,
5955000	5958000	but did you know that a few days prior to that release,
5958000	5962000	the Wii U version of Tropical Freeze was pulled from the North American eShop?
5962000	5964000	That version only cost $20.
5964000	5968000	I just looked and can confirm that it is still gone.
5968000	5972000	You may still be able to find physical copies for $20,
5972000	5974000	but don't you think this is a bit messed up?
5974000	5977000	Anyway, thanks once again for producing the show, and have a great week.
5977000	5979000	Hugs, Aaron, YYR.
5980000	5985000	It's not like that they would take away the options of purchasing games and, you know...
5985000	5988000	You know what, I'm not even gonna try to drag this into it.
5988000	5990000	Here's the thing.
5990000	5993000	Well, but I don't think Nintendo's the only company to do this.
5993000	5997000	We've seen other companies that will come out with the remastered edition or whatever,
5997000	6000000	and to be fair, it's not an exact copy.
6000000	6002000	They did add some stuff to this.
6002000	6006000	But we've seen other companies with their remastered edition and so forth,
6006000	6010000	like, you know, you can't really find the old ones as easy and all that stuff anymore.
6010000	6012000	I don't think this is a thing you need to Nintendo.
6012000	6014000	The reason why I didn't bring it up on last week's show,
6014000	6018000	I thought I had saw something where it came back on the store,
6018000	6020000	so it was only temporarily missing.
6020000	6023000	Apparently that little nugget of information I saw must have been wrong,
6023000	6026000	because you said you just checked, and you didn't send this email that long ago.
6026000	6030000	So I guess it did actually disappear there.
6030000	6033000	But one other thing to maybe ask yourself is,
6033000	6037000	well, how many people still have a Wii U to play it on?
6037000	6041000	So Nintendo's trying to get some of that cost of game development back.
6041000	6044000	Maybe it's one of those games that will go on sale a little sooner rather than later,
6044000	6046000	because you know Nintendo games never go on sale.
6046000	6050000	Maybe this will be one of them that does because of the fact that the Wii U one kind of exists.
6050000	6052000	So, anyway.
6052000	6056000	There is one more important thing that YYR said in the email
6056000	6058000	that I do need to make sure we get out here,
6058000	6067000	saying, PS, I agree that Tacos Are Fantastic would be a wonderful subtitle for Pixel Poops Number 2.
6067000	6071000	Now, there's a very distinct way he wrote that.
6071000	6073000	Pixel Poops Number 2.
6073000	6077000	Right. I think I meant that in that sense as well.
6077000	6081000	But that's also, like, I see what you did there, YYR.
6081000	6087000	And so if he simply names the game Pixel Poops Number 2, that's really funny.
6088000	6092000	And if he even makes the fucking game, I mean, he's got other things going on right now.
6092000	6096000	But someday, inevitably, when he's bored enough and puts pen to paper,
6096000	6099000	maybe we'll see Pixel Poops Number 2.
6099000	6103000	Let's put Pixel Poops stuff in multitasking.
6105000	6108000	There you go. A little cross-marketing.
6108000	6111000	Everybody's doing crossovers with, like, different things.
6111000	6112000	Alright.
6112000	6114000	Put Shovel Knight in there. Everyone looks over there.
6114000	6116000	Just put Charles Martinet in it. Alright.
6116000	6118000	Charles Martinet playing Charles Martinet.
6120000	6122000	Uh-oh. Uh-oh. YYR in chat says,
6122000	6126000	OMG. Why did I not think of that? BRB.
6129000	6130000	Like, that would've been the first thing he did.
6130000	6133000	Hey, I've got all these assets they made for other games.
6133000	6136000	I'm putting all that shit in there. Recycle those assets.
6136000	6137000	Well, he did.
6137000	6140000	Because the shooter stuff came from that shooter game.
6140000	6142000	And I'm sorry, I can't remember what it was called in the moment, YYR.
6142000	6147000	But the shooter gallery game, point blankish type of thing he did on 360.
6147000	6149000	All those assets were the same.
6149000	6153000	But there was no, like, Snake 360 redo or anything like that.
6153000	6156000	So, Sharpshooter. Thank you, YYR.
6156000	6157000	Anyway.
6157000	6159000	Yes, he should've had Snake in there.
6159000	6162000	You know, YYR, if you do add a couple new boards to the game,
6162000	6166000	then it allows it to be back out there all over again.
6166000	6169000	Because now it's like, oh, new free DLC.
6169000	6172000	And then you're gonna get people that'll run an article on it because,
6172000	6174000	oh, there's free DLC. There's new boards.
6174000	6178000	But I say it like DLC is this easy thing to implement.
6178000	6179000	I'm sure it's not.
6179000	6180000	Alright, anyway.
6180000	6184000	Let's move on and get into some more gaming news.
6184000	6186000	And, Loki, we'll start with you.
6186000	6189000	Speaking of Steam, and a place you can play Super Multitasking, right?
6189000	6190000	Yeah, exactly.
6190000	6191000	So, Steam is gonna...
6191000	6193000	You may remember the Steam link.
6193000	6195000	It's still something that's being sold.
6195000	6200000	Well, now they're saying that they're gonna be coming out with a Steam link app.
6200000	6207000	And it will allow Steam users to play their games on Android and iOS devices.
6207000	6210000	So, phones, tablets, and even Apple TV.
6210000	6215000	And if they're connected via Wi-Fi or Ethernet to the same network,
6215000	6222000	or if they're, of course, connected to the same network as your PC or Mac that you have Steam installed on.
6223000	6227000	Also, they're saying it's gonna be compatible with a variety of controllers.
6227000	6229000	Steam controllers, MFI controllers as well.
6229000	6231000	And, so that's gonna be pretty awesome.
6231000	6237000	I thought I also read on here too that they were gonna work on something for, I hope, Android TV.
6237000	6240000	Because I have an Android TV and that would make it nice and convenient.
6240000	6241000	I have a Steam link.
6241000	6243000	I just haven't actually set it up yet.
6243000	6248000	Because, once again, you know, if I have my laptop in front of me, I'll just play on my laptop.
6248000	6250000	But it comes in handy for games.
6250000	6253000	Like, I have some Lego games on my Steam library.
6253000	6260000	And if my kids wanted to play those multiplayer, I don't have to, like, plug in a cable to my computer so that they can do that.
6260000	6262000	So, it would be nice to see that available.
6262000	6267000	But, yeah, if they have Android TV support, that would be even better.
6267000	6269000	Since I've already got that.
6271000	6272000	We'll see you in a couple weeks.
6272000	6274000	So, but, why would, I don't know.
6274000	6278000	Like, I'm trying to think, like, what stuff from Steam would I really want to play on the go?
6278000	6279000	And I'm like, eh.
6279000	6281000	Well, you wouldn't really even play it on the go.
6281000	6283000	This would be, like, it has to be on the same network.
6283000	6285000	Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true.
6285000	6288000	So, you can't really, like, play, yeah, playing it over LT would be a bit much.
6288000	6290000	It would be more like playing, like, on a tablet.
6290000	6297000	So, instead of having to have, like, a monitor or something like that, you would just have, you know, just a device that you can play it on.
6297000	6300000	And, I guess, if you had a Bluetooth controller, then you could run that with the tablet.
6300000	6303000	Or, would a Steam thing work with the tablet? I guess if it was the right tablet.
6303000	6304000	Yeah, if it...
6304000	6305000	Not an iPad.
6305000	6306000	Yeah, you could...
6306000	6309000	No, it's all Bluetooth, so maybe it would work with an iPad.
6309000	6310000	Yeah, it might.
6310000	6312000	So, I mean, it's cool.
6312000	6314000	It's neat to have other options.
6314000	6316000	I mean, I'd have to check it out and see how well it works.
6316000	6319000	I certainly wouldn't want to play with just the phone.
6319000	6321000	Yeah, I wouldn't want to play, like, Civilization...
6321000	6322000	I'm not even.
6322000	6324000	I wouldn't want to play, like, Civilization 6.
6324000	6328000	But you have people in chat that are saying, a couple of people saying Super Hexagon.
6328000	6331000	Which, I mean, is already a standalone iOS game anyway.
6331000	6333000	So maybe something simple like that would work.
6333000	6336000	The other thing I was thinking of, and sometimes we forget this, you guys.
6336000	6340000	Steam got into movies a while ago.
6340000	6342000	You can buy movies, is it right? You can still buy them, right?
6342000	6344000	Yeah, I think so.
6344000	6347000	I know, like, Indie Game the movie. That was one of the first.
6347000	6349000	And then there was a few that trickled out there.
6349000	6354000	So, I mean, this would be a way for Steam to do more, I guess, if you will, traditional media.
6354000	6363000	That, I understand a lot, being able to beam that from Steam to your iPad when you're in the bed or something.
6363000	6366000	So, that could be something.
6366000	6371000	Alright, well, something that you're not going to be able to buy on Steam, at least right away anyway,
6371000	6374000	is Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.
6374000	6377000	Yeah, Atari has cut off the ability to buy this game.
6377000	6382000	And it's because Frontier Developments did file a lawsuit over unpaid royalties from the game.
6382000	6386000	I don't know why this lawsuit news apparently came from TMZ, of all places.
6386000	6388000	Like, why the fuck is TMZ doing games?
6388000	6390000	Yeah, like, why are they covering that?
6390000	6393000	I think the word Atari still kind of resonates with a certain crowd.
6393000	6395000	It's like, remember how-
6395000	6397000	Atari's a big company, right?
6397000	6402000	Remember how rad the 80s were? Let's see what Ataris do to all Ataris on Judge Judy.
6402000	6404000	You know, whatever's going on. Anyway.
6404000	6409000	So, Roller Coaster 3 Tycoon developer Frontier Developments said, in the suit,
6409000	6414000	they alleged, that Atari failed to pay out $2.2 million in royalties.
6414000	6418000	Frontier, which made the deal with Atari to develop the game way back in 2003,
6418000	6423000	wasn't able to pursue the unpaid balance when Atari went through bankruptcy in 2013.
6423000	6427000	But now that Atari's fortunes have reversed and the company is at a profit,
6427000	6431000	must be those Atari boxes that they're planning for 2019,
6431000	6433000	Frontier wants their damn money.
6433000	6437000	So, the developer wants an audit of the royalties owed,
6437000	6441000	and says, basically, in a nutshell, bitch, give me my money.
6441000	6446000	So, in response, Atari has pulled the game from the pending litigation.
6446000	6449000	They haven't really said why, but we know why.
6449000	6453000	The listing is still there, you just can't buy the game.
6453000	6457000	Other games that Frontier worked on after that, Jurassic World Evolution,
6457000	6460000	Elite Dangerous is also a big title that that same company worked on,
6460000	6463000	but I think y'all know Roller Coaster Tycoon.
6463000	6468000	So, anyway, weird that it didn't just disappear from the store altogether,
6468000	6471000	but maybe they had to do that for some reason to, like,
6471000	6474000	kind of allow you to still download it if you own it type of thing.
6474000	6478000	Maybe they see this as temporary, like it's going to come back
6478000	6480000	when they resolve all this lawsuit stuff,
6480000	6483000	but if they, well, of course they'll resolve it.
6483000	6486000	There's always a frickin' settlement in these types of cases.
6486000	6488000	There's not gonna be a trial here, there'll be a settlement.
6488000	6490000	And then it'll come back. We'll see.
6490000	6492000	You found a Roller Coaster Tycoon, Loki?
6492000	6496000	Um, I didn't really claim. I have some of them, though, from Humble Bundle.
6496000	6498000	I haven't played it since, like, the very first one.
6498000	6501000	But I still, and I know I've mentioned this on the show, it's a while ago now,
6501000	6507000	one of my favorite YouTubes is when they're doing the roller coaster in the first person,
6507000	6509000	and it's playing, like, Rihanna's, like, you know,
6509000	6513000	doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, and they're all, like, having fun,
6513000	6516000	and then the roller coaster just flies off the rails,
6516000	6518000	and the song instantly turns to Adele.
6518000	6524000	And it's all sad, as all these people fall, and there's flames everywhere.
6524000	6528000	That is my favorite thing to have come out of that series in a very long time.
6528000	6531000	Thank you, SC100Man. Dude, he's on fire tonight.
6531000	6534000	He's got this, he's got all this stuff bookmarked from old episodes.
6534000	6537000	I'm not gonna play it on air, but you can look at it in chat.
6537000	6540000	Yeah, I've got, um, the one I have is actually, I've got both that,
6540000	6544000	and I've got No Limits Rollercoast, No Limits 2 Roller Coaster Simulator.
6544000	6546000	That one's VR, so that one's pretty fun.
6546000	6547000	Oh, okay.
6547000	6551000	Um, but, uh, I have Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.
6551000	6554000	I don't see 3 in here, though.
6554000	6557000	Alright, let's move on with some more news, Loki.
6557000	6563000	Alright, um, so this is different, but Nintendo's revealed that they're gonna be releasing
6563000	6568000	a Japanese-exclusive Famicom mini to celebrate Shonen Jump's anniversary.
6568000	6571000	So it's the 50th anniversary of Shonen Jump, and with that,
6571000	6575000	the Famicom system is gonna have different games on there
6575000	6578000	than when they released the Famicom mini before.
6578000	6585000	So they've got, like, Tag Team Match Muscle, Dragon Quest, Fist of the North Star, Dragon Ball.
6585000	6588000	Um, they've got some Saint Seiya games,
6588000	6591000	uh, Famicom Jump.
6591000	6595000	Let's see, yeah, a few Dragon Ball games.
6595000	6599000	Um, but yeah, like, quite a bit, you know, all Shonen Jump properties.
6599000	6603000	So, interesting, though, that they're doing that,
6603000	6606000	and that's gonna be something that's available in Japan July 7th.
6606000	6611000	So do you think, I mean, we, well, see, when I put the short roll together,
6611000	6615000	we didn't have the late-breaking news about the confirmed NES, you know,
6615000	6619000	gonna be back on the shelves in June, so I guess it's kind of a moot point now,
6619000	6622000	because I was wondering, like, oh, when the NES Classic comes back,
6622000	6625000	do you think they're gonna sweeten the pot by adding a few games to it,
6625000	6631000	maybe some sort of tie-in, uh, to, you know, get the people who bought it the first time to buy it again.
6631000	6633000	Although, I don't know, if I had bought it the first time,
6633000	6637000	and they put out a new one with, like, three extra games, I'd probably be pretty pissed.
6637000	6638000	So...
6638000	6642000	All I wanna know is, are those controllers longer again? I bet they're not.
6642000	6645000	I don't think we know yet. For all we know, it's the exact same thing.
6645000	6646000	Probably is.
6646000	6648000	But the Super Nintendo ones, I think, were a little longer.
6648000	6649000	Right.
6649000	6654000	So, maybe, who knows? It doesn't, it's not for sure that it's gonna be the short chords again.
6654000	6657000	But, we'll probably be asking some of these questions of Nintendo in the coming days.
6657000	6664000	Maybe E3, this seems like very much a thing that Treehouse would probably bring up in their days-long stream,
6664000	6667000	that they might go like, oh, don't forget, guys, that Nintendo's coming out.
6667000	6671000	Uh, NES Classic is being re-released on the end of June,
6671000	6674000	and, uh, here's what they look like if you forget,
6674000	6677000	and either you're gonna see an NES sitting there with longer chords,
6677000	6679000	or it's gonna be the same thing as before.
6679000	6682000	And, even though no one's paying attention to this,
6682000	6686000	we must tell you that all 30 games in there are all copies of the Guardian Legend.
6686000	6688000	Now that-
6688000	6692000	We're releasing only one system, and somewhere in Alaska, I mean Antarctica.
6692000	6697000	Get, get, we're gonna go for, where are all the Kmart's in Alaska?
6697000	6699000	I'm on my way.
6699000	6701000	Alright.
6701000	6707000	Hey, this sounds like a pretty neat Switch title that's on its way pretty soon,
6707000	6711000	uh, is, uh, this crossover fighting game, uh, Crystal Crisis.
6711000	6715000	I think Crystal Crisis is supposed to be, like, uh, maybe kinda like Puzzle Fighter,
6715000	6717000	although I don't know if, um-
6717000	6718000	It looks like Puzzle Fighter.
6718000	6720000	Yeah, it kinda, it kinda really does look like, uh, a Puzzle Fighter type of thing.
6720000	6722000	But, uh, it-
6722000	6723000	It's all indies.
6723000	6726000	And Nysalis is the game, is the company doing this?
6726000	6727000	Yeah.
6727000	6728000	Is that how you say it?
6728000	6731000	Okay, uh, they are putting, like, all these kinda, like, indie characters in the game.
6731000	6734000	So when it was Puzzle Fighter, it was all the Capcom characters, right?
6734000	6738000	So in this one, it's going to be, uh, you know, different indie characters,
6738000	6742000	such as the little thing from Cave Story, uh, that looks like the little Binding of Isaac.
6742000	6744000	It is Binding of Isaac.
6744000	6746000	Yeah, uh, I don't have a list here in this story of all the characters.
6746000	6747000	I do.
6747000	6748000	Do you? What are the characters in this?
6748000	6751000	Yeah, it's on here. So they've got, um, you're talking about-
6751000	6753000	So they've got, like, C here.
6753000	6755000	Astro Boy, which is kind of interesting.
6755000	6756000	That's pretty cool.
6756000	6760000	Um, they had, um, the Turbo Duo spokesman.
6760000	6762000	They said Johnny Turbo.
6762000	6767000	Um, Code of Princess, Cave Story, um,
6767000	6770000	I know they did, uh, yeah, Binding of Isaac, as you mentioned.
6770000	6773000	Not sure who any of these other characters are, though.
6773000	6776000	But, uh, lots of different characters.
6776000	6782000	So, yeah, uh, it is a Switch title, uh, that was revealed at BitSummit in Kyoto,
6782000	6785000	which is why we're getting some indie news this week, you guys, actually.
6785000	6788000	It's where some of this news, uh, tonight came from was this whole thing.
6788000	6792000	Um, so they, uh, showed off the game, and it's going to be coming out on the Switch.
6792000	6796000	Uh, uh, the early trailer's in Japanese, so, um, you know,
6796000	6799000	you may not be able to understand it all, but you can see all the characters that are in it.
6799000	6802000	Uh, and I don't know if we have a date yet. I don't think so.
6802000	6805000	I think we just have Fall for North America and Europe.
6805000	6807000	That's all we know. Fall. So.
6807000	6810000	But, uh, you know, especially if Puzzle Fighter kind of dies on the phones,
6810000	6813000	and they don't end up doing a console release of that game,
6813000	6815000	this might be a neat substitute.
6815000	6819000	And there's some anime in there, too. Like, I see, uh, Blackjack is something that's in there.
6819000	6820000	Hmm.
6820000	6822000	Um...
6822000	6824000	That's really cool.
6824000	6826000	Yeah, I don't know who these characters are.
6826000	6828000	Sadly.
6828000	6829000	I mean, I know who Astro Boy is, but...
6829000	6831000	Of course, of course. So.
6831000	6835000	Alright, well, we'll, uh, check out that when it comes out on the Nintendo Switch in the Fall.
6835000	6837000	But, Loki, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys,
6837000	6840000	and we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.
6840000	6841000	But first, Loki.
6841000	6844000	Yeah, so, uh, there's Pokémon GO Fest coming out again.
6844000	6846000	Yes, Pokémon GO Fest 2018.
6846000	6848000	And they've already sold out in their tickets.
6848000	6850000	In an hour.
6850000	6856000	So, uh, Pokémon GO Fest is going to be, I guess, coming to Chicago again.
6856000	6860000	And they're switching up which park it's going to be at.
6860000	6862000	I know that.
6862000	6864000	Yeah, they're going to, I think, what's a much bigger park.
6864000	6868000	I'm not as familiar. I didn't go there when I was there last year.
6868000	6873000	Um, but I think it is a bigger, like, park, uh, ride along, like, the coastal area.
6873000	6877000	Yeah, so they said that, um, it is going to be...
6877000	6883000	They're leaving Grant Park for Lincoln Park, they said, which has, uh, 1.8 miles of walking path.
6883000	6889000	And they're going to have some new physical installations there,
6889000	6892000	and activities for trainers of all ages.
6892000	6894000	And, yeah.
6894000	6898000	Um, they said, well, of course, the tickets went on sale May 11th, but they're already sold out.
6898000	6900000	Of course they are.
6900000	6904000	So, people pretty quick to forgive last year and sign up to go again.
6904000	6908000	It sounds like, what, there's two days of this event, and you could buy a ticket for one day or the other.
6908000	6911000	Right, and then they also have, there's also, this isn't the only one that they're doing,
6911000	6917000	there's also going to be, uh, Pokemon GO Summer Tour, which is, um, kicking off in Germany on June 30th as well.
6917000	6923000	So there's stuff. And then they're saying that also that goes all the way, they're going around the world, uh, to Japan.
6923000	6925000	That's where it's going to end.
6925000	6929000	And I think the GO Fest is going to tie into Community Day somehow as well.
6929000	6934000	Like, you're going to be able to participate, uh, remotely, you know, even if you can't go to GO Fest,
6934000	6938000	there will be some cool things that you can do so you don't feel so left out because you can get to go.
6938000	6940000	Hopefully. Because I can't go to Chicago.
6940000	6941000	No, and what's-
6941000	6947000	And I would be hesitant to go to Chicago again, especially with, you know, how the last one turned out.
6947000	6949000	I would hope that it's better this time, but-
6949000	6958000	Well, I love Chicago, but, um, I'm already going to be, just like last time, I already booked my trip to be there two weeks before.
6959000	6964000	So, I'll be there two weeks before, but, uh, I won't be able to be there for the event.
6964000	6968000	So, because it makes no sense to go back just for that two weeks after the fact.
6968000	6970000	So, uh, who knows.
6970000	6975000	Uh, actdefs theorizes in chat at live.vognetwork.com, like, regionals, perhaps.
6975000	6979000	Maybe we'll see some more regionals released that you can get maybe only during the event.
6979000	6982000	That would be a pretty cool thing. Make some people very happy.
6982000	6983000	Maybe.
6983000	6987000	Um, certainly people at the event will probably be able to chase Unowns.
6987000	6989000	I know it's a big thing.
6989000	6996000	Uh, there was a Pokemon that was spotted in the little video that is available currently only in India, I believe.
6996000	6998000	Uh, or not in the video, in the little picture.
6998000	7001000	So, they're thinking that regionals could actually show up.
7001000	7005000	So, maybe that Pokemon that's region locked right now will be available for everybody.
7005000	7010000	That's, uh, Torkoal is the one that's available only in India right now.
7010000	7011000	Hmm.
7011000	7015000	Um, maybe that will be them throwing the switch on for Gen 4.
7015000	7017000	Who knows?
7017000	7029000	There could be, there could be a big new feature for the game, uh, for Go Fest because last year we got the gym redo happened when I was in Chicago.
7029000	7031000	So, it was like two weeks prior to Go Fest.
7031000	7035000	And it was all the 1, 2, 3, and 4 star raids at first, right?
7035000	7036000	Right.
7036000	7041000	And then, because the very first raid I ever did in Pokemon Go was a Totodile.
7041000	7043000	No, what's the second form?
7043000	7044000	Crocomaw, okay?
7044000	7047000	I did a raid for that at that fountain.
7047000	7049000	I think it's Buckingham Fountain or something.
7049000	7052000	It's the fountain that's in the opening credits of Married with Children.
7052000	7053000	Got it.
7053000	7056000	That's the very first raid I did was at that fountain.
7056000	7062000	Um, and then what they did at Go Fest two or three weeks later is they added,
7062000	7064000	Oh, Legendaries!
7064000	7071000	Lugia is out now, as is Articuno because Mystic won all the catch stuff for the day.
7071000	7075000	Because that's how everybody was getting in with Go Fest around the world.
7075000	7082000	So, um, and that's kind of where the, um, that's where the Community Day stuff I think came from.
7082000	7088000	Because, uh, you know, I remember when I was down at the capital during Go Fest because they said,
7088000	7093000	Oh, you get all these bonuses in the game if you get so many catches and all this stuff, right?
7093000	7096000	So, um, we were all down at the capital, like a ton of us.
7096000	7099000	And it was like the day the game first came out.
7099000	7100000	It was crazy.
7100000	7101000	Tons of people everywhere.
7101000	7106000	Um, so that's, and ever since then when they've done the Community Days, it's been the same thing.
7106000	7110000	I've gone to the Capital Park every single Community Day except the one I was out of town.
7110000	7112000	Uh, the Bulbasaur Day when I was out of town.
7112000	7114000	But, like, Capital Park is always, like, hopping.
7114000	7118000	So, we'll probably go there. I think there's one coming right up, like, next week of the week.
7118000	7120000	Yeah, I think it's next weekend. I think next weekend is the Charmander Day.
7120000	7121000	Oh, yeah.
7121000	7123000	May 19th, yeah. So, uh, I'll probably go out there again.
7123000	7126000	So, uh, good times.
7126000	7131000	So, anyway, the whole reason why I brought up the raid in the first place I did is that, you know,
7131000	7135000	they did make some big changes to the game and rolled that out at Go Fest.
7135000	7138000	So, who knows? Maybe there will be another big addition to the game.
7138000	7140000	Trading, battling, like, crazy.
7140000	7144000	Yeah, trading would be huge or PvP. That would be a huge thing.
7144000	7146000	Gen 4 would be something that I would think would be...
7146000	7152000	Because, you know, to be fair, we did just get the questing thing, the research tasks.
7152000	7153000	Yeah.
7153000	7160000	Which, if you haven't played Pokemon Go in a while, like, the research tasks are a huge change and a really welcome one.
7160000	7169000	Because the nice thing is now is that if you don't raid, it looks like they are slowly rolling out those Mon through these tasks.
7169000	7175000	Because now, uh, Moltres was, uh, the first one that you could get from the research task.
7175000	7178000	That was last month. Now Zapdos this month.
7178000	7183000	So, like, you can kind of catch up on a lot of those legendaries you missed because you don't raid through the research task.
7183000	7189000	And the little trade-off is that those that did do the raiding, uh, there are five levels higher usually.
7189000	7191000	Ten if you lucked out with a weather boost.
7191000	7195000	Um, and, uh, you, um...
7196000	7198000	Yeah, they're five or ten levels higher.
7198000	7200000	Um, I feel like there's something else with that.
7200000	7202000	Oh, and you had them for a longer time.
7202000	7204000	You've already had them for a year or so.
7204000	7205000	So.
7205000	7206000	Anyway.
7206000	7207000	Uh, yep.
7207000	7210000	So that's it for Pokemon Go then, right?
7210000	7211000	That's it.
7211000	7212000	Alright.
7212000	7214000	So we'll see if we, uh...
7214000	7216000	See if we, our buddy, um...
7216000	7222000	Because we had, uh, our friend from the Pokemon Go podcast, Charles, was there last year.
7222000	7224000	I haven't checked with him to see if he's, uh, going again this year.
7224000	7226000	So I'll find out soon.
7226000	7228000	Maybe we can get him back this year.
7228000	7229000	Uh, anyhow.
7229000	7234000	Let's talk about, lastly tonight, um, some big news on Pinball Arcade.
7234000	7247000	This is the, uh, Farsight Studios production that takes real pinball tables and, uh, kind of converts them, uh, for use on your PlayStation 4, your PC, your, what, iOS.
7247000	7248000	It's everywhere, basically.
7248000	7249000	Yeah, everything.
7249000	7254000	They even had them on, like, PS3 and, I mean, the, like, you know, I don't think they work on those versions anymore and they haven't for a while.
7254000	7258000	But anyway, this is, uh, this is gonna be a pretty big, uh, pretty big loss for them.
7258000	7265000	And that is that the licensing agreement for Williams and Bally pinball trademarks is not going to be renewed.
7265000	7277000	So this means tables that you can purchase now will no longer be purchasable as of, uh, I think it's June 30th is the day that these are all gonna go away.
7277000	7285000	Um, so, uh, I'm not gonna read the entire list of tables, but there are some big ones that are gonna be leaving.
7285000	7290000	One of my favorites, Pinbot, uh, including tables that were crowdfunded.
7290000	7294000	Uh, the Addams Family, which I think they were on this show promoting that one.
7294000	7295000	I think it was that one they were here.
7295000	7297000	Farsight came on this, uh, show.
7297000	7300000	Uh, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, I think was one they crowdfunded for.
7300000	7302000	That is going to be going away.
7302000	7305000	Um, so that's kind of a bummer.
7305000	7308000	Uh, Doctor Who, the 92 Table, that is going away.
7308000	7311000	World Cup Soccer, Jamie's Fave, that is going to be going away.
7311000	7317000	Uh, one of my other faves, Theater of Magic, uh, one of the all-time greats, Elvira and the Party Monsters.
7317000	7322000	All of these games gonna be going away, or all these tables gonna be going away and no longer purchasable.
7322000	7326000	Um, so of course if you own it, you can play it forever.
7326000	7334000	Um, if you are, um, kind of like thinking, oh, I'll hold out for the big goodbye sale, don't do it.
7334000	7338000	Because Farsight's licensing agreement, they are banned from offering discounts.
7338000	7344000	Probably due to the fact that many of these tables do involve some complicated intellectual, uh, properties.
7344000	7350000	Because, you know, it's like you have the Addams Family, you have the characters that are on the table.
7350000	7351000	I mean, they have to license all of that.
7351000	7354000	So, that's probably why they're not allowed to do discounts.
7354000	7357000	So, the seven current seasons are $30 a pop.
7357000	7361000	So, if you want every table, it's gonna cost you $210.
7361000	7365000	Um, maybe you don't want every table though, maybe you only need certain ones.
7365000	7370000	You can buy individual tables and two packs from inside the game, so check that out if you want.
7370000	7374000	Farsight has said that season eight will be Stern games.
7374000	7379000	It's gonna take some of the tables from Stern Pinball Arcade, uh, as well as some others.
7379000	7383000	So, there are still some other, um, table, uh, companies that they can work with.
7383000	7386000	But that's, uh, that's a pretty big loss, sadly.
7386000	7390000	I don't know if, um, I wonder why, uh, they weren't able to get the renewal.
7390000	7395000	I wonder if Williams and Bally priced them out, if they plan to do their own thing, or what the hell's going on.
7395000	7399000	So, um, it would be great if maybe they could work that out.
7399000	7402000	Um, but that, that really sucks, especially with the crowdfunded tables.
7402000	7408000	Although, to be fair, anyone who paid to get those tables made got their copy of the table.
7408000	7410000	So, it's not like you're really losing anything in this.
7410000	7418000	So, uh, Bobby Blackwolf points out on Facebook, all they said is, we don't know why they decided not to renew.
7418000	7422000	And so, they are telling Farsight that they are not renewing. There was no negotiation.
7422000	7427000	So, that makes it sound like, uh, EA got the license. No, I'm just kidding.
7427000	7432000	I made that up, I made that up, but isn't, isn't that a scary conclusion to jump to?
7432000	7436000	Alright. Anyhow.
7436000	7444000	Uh, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call and say hello, talk about anything that we've talked about tonight, or maybe something else.
7444000	7450000	Maybe there's something, uh, we weren't able to, uh, bring up on the show, uh, and you want to bring that up now, we can do that.
7450000	7456000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype is the place to be. Uh, and we'll get your calls here shortly.
7456000	7462000	Um, I think we do have calls coming in. Let's lighten up tonight, so let's get to it.
7462000	7466000	And we'll start here. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7466000	7468000	Hey guys, it's Aaron, YYR.
7468000	7472000	Hey, we have an email and a call tonight. It's Doubles. What's up, buddy?
7472000	7480000	Um, well actually, I was planning to call in and mention the business about the Pinball Arcade, but it turns out that was the very last story.
7480000	7482000	Well, what are your thoughts on this whole thing?
7482000	7488000	Um, I don't think a lot of people realize just how big of a deal this is.
7488000	7504000	If you go through, and by the way, the Pinball Arcade, it really is on everything. It's on Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, PS3, Vita, PS4, 360, Xbox One, Wii U, Kindle Fire, Ouya, and now Switch.
7504000	7508000	Except the Switch version already has these tables gone.
7508000	7519000	Yeah, that was a real kicker. Now, here's the thing. The Switch version came out, and it had all the tables in it. It was available for about eight hours, and then it was pulled from the eShop.
7519000	7526000	That was a few weeks ago. It just came back a few days ago, and all of it had been scrubbed already.
7526000	7531000	So, you gotta wonder if something about the Nintendo Switch version is what set this whole thing off.
7532000	7541000	You know, it's hard to say, and a few other people have speculated that maybe it had something to do with VR, because there are now some VR pinball simulations available.
7541000	7548000	And it's really cool, because you know how, I don't know, have you played the Pinball Arcade at all, or any of the previous versions?
7548000	7550000	Oh yeah, I backed Adam's Family.
7550000	7552000	Oh wow.
7553000	7555000	Yeah, so I've played it, yeah.
7555000	7563000	Yeah, then you know that there are some camera views available, and the view changes based on where the ball is sometimes.
7563000	7573000	But if you imagine how much more control over the view you'd have if you do it in VR, you can imagine that it's kind of a whole new game.
7573000	7584000	The level of the simulation is completely different, so some people are speculating that maybe they made a deal with somebody else to basically remake all of these games in VR.
7584000	7593000	But honestly, it's hard to imagine that anyone else is going to jump through all of the necessary hoops to make things like this possible.
7593000	7614000	So this is one example. Terminator 2 Judgment Day. If you want to do that table, not only do you need to have access to the original table to be able to take it apart, understand how all of it works, and reproduce it, but you also need the movie license, and you need Arnold Schwarzenegger's OK to use his likeness.
7614000	7638000	So that's a lot of work, and what I was getting at earlier was, if you look at the 96, 96 pinball tables that are currently in the pinball arcade, Bally and Williams, which are all getting cut from the game, that represents 63 of those tables, or about two thirds of everything available in that game.
7638000	7643000	Yeah. Bobby and Chad just said it was 61 tables out of 99.
7643000	7664000	Oh, OK. 61. I was close. But I mean, basically you're gutting it. It's hard to imagine that they're going to be able to keep going. I mean, Stern is a big deal because they are the only ones besides, I think, Jersey Jack pinball and maybe a few other indie outposts still producing pinball machines.
7665000	7678000	But, I mean, if you're looking at historical pinball games, that's the big one. They're really losing most of the game there, and it's really sad.
7678000	7695000	No, and I think we mentioned this maybe on the call during Bobby's show, but I was mentioning how the money that probably still rolls in slowly from the sales of this is probably helping to fund Farsight Studios. This is going to be a huge loss for them, so I hope everything's OK.
7695000	7704000	Yeah, apparently the early seasons, especially number one, which, I mean, the first three seasons in particular, there are so many quality tables in them.
7711000	7721000	You're cutting out a little bit YYR. I'm losing a little bit of your phrases, so hopefully when the connection re-establishes here. You were mentioning the first three seasons have such good tables.
7721000	7743000	Yeah, and there's a lot of them. There used to be more tables included in the early seasons than the later ones. So, season one and two represent a great value, and one through four basically have a ton of classics, including Adam's family. So, it's hard to pick and choose. It really is.
7744000	7752000	I was going to say the Thank You, Dark Tetsuya, or WikiPro. Episode 570 was when Farsight Studios was on the show, so if you want to go back.
7752000	7753000	Oh, wow.
7753000	7764000	I'm almost positive during that interview, and I think it was the Adam's family table they were promoting at the time, because I remember backing it, and I thought it was a result of that, or just the fact that I wanted to back it, because I love that table.
7765000	7784000	I remember them talking about how you don't, and it's exactly what you're saying about Terminator. You don't have to just license this one thing. You have to license the estate of Rao Julia, who is a deceased actor, whose likeness is in the game, whose voice is in the game. You have to license all of that.
7785000	7796000	Yeah, and it's hard to imagine that any other company, EA or otherwise, is going to really be able to reproduce all of what Farsight did. I don't even know how.
7797000	7809000	So, well, I mean, tipping our hat to Farsight Studios for doing what they could all these years, and hopefully, maybe, I don't know, maybe some of the fact that this news has caught fire, and it is kind of stunning a lot of people.
7809000	7821000	Maybe this will put some pressure on Bally Williams, although I don't know. I don't know if they're going to see that their minds need to be changed, especially if they're not making money per table.
7822000	7829000	Maybe if they were making money per table sold, they might be more into it, but if they were paid a flat fee, maybe they don't really give a shit.
7830000	7832000	Well, I guess we have about six weeks to find out.
7832000	7843000	That's true. So we'll see. We'll see if this news catches any fire, but I would imagine there's already people tweeting at them, because that's what we do this day and age. We're mad at companies. We send them tweets.
7843000	7846000	Why you no license the tables?
7846000	7864000	I will say this much. The company that now has these rights, they're basically a company that produces gambling machines now, and so this is probably such an insignificant portion of their revenue that it probably is just a drop in the bucket to them anyway.
7864000	7868000	Is it the same Bally still that runs the casino in Vegas?
7869000	7882000	They're called something different now. I'm not sure what of Bally they still retain, but basically it's just, well, they're like Konami, I guess.
7884000	7888000	Oh, I hate that comparison, but yes. Very true. Very, very true.
7889000	7899000	All right, my friend. Well, I'm going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you for sharing your input on this, you know, whole big change for Pinball Arcade.
7899000	7904000	Yeah, it really stinks, but I hope there's a good way forward from this, and I'll leave you with this.
7904000	7905000	Yes.
7905000	7911000	If you do decide to take the plunge on Pocket Card Jockey, yes, you can name all your horses whatever you want.
7911000	7914000	Good to know. Good to know. Note me.
7914000	7915000	Have a great week.
7915000	7916000	All right, my friend. Take care.
7916000	7917000	Yep. Bye-bye.
7917000	7923000	Oh my god, the phones are on fire tonight. We got a little time. I'll try to get to as many of these as I can.
7923000	7925000	Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio. Who's this?
7925000	7926000	Hey, this is Akdeaf.
7926000	7928000	Hey, Akdeaf. What's on your mind, buddy?
7928000	7934000	Well, sorry. I'm going to expand a little bit on the Nintendo Switch Online thing.
7934000	7938000	Uh-oh, I'm getting my red alert out. No, no. You get to have your say, too.
7939000	7950000	And aside the NES games and all that, I have a more legit concern, at least in my aspect.
7950000	7964000	Because if some of you have learned or seen either from Twitter or Flacco Jones' Splatoon 2 streams,
7964000	7971000	you can all know that I cannot play any Switch game online since March.
7972000	7981000	Because of my internet provider and the connection it provides, it's my NAT.
7981000	7988000	It isn't either A or B, which is what it should be. It's either D or F.
7988000	7994000	Why is that? Because I don't have a direct connection. I use cable internet.
7995000	8001000	And that pretty much doesn't let me play online, at least with the Switch.
8001000	8007000	I can play on the PS4, I can play on the Xbox, and all that stuff.
8007000	8012000	And it isn't Nintendo's fault entirely. But here's my point.
8012000	8020000	Nintendo uses peer-to-peer connections. It isn't dedicated servers or anything like that.
8021000	8036000	So my question here for you is, do you want to pay aside the Nintendo Entertainment System stuff, aside the crowd saves?
8036000	8048000	If it were only the online connection, and in this case you know that it's a peer-to-peer connection and it isn't servers,
8048000	8051000	would you still pay for the service?
8053000	8062000	I'm thinking that's why I've got dead air going on here, because I do feel like it's hard for me to not discount the Netflix-type service,
8062000	8065000	because in a way that's kind of like selling it for me.
8065000	8074000	I also feel that the other companies have been charging online for years now, so it makes sense that Nintendo's coming to the table.
8074000	8078000	They are doing it cheaper, but you do make a good point.
8078000	8084000	If it's not dedicated servers, if it's peer-to-peer, but don't they still have to run at least matchmaking servers or something?
8084000	8089000	What connects you to those other players in Splatoon? That isn't magic.
8089000	8095000	Maybe once you're in the game, now it's peer-to-peer. But there's still got to be matchmaking servers, right?
8096000	8101000	I think so, but I'm not sure exactly if that's the case.
8102000	8110000	I still think if that's the case, then it's still a little bit justified, but at least they're charging a lesser price.
8110000	8121000	If Nintendo was charging $60 for this, I'd be like, okay, hold up, because you guys don't even have basic voice chat system.
8121000	8127000	No, I'm not buying the app. That app is not good. Maybe if they improve the app, it'll sweeten the pot a little bit.
8127000	8133000	Before their lower price, and considering they're throwing in the NES classics, which I'm sorry, it's hard for me to ignore that,
8133000	8136000	I do think it's something I will pick up.
8136000	8141000	If the NES classics things weren't there, I would really have to consider, because then it's just online play.
8141000	8144000	Is there something I want to play online? Yes or no.
8144000	8148000	Splatoon? I've cooled down a little bit on that compared to you and Flacco.
8148000	8155000	I certainly don't dislike Splatoon by any means, but I've just gone to other games, as we sometimes do.
8155000	8159000	But when Smash comes out, I might want to be able to play that online.
8159000	8163000	Do I need to play that online for a year? No, but I might want to play it online for a month.
8163000	8171000	But then, YYR in chat says, whatever someone would answer to this question now, the answer may change when Animal Crossing comes out.
8171000	8176000	And there's the big ticket item there.
8176000	8182000	Now, if Animal Crossing comes out, and it's really going to open up your village 24-7 for some types of interactions there,
8182000	8189000	because you've got more central servers and stuff, or whatever, depending on these online capabilities of Animal Crossing,
8189000	8193000	that one, my friend, that would probably sell it to me right there.
8193000	8200000	And yeah, that's definitely a good thing, because we're going to get more games, starting with Smash.
8200000	8205000	And he also adds a Pokemon. That's going to be a big thing.
8206000	8213000	That's true. This encourages Nintendo, for better or for worse, Loki, to do more online stuff.
8213000	8219000	Because now they know if they put online in games, that could be a constant revenue stream for them.
8219000	8224000	So it actually, it kind of forces Nintendo to look at a calendar already.
8224000	8228000	Loki, you want to chime in on this, or you spent?
8228000	8233000	I just, I'm not expecting much from them, whether they're charging for it or not.
8233000	8238000	I think just because they're now charging for it, that they're all of a sudden become better at what they're doing.
8238000	8241000	But you don't really play any Nintendo games online right now.
8241000	8242000	No, I don't.
8242000	8244000	So I wouldn't expect that you would buy this for any reason.
8244000	8249000	No, I'm still going to, just in case I want to, but I'm not, I don't want...
8249000	8250000	Well, no.
8250000	8252000	After all that, you guys.
8252000	8258000	Well, hold on. To that extent, I don't really play PlayStation 4 games online either.
8258000	8261000	I play mostly single player stuff.
8261000	8265000	I still pay for that, just in case if I want to play with somebody online.
8265000	8266000	Okay.
8266000	8273000	Same with this, I would pay for it just with the thought that I may want to play a game online with somebody at some point, like Mario Kart or something.
8273000	8278000	I won't have to like, oh wait, I better go buy my online thing to go do that.
8278000	8286000	You know, that's why. It's not because, oh yeah, I'm just saying I hate all their stuff now, but truly I love it all.
8286000	8293000	No, I think it's so... No, I don't. I'm sorry. I think it's really underwhelming, but it's the gateway that I have...
8293000	8296000	It's what I have to pay a door to play online.
8296000	8300000	I wish I'd gotten you to say that in the beginning of the show, that you're going to pay for the service anyway.
8300000	8303000	I think that would have been a very important footnote, but anyway.
8306000	8311000	SSG100Man says, rips it to hell, but is going to buy it anyway.
8311000	8312000	You know what?
8312000	8314000	That's why I got to switch. Hello?
8314000	8319000	Have you ever logged on to Twitter? Any of you? Have any of you looked at Twitter.com?
8319000	8323000	Anyway, sorry Act F. I didn't mean to derail your call. What's your perspective on this?
8323000	8329000	I mean, you have the online issues, so if Nintendo's going to want to charge for that, then they kind of have to fix them?
8329000	8336000	So I mean, it goes without saying, if online doesn't work, you're not going to pay for it, because what the fuck are you paying for?
8336000	8343000	But let's assume that maybe something about having money under it finally fixes it for you. What are your thoughts on it?
8343000	8352000	And that's the thing. I actually do want them to change, not use peer-to-peer, because it's not a problem that's only affecting me.
8352000	8363000	It's affecting a lot of people. If you search like, Nat problems switch on Google, you're going to find like tons of people complaining about this.
8363000	8377000	It is an easy fix for most people, but in my case, my ISP isn't letting me change that, at least fix the problem myself.
8378000	8392000	I have to pay them 600 pesos, which is like around $25 a month to get a private IP for me to let me play online.
8392000	8402000	I'm not going to pay that, especially since I have to pay for the Switch service online.
8402000	8413000	I really, really want them to fix this, because even with the NES games and all that stuff, it's good and the price isn't that bad.
8413000	8421000	But I would actually like to play online. I haven't played Splatoon that much because of that thing alone.
8421000	8424000	What has your internet service provider said about this?
8424000	8431000	I called them and they said, oh, you have to pay. That's it. I'm like, really?
8431000	8437000	You have to pay to get an answer out of them, or you have to pay for them to flip a Switch?
8437000	8442000	Yeah, I have to pay them to flip a Switch every month. So, no, fuck that.
8443000	8452000	And so there it is in chat. Bobby Blackhill says, welcome to net neutrality, or lack thereof, as the case may be.
8452000	8455000	What are net neutrality laws in Mexico, or are there any?
8455000	8465000	Oh, no, we don't have any. It's only this ISP, because other ISPs let you fix this problem by yourself.
8465000	8472000	But in this case, and I have researched this because, again, it's been like two months.
8472000	8480000	And it's because of how cable networks work here, especially here in Mexico, that it isn't a direct connection.
8480000	8485000	You share the connection with other people. So that's why.
8485000	8492000	And you have to pay the ISP here to get a direct connection, to get a private IP in this case.
8492000	8498000	So as brought up in chat, it's more kind of about Mexico's internet infrastructure to begin with.
8498000	8500000	Yeah, it sucks.
8500000	8505000	Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that, Defs, but I hope there's something that can be done to help you out.
8505000	8515000	Yeah, I hope that Nintendo changes things here, at least instead of being peer-to-peer to be a dedicated server.
8515000	8527000	So in that way, I can play. Because, again, I can play on the PS4, I can play things like Overwatch, Street Fighter, other stuff on other consoles.
8527000	8533000	But I cannot play any game on the Switch Online. So hopefully that changes with the service.
8533000	8536000	But if not, the ISP hopefully will come around.
8536000	8537000	Hopefully too.
8537000	8539000	As more and more people get Switches.
8539000	8542000	Hopefully that happens too.
8542000	8547000	Yeah, because I think that would happen sooner than the other. But we'll see.
8547000	8554000	Alright, well, act Def. Don't stop raising a fuss. Use social media if you have to with your ISP.
8554000	8558000	I'm not talking about Nintendo. I'm talking about your ISP. So, anyway.
8558000	8560000	Alright, take care, my friend.
8560000	8561000	Hey, thanks for having me.
8561000	8565000	Yeah, good to hear from you as always. Take care.
8565000	8572000	Alright. More calls. Longer show, more calls. But it's good. A lot of news this week.
8572000	8574000	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio. Who's this?
8574000	8576000	Hey, what's going on, everyone? It's Ron, though.
8576000	8578000	Hey, Ron. It's always good to hear from you. What's on your mind?
8578000	8581000	Not too much. It was two things I wanted to talk about.
8581000	8585000	One, I forgot, and I'll probably send an email in right here to show.
8585000	8591000	And the second thing, jog my memory as I'm sitting here, restoring my computer, taking care of business.
8591000	8601000	This is in regards to an article from a few weeks ago when you all talked about the Steam links being pushed to another section of Steam's website.
8601000	8604000	What did you want to say about it?
8604000	8613000	The thing is, I'm not surprised, because I'll be the first to say it. I don't think Steam links were that popular to begin with.
8614000	8627000	It also falls on the lines of the Steam machines, and to be perfectly honest, we all know the reason why Gabe Newell pushed Steam machines is because he has a hard-on for hatred of Windows.
8627000	8633000	In a way, I don't blame him, but as you can see, nobody is doing Steam machines.
8633000	8640000	You have to get a lot of the offices to get off of Windows before you're going to get the homes off of Windows, if that makes sense.
8640000	8643000	I mean, this is where Microsoft makes its killing, is the Office life.
8643000	8650000	Yes, and I remember a time when Best Buy was selling Linux in retail stores for like 50 bucks.
8650000	8659000	And you can look at it, it looks like Windows, it kind of feels like Windows, but it doesn't taste like Windows.
8659000	8669000	Or it's like how I use Open Office, because I've historically been too cheap to get Microsoft Office on my own computer.
8669000	8671000	It's like, it's close!
8671000	8677000	Uh, Rob, I'll tell you this. If you use it at work, you can use it at home, and I can tell you how.
8677000	8681000	Well, I'll have to follow up with you offline. I do use it at work.
8681000	8682000	Mm-hmm.
8682000	8683000	Alright, fair enough.
8683000	8694000	And the funny thing is about that, that's not a secret, it's more or less a known fact, it's just that IT guys just doesn't like to tell other people, even though Microsoft says go ahead and tell the other people.
8694000	8697000	Well, because they can't control what you do at home.
8697000	8705000	Yeah, because I'll say this. If you're using Office at work and you log in with a Microsoft account, like Office 365, each user has five licenses.
8705000	8714000	So if you log in with your Office account at work, you can download, you can go to the website, log in, and download a copy for your home personal use.
8716000	8720000	I'm going to look into that. Thank you for that tip, because I had no idea about that.
8720000	8732000	I mean, I enjoy OpenOffice well enough. I think they've done a very good job considering what kind of project it is, but it would be nice to have something that I can open directly and all that stuff. It would be nice.
8732000	8746000	That's true. I mean, before I really went back into being more oriented with Office, I followed OpenOffice, but I stopped because there is an issue between Excel and Calc.
8747000	8752000	Sometimes the formulas do not add up properly on both.
8752000	8759000	That is correct, and Calc is actually how I make the show rules for this show, but luckily no math is involved, so it works out okay.
8759000	8763000	All I need is something that exports to HTML, which I know Office can do too.
8763000	8775000	See, you use Calc. I actually use OneNote. It makes it easier for my crew, because they can just log in, drop articles in. I just go in, make the outline, and be like, log in here, done.
8775000	8795000	But we're kind of really straight off the beaten path here. What I'm saying is, I enjoy Steam just as everybody else, but I'm not going to sit here and build a $1,000 Steam box to play maybe, I don't know, a third or two-thirds of my collection.
8795000	8804000	Even though there are more games, there are more Linux and Mac OS friendly, every game that's on Steam plays on Windows.
8804000	8812000	And as far as I recall, with a Steam machine, you're not really going to be able to stream a Windows game for your PC to your Steam box.
8812000	8818000	Yeah, and the Steam box thing, I always had a hard time understanding who that was for.
8818000	8826000	And so the fact that they're fading a little bit, they're moving into the background, backup singers, isn't totally surprising to me.
8826000	8840000	Steam Link, I don't know, I always thought maybe there was a better calling for that, because especially when Steam got more into movies and stuff, but I kind of feel like Steam kind of brought out movies and then really didn't do anything with it.
8840000	8843000	Like, I feel like they missed the ball on that.
8843000	8857000	Yeah, I mean, if you built a Steam box and you loaded it where all you have to do is load the software, log in with your Steam account and bring everything forward, I think that would be good, but you still have extra stuff to do that.
8857000	8873000	Hell, I mean, with Windows 10 S that's coming down the route, I mean, if you could just have a decent front end for a media PC where you don't have to do anything special, just turn it on and it just comes right up like a console, you're good.
8873000	8879000	Yes. Agreed.
8880000	8891000	I mean, think about it, I mean, Xbox, 360, one, they're all Windows OSes, but it boots directly to a front end, that's it.
8891000	8917000	And I don't see, and the thing is, nobody's really kind of making that forward. You kind of can, by building your own machine and running scripts or automatic executables to bring it right up, but you should be able to just have a special front end edition of Windows where you load it, you log in, then once you log in, you tell the front end to come up, you reboot, you're golden.
8917000	8931000	Well, I gotta say though, you know, when it comes to the Steam Link, as much as I'm sitting here going, oh, the Steam Link is something that makes more sense, honestly, I can't tell you the last time I used mine. You know, when I want to play a computer game, sometimes I just want to be sitting at the computer.
8931000	8949000	Exactly. And I mean, my apartment is probably the size of your studio, so I can either go to my TV to play whatever consoles, if I want to jump on a steam, I just walk four feet over back to my PC and sit down in front and go for the gusto.
8949000	8964000	Yeah, and Rage Nator is giving a very similar scenario in chat saying my PC is right next to my new 40 inch TV, so Steam Box and Steam Link are unnecessary for me. Like if your living space or situation is small enough where it's kind of like all in the same place anyway, you know, then it doesn't make a lot of sense.
8964000	8976000	But you know, Alan and I rent a three bedroom house, so we thought it made more sense for us, but even then, it's not really needed. Like if I want to play something like Civilization on Steam, I'm not gonna do that on the TV.
8976000	8990000	Now, if I end up dumping $210 to get all seven Pinball Arcade Seasons, maybe that's something I do. I don't think I'll really do that, but I might buy some of these tables on PC that are like my fave fave fave ones, and then kind of go from there, but yeah.
8990000	8996000	Okay, now that you mentioned Civilization, now I remember the other thing I want to talk about. SimCity.
8996000	8997000	Oh, okay.
8997000	9005000	You're talking to someone who sat there in junior high, in high school, and just played SimCity non-stop.
9005000	9012000	Dude, that game is a classic. I used to play that game a shit ton on our very first 386 PC. I used to play that game all the time.
9012000	9026000	I wanted SimTown so badly because I thought it was a fun game. I just wanted it so badly. I wanted SimCity for Super Nintendo when it came out, but I was told you gotta pick this or that because they didn't have SimCity in at the time, so I was like, tear.
9026000	9027000	Aww.
9027000	9034000	But I actually went digging. I'm seriously thinking about purchasing SimCity 4 to play. Seriously.
9035000	9042000	Just so you can do some SimCity playing. Whatever you do, don't buy the 2013 version.
9042000	9056000	I want you to know, I bought SimCity CD. I lost it in my move, but I can tell you, I actually had a physical copy of it on our podcast, Anime Jam Session. I think it was last season. It might be this season.
9056000	9061000	Ari, his intro music is from SimCity.
9061000	9071000	I had the SimCity 94 CD-ROM as well, and hell if I know where that is now. It's probably in my dad's garage somewhere. That's gonna be a fucking treasure if I find that someday.
9071000	9088000	Well, if you find that, I would love a copy in exchange. I'll hook you up with copies of Sonic CD and Sonic R for PC that came out years ago. I just stumbled across them, now trying to find my copy of Last Bronx and the other Sega fighting game that came out on PC.
9088000	9098000	By the way, I see the chat happening right now between you and Bobby in chat, and I would actually agree with him too. Cities Skylines is kind of like what we think SimCity, the new one, should have been.
9098000	9105000	So if you haven't even played Cities Skylines yet, that might satisfy the itch. And there's a lot of people playing that.
9105000	9111000	Plus they have an expansion now, so if you wanted to play RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 as well on top of that, they have that theme park expansion.
9111000	9117000	Right, they have the theme park expansion. So I'm gonna give a hearty OLR recommendation to that to you.
9117000	9135000	You know what? I might just have to, because before SimCity came out for mobile, I kept looking around for a game that came close, but it's like, you had to do these extra features in order to do this one thing. I'm just like, I can't sit here and play this, so no. So I'm definitely gonna have to check into that.
9135000	9138000	Yeah, I definitely recommend.
9139000	9150000	I may just have to. I mean, between that, Age of Empires and Mini Metro, I think I'm gonna be a happy little nerd for a while.
9150000	9154000	Alright, well remember to go outside once in a while and drink plenty of water.
9155000	9168000	I have no choice but to go outside. It's called work. I have no choice but to drink water. I mean, there's a water fountain at work, so you know. I gotta pay for the habit, and you can't tell if you can hear it.
9168000	9176000	I'm tapping that vein, and that's the vein where I inject the money to play the games. And what's in that injection? The weekly paycheck.
9176000	9178000	That certainly doesn't sound like tapping a vein.
9178000	9182000	I know. I'm glad to know your basic needs are taken care of, Rama.
9183000	9185000	Let's not talk about my Friday night, okay?
9185000	9189000	Alright. Alright, I'm gonna let you go, so we can try to squeeze in one more call, but thank you.
9189000	9190000	Okay, bye.
9190000	9198000	Alright, bye. We'll see if we can squeeze in one more call. OrangeLaundrio, all one word on Skype. Loki, I haven't really been looking to you for last minute stories. Anything else you wanna bring up here?
9198000	9210000	Yeah, we got lots of stuff. So, Super Mario 64 Online is coming back. They had that whole season in the system that came down. For those of you who don't remember, that was the online multiplayer version of Super Mario 64.
9210000	9212000	It let you play Waluigi in it.
9212000	9222000	Yes, now you can play Waluigi, and Sonic, and Knuckles, and a bunch of other characters. Plus, they've added a capture the flag mode as well, so that's out there now.
9222000	9223000	Sounds like fun.
9223000	9224000	Yeah.
9224000	9231000	Let me get to a call, actually. We got one more call coming in. I'm gonna try to grab this here. Hi, you're on OrangeLaundrio. Who's this?
9231000	9233000	Hey, this is Regineater.
9233000	9235000	Hey buddy, what's on your mind tonight?
9235000	9242000	Not a whole lot. Well, two topics. I'll start with the one that I immediately called in about.
9242000	9243000	Okay.
9244000	9260000	As everyone knows, I've been mainly a PC gamer for the past, going on six years now, and I have dabbled with the 360 to a certain degree over the past few months.
9260000	9269000	And of course, I grew up with console gaming, and God knows I play virtually anything put in front of me.
9269000	9297000	Now, with all that being said, would you recommend getting a current gen system, be it the Switch, Xbox One, or a PS4, considering that I get games updated on PC, or should I just stick to mainly PC?
9297000	9307000	I'm not sure that's something we can answer for you, Regineater, because you have to ask yourself, you know, is what you have enough? Do you feel satisfied with what you have?
9307000	9316000	Do you think there's enough for the entertainment in those things that you have? And I'm sure, you know, I know you're a deal hunter. We make a lot of jokes here on OLR about the, you know, free games and all that stuff.
9316000	9325000	But I'm sure over the years, you've built up quite a little library on your 360 and your PC, and if that is enough to satisfy you, then you know what? Then you're good.
9325000	9331000	And you don't have to buy these systems just because other people are buying these systems. It doesn't make you any less of a gamer or anything like that.
9331000	9344000	Now, on the other hand, if you're sitting there going, God, I see these videos for Breath of the Wild, and I see these things for Mario Odyssey, and man, I am missing the fuck out because these things are not on PC.
9344000	9352000	Or, you know, that goes other ways, too. You know, if you're watching, you know, the clips of PlayStation 4 games, you know, like, God, I really want to be able to play Horizon or God of War.
9352000	9369000	God, everybody's fucking raving about God of War, but it's like, I can't get that on PC. Then you have to start asking yourself, you know, that harder question of, well, like any luxury, like going on a trip, going, you know, getting booze one night, going to a movie.
9369000	9388000	Like any luxury, is it worth the effort for me to really save for that to enjoy that? Or would my money be better spent? Just, I'm perfectly, I'm getting, I get the same satisfaction out of finding 10 bargains for five bucks a pop on the 360.
9388000	9405000	Yeah, you know, my thought is, you know, don't get me wrong, I love PC gaming. I'm always talking about this deal, that deal, whatever. I get more PC games than I can possibly count or play in a lifetime.
9405000	9428000	But, you know, in fact, you kind of touched on it. PC gaming doesn't have everything, you know, like, you know, Sony has the Uncharted series, you know, Microsoft has like the Forza series, and hell, I just picked up Forza Horizon 2 on my 360 not too, too long ago.
9428000	9445000	I mean, enjoying the crap out of that. I mean, unfortunately, as far as I know, to get anything newer than Forza Horizon 2, I would probably have to get an Xbox One. So that's where I'm kind of now having this little debate.
9446000	9460000	Well, yeah, I all I can really do is wish you luck in that it seems like you would get a lot of value out of Xbox One because the fact you have the backwards compatibility and all that stuff. But at the same time, you know, you already have a rich Microsoft library, maybe it's time to go to Nintendo.
9460000	9473000	But don't forget that is that not only do you have to get the system, you have to get the games. So one thing that the Xbox One would give you is that while you already have several games that are going to carry around on over to Xbox One, but they're not going to look any different than they do now on 360.
9474000	9480000	A lot of that is a convenience thing when it comes to many of those games. Anyway, you said you had another question. Let's get to that real quick.
9480000	9497000	Yeah, well, I kind of touched on that to a degree when I called Bobby's show earlier, but I started commenting on the whole pinball arcade losing the bulk of the tables.
9497000	9499000	Yeah, what's your thought?
9499000	9500000	Pardon?
9500000	9501000	What's your thought?
9501000	9514000	Well, the thing is, you know, I can understand why they're losing it. Unfortunately, I can't control what Williams is doing.
9514000	9519000	But at the same time, I'm kind of sad to see the tables go.
9520000	9533000	Yeah, I mean, you know, unfortunately, I've been kind of neglecting buying the seasons and whatnot for that game compared to pinball effects.
9533000	9544000	But, you know, these games, whether you're talking about pinball effects or pinball arcade, they're fun to sell.
9544000	9550000	Yeah, sure. Bobby can attest to that. New guys can attest to that. I mean, no.
9550000	9562000	Well, I don't know if Dark Soccer was here. She'd say, I have the real thing in my garage. But not everybody has that. And we know that not everybody takes their pinball love to that level. That's a very special level.
9563000	9569000	You know what, though? I want to bring up an interesting point from Brad from Pod Culture in our chat who says used OG XB1s are pretty cheap-ish.
9569000	9576000	You know, he makes a good point because, you know, how we talked about the whole, like, luxury budget, you know, and you mentioned that you're into the pinball arcade.
9576000	9585000	Now, not that I don't think you've maybe dropped this much on pinball arcade, especially all at once. But we all know that, you know, there's not going to be a sale for pinball arcade.
9585000	9589000	So I'm sorry to break your heart on that, but that is due to the licensing and all that.
9589000	9599000	So the reality is, all seven seasons here before they go away are going to be $210. Whether you bought them before or you buy them now, it's going to set you back over $200.
9599000	9603000	You know what, Regenator? That's about the price of a used Xbox One.
9604000	9612000	Yeah. Well, admittedly, to date, I had bought two full seasons, season two and season three.
9612000	9620000	And I think I bought, you know, the occasional eyeball table, like the next Star Trek Next Generation table.
9620000	9631000	And I think one other one. But so I won't necessarily have to drop the full $210 between now and the day of June.
9631000	9638000	But, you know, even then, you know, I won't be able to drop all that money, you know, you know, for all the seasons.
9638000	9640000	So I could have to be a little selective.
9640000	9649000	Yeah. I'm not going to drop all that money either because some of these machines I just don't have that same attachment to like F14 Tomcat.
9649000	9660000	I mean, not I'm sure it's a fine table, a solid table, but not one that evokes those childhood memories in the same way that, say, Tales of Arabian Nights or the Pinbot family does.
9660000	9664000	You know, it's not quite the same thing. So I might be a little more picky choosy, too.
9664000	9672000	Yeah. And the thing is, you know, well, I don't live in California like you guys.
9672000	9679000	I never had the chance to go to these cons or whatever you want to call them.
9679000	9691000	They have all these people tables on display in most places that are in my area that have had arcades, you know, over the years.
9691000	9695000	Not very rarely, if ever, have pinball tables.
9695000	9708000	So a lot of these classic tables I never really got a chance to play over the years is mostly actual upright arcade games more than anything.
9708000	9712000	Keep an eye out, Raginator. You never know when they'll show up in the area.
9712000	9721000	Yeah. So a lot of these classic pinball tables, I played for the first time through pinball arcade.
9721000	9729000	So, you know, with these tables going, you know, it's going to hurt a little bit.
9729000	9737000	Yeah. Hopefully, you know, even though I think Farsight did a fine job and deserves to keep the license, I mean, the reality is, if Williams is going to revoke it,
9737000	9743000	and they're taking it somewhere else, I hope they're at least going to be able to put this out somewhere else.
9743000	9748000	But, you know, based on everything we talked about with YYR, it's not going to be as easy as just getting the table.
9748000	9754000	Because especially with these things that tie into TV and movies, it goes a whole lot deeper than that.
9754000	9758000	And another company may not have that drive that Farsight had.
9758000	9762000	Anyway, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up. But thank you so much for the call.
9762000	9764000	All right. Sure. Have a nice night.
9764000	9765000	Yep. You too. Bye.
9765000	9773000	All right. That will do it for the show tonight because I do know Bobby's going to be doing a live stream here after the show.
9773000	9775000	I don't want to keep him up too late, so I do want to wrap things up.
9775000	9780000	Let me just quickly get, like, the cliff note headlines from you here of anything else we missed here, Loki.
9780000	9785000	We talked about that Crystal whatever game.
9785000	9786000	Yeah.
9786000	9788000	So they also have a fighting game that's coming out too.
9788000	9789000	Oh, cool.
9789000	9793000	So that one was called Blade Strangers, and it also has similar characters as well.
9793000	9805000	They have the binding of Isaac, quote from Cave Story, Gunvolt from Azure Strikers, Gunvolt Solenge from Code Princess.
9805000	9812000	And they had, like, other characters in there as well. So that looked kind of cool.
9812000	9815000	And, yeah, I guess that's about it.
9816000	9827000	Oh, there's a new SNES game coming from Devolver Digital, Fork Parker's Crunch Out, talking about video game developer Crunch.
9827000	9830000	And so that's something that you can actually get on a physical cart.
9830000	9836000	They're going to have actual playable cartridges for $50 each, or you can get a special edition for $150.
9836000	9837000	Hmm.
9837000	9839000	So interesting.
9839000	9844000	And if you want to check that out, I believe they have it on MegaCatStudios.com.
9844000	9845000	That's it.
9845000	9846000	That's it.
9846000	9853000	All right. Well, I want to thank you guys for downloading and checking out our show tonight.
9853000	9858000	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf is saying, I bought this Super Nintendo game and I paid for the special edition cart.
9858000	9859000	Happy birthday to me.
9859000	9860000	Yes. Happy birthday to you.
9860000	9865000	You know what? You get to spend that luxury money on whatever you want, and nobody gets to judge you for it.
9865000	9866000	It's your money.
9866000	9870000	And it's also your time, and we appreciate you taking the time out to listen to OLR every week.
9870000	9876000	I hope we helped you get through the work day or the commute or live on Sunday night or however you choose to partake in Orange Ons Radio.
9876000	9880000	We really appreciate you guys downloading the show and listening live and checking it out.
9880000	9883000	If you enjoyed what you heard here, please tell a friend or two about the show.
9883000	9889000	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, you know, we can't air them.
9889000	9891000	So that is really going to do it here.
9891000	9894000	A five-star review on iTunes, Google Play, wherever you found the show.
9894000	9897000	Those go a very long way as well.
9897000	9900000	Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9900000	9905000	Hopefully I will work on game development again.
9905000	9908000	I've been trying to this week, but I've been just like really tired.
9908000	9921000	I haven't been able to sleep well between the kids and the cat, because the cat decides to throw up in the most inconvenient spot at three in the morning and then sprint around the house, throwing up in each and every single room there.
9921000	9923000	So that was annoying.
9923000	9930000	So yeah, I just want to sit down and actually build a program, but I just don't have the mental capacity to do that at that point.
9930000	9932000	It's almost like just go to sleep.
9932000	9935000	So I'm going to try this week, hoping.
9935000	9940000	Although if it's anything like today, Outlook's not very positive.
9940000	9945000	All right, and my final thought is I hope to get in some more game playing this week.
9945000	9952000	It's been very, very busy this week and will probably continue to be for another couple of weeks, but hoping to get some more gaming time in soon.
9952000	9954000	So that is going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.
9954000	9957000	We want to thank you guys again for taking the time out with us this week.
9957000	9961000	Sorry, you better make it fast because I'm wrapping up random tangent.
9961000	9963000	I found some ice cream today.
9963000	9968000	It's maple maple pancake ice cream.
9968000	9971000	So it has its maple ice cream with bits of pancake and butter in it.
9971000	9973000	OK, next time you're going to interrupt me with that.
9973000	9974000	You better fucking bring me some.
9974000	9976000	I almost did today.
9976000	9978000	I did week.
9978000	9980000	All right.
9980000	9981000	That's it.
9981000	9982000	We're done.
9982000	9983000	We're out of here.
9983000	9984000	Dark soccer will be back next week.
9984000	9987000	So we will all be here to do it all again until then.
9987000	9988000	Goodbye.
9988000	9989000	And thanks.
