00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,320
This week, Rockstar draws on its years of experience with GTA Online and brings the

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,680
experience to the Wild West.

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,760
Gather your posse and get rootin', lootin' and shootin' without threat of the giant death

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
ray.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
That's just one story on the home stretch of the year.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,520
Join us for the rest of the night's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,520
every gamer has their voice.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,720
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
Welcome back.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,840
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,640
Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 754 for this December the 2nd of 2018.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,760
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
gaming culture, the gamer's lifestyle, all that good stuff, with my co-hosts.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi, Loki, how are you?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm fine.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, me too.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm fine too.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Did you have a good week?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,320
Looking forward to any of the big retail releases coming up, like Smash is big, I know you have

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,800
a Switch now, are you gonna pick up Smash, or maybe Katamari re-roll?

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Maybe.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
Sega Genesis Collection's gonna be pretty cool for retro fans.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Maybe.

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
I don't know.

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I have to...

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I'm spending money on kids, so you know.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I just...

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Well, that's how it goes sometimes.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,360
They don't know, but I've already purchased four more Switch games for myself.

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Oh!

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
What'd you...

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Well, of course you'd say.

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Of course.

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
What'd you get them?

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
So...

39
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Where did Santa get them?

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:43,800
Yeah, so Santa got them, well, my youngest son, the Lego Incredibles, and Lego DC Villains,

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
which is pretty cool.

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,640
And then for my older son, and they made Switch between stuff too.

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,080
And you play those Lego games as much as they do.

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,520
Not on the Switch so much.

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,200
Actually, they've been playing more on the Switch, but anyways.

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,640
So Hello Neighbor and Bendy and the Ink Machine.

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Oh, okay.

48
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,680
Hello Neighbor is that scary game, isn't it?

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,560
Yes, speaking of scary games, so my oldest son's now has been playing Ultimate Custom

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,520
Night, which is the Five Nights at Freddy's build your own Five Nights at Freddy's game

51
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
type thing.

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
So he's been playing that.

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Well, that's fun.

55
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Apparently in super easy mode.

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
Okay.

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
With no robots.

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,440
What's the point if you're playing with no robots in there?

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,360
It's like, cause I can beat it, like, okay.

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,400
It's safe.

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,040
Not very scary when it's done that way.

62
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
All right.

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
That's fine.

64
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I respect that.

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
But my youngest son wants to play Hello Neighbor.

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,040
I think he won't like Bendy, but like I figured they've just, they're going to fight over

67
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
it.

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
They're going to fight over everything anyway.

69
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
It's going to be absolutely miserable because we only have one Switch and they're like,

70
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
I don't want to play this game.

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,040
I already have a headache thinking about it.

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,120
All right.

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,400
Not here tonight, Dark Sakura or JB Summers.

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,880
She's still on a work conflict for a little while, but she will join us later in the show

75
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,400
and she will be here in studio next week.

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,520
So let's jump right into some gaming news.

77
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,680
Well, let me do say if you are listening live, of course, over the voice geeks network of

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,120
vognetwork.com because that's where we tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,580
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Block will show.

80
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,240
You can always join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where Dungeon Buster does

81
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,880
say nice picks.

82
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,000
Bendy's on my game wishlist on Steam.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The demo was fun.

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,760
For kids and adults alike as a lot of great video games often are.

85
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Yeah.

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,520
And they, the other one I wanted to get was the Lego Harry Potter collection because they've

87
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,040
just started watching Harry Potter.

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Oh, okay.

89
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
So we were up to the, we just finished the third movie.

90
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Okay.

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
So they're about as far as I am.

92
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,720
So, but they're like super into it now.

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,400
And so they would want to play that, but they didn't have that at GameStop.

94
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
So you know.

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
All right.

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Fair enough.

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,640
Anyhow, Dark Sakura will be back with us next week, at least for a week.

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
She's still going to be on and off in the show through February.

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,880
Sadly, there's just nothing we can do about work.

100
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,480
Work is most important, but Loki and I still holding down the fort here with all you guys

101
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,660
in our live chat room soon to be over on Twitch TV in a couple of weeks.

102
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,320
So if you aren't following VOG Network, all one word over at Twitch, that's going to be

103
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,240
the new home for our live nights.

104
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,880
Again, podcast stuff, uh, still going to pretty much work how it always has.

105
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,840
It's just, instead of this whole shoutcast, Winamp, what's the link to the stream?

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,880
I think most people are very familiar with, oh, let me just pull out my phone and go to

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
that Twitch channel.

108
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,560
That's actually going to be a little easier, I think for most people.

109
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,000
So more details on that, uh, as we get closer and closer to the go live date, which is right

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
now targeted as December 16th.

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,640
Um, but it may go one way or the other, depending on how some of these computer issues work

112
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
out.

113
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
We shall see.

114
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,940
Uh, anyhow, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic because we got video game news going

115
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,940
on.

116
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,920
So let's talk about, even though you would think it's starting to slow down because the

117
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,120
holidays and maybe to an extent that's true.

118
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,160
And I say the holidays, cause really this, this whole period between Thanksgiving and

119
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,800
and Christmas and, and new years is the holidays because to be fair, Hanukkah started tonight.

120
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,360
So happy Hanukkah to all those that observe it for sure.

121
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,440
Um, but we're in that period called the holidays.

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,740
So usually not a lot of big gaming, uh, happening now, but we are still shy.

123
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,640
A few big gaming releases, right?

124
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,160
By the time I think about this, by the time you guys, you know, hear this, or by the time

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,040
we're doing our next episode, let's say the next episode we do super smash brothers old

126
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,120
ultimate will be a thing.

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,820
It will be out in the world as will Katamari and, and, uh, the Genesis collections of these

128
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,660
other games, you know, that are kind of at the tail end of the year here, uh, and hopefully

129
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,940
going to end up under some, you know, menorahs and some Christmas trees, uh, for, uh, folks

130
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,940
that sell.

131
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,940
Yeah.

132
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,940
And that's why I didn't get them smashed.

133
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,160
Cause we'll probably just get smashed anyways.

134
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Yeah.

135
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,660
And besides like I was, I was at, like I said, I was at GameStop and only because I agreed

136
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,820
to go get ice cream for the family because they were watching the movie.

137
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,820
And so I just went over there.

138
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,140
I was like, well, I need to get some Christmas shopping done anyway.

139
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,140
I love the, had to justify why you were at GameStop.

140
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,140
It's fine.

141
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,140
It's fine.

142
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,140
I was just trying to explain why it's ridiculous.

143
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,620
Cause it games out there like, well, you know, we're not even going to have enough copies

144
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,820
of smash.

145
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,540
You know, people aren't going to be able to get one.

146
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,140
I'm like, or you could just buy it digitally and they're just an infinite amount of copies.

147
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Yeah.

148
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,020
GameStop may need to change some of their, uh, yeah.

149
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,860
You know, I was at, not to derail a bit here because we do have a big thing we want to

150
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,500
get into, but I was at target just randomly, um, looking at stuff.

151
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,100
You know, we, we, we needed like paper towels or something.

152
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,060
So of course it turned into like a hundred dollar shopping trip.

153
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,680
Well, part of it is because I added one more mini machine to my collection.

154
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,700
So I now have a Galaga machine in my collection.

155
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,820
These are the mini little mini ones that are like 35 bucks to my arcade.

156
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,940
Uh, so I have that some of it from that collection.

157
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,760
I have Walmart's kind of $20 equivalent.

158
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,620
There are things you should get the $300 ones.

159
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,340
The ones that are like yay high or whatever.

160
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:43,220
Well, I told Santa AKA the guy I'm married to that, uh, I wanted that cause they have

161
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,500
like an $80 one.

162
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,540
That's a little bigger that has like bad dudes and stuff.

163
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,140
$300 might be a bit much when he's unemployed by now, but 80 eighties in the right range.

164
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,740
So I said I wanted that one.

165
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
That's a little bigger.

166
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,980
It's going to have to go like on the side or something.

167
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,740
If we get that one or, you know, you can just plug that in and I know and have all the games

168
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,860
that has bad dudes on it.

169
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,860
It doesn't.

170
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,860
I know.

171
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
I know.

172
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,460
Anyway, he's pointing at the, uh, the good old, uh, tabletop main machine that used to

173
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,860
be at his work many years ago.

174
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,700
If you're listening to show about three years ago or so, maybe God, maybe longer about 14.

175
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Oh geez.

176
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Okay.

177
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,100
So about four years ago, uh, that was, uh, when he brought that over here, it still has

178
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,540
the name of his company on the marquee, which is funny.

179
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
Yes.

180
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
All right.

181
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
Anyway, I promise gave me news.

182
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,580
So we still have a lot going on, especially around one recent release.

183
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
Right?

184
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
Low key.

185
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,580
A lot of news surrounding.

186
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,580
Yeah.

187
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,580
76.

188
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,360
I've watched my fair share of reviews on this.

189
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,900
I haven't picked it up because I just, I'm not re I wasn't too keen on it to begin with

190
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,780
because it was, you know, online with other people and stuff like that.

191
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,060
Maybe that's not such a big deal now, but it's just, it seems like it's a mess.

192
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,740
And so what kind of started things off, you know, people were kind of getting pissed off

193
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,020
the games just buggy and broken as shit and that there's just nothing that's really being

194
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,340
done to fix any of it.

195
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,500
So finally they came out, they made this big post on Reddit, uh, talking about like, we're

196
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,540
going to do some better communication in the future and here's what the fall of 76 team's

197
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
working on.

198
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,900
Um, so some of the improvements they're going to make a priority in the December 4th patch

199
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,180
is they're increasing the stash sizes.

200
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,820
So it's going to go up from 400 to 600 pounds.

201
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,460
And for those who don't play the game, the stash is basically you're kind of walking

202
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,420
chest that moves with you to any locations that you take over.

203
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:34,000
So you can, um, basically just be able to put more loot in there, um, improving loot

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,520
drops for tough bosses because apparently the drops haven't been very good or they may

205
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,160
not spawn very well, uh, enough things.

206
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,760
So they're going to improve that as well.

207
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Um, they're saying that apparently people who have suffered glitches that caused them

208
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,620
to be remained or trapped inside their power armor will be able to come out of their power

209
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,640
armor because apparently that's a thing.

210
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,560
Um, and also they're saying that they're going to cut down on the excessive backtracking

211
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
in the game.

212
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,360
Um, cause apparently there was an issue where is forcing players that were over encumbered

213
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,240
to spawn back at vault 76 so you have to walk way back to where, Oh yikes, where your place

214
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
was.

215
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,200
And then, um, December 11th, they're adding push to talk on PC because why the hell that

216
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
wasn't there?

217
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
I don't know.

218
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Oh boy.

219
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,760
This apparently being their first online game that they ever done and yet for some reason

220
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,640
they also had help from all these other teams including a team that has this massive game

221
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,280
called, you know, the elder scrolls online that you would think that they would have

222
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,160
like, so you'd be like, ah, you know, you probably should put that in there.

223
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I know.

224
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,280
I was going to say it's, it's actually not the first online game they've ever done.

225
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Cause technically Bethesda proper it is cause Bethesda online is another.

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Okay.

227
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
All right.

228
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Fair.

229
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
And all right, fine.

230
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
You got me out of technicality.

231
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
You're fine.

232
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,880
Cause I was even just thinking, uh, throughout all this news I was like, boy, like I, I,

233
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,120
you know, I'm not really a big fallout person.

234
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,960
I've never gotten into that series as much.

235
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
I've tried them.

236
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,920
I've played a little fallout three, a little fallout four, but I just, I don't get into

237
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,360
that series as much as maybe an elder scrolls game, uh, is something that I would get into

238
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
a little more.

239
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,740
And I was just thinking, I was like, gosh, I mean, if this was an elder scrolls online

240
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
game, I'd be really here too.

241
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
And I was like, wait a minute.

242
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,480
There was an elder scrolls online game.

243
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,200
I just didn't really get into that one either, but I don't remember that being, I mean, I

244
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,800
just might be seeing it through like rose tinted glasses or whatever.

245
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,160
I don't remember that game being that messy, but then again, I seem to remember when they

246
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
first brought out Tam, cause I didn't want to pay the monthly fee.

247
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,920
So I didn't get on it until it was Tamriel unlimited or whatever.

248
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Yeah.

249
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,960
And when that first came out, like I think what was happening is like, things weren't

250
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,280
loading on my PlayStation four and I was like, why don't I see any of the things I'm supposed

251
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
to be doing?

252
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,480
And I think it was like those types of bugs.

253
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,560
So it's like, I just kind of broke it, not enough, like elder scrolls, Skyrim for me.

254
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,120
So I didn't want to play it, but I love, I would love a multiplayer Skyrim.

255
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,400
It's just, I'm not sure if they're going to be the ones to make that.

256
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,320
I think I'm ready for Bethesda to move on to elder scrolls six and see, see what happens

257
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
next.

258
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
So we'll see.

259
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Okay.

260
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,120
So like one of the, like, but everything that's happening here does not make me feel great.

261
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,560
No, no, no, seriously, you know, prior to them, um, you know, releasing this statement

262
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,240
on Reddit, I mean, there was like people discovering, you know, stuff that's recycled from older

263
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
games.

264
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,480
Like, I mean, this is something they've been doing, like, you know, Skyrim, there's references

265
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,360
to like fallout three and this one there's references to follow for like checking to

266
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,920
make sure the fallout four disc is in the drive or some weird shit.

267
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
I don't know.

268
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
There's like a lot of recycled.

269
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,560
Well, I actually don't think that's as big of a crime as you might think because it's

270
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,760
common for games to get built on engine.

271
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Right?

272
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,480
I mean, like, come on, if you were to play like a Madden game, you're going to see some

273
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,440
of the ghost stuff from fallout four, I think are being actually repurposed in this game

274
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
as well.

275
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,800
It's just, it looks like fallout four, um, except crap.

276
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,600
So, and then on top of that, there was some other stuff with camps where they're basically

277
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,400
allowing you to bulldoze the area so you can remove like rubble and stuff that's nearby

278
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,960
so that you can build a camp better.

279
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,480
And then also a way to relocate your camp to another server if there is somebody in

280
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,600
your camp space, because apparently like when you go offline, your camp is gone or whatever

281
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,920
it gets deleted.

282
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,080
If someone builds there, I don't know how it works, but it's stupid.

283
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,440
Um, so anyways, so they did all that and you know, the game was a buggy mess and people

284
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,240
were not very happy about that at the beginning, but at least there seemed to be like saying,

285
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,200
okay, well we're going to do something about that maybe.

286
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,660
Maybe they should have waited a few more months before releasing it, but unfortunately this

287
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:42,320
is Bethesda's now like, it's like the running gag in the industry is, you know, Oh, Bethesda's

288
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,760
games are never done when they release.

289
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
They're always buggy.

290
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,880
Like I, it just kind of blows my mind that anybody would preorder a Bethesda game at

291
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
this point.

292
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,320
But see that that's the point like buggy, yes, like Skyrim, buggy as fuck, still buggy

293
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
as fuck.

294
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,680
And, but there's an intriguing storyline.

295
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
The gameplay is good.

296
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
That's what you have.

297
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
Fallout 76 didn't have the great storyline, didn't have the intriguing gameplay.

298
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,160
And so now people are like, okay, well now these bugs are deal breaker.

299
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I guess.

300
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Okay.

301
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,080
I guess I can see that a little bit because red dead redemption is also buggy edition

302
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,760
too, but like it seems to be forgivable because a, the bugs are hilarious.

303
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,600
Like when the women, women gets hit by the horse that I saw in some video or like I was,

304
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,760
it was like one of my friends shared on Facebook today.

305
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,200
They were, they were walking through a mountainous area of train.

306
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,940
All of a sudden this horse just comes tumbling down the hill in the mountain.

307
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,120
So it was like kind of funny, but it isn't like game ruining.

308
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
But I get what you're saying.

309
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,960
Like, you know, red dead also has tons and tons and tons of story and all this other

310
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
stuff.

311
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
It's detailed.

312
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Skyrim's the same way.

313
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,320
Fallout 76 because the whole MO story really, I mean, because it's, to be fair, it's not

314
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
really supposed to be.

315
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
It's supposed to be online.

316
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,640
You're, you and your friends build the world.

317
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,000
It's like MMOs have stories, but unfortunately to some of those stories are getting really

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
ugly.

319
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,620
I don't know if you read about that Twitch stream where, um, some guys, I think one guy

320
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,120
said off handed to some other player, like, Oh, your outfit's really cute.

321
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,160
And then they got basically called anti-gay slurs and hunted down by a squad that was basically

322
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
trying to kill him because they were gay.

323
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Yeah.

324
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
And it was really disgusting.

325
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,920
And to Bethesda's credit, they, they banned that crap.

326
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,920
And they said, I don't want, we don't want this toxic shit in our game, which good for

327
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
them.

328
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,960
But you know, it's, it's G when you, when you throw all these people in a no man's wasteland,

329
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,000
it's almost as if the worst part of humanity comes out of people when they can hide behind

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
their monitor.

331
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's, it's kind of sad.

332
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,020
But then there's, of course, you know, the Bethesda fans who, you know, really did like

333
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,960
fallout 76 or fallout and they decided, Hey, I'm going to order that collector's edition

334
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,360
cause I got to have that power armor helmet and stuff like that.

335
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:51,020
And it comes with this really nice, you know, canvas bag and it's $200.

336
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
And so what happened?

337
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,200
Well, they got their, their $200 power armor edition and that canvas bag is not canvas.

338
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,640
It is a nylon cheap ass bag that they built and which it's, it's more of like, it's kind

339
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
of like this.

340
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,040
It's like if the game were really good, that might be overlooked, but it's not.

341
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,600
So now you're nitpicking every little thing that's wrong with it because it's like, well,

342
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,900
what the fuck you guys now, now I'm pissed at everything.

343
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,100
I actually disagree.

344
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,560
I think this is shitty.

345
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,640
Even if the game was good, I think it's a real shit move.

346
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,040
So basically go ahead.

347
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,960
They, they complained that there were, it started off as a post on Reddit and they complained,

348
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,200
you know, saying, Hey, what the hell, you know, why is this bag not an actual canvas

349
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
bag?

350
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,680
And they, um, commented, they contacted customer support to where there was an email response

351
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,120
saying that, you know, thank you for contacting Bethesda support.

352
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,840
My name is Nicholas and I'd be happy to help you do the unavailability of materials.

353
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,900
We had to switch to nylon carrying case and fallout 76 power armor edition.

354
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,960
We hope this doesn't prevent anyone from enjoying what we feel is the best collector's edition.

355
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,160
And then before that though, they said that, um, uh, what was it that they had no intention

356
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,400
of up, you know, fixing it, that there was, it was a prototype that was shown in those

357
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,840
pictures and that they weren't unable to make it.

358
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,280
But you got to get to the second story.

359
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
You got it.

360
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
We're getting there.

361
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
We're getting there.

362
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
We're getting there.

363
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Okay.

364
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
This is the worst.

365
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
I know it's coming.

366
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
You all know what's coming.

367
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
And I'm sitting here going, Oh my God, I'm about to pop off.

368
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Hold on.

369
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Hold on.

370
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
There's still more.

371
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
So it's still on their site.

372
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,680
The collector's edition is still advertising a canvas bag.

373
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Okay.

374
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
It was still advertising canvas bag.

375
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm good.

376
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
Great.

377
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
That's not good.

378
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,480
But then, then it gets even better because everyone's already pissed at this.

379
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Oh.

380
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,440
Oh, we understand that you may not be happy with the bag.

381
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,880
Oh, let me just get the exact, the exact phrase invaded because it was just, we understand

382
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,440
and respect that there's a disappointment with the bag and the power arm edition.

383
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
We are sorry.

384
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,720
Please contact Bethesda support with your proof of your collector's edition purchase.

385
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,640
They will assist you in granting your account 500 Adams, 500 as being 500 points of their

386
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,720
fake Bethesda money that you buy follow crap with, which by the way is not enough to actually

387
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,160
get an in game nylon or maybe a nylon bag, but not a canvas bag.

388
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Okay.

389
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,360
But then it gets even better.

390
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:25,560
The best part was that apparently canvas bags do exist because why?

391
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,360
Because they've been giving them out to influencers at press events.

392
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,640
They're not necessarily the same canvas bags, but their canvas and their fallout 76 bags

393
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
and the type of bags that if they were the ones included in the bundle, we wouldn't have

394
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
any of these issues.

395
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
No.

396
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Yeah.

397
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Okay.

398
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Y'all.

399
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,480
I try very hard in the show to not get caught up in like angry mob mentality that happens

400
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
online and Twitter and stuff.

401
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,880
I always try to be very fair.

402
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,920
I try to look at all perspectives about like, you know, and, and, and, you know, maybe there's

403
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,440
a reason why this decision was made and all that stuff.

404
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,480
But like when I read this about the fact that they were handing out canvas bags that existed,

405
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,560
that were made, that the cost was known, how much it made made cost to make those bags

406
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,960
to influencers.

407
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,600
Like I can't, I can't, I got nothing like rake them over the fucking coals, Twitter.

408
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,960
It's it's like, they deserve it.

409
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,640
That is shitty.

410
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,600
That is just straight up shitty.

411
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,960
There's no other word for it than what they did with, with subbing out the canvas of the

412
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,440
nylon, because they didn't know the cost and they're continuing to do it online.

413
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,700
And then they go and they give it to their influencers so that people are making these

414
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,720
YouTubes and these Twitch, like, Oh, cause you know, these unboxing videos are sweet

415
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,160
and then they show this whole thing.

416
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,320
And I'm sorry, there is a huge difference between a canvas bag and a nylon bag.

417
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,920
Like we're not talking about like fucking like polyester and cotton.

418
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,400
Like this is, there's a huge difference between those two types of bags.

419
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:04,080
So the fact that like Bethesda is trying to say they, they did poor planning on this,

420
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,460
then you did poor planning on this, like this and everything else, suck it up, buttercup.

421
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,280
You did, did poor planning on this.

422
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,960
Then I mean, I honestly think, and I don't agree with this, but I honestly think a better

423
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,240
option would have been to make the canvas bag smaller, but at least it would have been

424
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,560
like matching their advertising and all this stuff.

425
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,180
And again, what you gave the influencers should have been the product.

426
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:38,560
So we have this very interesting case now of in the year 2018 is Bethesda practicing

427
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,660
in false advertising.

428
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,860
And I think the fact that they're still showing it on the website, despite all this, I think

429
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,840
even by old school measures would show, yes, they are.

430
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,620
They're falsely advertising right now and they know damn well they can't produce those

431
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,000
canvas bags.

432
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,760
But now we live in this really interesting YouTube, Twitch, social media influencer age

433
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,140
where it's like, did they practice in false advertising by giving their influencers a

434
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,600
different product than what they gave the people?

435
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Well, it's even better about the influencer thing too, is they had this at multiple events.

436
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,280
So some of these influencers may have actually received multiple canvas bags and the, I know

437
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,340
one of these that were handed out was actually during this three hour long like press event

438
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,040
to get early foot or not early gameplay, I guess, of Fallout 76.

439
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,280
But it's just, it's bad.

440
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,400
It's just bad.

441
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,480
Like especially now with the whole drama behind it and everything, it's just, yeah, people

442
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,800
are going to nitpick the stuff you do now even more so, whereas they may be a little

443
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,960
bit more forgiving because you fucked up every aspect of this, every possible aspect that

444
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,940
you had to do, it was just all fucked up.

445
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,400
Like the game is all fucked up.

446
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,880
It doesn't play right.

447
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,680
And then the collector's editions paid $200 for it.

448
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,040
You can't tell, you couldn't afford to make a bag for $200.

449
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,080
I mean the game, 60 bucks, okay, whatever.

450
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,120
There's a markup on that.

451
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,840
But like, you can't tell me that the cloth map and like the plastic helmet costs $200

452
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
to make.

453
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,560
No, it didn't.

454
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,440
So you can definitely afford to, you know, and campus, what fucking shortage of canvas

455
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
are we talking about?

456
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Or honestly, like why did you advertise it if you weren't going to be able to make it?

457
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,480
Like why did you plan that poorly?

458
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,040
That's what it kind of comes down to for me.

459
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,040
You shouldn't have sold it that way and taken pre-orders and all this, if that's not what

460
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
you...

461
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,600
When you're planning it out, you know how many collector's editions you're making.

462
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,760
You know how much it fucking costs to make them.

463
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
I got it.

464
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
I got it.

465
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
I got it.

466
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,320
Before we got into this topic, you just said this.

467
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,000
When you went into GameStop, they told you to pre-order Super Smash Brothers, because

468
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
why?

469
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,320
They would know how many to make, or you might not get one if you don't pre-order because

470
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
they only make so many.

471
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Yes.

472
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,640
So they're fucking taking pre-order money from people and they know how many of these

473
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,280
they're selling and they still can't deliver.

474
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,280
It just, it blows my mind.

475
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,800
Is Bethesda going to get a pass on this because it's the holidays?

476
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
I sure hope not.

477
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,800
I know, I'm hearing rumbles of law offices are looking into possible, you know, but yeah,

478
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,040
that kind of stuff happens over, honestly, things that probably shouldn't be either.

479
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
I know.

480
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
I'll believe it when I see a court filing.

481
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,680
I just deposited my $10 check from Sony or like from the Sony class action lawsuit today,

482
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
so we're all good.

483
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Congrats.

484
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:38,000
But it's just like, Bethesda needs to answer things and sorry if I'm going to spoil a story

485
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,780
that I think you have coming up later in the show, but earlier next year, they're going

486
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,500
to be going on a press junket for their newest elder scrolls game, right?

487
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,060
Because blades is going to come out next year now, right?

488
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,300
So they're going to be going on a press junket for that.

489
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:56,420
And I really hope like they get asked some questions about this and you know, if they're

490
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,420
doing any, I mean, I know blades is kind of like a free to play thing and all this, but

491
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
who knows?

492
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,740
They'll probably try to have a way to make money off of it anyway, which is fine.

493
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,300
That's what free to play games do.

494
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,380
And if they're going to do collector's decisions and stuff, like I really hope Bethesda gets

495
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,260
asked these questions.

496
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,140
Like how are you not going to fuck up?

497
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,300
Like you did fallout four or false, excuse me, fallout 76, which is copy pasted fallout

498
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,300
for it online.

499
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
No, I'm, I'm, I'm being mean.

500
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,020
I'm being mean, but no, you're not.

501
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,020
It's pretty accurate.

502
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,020
Okay, fine.

503
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,620
But, uh, I said fallout four is good.

504
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,620
I just will.

505
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,020
Fallout four has the story that was able to save the weirdo bugs, right?

506
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
That's the difference.

507
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,020
Yes.

508
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,020
Okay.

509
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:41,020
I just, uh, just, I, I just, why, why would anybody pre-order a Bethesda game again?

510
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,300
Why even as much as I can sit here and say, I can't wait for elder scroll six and I can't

511
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,700
like Bethesda is going to have to prove to me why, well, I mean, to be honest, I don't,

512
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,140
I rarely pre-order games anymore anyway.

513
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,380
Like I might, I might pre-order things on Amazon.

514
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,500
Like I have my smash old, I'm like the one person that's still using Amazon and doesn't

515
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,620
have a problem with all the shitty things they've been doing, but that's a whole nother

516
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Oprah.

517
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,820
Um, so I pre-ordered smash brothers ultimate on Amazon because they promised to get it

518
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,440
here at my house the day of, I don't have to take an extra to the store or whatever

519
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
that whole thing.

520
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,500
So I'll, I'll do that.

521
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,220
But like the nice thing about Amazon pre-order is like, I don't have to put five down up

522
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,700
front and cancel whenever I want.

523
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Right.

524
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Yeah.

525
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,540
So like, honestly, like I can think of very, very few games.

526
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,460
I have actually like paid money to pre-order in a long time.

527
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,260
I would think honestly, one of the last ones I did was final fantasy 14 heaven's word because

528
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,860
it came with a dragon statue and I wanted it, but you know what, Loki, you know what

529
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
I got?

530
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,940
I got a dragon statue and it was, it was not made out of paper mache or some dumb shit.

531
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,100
It was an actual legit, pretty impressive little statue in a big box.

532
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,340
So I've never been disappointed with the collector's editions I've gotten so far.

533
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,340
Yeah.

534
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,460
There's nothing that's been like, Oh, I was hoping this would be better.

535
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,220
No, it's been fine.

536
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,420
All right.

537
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,700
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com where you guys are really lighten up chat.

538
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
I love it.

539
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
Uh, interesting.

540
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
Why?

541
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,260
Why are the very interesting perspective on this?

542
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,900
And I hadn't given this thought, obviously the China tariffs are to blame canvas bag

543
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,620
prices have skyrocketed.

544
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,780
Bethesda didn't know this would happen at the time the canvas bags were planned disaster.

545
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Huh?

546
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,780
Huh?

547
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,860
Well then why are you telling me this?

548
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Why?

549
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Why?

550
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Isn't Bethesda trying to milk that excuse?

551
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,060
They could have changed that.

552
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,960
When did the tariffs go into place?

553
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,100
They could have a few months ago.

554
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,380
So I could have said, you know, Hey, we're going to have to change.

555
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,380
Let's say, well, let's put it this way.

556
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,740
Loki between E3 and now those Chinese tariffs went into place.

557
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
Okay.

558
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,540
So they could have said, Hey, you know, due to this, we're going to be unavailable to

559
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,700
offer this in our collector's edition where you have the opportunity to, to cancel that

560
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,780
if you'd like, or, or, Hey, we're just going to drop the bag out of the collector's edition.

561
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,160
You just going to get the helmet instead, maybe we'll reduce the price like 10 bucks

562
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
or something.

563
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Totally.

564
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
You're right.

565
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
You're right.

566
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
That's that would have been the right way to do it.

567
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,900
I agree with you there that they would have seen that coming a long way.

568
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Why?

569
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Why are just want to clarify?

570
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
It was a joke.

571
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,220
I don't like honestly though, like there, there could be some legitimacy to that angle

572
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,820
is that like, if you want to talk about how did they not know what it would cost beforehand

573
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,820
and why does it cost more now?

574
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Like honestly, why?

575
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
Why our joke or not?

576
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,540
Like, like, like that could be the reason, but Loki's right.

577
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,540
They should have disclosed it at that time.

578
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:33,500
But then again, price or not, they did manufacture canvas bags for other things.

579
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
That's true too.

580
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
That's true too.

581
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Okay.

582
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Uh, let's see.

583
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,820
Dungeon buster says, dude, if something, if someone promised you something you ordered

584
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,260
and you got something else, that's not right.

585
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
Full stop.

586
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,060
And that's, that's, it is kind of, especially if they're not telling people upfront that

587
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,900
they're changing something and they're just like, well, we'll get away with it guys.

588
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,900
You don't chat says, I don't preorder many games, but I think people know if the game

589
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,360
does have issues, Bethesda will fix them.

590
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,620
It's not like it's some indie dev from out of the blue.

591
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,620
I don't know.

592
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,540
We'll fix them because some of these bugs that are in fallout 76 are bugs that have

593
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,860
been there since like fallout four.

594
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,340
It's been there even prior to fallout four.

595
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,260
So it's stuff that they're not fixing them.

596
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,540
And a lot of times the stuff, the way this gets fixed is because the community creates

597
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,620
a patch and fixes the stuff.

598
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,040
This is also why the indie dev devs, a lot of them tend to use like the early access

599
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,700
outlet because it allows them to say, I ain't done with this yet.

600
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,120
We're still working some things out.

601
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,760
You know that by this coming out on early access and then, you know, they can work out

602
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,700
some bugs and do the full release and you know, all that, that stuff like stardew valley,

603
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,700
I think went that route.

604
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Right.

605
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
When stardew valley early access for quite a while.

606
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,700
Um, I think so.

607
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Yeah.

608
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
So, you know, that happens sometimes.

609
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,260
Um, let's see, uh, tiger claw on chat says if it were me, I wouldn't be upset at the

610
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,780
quality of the bag since the main item, which is the game is all I care about.

611
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,500
And that helmet thingy, it's something you put on display.

612
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:57,420
I get it, but it's still like, I don't know, like I still thought the bag was pretty cool

613
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,080
and I don't have a lot of canvas bags that I can think of.

614
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,100
I do have little nylon bags I've gotten at various trade events.

615
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
I don't get a lot of canvas bags.

616
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,140
I've gotten a duffel bag that I had with grand theft auto four that I used to carry my game

617
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,140
system around in.

618
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,260
Final fantasy 14 fan fest gave me a pretty sweet backpack, I gotta say.

619
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,860
But uh, yeah, again, that's all, you know, nice stuff.

620
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,860
I don't know.

621
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,860
I mean, sure.

622
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,620
The helmet might've been like the centerpiece of that whole thing.

623
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,540
Just like the, the pit boy that you wear on your wrist if you're not going to make it.

624
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
I mean, I don't know.

625
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:31,320
I just think the thing is the fact that they gave it to influencers still, that's like

626
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,320
to me, like the rest of it, I might've been able to find an angle to forgive them.

627
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,280
But the fact that they knowingly still gave the influencers the wrong type of one.

628
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,140
And we all know influencers, part of what they do is like basically advertising for,

629
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,400
you know, these companies and so forth like that.

630
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,040
That's the part where I'm like, I got nothing.

631
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,280
I got nothing to depend, defend Bethesda with at this point.

632
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Like after they went and did that, I can't, I can't, I don't even think it helped.

633
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,960
I mean, honestly, I mean, you got the word out that the game sucked.

634
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,080
I mean, I don't know.

635
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
All right.

636
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Anyhow.

637
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,880
So, um, Loki, did you even pick up fall at 76?

638
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Like no.

639
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,920
Yeah, I never did.

640
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,040
And I honestly, my coworkers are trying to get me to pick it up and I'm like, no.

641
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Yeah.

642
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,400
Would you maybe when it goes on sale, cause inevitably it's gotten down the 1999 recently.

643
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Has it really?

644
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Yes.

645
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
I know black Friday.

646
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
It was down 30% already.

647
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,600
It was down pretty low, um, recently, but like, I just don't know.

648
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,200
It would have to be really cheap.

649
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,320
I just don't get into the fallout games and it has nothing to do with it.

650
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,800
Honestly, it has nothing to do with any of this.

651
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,400
I just, I just think it's shitty and it makes me worry for the future.

652
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,880
Like if Bethesda gets away with this, they'll have free license to do it again.

653
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,040
And they're planning on using the same engine for elder scrolls six and the star field,

654
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
right?

655
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Or what?

656
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Is that the name of it?

657
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,920
And I'm, I, I would be interested in Bethesda game in space.

658
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
I love space.

659
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,400
EA and Bioware used to make a game about space that I really, really enjoyed and Bethesda

660
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,840
does pretty good stories too.

661
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,200
So like I'm down, but if this is what I have to look forward to, then like, fuck it.

662
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,120
One of the end game bosses in fallout 76 uses the same animations as the dragons in Skyrim.

663
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,880
Exact same animation.

664
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Oh boy.

665
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
All right.

666
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,420
Uh, anyhow, let's, let's move on.

667
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,280
Let's get into some of the games we have been playing this week cause I'm sure there's been

668
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
a few things here and there.

669
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,720
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

670
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,200
It was all Pokemon.

671
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:31,480
So I played, um, Pokemon go a bit and then I also played Pokemon let's go and I finished

672
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:39,040
all of the gyms and now I'm just trying to level up some ice electric and, um, water

673
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,620
Pokemon cause I think that's what they recommended that you have for the final four.

674
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,580
And then, um, yeah, that's, that's pretty much what I've been doing cause it's like

675
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,480
Pikachu right now is like level 65 and so it just like destroys everything.

676
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,160
Like I go through all of the gyms with just Pikachu and take them all out.

677
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Oh wow.

678
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,720
Um, so I don't know.

679
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,420
I could probably just take the final four with Pikachu too, but you know, I just haven't

680
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
tried yet.

681
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,760
Uh, at least for the one that's susceptible to electric for sure.

682
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,640
I don't know about all of them though.

683
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,360
Cause um, I think, I think they, they correct me if I'm wrong chat, but I think the final

684
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,960
four elite four or whatever use Pokemon they're in level fifties ranges.

685
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,520
You'd probably get through it with Pikachu honestly, but um, you might want to bump it

686
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,240
a few more levels or just get like one other.

687
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I've got some rare candies.

688
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I'll just shove them all in the Pikachu.

689
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,700
That might honestly work.

690
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,240
So Pikachu the level like 80 and yeah, just destroy everything.

691
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,320
Act Efton chat says my EV is level 99.

692
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,120
I haven't gotten to the elite four.

693
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:40,240
So yeah, if you get it that far then yeah, like see, um, I had an EV and then I, I evolved

694
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,940
it into a Jolteon because unfortunately this EVs of the EV that you get in my game is not

695
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
the same.

696
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,340
I get the same abilities as the other EV version.

697
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:57,420
So I can't really make an op EV that way, but, um, I don't know.

698
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,820
So I'll just mess with that right now.

699
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,820
I don't even remember what the hell I have in my Pokeball right now.

700
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,260
Like I was trying to remember what it was earlier.

701
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:09,180
It's either, um, I think it's a Vipirion or it's, um, Archileno or whatever.

702
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
I don't remember.

703
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:16,540
Um, but yeah, so I just have to do that stuff and I don't know.

704
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,020
Play the end game thing cause I know there's some end game stuff and you know, new areas

705
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
you can go to.

706
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:27,740
And then I think at some point you fight red too at some point and then Mewtwo as well.

707
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
All right.

708
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,740
Um, anything else besides let's go and DDR fourth plus.

709
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,740
Oh yeah.

710
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
I saw some of your streaming.

711
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,740
Yeah.

712
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,740
The conga feeling for me.

713
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,740
Yes I did.

714
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:43,020
And uh, I am not very, I don't like a lot of like the fourth mixed steps that they put

715
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
in there.

716
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Like they did brand new steps.

717
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,540
It's been a while since I played fourth plus cause I think when I was playing fourth mix,

718
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,260
like primarily it was singles.

719
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,100
I wasn't really playing doubles back then.

720
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,260
I think I did a little bit doubles, but I didn't really play a lot of that stuff.

721
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,380
Um, it was mostly on fifth mixes so that I was just doing doubles.

722
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,580
It was harder in the arcades too cause you'd be under more pressure to like share your

723
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,860
game with somebody else.

724
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,820
Like if they wanted to spend it all and let you pick the songs like, you know, so it was,

725
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,440
it was a little bit, you know, different.

726
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,440
But like, I don't like some of the steps that they have, like some of them, like I tried

727
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,080
playing Xanadu, like I played both sets of steps and they just, I fucking hate them.

728
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,400
Like I don't like what they did.

729
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,800
They changed the steps to Xanadu.

730
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Right.

731
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,160
But you can play the original ones too.

732
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Okay.

733
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Okay.

734
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,960
So they have like a, they're like edit sets, but it's just all jacked up.

735
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,520
So I'm not really digging fourth plus too much.

736
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,040
I may end up putting something else on there, but I can always put it on again whenever

737
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
you decide to come over.

738
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,680
Cause I mean I can sweep swap them like pretty fast.

739
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
All right.

740
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Yeah.

741
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,600
I may end up moving to, I think I might move to Euro mix too because that's a mix I have

742
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
not played yet.

743
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Oh, there you go.

744
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Something new.

745
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,140
And so it's basically max two with like some different songs on there and it's got Cotton

746
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
Eye Joe.

747
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,140
Yeah.

748
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Heck yeah.

749
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,220
So, you know, maybe quintessential nineties dance hit, you know, there's, there's people

750
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,080
alive and maybe listening to our show, I have no idea what some of these songs are who never

751
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,740
had the pleasure of going to a high school dance and hearing, where did you come from?

752
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
Where did you go?

753
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Where did you come from?

754
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
Cotton Eye Joe.

755
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,980
Or I can put like the old Euro mix.

756
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:23,420
I think I have Euro mix one on there too, which is, it's got a Caribbean queen and video

757
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,740
killed the radio star.

758
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,700
I don't know some of those, but that's like third mix stuff.

759
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
So I don't know.

760
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,700
Or Disney rave, you know, we'll see.

761
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,860
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com YYR says you'll spend an hour with it and then

762
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
you'll be done.

763
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
Yes, pretty much.

764
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
Yeah.

765
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,980
But that's okay.

766
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
Yeah.

767
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
Have fun with it.

768
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,140
But I've been working on set mania stuff too.

769
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:49,180
So I actually started working on a theme that I was going to accustomed being for the cabinet.

770
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
Oh, fun.

771
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,060
But I'm, I'm, I'm stuck on what I'm going to call it.

772
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,740
So that's, that's the problems.

773
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,220
It's like a fake DDR version.

774
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,820
So Loki's DDR hell, no, that's dumb, but yeah, the kids have to be around it.

775
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,220
So I've got it like started and I kind of like, I just can't think of a good name for

776
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
it.

777
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,580
So anyway, you can think of a cool name.

778
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
I'm down with that.

779
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
But like, there you go.

780
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,380
I'm working on the figuring out how to do theming and stuff.

781
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,700
Yell it out in our chat or visit a Loki on Twitter at lokiolr.

782
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
So, all right.

783
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Awesome.

784
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Um, my gaming week.

785
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Um, I didn't really buy any new games this week.

786
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,380
Well, except for runner three, which I played after last week's OLR.

787
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,540
I did a live stream and I did some runner three after the show last week and, and that

788
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,540
was fun.

789
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,540
I don't know why they took the name bit trip out of it.

790
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,380
I'm not sure what that was about, but, um, maybe because it's not as bit, it does look

791
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,540
a lot different now, but, uh, it kind of did in version two as well.

792
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,940
But it doesn't really matter.

793
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,540
Semantics aside, uh, the game is, is cute and fun.

794
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,820
And if you enjoyed Bit.Trip Runner 2, a lot of that same type of stuff is there in three.

795
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Love the music in the game.

796
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,460
And it's fun to kind of be bouncing along and jumping to the music.

797
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,980
Obviously it's like head bang on the wall hard.

798
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,900
Like I got to the, the boss of the first area and I just had to like end my stream before

799
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,740
I beat it because it was just getting too late.

800
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,180
And I was like, guys, I really wanted to like end with beating this boss, but I'm not fucking

801
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,300
making progress on it.

802
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,180
So sadly, we're just going to call it here.

803
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,420
So that's a little bit embarrassing, but, um, there's just some stuff where it's like,

804
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,300
dang, you have to really like work on it and do it over and over and over again.

805
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,500
But you know, sometimes with those very difficult games, as a lot of 8-bit Nintendo games used

806
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,140
to be, you start to feel that progression and it feels very rewarding and very good,

807
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,540
uh, when you kind of keep at it.

808
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,420
So that was, um, Runner 3.

809
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,860
And other than that, I've been playing, um, a lot of the similar things that I've been

810
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:34,140
playing, uh, include pickup, um, uh, what was it called?

811
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,020
It was, um, old school musical.

812
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,260
I didn't know.

813
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,780
I've watched you guys play it and I never picked that up myself.

814
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
That's probably on the list.

815
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,460
I should have got that during the last steam sale.

816
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,460
Dang it.

817
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,460
But maybe I'll get it.

818
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,060
Cause there'll be another one like at New Year's, right?

819
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
Yeah.

820
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,540
So maybe I'll pick it up then if it even goes on sale, not everything does.

821
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,660
So I might pick it up then.

822
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,300
Or maybe I'll just, you know, who knows?

823
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
We'll buy it, buy it before then.

824
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,300
Oh, do they?

825
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
Oh, maybe I'll buy it there.

826
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
Yeah.

827
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
That'd be a lot of fun.

828
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
Yeah.

829
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,420
I got it on both because I bought it on the switch and my kids are like, give me that.

830
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,380
I want to play whatever the hell game I'm playing.

831
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,380
I want, I want, I want.

832
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,380
I want Mario Kart.

833
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm like, crap, how am I going to play this game now?

834
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Okay.

835
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,300
I guess I'll buy it on steam too.

836
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,300
All right.

837
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Yeah.

838
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,340
Bobby Blackwell says, just pay full price for it so the developer gets the full price.

839
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,340
Fine.

840
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,180
I, and honestly the Nintendo games go on sale a lot less frequently anyway.

841
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,900
And I like the idea of having it portable and that, that sounds, it seems like a good

842
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,900
switch game.

843
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,900
So I think we found a good happy medium.

844
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,900
All right, Bobby.

845
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,900
All right.

846
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,380
Uh, uh, let's see.

847
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,780
And um, other games I have been playing this week, uh, continuing on in Final Fantasy 14,

848
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:39,060
trying to like cap out my tomes, work on my gear in that game, world of Warcraft.

849
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,220
Although I kind of have hit a wall where if I don't team up with Delvin or other people

850
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,700
to do like mythics and other stuff, like there's not really a lot of ways to advance my gear

851
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,560
besides trying to get Azerite.

852
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,840
So one thing that I've been working on is PVP.

853
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,860
I'm actually having fun PVPing.

854
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,500
And for some reason, I don't know if they're considered underpowered or something, but

855
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
I play a warlock.

856
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:03,680
I play an affliction warlock and in PVP, like I hardly ever see other warlocks.

857
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,140
Like people will get excited when I'm there cause they'll be like, yay, lock candy, which

858
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,580
is, you know, I think it's a spell they have to let everybody get a little hellstone.

859
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,780
Um, and so I don't know, but, but I feel like I do all right when it comes to damage because

860
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,560
you could just dot everybody up and you get, and you do have this one spell that's seed

861
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,740
of corruption.

862
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,660
And so you fire it on somebody that's like in the middle of the pack.

863
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,300
And then when it explodes, they spread this thing called corruption to every other player

864
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,380
around them.

865
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,140
And that's probably how I'm able to climb up the DPS charts, uh, in some of those big

866
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,140
battlegrounds so easy.

867
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,180
But anyway, I won't bore you with all the wow talk cause I know not everybody plays,

868
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,000
but that's something I've been getting into a little more is playing the PVP, uh, in world

869
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
of Warcraft.

870
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,060
And I've gotten enough marks of honor where I bought the very first season set, the blueberry

871
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,220
face on the warlock.

872
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,980
I just bought that one last night and I bought one of the sets during, um, cataclysm cause

873
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,400
I thought it looked cool.

874
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,180
So I'm PVPing enough to buy some of the, uh, uh, Barbie dress up transmog sets.

875
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,320
And so that's a lot of fun.

876
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
Dang it.

877
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,120
So that's kind of giving me something to do in the game right now.

878
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,920
Um, otherwise on consoles been continuing to play Tetris effects cause I played the

879
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,280
weekend event event.

880
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,000
I beat the journey mode thing.

881
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That's right.

882
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm mixing them up.

883
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah.

884
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Journey is the mode with all the stages, right?

885
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah.

886
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,840
Um, and I will say Bobby did get something right on his last show.

887
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,560
That stage with the hot air balloons is like one of the best songs in the game.

888
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,240
You know what my actual, actually my absolute favorite was, was the board right after that

889
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,720
was the mermaids.

890
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,040
I haven't played enough of the game yet.

891
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Oh yeah.

892
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,080
Oh, um, you know, I don't think I'm really spoiling anything, but, um, there's a, in

893
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,000
the very last set, well, the very, and you can see this on the map again, it's not a

894
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
spoiler.

895
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,600
The very last stage is one giant stage called metamorphosis.

896
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,560
So before that you have like a track of five skins that you do.

897
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,280
And I think the second one is the hot air balloons that has a really cool little song

898
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,960
behind it that's very similar to the trailer song.

899
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,920
And then the one after that is the mermaid cove and it's like purple, this really beautiful

900
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
color.

901
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,080
And the song is really good too.

902
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,000
Like I just, I really enjoyed that one.

903
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,440
And in VR again, Oh, it's so good in VR.

904
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
I love playing that game in VR.

905
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,640
It's just such a like in the zone type of game.

906
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
I love it.

907
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,960
Um, so yeah, that's pretty, actually it's, have you played rez in VR?

908
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Yeah, I did.

909
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
We talked about last week.

910
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Oh, that's right.

911
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Yeah.

912
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,280
So well actually I'm not, I'm not unhappy you brought that up because even though I

913
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,800
didn't play it again this week, remember last week we got into this thing where I said,

914
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,600
I noticed that rez area X is like its own thing developed in unity and it's in the synesthesia

915
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
engine.

916
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Yeah.

917
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
And unreal.

918
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Yeah.

919
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Guess what?

920
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Since I beat Tetris effect, I actually watched the credits.

921
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Guess what?

922
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,620
Y'all synesthesia engine Tetris effect and rez area X are built on the same engine.

923
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,180
And I tweeted about that on my Twitter.

924
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:44,560
Go look at who liked my tweet because I wrote something like, wow, Tetris effect and rez

925
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,520
area X are indeed on the same engine.

926
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
What's next?

927
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Question, question, question.

928
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,920
Um, enhance like the tweet.

929
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,340
Some other employee over there liked the tweet and Mizuguchi liked the tweet.

930
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,760
And I was like, okay, wow.

931
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,040
That's like a little, a little kiss and a, that's a little pat on the ass from the developers.

932
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,320
Like good for you snowflake figuring that one out.

933
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,360
So I was, but I was thrilled and I honestly, yeah, I meant it.

934
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Bring it on.

935
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
What is it?

936
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
New rez game.

937
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:20,660
Just rez triple X, do it in the synesthesia engine, do a child of Eden remake in the engine,

938
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,360
do a new, let Mizuguchi do whatever the fuck he wants TBH cause I will be there and, and

939
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,760
uh, I'm sure the synesthesia engine will be great for it.

940
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,360
So, uh, or whatever they want to do in the future.

941
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,160
Like on, and I said this when I first reviewed Tetris effect, like we all have our fanboy

942
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:41,000
things in video games and video games that that man makes Mizuguchi like are always,

943
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,240
I'm going to like, he made 99 nights and I still defended that more than most people

944
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
did.

945
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Okay.

946
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,080
Cause it, look, it was flawed, but it was still decent for what it was.

947
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Okay.

948
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,680
So anyway, uh, I played a little bit of that and um, yeah, I guess that's really, that's

949
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,240
all that's like jumping out other than like canoeing, switch games, Pokemon, let's go

950
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,080
a little bit mobile games still plucking along on ingress, although ingress isn't as exciting

951
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,400
now that double AP is over.

952
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,860
I wish it was always double AP, but I guess, I guess one thing, you know, quickly I will

953
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,640
say about the mobile games, um, that I play ingress does seem to be wanting to implement

954
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,580
more limited time events, kind of like what Pokemon does.

955
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:24,060
Cause obviously we had this three day long community thing, although really that bonus

956
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,500
window was when all the shinies were boosted and all that good stuff, which I caught like

957
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,220
seriously like 12 shinies in that three hour period.

958
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:36,540
But it was unfortunately, yeah, I didn't need anything, but it was nice to get another Bulbasaur

959
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,100
because I had only gotten one because it was the Bulbasaur weekend was the same day as

960
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,100
Bobby's wedding.

961
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,340
So obviously that was more important.

962
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,060
So I'm really glad I got a second chance.

963
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,320
I'm just trying to get all my dratini's now so I can actually get, I have a shiny dratini

964
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,060
that left it or shiny dragon air that was leftover from.

965
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,740
But anyway, we talk enough about what we want to go ingress on the other hand, um, it seems

966
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,100
to be wanting to look at doing more of those limited time events, especially because you

967
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,360
know, they're trying to push the prime scanner as their new version of the game and all this.

968
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,220
So they're doing some event coming up where like for five days, beginning on December

969
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:11,620
26, don't quote me on this because everything they have to do based on UTC as well, um,

970
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:18,340
you're going to get double AP for smashing resonators and placing resonators, but not

971
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,320
like hacking and it's, it's interesting to kind of, kind of doing like a weird thing

972
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,340
with the AP and that's their version of experience.

973
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,460
So it's, it'll be interesting.

974
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,700
So, but yeah, uh, otherwise that's, that's been, that's been plenty of gaming for me.

975
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,860
So, uh, all right, let's get to some housekeeping.

976
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,420
Um, over at, uh, uh, sorry, I'm checking in with the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

977
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,000
VidPower confirms that Old School Musical only had a 10% discount in the Steam Autumn

978
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
sale anyway.

979
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,180
Hey, 10% is 10%.

980
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,060
I mean, and that game is still newer.

981
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,420
Like in, uh, what Bobby says is, you know, the devs are entitled to, to a big chunk of

982
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
the money and that's fair.

983
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,880
Uh, and Bobby Blackwell says, senpai notice Rob.

984
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,480
That's seriously how I felt, just so we know.

985
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,160
And Act Def says Mizuguchi likes a lot of tweets, especially when they mentioned something

986
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
good about their games.

987
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,440
Oh, I'm sure Mizuguchi like has that tweet deck and has a thing for Tetris Effect.

988
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,240
So he sees all the tweets on it.

989
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,400
Not that I think he sits there all day, but you know, he probably scrolls through it once

990
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
in a while.

991
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
He probably likes a bunch of tweets.

992
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,880
You know, I bet when you're a game developer, seeing good things about your game feels really

993
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
good.

994
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,040
You know, I would, I would bet that that is a thing.

995
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,680
And so, uh, you know, he, I, I, and I love it that he, he stopped to check it out.

996
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Yeah, exactly.

997
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,560
Like going back to Fallout 76, I mean, I'm sure that it feels bad for like the developers

998
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,200
that, you know, I'm sure there are a game many, probably so frustrated, like we wanted

999
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,600
to fix this shit, but I know that's a very fair perspective and something we can't say

1000
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
enough.

1001
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,880
I'm sure there are plenty of Bethesda employees who worked very hard on that game, who are

1002
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,800
just straight up embarrassed right now.

1003
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,000
So like, don't pick on people that work at Bethesda and less their boardroom management,

1004
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,160
financial CEO type of people.

1005
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,980
Those are the people you take issue with.

1006
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:05,740
Do not take issue with the QA people, the, the programmers, the, the people that designed

1007
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,900
the textures and all that stuff.

1008
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,580
They were just, they were making the game under the constraints that they were given

1009
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,580
from up above.

1010
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,940
So do not, do not, let me see you doing that on Twitter, but I'm, I'm, I know the listeners

1011
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,740
of this show are smart enough to know that.

1012
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,800
Um, let's see, uh, going to chat for a couple more comments, uh, dark tits to be in chat

1013
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,340
says rez triple X.

1014
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:28,760
Well, it does support trans vibrators, but that's true that rez is the game that brought

1015
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,720
us that wonderful, wonderful, um, accessory.

1016
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,640
All right, so quick housekeeping before we get to gaming news tonight, let me bring up

1017
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,360
one thing because it was brought up on Bobby show, so I think it's important to just bring

1018
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
up here too.

1019
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,160
So y'all know that we're going to be making a transition to Twitch for the live presentation.

1020
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,760
So right now, if you want to listen to the show live, you're either using the plugin

1021
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,880
over at live.vognetwork.com or you're using something like TuneIn or basically you're

1022
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,280
using something that is shoutcast embedded.

1023
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,420
You're using something to connect to an MP3 streaming platform called shoutcast, which

1024
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,580
goes all the way back to old school Winamp, which is why we joke about this computer that

1025
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,580
still uses windows.

1026
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,660
Um, I almost said 95 and it might as well use windows 95, but windows XP, uh, because

1027
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,760
that's, you know, when, when, when this Winamp and shoutcast thing was all made.

1028
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,640
So anyway, part of the reason we're making the switch to Twitch is that for our live

1029
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,640
presentation, uh, it's now going to be delivered on Twitch.

1030
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,820
And so you don't have to think like, what's the link to get to OLR stream or what app

1031
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,820
do I have to download?

1032
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,780
Cause you know, I think most of y'all have Twitch in your pockets, on your phones, all

1033
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,340
that stuff and on your gaming consoles and on your computer.

1034
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,380
So this would be very easy for you to just go to twitch.tv slash vognetwork and check

1035
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,380
it out.

1036
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,140
So since we are moving to Twitch, obviously video is a big thing on Twitch.

1037
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,340
So we will be streaming video additionally with that.

1038
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:40,420
Um, as far as the podcast goes, and again, I want to emphasize it's Orange Launch Radio

1039
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,420
and always has been, and that's going to be the way it is for the way foreseeable future.

1040
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,300
Um, so the podcast will be the exact same thing, pretty much you're hearing now, but

1041
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,620
maybe, maybe it was actually, I'm looking at, uh, we got a brand new mixing board, so

1042
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,740
maybe a little bit of audio polish and maybe a little bit of polish here and there, but

1043
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,780
for all practical purposes, it'll be the same show that you're used to and still free.

1044
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,780
And I want to stress that.

1045
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,620
Um, but, and there's a, but here, um, uh, something somewhat new.

1046
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,500
I say it's new, even though we used to do stuff on Justin TV a long time ago.

1047
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,660
So, and you can go to our old Twitch channel and see some highlights from what that looked

1048
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,660
like.

1049
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,780
And it's, it'll look better now cause it'll be HD and we're not in the same studio, but

1050
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,300
it'll, you know, you get the idea.

1051
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,220
But something, uh, that people are, uh, you know, looking forward to, I suppose is video,

1052
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,820
even though we don't plan to play up to the video, it's, I don't know how exciting it'll

1053
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,820
be, but all right.

1054
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:32,880
Um, but some people were wondering like, will I be able to just go listen to OLR on Twitch

1055
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,300
video archives?

1056
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,020
Um, and we are still a podcast and we want to push people to the podcast feed.

1057
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,980
So that is kind of still the preferred place to listen to this show in the archive.

1058
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:47,260
However, I understand that a people want to do, uh, go along with the show live, which

1059
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,540
I think is great.

1060
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:54,520
And also with that people, um, uh, might want to go check out what it looks like live and,

1061
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,520
and all of that.

1062
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Uh, and that's fine.

1063
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,480
Um, but we did make a decision at VOG network that we will be putting the video on demand

1064
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,340
only on demand, not the live, the video on demand will be, uh, available to subscribers

1065
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,140
of the Twitch VOG network only.

1066
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:14,500
Um, so, uh, again, we see that as something new that is being put behind a paywall and

1067
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,460
not anything old that we're like taking away to put behind a payroll.

1068
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,500
I want to really stress that because I know how y'all can handle some of these news when

1069
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,380
game companies do it sometimes and all that.

1070
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,860
So again, it's, it's something new.

1071
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,540
And if you want to be here live, you'll get to see all of it for whatever.

1072
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,020
Um, but if you do want to do the video on demand, um, because again, podcasting is kind

1073
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,940
of the game we're in and we want to really push people there.

1074
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,260
But if you really, really want to see the video, um, you can use your, um, Amazon prime.

1075
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:44,140
If you have that, your prime subscription over on the VOG network, um, or, or so on.

1076
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,560
Um, but not right away because again, we're going to have to get to that point first.

1077
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,500
We have to kind of hit the affiliate status on Twitch and all that good stuff.

1078
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,220
So for a little while, it'll still be open and free.

1079
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,140
So you kind of get an idea what that looks like, but please know that the plan is in

1080
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,940
early 2019, uh, we are going to kind of make that change.

1081
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,220
So if y'all have any questions about it or you want to, you want to yell, get mad, although

1082
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,420
I don't, I don't know why people would get mad, but you never know, uh, now's a good

1083
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,420
time to do that.

1084
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,180
Cause I just want to be upfront with that.

1085
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,460
And uh, yeah, I hope some of you guys will, you know, enjoy it though.

1086
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,540
I remember one more thing I was going to complain about on my gaming week and it says has to

1087
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,860
do with both Pokemon Let's Go and Pokemon Go.

1088
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,980
It's the Pokemon, the brand new Pokemon Meltan.

1089
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,980
Oh yeah.

1090
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:30,140
So Meltan, the way you get him in Pokemon Go, or you have to get him in Pokemon Go is

1091
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,940
you, when you transfer Pokemon from Pokemon Go into Pokemon Let's Go through the Go park,

1092
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:41,460
you get a mystery box that appears in Pokemon Go and you open the mystery box and acts like

1093
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,940
a lure for 30 minutes and you're supposed to spawn a bunch of Meltan.

1094
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,780
You catch them and that's how you're supposed to do it.

1095
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,900
And you're supposed to get 400 Meltan to evolve into whatever the fuck the thing's called.

1096
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,540
Um, Melmetal, Melmetal, yes.

1097
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,860
And Melmetal, well, Meltan's also, you mean you can earn candy by walking, but you have

1098
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:06,340
to walk 20 kilometers per candy for that, which is fucking stupid.

1099
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:14,220
So it was, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when I popped the mystery box and 30 minutes

1100
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:21,140
go by and there's four, four fucking spawns of Meltan.

1101
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,300
Four.

1102
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,180
Mind you, you can use that once a week.

1103
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,260
Yikes.

1104
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,100
So it would take, assuming that was always four and assuming that I was, do you get more

1105
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,100
if you walk?

1106
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,880
Cause that's the way regular lures work.

1107
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,940
More will pop if you walk while the lure is going.

1108
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,940
I was walking.

1109
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,940
Okay.

1110
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,180
So it's so four.

1111
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,980
Are you using pin apps?

1112
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,300
But yes, of course.

1113
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,300
God damn.

1114
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,300
Just making sure.

1115
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,300
Just making sure.

1116
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,300
Yeah.

1117
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,300
Every time.

1118
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:54,260
So it would take like probably at least a year to get Melmetal.

1119
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,380
Deft of saying you get 10 mil, 10 guaranteed.

1120
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:02,020
So well, it's not a guarantee cause I got four and I had that, that fucking app open

1121
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,020
the entire time.

1122
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,380
So there was not fucking guarantee.

1123
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,780
In fact, I complained about it on Twitch or not Twitch, Twitter, because for the first

1124
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,380
like eight minutes, nothing was spawning.

1125
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:15,820
Like it was all of the event Pokemon that were around, but nothing was spawning.

1126
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,260
And so I'm like, what the fuck?

1127
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,380
I wonder if the event screwed it up somehow.

1128
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,700
I don't know.

1129
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,100
Well, you know how we can fix that?

1130
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:27,420
It's called your program, the fucking game, so it doesn't fucking do that.

1131
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,420
All right.

1132
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,540
Let me get some of these comments and we'll get into the gaming news for the week.

1133
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:35,440
So in the, uh, comments over at live.vognetwork.com, a lot of positive.

1134
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,440
That's fair.

1135
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,440
I understand.

1136
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,440
I'm cool with that.

1137
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
Thanks you guys.

1138
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,440
I really appreciate that.

1139
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,020
Uh, bonds double six and chat says just redownload Winamp for the memories.

1140
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,060
Winamp did put out a new version and I'm all for the memories.

1141
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,220
Um, but it does remind me to say, um, that when we do move to Twitch, the audio will

1142
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,500
no longer be available.

1143
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,660
So if you are using TuneIn or you know, the, the plugin at VOG, well, the plugin at VOG

1144
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,780
network will simply change to a Twitch window, but you know, the way you're listening live

1145
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,940
now, again, only for our live listeners, uh, for podcasts, it would be the same, but for

1146
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,000
live listeners, um, it will change.

1147
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,980
You will not have a audio only feed anymore.

1148
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:15,340
Um, I believe Twitch offers a audio only component in the app where you just listen.

1149
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:21,480
Um, but yes, uh, it will be a little bit of a change, but also, um, again, the, the, the

1150
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,720
radio feed, the shoutcast feed is the most expensive piece of running VOG right now.

1151
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
So hope you guys will understand.

1152
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,720
Oh.

1153
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,320
And he says, you know, Bobby mentioned new chat room.

1154
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
Oh yes.

1155
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,320
New chat room too.

1156
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,380
We will be moving over to the Twitch chat room, which I mean, kind of makes sense, right?

1157
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,480
And that's just a decision because it ain't like, let's be realistic.

1158
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,480
You guys, if we said, Oh, don't use that chat, head on over to this chat.

1159
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,480
People aren't going to do it.

1160
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,800
So if we want to get new people in our family, we want people to be engaging and all that

1161
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,800
good stuff.

1162
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,520
Uh, we have to, you know, um, open up that chat over there, but you know what, this also

1163
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:00,560
opens the door to, you know, if maybe we want to do more extra things, we're going to be

1164
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,560
able to really do that.

1165
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,060
So, um, it's really exciting.

1166
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,440
And I, as far as I know, the plan is it will be a shared space with Bobby Black Wolf, uh,

1167
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,280
anime jam session, hopefully some of our other shows too.

1168
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,880
I'm really hoping we'll give it a try.

1169
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,680
We'll see again, we don't want to force them to do anything.

1170
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,640
We'll still be a network for promoting and, and lifting each other up.

1171
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,620
But um, you know, we'll have, we'll have a platform should they choose to use it.

1172
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,360
But as a podcast producer, they're free to do whatever they want to do.

1173
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,880
Um, you know, maybe draw some more stuff and grow our network.

1174
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,100
So I think in the year 2018, it's going to be an awesome thing, but I'll stop talking

1175
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,080
about it and let y'all experience it in a couple of weeks when we get to experience

1176
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,080
it too.

1177
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,840
Let's get into some gaming news for now instead.

1178
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,840
Loki.

1179
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Yes.

1180
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,300
So let's talk about Nintendo finally getting rid of their shitty Nintendo creators program.

1181
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,020
So for those who may or not remember, the creators program was basically their way of

1182
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,660
doing YouTube content, um, or monetizing YouTube content.

1183
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:59,300
So basically you weren't allowed to put YouTube content out there unless you're part of a

1184
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,800
Nintendo, um, the Nintendo creators program, in which case they got a significant portion

1185
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,500
of the ad revenue from that and then they wouldn't strike your video for that.

1186
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:16,480
So now as of March 20th, 2019, they will be ceasing operations on that front.

1187
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,560
So we're ending the Nintendo creators program to make it easier for content creators to

1188
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,500
make and monetize videos that contain Nintendo game content.

1189
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,860
We will no longer ask creators to submit their videos to the NCP and the creators can continue

1190
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:34,980
showing their passion for Nintendo by the following Nintendo or by following Nintendo

1191
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,260
guidelines.

1192
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,580
And, um, let's see what those guidelines are.

1193
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:45,420
I think it's just basically from what I gathered, it was, um, you know, you got to make sure

1194
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,700
that you're not just posting, you know, direct video of the games, you know, you're doing

1195
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:55,120
some commentary, um, you know, they want to make sure that, you know, that your input's

1196
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,120
in there.

1197
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,620
So for example, you know, they want to post gameplay videos, screenshots using Nintendo

1198
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,740
system features.

1199
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:06,700
You can use the capture button on Nintendo switch with additional input or commentary.

1200
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:11,860
Um, you're only permitted to use Nintendo game content that has been officially released

1201
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:17,460
from or from promotional materials official released by Nintendo as such as, um, product

1202
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,680
trailers or Nintendo direct.

1203
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,340
So none of you streaming smash brothers before it's out cause you pirated a copy of the internet.

1204
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,340
Not allowed.

1205
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,340
I mean, that's self-explanatory.

1206
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:33,780
Um, they of course reserve the right to remove any content that they feel is unlawful, impringing

1207
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,780
or inappropriate.

1208
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:41,860
Um, so no like peach fuck Daisy type of things on YouTube.

1209
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:50,100
Well, actually, to be fair under parody law, you could, I mean, you might be breaking some

1210
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:55,080
YouTube things, so you gotta be careful, but under parody law, I would say you still have

1211
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,880
quite a bit of leeway room, but you can't really like use direct feeds of Nintendo stuff

1212
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,160
and all, you know, you'd have to be a little more creative with how you do parody, I guess

1213
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,160
in that regard.

1214
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
Right.

1215
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,160
I don't know.

1216
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,160
I'm not a lawyer.

1217
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,160
Don't take my advice.

1218
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,360
Maybe just don't do that idea.

1219
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:16,200
So they basically, there's some things that there's like a QA on, on their little guidelines

1220
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,200
or whatever.

1221
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,640
So some of this is kind of a little interesting.

1222
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,840
So for example, you know, they, the, one of the questions number three, what do you mean

1223
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,520
by appropriate video and image sharing websites?

1224
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,880
And the answer is we generally accept most commonly used video and image sharing platforms

1225
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,120
such as, but not limited to YouTube, Twitch and Instagram.

1226
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,600
However, we reserve the right to remove any content that we believe is unlawful, infringing

1227
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,900
or inappropriate or not with these guidelines.

1228
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:47,080
And then number four, what exactly are the monetization methods separately specified

1229
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,800
by Nintendo as referred in the guidelines.

1230
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,080
So they're talking about monetization through Facebook, Nico Nico, open rec TV, Twitch,

1231
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,760
Twitter, and YouTube.

1232
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,140
Could it be that the reason that like mixer isn't on there is they don't have a way to

1233
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,360
monetize stuff yet.

1234
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,540
Their partners do.

1235
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,540
Your partners do.

1236
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,540
Yeah.

1237
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:12,280
Uh, of course they have an asterisk, they're subject to be updated.

1238
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,560
So I just think again, and I mentioned this on Bobby show and this topic came up on the

1239
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,480
call that we do at the end of the show.

1240
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,160
But um, I think with a mixer, I think it's just that mixer does a lot of Microsoft stuff.

1241
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,400
There's a lot of PC stuff, not exactly known for its heavy Nintendo presence.

1242
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,460
And although you may not have heard of some of these streaming sites that were brought

1243
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,200
up here, um, like Nico Nico, like that one's here in Japan.

1244
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,200
Yeah.

1245
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,280
I mean, I maybe some of you have, but some of these sites that Loki's naming, they're

1246
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,280
big in other countries.

1247
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,660
They're just not the method of choice here.

1248
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,640
But did you, did you say things like daily motion and yeah, so there are other cause

1249
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,900
like PlayStation four will let you stream to daily motion.

1250
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:53,100
So there are other sites that are being not called out here, but I would assume it's a

1251
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,060
similar kind of rule on these sites.

1252
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,060
So I would assume.

1253
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,900
So I think they're just listing sites cause they're talking about, yeah, I don't know.

1254
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,900
Um, so yeah, I mean, I guess, sorry, I'm laughing.

1255
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,220
Zach Defton chat says, this is the best news from Nintendo in the whole year.

1256
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,220
Yeah.

1257
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,220
Even more than it is.

1258
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,220
But it is good.

1259
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:14,100
I think the whole program that they have was absolute shit.

1260
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,220
So it is a step in the right direction, misinformed.

1261
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,940
I'm going to say it was, it was just, it just wasn't a good idea.

1262
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,940
Yeah.

1263
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,300
And I think finally I think it caught up with them.

1264
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,460
You know, um, I think there are certain big channels who made a decision to just stop

1265
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,220
covering Nintendo.

1266
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:30,780
And I think somebody finally had a discussion of where finally everybody made a meeting

1267
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,060
that was planned to one week where they brought in some numbers and said, you know what guys,

1268
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:40,940
this program is just not effective because we're not getting looked at by these people.

1269
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,900
And what are we really gaining from this?

1270
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,900
We're not.

1271
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,420
We're not getting social media feedback on our creators program.

1272
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,500
We're not getting new people that apply.

1273
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,100
People are just doing it on Twitch anyway.

1274
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:54,180
So, so I think finally they just sat down and said, why don't we just adopt a policy

1275
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,560
similar to Sony and Microsoft?

1276
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,460
Some people are worried about certain wording that's in there.

1277
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,620
Like for example, you're only permitted to use Nintendo game content that has been officially

1278
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,620
released.

1279
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,100
So like for example, they were saying officially, does that mean ROM hacks and fan games?

1280
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,880
Not officially, honestly, if you want to take it at face value, no.

1281
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,640
Or I mean, if you want to take it at face value, that stuff is not acceptable.

1282
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,320
However, is Nintendo going to blackball that stuff?

1283
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,960
Probably I would think Nintendo is going to turn a blind eye to it, especially when it

1284
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,820
comes to things like AGDQ.

1285
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,760
We all know that Nintendo would be the biggest dick bags in the world to smack down a charity

1286
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,580
event that they just happen to be playing ROM hacks.

1287
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,640
And I think Nintendo is well aware enough of that as well.

1288
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,720
That wording is specifically for what is happening right now with Smash and how that, and to

1289
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:48,400
be fair, I think when it comes to the hack, like the homegrown Smash that they did, that

1290
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,160
stuff, Nintendo probably don't want that stuff out there either.

1291
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,480
Well, I think also like they're talking about like maybe like if somehow someone were to

1292
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,040
leak footage from a game that hasn't been released or something like that, like if something

1293
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:02,200
were to leak out of Nintendo, then they'd be able to smack it down.

1294
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,800
It's maybe, but I don't know.

1295
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,000
Then, then you have to kind of question what ends up being fair use for the purposes of

1296
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,840
news and commentary and you just get into all that stuff.

1297
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,280
But unfortunately, if you still continue to use YouTube, you're going to notice there's

1298
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,320
a very good reason why VOG Network went to Twitch and not YouTube Live because I'll just

1299
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,680
say it because I'm not one to hold back tonight because YouTube Live, and I've said this over

1300
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:28,480
and over again on the show, YouTube has demonstrated that they do not side with their creators

1301
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,080
ever in these issues.

1302
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:35,720
So whereas Twitch seems to make decisions that, you know, they're not always what you

1303
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,360
want to hear, but I feel like for the most part, they've been a lot more sensible in

1304
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,720
the types of decisions they make and so forth over on Twitch.

1305
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,720
And that's a big part.

1306
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,740
Obviously, I solely did not make the decision, but those were the type of factors I weighed

1307
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:51,120
when I cast my vote, we'll put it that way.

1308
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:58,500
So anyway, my point is with that, if you know, if there's like a leak and that's like newsworthy,

1309
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,340
one could argue that's a bit of like news and fair use, but I think Nintendo is trying

1310
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:05,880
to prevent the straight up piracy leaks, that type of stuff.

1311
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,880
They don't want that.

1312
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,800
They're not streaming four hours of Smash Brothers or worse yet, a more, well, I guess

1313
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,160
Smash Brothers is story based, but I was going to say, let's say in a couple of years time,

1314
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:20,040
they do a new Zelda because Nintendo would be redonkulous to not give us a new Zelda

1315
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,920
after Breath of the Wild was fucking amazing, right?

1316
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,400
There's going to be a new Zelda someday.

1317
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,460
We all know.

1318
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:28,800
So what they'd want, what they don't want is somebody streaming the entirety of Zelda

1319
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,240
and the story spoilers and all that stuff three weeks before the game is out.

1320
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,560
That's that's what that is there for.

1321
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,560
And I get it.

1322
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,440
Like they want to keep that stuff under wraps.

1323
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,120
I think, I think you can, I think you can give Nintendo that for all the Nintendo is

1324
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,800
clueless when it comes to online shit that they've they're given over the years.

1325
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,240
This new policy is good enough.

1326
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,380
And again, I really think if you go look at Sony and Microsoft's policies, you're not

1327
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,880
going to find that big a difference.

1328
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,420
Sony and Microsoft don't want that stuff out there either.

1329
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,740
So I really don't think you're going to find big differences in that.

1330
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,880
So I'm glad they're on this route.

1331
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,880
Yeah.

1332
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,240
So anyhow, um, tiger class has four hours of smash brothers.

1333
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,000
What if you were broadcasting a tournament?

1334
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,680
Well, you're not going to be doing a tournament of a game that has not yet been released yet.

1335
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,040
Cause that's a whole nother reason unless here's the funny thing.

1336
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,920
If you're a Nintendo and it's your official tournament, well, you can do whatever you

1337
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,520
want because remember at E3, they did do a super smash brothers, ultimate tournament.

1338
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,480
Am I, am I not right?

1339
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,720
Didn't they do a tournament?

1340
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,720
I don't remember.

1341
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,720
I think they did.

1342
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:35,200
And when Nintendo's doing tree house and all that stuff at E3, they can stream all the

1343
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,040
Nintendo stuff they want.

1344
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:44,900
Um, but you know, a lot of that stuff again, like at an event like E3, you know, that media

1345
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:51,760
is put out there for other people to put out on their channels and, you know, put out in

1346
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,880
the open and so forth.

1347
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,800
They just don't want unreleased stuff out there.

1348
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,080
But E3 demo footage, I don't think is going to really be a problem either.

1349
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:06,240
So, um, let's see, uh, Bobby Blackwell says they aired that on TBS last night.

1350
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,440
The E league took that E3 tournament and turned it into a few episodes that aired on TBS last

1351
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,440
week.

1352
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,440
Huh?

1353
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,360
Just, just in time for the release of the game.

1354
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,360
Funny that.

1355
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,360
Yeah.

1356
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,480
Might wonder why it took a couple months of delay.

1357
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,920
Did, did it really take that long to edit?

1358
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,600
There's a little bit of both those things coming into play.

1359
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,600
Who knows?

1360
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,600
All right.

1361
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,600
Yeah.

1362
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,280
Tiger class says, so by the time ultimate comes out, we can expect tons of coverage

1363
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,120
for that in the fighting game community.

1364
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,880
And honestly, tiger claw, I think smash brothers could be the catalyst for why Nintendo finally

1365
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,400
sat down to re review this decision because maybe they realized there were some big names

1366
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,840
and fighting and all that stuff that we're not gonna look at it because of Nintendo's

1367
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,840
rules.

1368
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,840
And I mean, who knows?

1369
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,800
I could, you know, I don't have all the facts in front of me.

1370
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,000
Unfortunately, Nintendo knows why Nintendo made that decision, but I think somebody pointed

1371
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,320
out to them, they were off base and thinking they could control the entire internet with

1372
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,620
all that content and they got set on the right path.

1373
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,520
So there you go.

1374
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,520
Anyhow.

1375
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:11,700
Um, maybe not so much on the right path, uh, as it comes to light this week, uh, the PlayStation

1376
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,700
classic.

1377
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,700
Yeah.

1378
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,360
That's coming out real soon too.

1379
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,520
And uh, turns out, uh, some of the games on the PlayStation classic, not actually going

1380
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,680
to be exactly the same as you remember them in America.

1381
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,520
That's because they're adopting a different standard for the PlayStation classic called

1382
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:32,000
pal, which if you're in Europe, well, that will be the game that you remember.

1383
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,140
But essentially the difference is that a game in pal would run at 50 Hertz.

1384
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:43,800
So a game that runs at 30 frames a second in America runs at 25 frames a second in Europe,

1385
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,800
essentially.

1386
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,800
I mean, because you know, 60 Hertz is that more like standard here.

1387
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,180
It's like, so if you kind of do your fraction, okay, anyway.

1388
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:55,580
So, so essentially it cuts down the frame rates a little bit.

1389
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,580
Will most people notice?

1390
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,580
Yes.

1391
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,580
Oh, you think so?

1392
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,580
Okay.

1393
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,580
You will.

1394
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:05,660
But if you're like a big Tekken fighting game person and Tekken is one of the games, Tekken

1395
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:10,240
three, where the pal version is used, uh, those frames can absolutely make or break

1396
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,740
when it comes to when you block, when you do your moves.

1397
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:18,060
Cause the games they're running at 50 frames per second says 60, uh, that's a locked 50.

1398
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,660
Well, it's not even locked.

1399
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:20,660
It's you know.

1400
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,660
Yeah.

1401
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:26,900
Uh, Sony did confirm that news in a PlayStation, a blog post about the PlayStation classic.

1402
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:33,260
Uh, and uh, yeah, so for some reason, uh, the Europe versions are going to be the worldwide

1403
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,260
versions.

1404
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,300
Uh, it's not just Tekken.

1405
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,300
It's going to be as well.

1406
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,940
Resident Evil Director's Cut, Tom Clancy, Rainbow Six, Oddworld, Abe's Odyssey, Jumping

1407
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:44,820
Flash, Grand Theft Auto, Destruction Derby, Cool Borders 2, Battle Arena, Tushin Den.

1408
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:49,740
So yeah, you go, you go watch the Digital Foundry's video, they kind of do a nice breakdown

1409
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:54,700
of all the things that are not so great about, um, the PlayStation classic being, uh, there's

1410
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,260
sound emulation issues, there's slowdowns and games that weren't in the actual versions

1411
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,260
of the game.

1412
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:06,060
Um, just even the emulation like method that they use is not fantastic.

1413
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:12,420
It just, it works better on the PSP even, which if you think about it, like, I don't

1414
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,700
know, man, you could like buy an old PSP and with the video out cables and get a better

1415
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:22,940
experience than you would with, with the PlayStation classic, which is pathetic.

1416
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,940
I don't know.

1417
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:24,940
I think you can do better.

1418
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,940
Yeah.

1419
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:30,700
You know, with retro arch, they have other, um, they were showing there's one, I don't

1420
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,500
remember what, um, core it was, but there was a different PlayStation core that you

1421
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:40,500
could do that was, it actually fixes all the texture distortions issues that the PlayStation

1422
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,500
had.

1423
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,580
Oh my God.

1424
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:48,740
They should like, um, are four on that hole that now that was how it looked.

1425
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,300
That would be fantastic.

1426
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:56,380
And I'd be totally on board with getting it, but no, not, not the way this is.

1427
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:01,180
Well, uh, also one other thing is that in the blog post, uh, the PlayStation classic

1428
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,780
will not be upgradable.

1429
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:05,740
They're saying the PS classic is preloaded with 20 of the best games from the original

1430
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:09,500
PlayStation is not possible to purchase additional games for PlayStation classic.

1431
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,820
I don't know where that rumor came from.

1432
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,740
I thought they made it pretty clear before that it's not like they're not connecting

1433
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:18,060
it online or anything, but whatever it just sounds like a challenge to me.

1434
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,060
Yeah.

1435
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:20,060
Right.

1436
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:24,500
I mean, who, you wouldn't really want to upgrade it, but I mean, you could like, I'm sure it'll

1437
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,500
be hacked.

1438
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,820
I can't wait for the, you know, that portion of it and who knows, you know, being that

1439
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:34,460
it could be hacked and being that it's running an open source emulator anyways, I would think

1440
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:39,780
that perhaps we could just load something on there that maybe emulates it better.

1441
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:40,780
I don't know.

1442
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:41,780
All right.

1443
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:45,500
Uh, anyway, uh, Bobby Blackwell's in our chat saying the official reason is because the

1444
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,180
Europe versions have seven languages where the North American versions only have English

1445
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,940
and maybe French for Canada.

1446
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:54,780
And they wanted to make only one PlayStation classic for both North America and Europe.

1447
01:07:54,780 --> 01:08:03,340
I mean, I, I guess yay to more countries having access to this because of language needs,

1448
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:09,700
but it just doesn't seem like the greatest followup news story when this, I think most

1449
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,700
people, here's the thing, I think most people were already feeling lukewarm on this.

1450
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,900
And so this is just another kick in the shin.

1451
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,460
You know what I mean?

1452
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,460
Yeah.

1453
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,060
So yeah, just minimal viable product.

1454
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,060
Yeah, exactly.

1455
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,580
So, all right, well, we'll see how it goes for him.

1456
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,580
Anyhow, moving on.

1457
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:29,540
I have a feeling this will be PlayStation's only classic console though.

1458
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,240
We'll see moving on to Loki.

1459
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:36,120
So I'm surprised I didn't play this this week, but a red dead online, they did like a surprise

1460
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,680
announcement that, Hey, we're going to be doing testing for red dead online.

1461
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,020
So you go ahead and check it out.

1462
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,360
It's going to be available out there.

1463
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:50,360
So people got a chance to actually check out what the online micro track and transactions

1464
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,360
are going to look like.

1465
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:56,240
So you much like Grand Theft Auto online, you know, they have different currency.

1466
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,960
You can buy, you know, shark cards.

1467
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,360
So in Grand Theft Auto online, that is in the form of gold bars.

1468
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,200
Right now you cannot purchase gold bars for real world cash.

1469
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,840
That is going to be probably coming.

1470
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:14,400
So right now you earn nuggets and I believe for every 100 nuggets you get, you get a gold

1471
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,400
bar.

1472
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,600
And for some of the customization in the game, it costs you money to do that.

1473
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,800
For example, they said with the, if you want to change all of the metal pieces on your

1474
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,300
starting rifle, it's going to cost you 30 gold bars, which takes about 200 plus hours

1475
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,960
to earn.

1476
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,400
The only other way is to purchase, you know, gold.

1477
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,920
And then they said, of course, future, your first horse, I guess you can ensure it without

1478
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,920
gold.

1479
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,960
So that means that it will respawn.

1480
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:50,440
Otherwise, if you buy a horse later on, you would need five gold bars to ensure it.

1481
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:58,040
And then also people are finding that the in-game prices for items that you can purchase

1482
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,480
are much higher in the online version versus the actual game.

1483
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,160
Whereas the rewards aren't necessarily as high because of course they're trying to drive

1484
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:12,100
you to buying, you know, that online currency.

1485
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:18,320
See for me, I'm not, I'm kind of worried that I don't think the draw like with Grand Theft

1486
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:23,320
Auto five online is going to be the same as this game.

1487
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,960
I don't think that Red Dead Online is going to have that same draw because you're kind

1488
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,400
of limited in scope of what you can do with the game.

1489
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:35,000
Whereas Grand Theft Auto, I mean, you have like stunt races and shit with like cars transforming

1490
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,120
and all sorts of like crazy tracks and stuff in the sky and different game modes that are

1491
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,840
ridiculous like with spy cars and all that.

1492
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,860
I just think you're going to be kind of limited what you can do game mode wise.

1493
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:53,520
And so I may be harder for them to make that money back that they think they're going to

1494
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,520
make with this.

1495
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,520
But I guess we'll have to wait and see.

1496
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:59,680
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Red Dead Online is just Barbie horse adventures with mustaches

1497
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,880
and guns.

1498
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,640
Bobby knows how to sell video games.

1499
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,840
Like I'm kind of interested all of a sudden.

1500
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:12,100
No, I mean the online mode I bet would be pretty cool, but yeah, I don't know.

1501
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,760
Maybe it just sounds like it's very, very limited, but it's like all these games kind

1502
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,800
of like have forced online modes these days, right?

1503
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,380
I remember Mass Effect 3 got so much shit for having an online mode when it was such

1504
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,480
a narrative game.

1505
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,480
But like honestly, I still defend Mass Effect 3's online mode.

1506
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,000
I thought it made that game that much better.

1507
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,040
Like for all the shit it got for its ending and all that other stuff, like honestly, the

1508
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,560
online mode was fucking solid.

1509
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,400
Like I really loved how they implemented it.

1510
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:40,540
And I kind of wish like, yes, I know we got another online mode in Andromeda, which really

1511
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:41,840
it wasn't bad.

1512
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,680
I didn't like it as much as 3's, but it was competent.

1513
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:50,000
So I'd like to see another Mass Effect that's that if I can't get a narrative game soon.

1514
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,480
Like here's an example of how fucked up the economy is online right now.

1515
01:11:53,480 --> 01:12:00,080
So they said in the game you can steal, you know, loot stagecoaches and stuff like that.

1516
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:09,100
You can sell a gold wedding ring for $1.15, but a can of beans costs $1.50 to buy.

1517
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,520
That's more than they cost at Winco.

1518
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,520
That's a supermarket here.

1519
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,560
I don't know if that's a nationwide thing, but all right anyway.

1520
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,700
So it's just like, it's, it sounds like they're going to need, but you know what though?

1521
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,400
To be fair, it is a beta.

1522
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,880
All this stuff can be rebalanced.

1523
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,960
That being said, in Red Dead Online, or not Red Dead Online, in Grand Theft Auto Online,

1524
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,220
the prices of cars have been going up and up and up and up and up.

1525
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:42,600
So yeah, Red and Rockstar did make a lot of money off of Grand Theft Auto Online, so you

1526
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,600
know.

1527
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:49,120
All right, well, let's talk about some rumors.

1528
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,880
Everybody's favorite thing to get into in this slow news period time of year.

1529
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:55,660
Although no, to be real, I mean the game awards are coming up this next week, so I always

1530
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,460
forget how quick and fast they come and they go, right?

1531
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:02,840
Like I feel like we just heard the nominees for these a couple weeks ago, and now it's

1532
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,160
like bam, the awards are here.

1533
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,000
Which the nominees are not legitimate because Tetris Effect only got one nomination in a

1534
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,600
minor category, and that is criminal, I'm sorry.

1535
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:19,400
But all that joking aside, we know that we're going to get some big game reveals at the

1536
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,400
game awards.

1537
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,400
Yes.

1538
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,780
Especially with no PSX this time of year, right?

1539
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,480
So there's really, it's kind of open season in December for announcers.

1540
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,600
The one I paid attention to was the Russo Brothers are going to be there.

1541
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,680
Oh yeah, they're, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1542
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,680
The Avengers, right?

1543
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,680
Yes.

1544
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,680
So I'm hoping that Avengers game.

1545
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,240
Yeah, it would either be the trailer for the fourth movie, but not sure that's the right

1546
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,240
place for that.

1547
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,240
I think the trailer for the Avengers game would be hot.

1548
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,880
I'll take both.

1549
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,880
Yeah.

1550
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,440
I would, I would say if you're going to bet money, go on, they're not going to do, they're

1551
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,680
not going to debut a trailer at a game show.

1552
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,040
They're going to debut the game trailer.

1553
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,040
Yes.

1554
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,040
Yeah.

1555
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,860
So anyway, uh, but one of the other big rumors is, uh, something circulating about Mortal

1556
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,960
Combat 11.

1557
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,740
Now grain of salt, y'all it's from 4chan.

1558
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:10,960
So I completely understand if you want to tell me this is just like the Grinch leak

1559
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,320
or whatever.

1560
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:18,480
However, there are some indications based on things like track record, the thoroughness,

1561
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,760
some other things in the responses and some things that have collaborated that give it

1562
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,040
a few more legs.

1563
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:28,420
And also, I mean, are they going to make a Mortal Combat 11?

1564
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,420
You know what?

1565
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:32,620
It's, it's a pretty safe bet that yes, they are going to make a Mortal Combat 11.

1566
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,720
When did Mortal Combat 10 or Mortal Combat X, if you will, when did that happen?

1567
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,720
That was what?

1568
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,720
Back in 2014, 2015?

1569
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,720
A little while ago.

1570
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,900
It was a few years ago.

1571
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:44,100
So I mean, granted, there was Injustice 2, so it's not like Netherrealm's been sitting

1572
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:48,160
on their butt, but they've been probably pretty busy, you know, working on a Mortal

1573
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,600
Combat 11.

1574
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,380
So I won't get into too many more of the rumors, but one thing that I did find interesting,

1575
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:58,000
they are talking about some character things, but I think, I think it's A, way too early

1576
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
to talk about that.

1577
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,380
B, who knows what's going to turn up as fucking DLC anyway.

1578
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:04,940
You say a character's not going to be in the game, it'll probably just be DLC later on.

1579
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:09,920
But anyway, um, apparently there will be an adventure mode that will have gameplay similar

1580
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,760
to Mortal Combat Shaolin Monks from 2005.

1581
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,760
That's kind of interesting.

1582
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,760
Sort of like Shaolin Monks.

1583
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,760
Yeah, why not?

1584
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,760
Why not?

1585
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,680
So anyway, we'll see what happens.

1586
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,640
We'll find out by this time next week when the Game Awards actually happen.

1587
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:28,040
Now, something that seems a lot more probable when it comes to rumors is because Koei Tecmo

1588
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:33,580
has a new game that they are teasing on a site and they're teasing the unveil as December

1589
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,580
6th.

1590
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,380
Well, guess what's on December 6th, you guys?

1591
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,380
The Game Awards.

1592
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:42,660
So, Koei Tecmo is almost certainly unveiling something for the PlayStation 4 and Switch

1593
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:47,660
with the tagline on the website in Japanese that says, The Faded Battle Begins.

1594
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:50,460
So Dynasty Warriors prequel?

1595
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,460
I don't know.

1596
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,460
It could be anything.

1597
01:15:52,460 --> 01:16:01,360
And I know that this is no surprise to anybody, but apparently, um, well, Conan O'Brien did

1598
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:07,960
a trip in Japan recently and he went to Kojima Productions and they have footage that they're

1599
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,160
going to show, but they're not allowed to show it yet.

1600
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,880
So until after the Game Awards, oh, God, I'm going to do another Death Stranding tease

1601
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,880
the Game Awards.

1602
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:19,680
I think it's going to be another Death Stranding something or other.

1603
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,680
Here's the thing.

1604
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,680
I know.

1605
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,680
You all know where I'm at with this.

1606
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,680
You all know where I'm at with this.

1607
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:29,840
Like if all I'm going to say is this game or get out, maybe it's game play.

1608
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,840
Great.

1609
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,640
Well, they showed gameplay last time.

1610
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:38,800
It's still like running around.

1611
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,520
So game or just don't bother.

1612
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,780
Don't please don't show up.

1613
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:46,420
I'm sure people are going to see it and love it and eat it up anyway.

1614
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:50,460
And because it is Kojima, I have to cut this some slack because Kojima doesn't really make

1615
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:51,460
bad games.

1616
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,800
I mean, he doesn't.

1617
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,920
Like and he makes games that unfortunately didn't get finished, but I still would have

1618
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,360
loved to play such as Silent Hills.

1619
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:07,840
Anyway, Tigerclaw theorizes is that I bet this new gameplay footage will show another

1620
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,240
major celebrity that's in Death Stranding.

1621
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,960
Perhaps another cameo might be good.

1622
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,320
We'll see.

1623
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,880
Anyhow, let's move on with a couple more stories and then we'll get to the classic game of

1624
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,880
the week.

1625
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:20,880
Loki.

1626
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:28,780
So apparently a full copy of Super Smash Brothers Ultimate has leaked out two weeks early.

1627
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:37,420
And this was caught online by it's been spreading around against YouTube and Reddit and 4chan.

1628
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:44,680
Basically the hacker who went by the name of J.J. was showing off like some gameplay

1629
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:49,740
and was basically, you know, they had asked to confirm that it was legit and stuff and

1630
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:55,700
basically showing, you know, different specific stages and stuff, whatnot.

1631
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:59,940
Apparently he believes a leak came out online and thinks that it came from a journalist's

1632
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:05,260
early code or a wholesaler that broke street date.

1633
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:09,780
Probably from another country because I know that's a ship and that early anywhere for

1634
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:15,900
this specific reason of breaking street.

1635
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:21,700
But apparently, you know, this has been cast smack down by Nintendo already.

1636
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:27,780
And so be curious to see, though, what's going to be coming out regarding this, you

1637
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:30,380
know, for any more details will leak out.

1638
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,220
But really a couple of days away.

1639
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,220
So, you know.

1640
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:38,240
Yeah, I know you're a couple of days away from being able to play the game yourself.

1641
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:42,180
It sounds like the thing the thing that would probably be the biggest surprise would be

1642
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:45,940
any more characters, because sometimes in Smash Brothers, like even with this last one

1643
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:50,180
on Wii U and 3DS, we didn't know about Duck Hunt being in there until the game actually

1644
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,180
like came out.

1645
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:54,700
And there was there's a few things like that that they kept secret until the game is out.

1646
01:18:54,700 --> 01:19:00,340
Well, I will say now so the characters, they have because the leaks don't show any new

1647
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,340
characters.

1648
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:02,340
So that's that.

1649
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:08,180
And plus, they found out they could sell new characters through DLC or give them away as

1650
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,920
incentives like Piranha Plant.

1651
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,340
And that would be a great way to do it.

1652
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,860
So I kind of think that.

1653
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:17,460
And it's also like you can't sit here and be like, gosh, Nintendo is really holding

1654
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:22,180
back on characters when they are giving you every single it's not like they cut somebody

1655
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,900
to make room and sell it later.

1656
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:27,700
Now, they're giving you everybody from every single game and a few more.

1657
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:31,180
So you really can't say Nintendo's holding back.

1658
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,420
OK, so it is what it is.

1659
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,420
No secret characters.

1660
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,380
But I think there's some things related to story mode.

1661
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:39,380
I won't get into that here, obviously for obvious reasons.

1662
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:44,020
And then the music, the music list is out there, the full music list.

1663
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:47,840
And all I'll say about that is it's it's goddamn impressive.

1664
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,740
And it's going to make you wish that like there was just a mode where you could just

1665
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:55,620
turn your little switch into a jukebox and like plug it in your car stereo and drive

1666
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,620
down the highway.

1667
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,620
That's what the aux cables for.

1668
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:58,620
Yeah, maybe.

1669
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:59,620
Maybe people will do that.

1670
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:00,620
I don't know.

1671
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:04,300
And I'm sure you I don't know graphically what it looks like, but they would be silly

1672
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,800
if they didn't just put a mode in there where you just kind of like have your little switch

1673
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,140
sitting there with the thing in the back that holds it up and and just have it playing some

1674
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,460
music, you know, at your at your next party.

1675
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,940
So there you go.

1676
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:19,580
Act Defton chat says the leak apparently originated in Mexico.

1677
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:20,580
Yes, I'd heard that too.

1678
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,080
Sounds like a retailer there may have put it out on the shelf.

1679
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:30,100
You know, just not everybody follows the rules and it's not always somebody maliciously trying

1680
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,100
to do it.

1681
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:37,360
It's just it may have gone to a bond pop indie store in a country where, you know, I'm sure

1682
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:43,560
most North American, European, the big regions probably all get the rules enforced, you know,

1683
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,560
very heavily.

1684
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,000
But you start to go to places that maybe don't deal with as many companies on that kind of

1685
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,240
stuff and NDA and street days that it was inevitable what was going to happen.

1686
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,040
And once it's out there, y'all, it's out there.

1687
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,040
Y'all know that.

1688
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,040
Yeah.

1689
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,040
So there it is.

1690
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,480
Smash Brothers is leaking out.

1691
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,520
So be careful of leaks.

1692
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,600
But again, you're not going to I really I think the story stuff will be some people

1693
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:10,120
things that people want to avoid, but I'm going to admit, I looked at it and I didn't

1694
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:13,240
see anything that made me go, oh, my God.

1695
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,600
But I didn't like really read through it with a fine tooth comb either.

1696
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,260
Like, I'm just excited to play the game soon.

1697
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:23,360
And honestly, like, I hate that when I phrase it that way, it makes it sound like I don't

1698
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,360
care about the game or something.

1699
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,360
I really do.

1700
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,960
But like the minute they announced every single character will be here and you have this and

1701
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,960
this and this and this.

1702
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,400
I'm like, this game is going to be a great value.

1703
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,200
Like, they don't even need to announce anything else.

1704
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,200
It's going to be fine.

1705
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,200
Yeah.

1706
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,000
So I these spoilers are more of a whatever to me.

1707
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
All right.

1708
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,360
Anyhow, one other story here, and this is about a classic as we start to get into the

1709
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,360
classic game of the week.

1710
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:48,680
But Al Lowe, which is a name you may be familiar with as the creator of the Leisure Suit Larry

1711
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:51,520
Games, and he did some of the other classic Sierra titles, too.

1712
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,980
He's going to be selling some of his source code for classic Sierra games on eBay.

1713
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:59,120
He did an interview with Metal Jesus Rocks on YouTube.

1714
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,080
Never heard of the guy, but all right, go ahead.

1715
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,160
And he said in the interview, Al Lowe said, I'm 72 years old and none of my kids want

1716
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,360
this junk.

1717
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,360
Does anybody?

1718
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:13,040
Isn't that funny how like a lot of times kids like don't want to do the thing that their

1719
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,040
parents are into?

1720
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,960
Like this happens a lot with celebrities.

1721
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,720
Some do like, you know, like Paris Jackson, daughter of Michael Jackson, I think wants

1722
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,720
to be an entertainer.

1723
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,720
She's kind of going down that path.

1724
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,720
But you get a lot of like kids of famous movie stars and stuff that are like, I am perfectly

1725
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:32,640
content being an accountant or being a office manager or be, you know, they, they don't

1726
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,840
necessarily need that life.

1727
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,000
So I could totally see where Al Lowe's kids are maybe like, that's cool that dad made

1728
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,480
this video game that I don't want to make porn games, dad.

1729
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:47,120
I won't do it.

1730
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:51,320
So anyhow, listen son, you're going to make those porn games.

1731
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:56,480
I didn't raise you to be anything like this.

1732
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,200
Well now, Loki, you weren't there in that household, so we don't know.

1733
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,440
But anyway, all that jokes aside, you can check them out on eBay.

1734
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,200
They're all being sold under the same name, Al underscore Lowe.

1735
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:11,600
What is currently being sold there, the source code for Leisure Suit Larry one and Leisure

1736
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:16,180
Suit Larry two, which I think either one is going to set you at least $8,000.

1737
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:20,200
To be clear, you are not buying the intellectual property rights to the game.

1738
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,180
Somebody else has that right now because new Leisure Suit Larry games are coming out.

1739
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:26,660
You are not buying the rights to compile this and mass produce it.

1740
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,420
You don't have those sorts of rights.

1741
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,180
You are getting the source code.

1742
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,860
That's what you're getting.

1743
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,140
And you know, but it could be a really cool little way to get some insight, especially

1744
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,660
if you're like into that stuff.

1745
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:42,940
I really, you know, I know there's some gaming museums and gaming preservation societies.

1746
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,620
I hope some of them have the coin to throw in for this because I bet it would be really

1747
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:49,020
fascinating if we could get that.

1748
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:53,140
Word is, and Bobby was getting into this on his show, is that right now, as of right now,

1749
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:57,460
it could change by the end, but as of right now, the highest bidder is the company that

1750
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,660
owns the rights currently.

1751
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,580
That's an interesting little twist, isn't it?

1752
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:07,940
So since they own the rights, they would be able to take said source code and re-put out

1753
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:11,500
the game and maybe put it, I don't fucking know, on mobile or whatever they want to do

1754
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,220
with it, which is probably what would happen.

1755
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,220
Who knows?

1756
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:15,220
Don't quote me.

1757
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:18,420
But it would be interesting to see if that's how it turns out.

1758
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,700
I would love it though, if one of these like retro preservation societies, but it is a

1759
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:27,940
lot of money and, you know, those societies run on donations, a lot of labor of love there.

1760
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,380
Not a lot of people making money off that.

1761
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:37,660
So they just may not be able to afford it unless a very kind donor steps out to do that.

1762
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,260
So anyway, if you want to check that out, there's a whole little thing on YouTube and

1763
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:41,300
you can check more.

1764
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,300
It's all over the Internet right now.

1765
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,420
And again, the current bids over at Al underscore low.

1766
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:51,940
So as of the recording of the show Sunday night at about 730 Pacific time, $8,400 for

1767
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:56,060
the source code to Leisure Suit Larry 2, excuse me, $8401.

1768
01:24:56,060 --> 01:25:01,100
Source code to Leisure Suit Larry 1, $9,201.

1769
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,860
There's some other collectibles he's selling as well, including, I don't know how this

1770
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:09,540
BAPA bet is going through for $10,000 because it's extremely rare.

1771
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:12,660
That's going for more than the source code, go figure, but he's selling some other little

1772
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:13,660
things here and there too.

1773
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:15,660
So interesting.

1774
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:19,260
So yeah, hopefully again, somebody will be able to come up with a coin to buy that source

1775
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,860
code and preserve it.

1776
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:24,580
All right, but for now, let's talk about, let's talk about other games that might need

1777
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:25,580
some preserving.

1778
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:28,620
And so we go to the classic game of the week.

1779
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:36,260
And so we take a step through the portal of radio magic to a simpler time and simpler

1780
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,260
games.

1781
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:38,260
It's the classic game of the week.

1782
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,660
And joining us on the Skypline tonight is Dark Sakura.

1783
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,660
Oh, hi.

1784
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:44,980
Hi, how are you doing?

1785
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:45,980
I'm okay.

1786
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:46,980
Good.

1787
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,260
It's good to have you here.

1788
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,260
What's that?

1789
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,660
Been busy.

1790
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:54,740
You've been putting stuff together for the show behind the scenes.

1791
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,740
It has been busy.

1792
01:25:55,740 --> 01:26:00,940
We did, we went on a little friend date yesterday and we did some stuff for the big studio changeover

1793
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:03,860
or makeover, whatever you want to call it, and the Twitch stuff.

1794
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:06,120
And then we went out to food and that was good.

1795
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,120
And there were so many leftovers.

1796
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,780
I believe you're eating them now, right?

1797
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,780
I am.

1798
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:13,780
I finally all by myself finished off the wonton soup.

1799
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:14,780
Congrats.

1800
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:15,780
Good job.

1801
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:16,780
Good job.

1802
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:17,780
All right.

1803
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:22,140
I want our listeners to step into the gaming vault like you do every week and curl up with

1804
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:27,340
some nice hot soup in this winter weather and play, I guess, a scary game this week,

1805
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,340
Dark Sakura.

1806
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,180
What is the classic game of the week?

1807
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:34,300
The classic game of the week is a game called Sweet Home.

1808
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:40,260
And I don't think a lot of people might have heard about it because while it's a neat game,

1809
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:44,060
it's based off of a kind of obscure movie.

1810
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:52,740
Sweet Home was a ghost movie that came out in Japan that was about a team of filmmakers

1811
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:58,100
who wanted to run a documentary about an artist who had lived there and he died, but it turned

1812
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:02,940
out that the house was, of course, haunted in true Japanese ghost story fashion.

1813
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:11,340
So the game is based on the movie, but the game director, who is a Fujiwara Tokuro, he

1814
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:16,140
got complete permission to tour the film sets to inspire him for the game, and then

1815
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:19,820
the film director said he could take liberties with the script.

1816
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:27,500
So it actually was an expansion of the story in a little bit.

1817
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,860
The game came out in December 1989 only in Japan.

1818
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:35,820
It actually had some really good reception, and it was even called Better Than the Film,

1819
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:39,220
which how often does that happen for a video game tie-in?

1820
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,220
Like never.

1821
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:43,980
I always say, we never get video games that are better than the movie.

1822
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:46,180
I'm trying to think if there's others.

1823
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,180
It's very rare.

1824
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,180
It's very rare.

1825
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,180
Very rare.

1826
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:50,180
Yeah.

1827
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:54,500
But at any rate, the game never did come out in the West just because it really did have

1828
01:27:54,500 --> 01:28:01,420
some pretty, at the time, gruesome imagery, and of course also RPGs weren't very popular

1829
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:05,140
outside of Japan in the late 80s.

1830
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:12,820
But the game itself, it's very significant because of what it led to as well.

1831
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:18,740
Fujiwara Tokuro also had worked on Ghosts and Goblins in the arcade, so he already had

1832
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:24,140
that little bit of a finger into the pool of scary.

1833
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:30,820
So the big thing about this game is that it really did, and I'll get to the games that

1834
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:35,620
get really inspired later on because that's a big part of it, but lots of different things

1835
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:40,740
came in in the game, including the use of quick time events, inventory management, ghost

1836
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:44,580
story, and the Metroidvania-style exploration gameplay.

1837
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:49,420
On top of that, it also had like story switching, or more like character switching.

1838
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:56,220
So basically, in the game, you are in this intricate mansion, and you have five playable

1839
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:00,340
characters, and they were all characters in the movie, but each character has the unique

1840
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:05,620
item that is necessary to finish the game, including a camera, a lighter, a medical kit,

1841
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,580
a lock pit, and a vacuum cleaner.

1842
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:13,700
Okay, the vacuum cleaner actually belongs to a painting restoration person, like to

1843
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:16,300
vacuum up glass, you know, like a little vacuum cleaner.

1844
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:21,420
But, I mean, in the nutshell, the game is where these people are, like I said, are going

1845
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:27,140
in to explore a house that was left abandoned so they could see the last works of this great

1846
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:30,060
artist who died, and of course, ghosts.

1847
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:35,220
But getting back into it, you've also got, you know, different puzzles to solve, inventory

1848
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:40,340
management, survival horror, one of the early survival horror games, and you have to backtrack

1849
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:45,660
to other locations to solve puzzles with items you acquire later in this giant mansion.

1850
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:46,660
Hint, hint.

1851
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:53,020
And the mansion eventually grows, like you know how when you go through Metroid, you

1852
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,900
get a different area, that's how the mansion works.

1853
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:58,420
You have random enemies, and you either fight or run away.

1854
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:05,220
You can also pray, but you get different types of enemies, like zombies and ghosts and dolls.

1855
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:09,620
And the only way that you can restore your health is by getting conics in the mansion.

1856
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:15,500
The story does have some cinematic cut scenes, you know, for an NES game at the time, and

1857
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:20,220
you can pick up notes like secret messages and diary entries that tell you more of the story.

1858
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:25,860
Now, with the game, you have different traps that you have to settle itself really quickly

1859
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,100
or else you die, or the character dies.

1860
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:32,500
And then when a character dies, they remain dead permanently in the game, like permanent death.

1861
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,500
There's no bringing them back.

1862
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,500
Yikes.

1863
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:40,500
But the items that have their power is left to be used by somebody else.

1864
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:45,980
So like for example, if the nurse Akiko dies, then the team will find pill bottles that

1865
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:49,460
can be used to heal ailments, so different things like that.

1866
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:54,540
And depending on how many characters are alive after you defeat the final boss, you get different

1867
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,940
endings depending on, you know, it's up to five endings depending on how many people you live.

1868
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:12,340
But so basically, the movie itself, 30 years prior to the game, so like in 1959, this artist

1869
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:20,740
named Maemiya Ichiro, I'm sorry, I cannot pronounce his name tonight, had different

1870
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:25,340
frescoes that were in his mansion before he disappeared or died.

1871
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:29,420
And so the present day, these five documentary filmmakers are going in to recover the paintings

1872
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:34,220
in his mansion, but they find that this ghost of an unknown woman wants to kill them.

1873
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:38,820
Turns out the ghost was his wife and their two year old fell into the incinerator and

1874
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:45,580
died there and had to be fed like the corpses of other children to be happy and bringing

1875
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:49,700
him playmates by killing other children and that she killed herself and all this stuff.

1876
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:52,540
This is a wonderful holiday selection, Dark Sakura.

1877
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:54,500
Of course it is.

1878
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:57,980
So now here is the reason why the game is important.

1879
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:05,220
Like I said, it was directed by Fujiwara Tokuro, and he had worked on Ghosts and Goblins on

1880
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:08,580
Commando, Violet Commando, Mega Man 2 and Strider.

1881
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:21,380
Um, now there's more that goes to this is that, um, the ideas that came into this game

1882
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:26,820
eventually made it into another game called Biohazard.

1883
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,340
Where do we know Biohazard from?

1884
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:32,180
Uh, Resident Evil 7 is called Biohazard.

1885
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:36,660
Well, the first Resident Evil was called Biohazard in Japan.

1886
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,260
I know, I was just setting you up.

1887
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:47,260
Yeah, anyway, um, it was, the first Biohazard was supposed to be a remake of Sweet Home.

1888
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:54,180
Um, it was directed by, uh, Mikami Shinji with Fujiwara acting as the producer.

1889
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:59,820
And he thought that, you know, there were so many things he wanted to do in Sweet Home

1890
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:05,940
that there would be the, um, you know, the ability to do this now on the PlayStation.

1891
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:11,300
And of course also came out on Saturn, but Capcom no longer had the rights to Sweet Home.

1892
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:14,860
So they created a new universe and that's where Biohazard came from.

1893
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:23,940
And so in all of the Biohazard games, it has, um, like elements that were introduced in Sweet Home.

1894
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:30,220
So like, for example, um, the first Resident Evil is supposed to be, um, first person battle

1895
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:33,100
perspective, but then that got changed because of how the game had to go.

1896
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:39,020
But it had like, you know, the mansion with the layout, getting the story through notes, multiple endings,

1897
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:45,260
depending on who survives, you know, the imagery, the door loading sequences, puzzles, backtracking,

1898
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:51,260
all of this, you know, having to use a lockpick and a lighter, you know, and then in the later games,

1899
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:56,620
Resident Evil 0, um, let you switch between characters and draw up items for the other characters,

1900
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,380
which you could do in Sweet Home.

1901
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:05,500
Um, the quick time events, you know, showed up in Resident Evil 4 and after Resident Evil 7 even has

1902
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:10,580
some story elements, including the film crew going to an abandoned house with a paranormal female

1903
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,500
presence in the house.

1904
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:14,220
So, you know, tragic stories.

1905
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:20,340
And it also, um, apparently plays homage to Sweet Home and a side story told through a VHS tape.

1906
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:26,380
So it, it was really, you know, that just kept going on and on and on.

1907
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:33,380
And so it's just funny to see how even today, those elements are still going on in the current

1908
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,700
Resident Evil franchise.

1909
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:38,260
And so there you go.

1910
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:39,660
The game is Sweet Home.

1911
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:44,140
Sweet Home for the Famicom, because it wasn't really released here officially in the US anyway,

1912
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:47,860
but fan, fan translations are available because this is the internet.

1913
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:48,700
They are out there.

1914
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,380
Um, and I gotta say, yeah, like,

1915
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:55,460
I don't know, maybe, maybe we should like do a take turn stream of this game.

1916
01:34:55,460 --> 01:35:00,780
Yeah, that might be fun because like, yeah, I mean, so much depth to this game, which was on the NES.

1917
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:05,460
I mean, you're talking about a lot of concepts like, uh, endings based on who lives and who dies.

1918
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:08,180
Like that was Until Dawn was very famous for that very recently.

1919
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:11,820
Um, you know, a lot of these other games like the quick time events and things.

1920
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:16,180
And, um, yeah, when I'm, when I'm kind of watching, cause I, I was not very familiar with this game

1921
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:19,820
until I knew you were going to pick it and I kind of, kind of looked up some stuff on it and, uh, it

1922
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:23,380
looks like, especially like in the overhead and when they're kind of walking around, it looks a lot

1923
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:28,460
like to me, and this is another obscure pick, but Ultima 4 Quest of the Avatar is kind of like what it looks like.

1924
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:28,860
Yeah.

1925
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:29,540
Yeah.

1926
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,980
But then it's got like all this, yeah, this whole different element to it.

1927
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:34,140
Yeah.

1928
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:37,380
The way the menus work and the perspective and everything really looks like Ultima 4 to me.

1929
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,940
But yeah, kind of neat.

1930
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:45,700
But it was, you know, and the funny thing is, is that now that I think about it, you remember I said

1931
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:48,620
that when I was younger, I had a Japanese friend who had a Famicom.

1932
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:49,140
Yeah.

1933
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:51,940
I think my friend owns this game.

1934
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,100
Nice.

1935
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,540
Well, you should, uh,

1936
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:56,660
never played it, but I remember the box.

1937
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,420
Yeah.

1938
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,460
That's awesome.

1939
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:01,740
Well, there it is again, your game of the week, sweet home on the Famicom.

1940
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:03,860
Good choice, Jamie, educating the listeners tonight.

1941
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:09,100
Although I don't know, I might've done it in October, but, uh, she does it her way here on OLR.

1942
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:11,420
I do what I want.

1943
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:12,580
That's right.

1944
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:14,700
By the way, I will be on the show next week.

1945
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:15,460
Hooray.

1946
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:19,220
I was going to say Dark Soccer's favorite Christmas movie, Krampus.

1947
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,620
No, it's Gremlins.

1948
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:23,100
Thank you.

1949
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,020
Oh, sorry.

1950
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:27,900
I was, I, at least you can go with Die Hard, which I think is now like the cliche answer.

1951
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,980
Everybody says Die Hard's a favorite Christmas movie.

1952
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:30,740
That's a cliche.

1953
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,860
You know, I'm not, this may be blasphemy.

1954
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,500
I'm not really the biggest fan of Die Hard.

1955
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:35,700
Oh my.

1956
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:36,620
All right.

1957
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:39,980
Well, I'm sure, I'm sure you'll get some hate mail in our discord.

1958
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:42,260
That's all right.

1959
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:46,420
Uh, you know what, if you just, I will say that to my dying day, be mad about it.

1960
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:50,300
Die mad about it while playing sweet home on the Famicom.

1961
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:51,100
All right, there it is.

1962
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:54,660
We got to get back to the studio for this week, but we'll see you in studio next week.

1963
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:57,660
Uh, Dark Sakura, any final parting thoughts for our listeners?

1964
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,140
Next week is Hanukkah.

1965
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:01,140
You know what that means?

1966
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:03,700
Latkes.

1967
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:12,380
Oh boy, cooking with a Dark Sakura on the show next week.

1968
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,380
I look forward to it though.

1969
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:13,940
That's always fun.

1970
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,060
She she's done that before.

1971
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,780
I asked those of you that are newer to Orange Launch Radio.

1972
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:20,220
She has, she has cooked latkes, this Hanukkah celebration live on the show before.

1973
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:21,820
So I look forward to that, honestly.

1974
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:24,100
So applesauce to all that good stuff.

1975
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,980
So looking forward to that next week.

1976
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:28,140
And again, those of you, I think I said this earlier in the show, but those of you

1977
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:31,780
that are celebrating Hanukkah with the first night tonight, um, uh, hope you're

1978
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:34,380
having a happy celebration and all that good stuff.

1979
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:37,820
Um, yeah, I'll be excited to have Dark Sakura here, here next week.

1980
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:42,140
It's a bummer she won't be here the first week that we make the Twitch move, but it is what it is.

1981
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:46,180
So I have to figure out how video magic is going to work.

1982
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:49,820
Cause I don't, I, well, the short answer is I don't think it's going to.

1983
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,940
But I'll have to do something a little different.

1984
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:58,820
You could just put like, you know how like they have, uh, well you set up your overlays

1985
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:03,580
and everything, so you could just have, you know, have the video and then put

1986
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,580
like a different sticker over her.

1987
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:10,940
No, I, I think, well, I think she's going to be more open to doing some video stuff

1988
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:13,340
with, uh, that we have, we put a picture of Dr.

1989
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:13,980
Claw.

1990
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,500
I actually love that idea.

1991
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,460
I really do think Jamie should be like Dr.

1992
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:22,660
Claw or something where she's like, you know, partially hidden, except like them nails or something.

1993
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:26,740
Or I think we were joking in the car the other night about wigs that she had.

1994
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:30,820
Cause she was saying she was going to be Sia and just have like a giant wig that she wears.

1995
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,220
And then I was like, Ooh, you get to expand your wig collection though.

1996
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,460
She's like, Ooh, I like this idea.

1997
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:35,100
So who knows?

1998
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,060
We might have Jamie in drag every week.

1999
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:37,500
Who knows?

2000
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:42,340
But, uh, all seriousness, I think the easy answer, which I'm sure a lot of you, I'm not even looking at

2001
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:42,940
chat at the moment.

2002
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:48,660
The easy answer is it'll probably be the audio still, but maybe with footage of said game running behind the

2003
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,460
audio would make an awful lot of sense.

2004
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:50,780
Wouldn't it?

2005
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:51,220
Low key.

2006
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:51,660
Yeah.

2007
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:54,460
So I think, I think that'll probably be the direction it goes in.

2008
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:55,300
All right.

2009
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:58,980
Uh, if, if I can pull it all off, we'll see the deadline is fast approaching.

2010
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:04,260
To register participation for this week's episode of orange challenge radio at

2011
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,380
vognetwork.com use the pass phrase drum.

2012
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:07,820
All right.

2013
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:12,220
Meanwhile, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other things going on in the industry this week.

2014
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:12,580
Yeah.

2015
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:21,900
So it's a little bit of a tease, but, um, apparently finally the PVP, uh, trainer battles are going to be coming to Pokemon

2016
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:22,300
go.

2017
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:29,380
So they've been teasing some stuff, um, through Twitter, uh, talking about how there's different classes of Pokemon.

2018
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,740
You'll build a battle and stuff.

2019
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:35,300
Um, just not exactly knowing when that's going to happen yet.

2020
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:37,420
Maybe after this event, who knows?

2021
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:40,300
Um, but soon because they are teasing it.

2022
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:41,660
So we'll have to wait and see.

2023
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:50,900
Um, then of course, you know, as referenced earlier, elder scrolls blade has been delayed to early 2019.

2024
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:54,460
And so they announced this via Twitter, Bethesda did.

2025
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:58,140
Um, so we'll have to wait and see what happens to that.

2026
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:02,820
Maybe it just needs some more time to polish those canvas bags in the game.

2027
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,260
Womp womp.

2028
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:04,700
Yeah.

2029
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:06,860
So that's it.

2030
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:07,620
That's it.

2031
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:10,220
Sorry for ruining that story a little bit earlier.

2032
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:10,620
My bad.

2033
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:11,700
Oh, no, that's all right.

2034
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:13,780
Are you looking forward to the trainer battles and Pokemon go?

2035
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:20,740
No, I think people need to lower their expectations because people are like, Oh, finally we'll get to battle.

2036
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:22,220
Like we do in the game boy games.

2037
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:22,780
Nope.

2038
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:23,620
Nope.

2039
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:24,260
No, you won't.

2040
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:25,460
I'm going to tell you right now.

2041
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:30,860
Don't assume the gym battles, but it's just another person instead.

2042
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:31,140
Yeah.

2043
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,100
It's ding, ding, ding, ding.

2044
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:34,820
That is exactly how it's going to be.

2045
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:38,820
So it's going to be broken somehow who can tap, who can dodge.

2046
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,540
Maybe the dodging will actually be important.

2047
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:47,940
Like that'll be a thing that is like actually important now, but honestly like, do not, do not suddenly think it's going to become the game boy that the, you know why?

2048
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:56,260
Because the game they want you to buy to do those types of battles is Pokemon gen eight, which is all but confirmed for next holiday, assuming it's done.

2049
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:01,340
So yeah, get just these pie in the sky ideas about what PVP is going to be.

2050
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:01,620
Nope.

2051
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:05,300
It's it'll be, let's, let's go melt and that's right.

2052
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:08,740
Y Y R in chat says it's rock, paper, scissors, and you're going to like it.

2053
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:09,340
Yup.

2054
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:10,660
All right.

2055
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:17,740
Moving on talking about, uh, uh, some other stories like PlayStation plus and free games for December.

2056
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:25,460
Uh, the PlayStation plus free games for December are going to include Soma and on rush on the PlayStation four and sounds good.

2057
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:25,820
Yeah.

2058
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:32,340
Stera den and Stein's gate on the PlayStation three and the Vita has crossover with iconic class.

2059
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,580
That's a cross by things.

2060
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:41,780
You also get that on PS four and then the indie runaway hit papers, please, which if you've never played, that is really worth a look.

2061
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:44,580
Uh, papers pleases is a pretty cool little game.

2062
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:45,500
I like that.

2063
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:46,860
I need to do a stream of that sometime.

2064
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:48,500
I need to go back and visit some indie classics.

2065
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:55,660
Uh, anyhow, uh, as far as Xbox live and the games with gold go on Xbox one, you can look forward to cube.

2066
01:41:55,660 --> 01:42:02,380
Two from December 1st to the 31st and a game called never alone from December 16th, January 15th.

2067
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:13,420
That was that game that, um, you played like, um, um, a little girl and she's like, um, got this spirit animal with her and stuff that she kind of walks around with.

2068
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:15,100
And I'm sorry, I don't remember all the details of this game.

2069
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,620
It's a very artistic kind of adventure game.

2070
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:18,860
It's, it was, it was pretty good.

2071
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:19,940
What little bits I saw of it.

2072
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:21,420
So I think that'll be another one.

2073
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:22,780
It's kind of similar to papers, please.

2074
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:26,020
One of those smaller games that you'll have a chance to look at all over again.

2075
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:30,220
Um, thanks to this and on the Xbox three 60.

2076
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:34,180
And remember these games are compatible backwards compatible with Xbox one.

2077
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:40,180
The second half of a month goes, uh, mercenaries playground of destruction from December 16th to the 31st.

2078
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:44,500
But the first half of the month, dragon age two, it's a pretty big one there.

2079
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,180
So yeah, that'll be pretty cool.

2080
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:47,180
I like mercenaries.

2081
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:47,540
Yeah.

2082
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:55,780
Y Y R commenting about never alone in our chat room at live.vognetware.com says the game is based on an Alaskan native tribe and never alone that is.

2083
01:42:55,780 --> 01:43:00,820
Yeah, I thought, I thought it was native culture based, but I wasn't a hundred percent sure.

2084
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:04,620
So I don't want to say that, but thank you for confirming what I was kind of thinking in the back of my head.

2085
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:09,180
Uh, talking about rockstar and, uh, them walking away from a trademark.

2086
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:15,940
Uh, they had trademarked the term agent for a game some time ago, but they walked away from that trademark.

2087
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:18,460
Uh, that trademark is now going to be irrelevant.

2088
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:23,660
It was this game that was expected to come out on PlayStation three, like an exclusive or something a long time ago.

2089
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:27,020
You would have still thought that they might've held onto the assets or try to make something out of it.

2090
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:33,580
Like even, even blizzard salvaged Titan and made overwatch out of it, which, you know, ended up being a huge hit.

2091
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:36,900
Well, they're made too much money on grand theft auto.

2092
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:37,740
I guess so.

2093
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:38,180
Yeah.

2094
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:38,860
All right.

2095
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:43,460
Anyhow, uh, yeah, it was supposed to be, Oh, I guess it actually was announced at E3 2009.

2096
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:49,740
It was going to be a PlayStation three exclusive, but didn't really, uh, end up going anywhere past that bummer.

2097
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:53,500
So that's it for that rockstar trademark.

2098
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:56,540
So if you want to make a game called agent, you might have the opportunity.

2099
01:43:57,220 --> 01:44:01,620
All right, let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores this week, starting with the U S Loki.

2100
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:03,460
Well, we've got quite a few things coming out this week.

2101
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:13,220
So let's start off with Gwent, the Witcher card game on PlayStation four and Xbox one just cause four on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one.

2102
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:19,460
Monster boy in the curse kingdom on the PC switch PlayStation four, Xbox one.

2103
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:42,700
Mutant year zero road to Eden on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC override mech city brawl on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one persona three dancing in the moonlight on PlayStation four and Vita persona for dancing all night on PlayStation four and persona five dancing in starlight on PlayStation four and Vita.

2104

We have subnautica on PlayStation four and Xbox one throne breaker, the Witcher tales, two Witcher games in one week.

2105
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:59,300
How fancy on PlayStation four and Xbox one, the last remnant remastered on PlayStation four.

2106
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:05,700
Katamari Damacy reroll on PC and the switch.

2107
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:11,140
I'm totally getting that on PC because of mods and mods, mods, mods.

2108
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:16,300
Uh, path of exile and PlayStation four pub G forgot.

2109
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:17,220
That was the thing that was happening.

2110
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:17,440
Yeah.

2111
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:25,220
Pub G on PlayStation four, um, super smash brothers ultimate on switch.

2112
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:37,660
You don't say, and then also is ultimate, but not until the week after, but I'm going to tell you anyways, because I'm looking forward to earth defense force five PlayStation, which you'll just be reading every, I'll just read it again next week.

2113
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:38,020
That's fine.

2114
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:38,420
That's fine.

2115
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:38,820
That's fine.

2116
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:39,780
That's it.

2117
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:41,220
All right.

2118
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:48,100
Uh, let's talk about what's happening in Japan, uh, over on the PlayStation four Capcom is putting out a Capcom belt action collection.

2119
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:51,980
I think that is their version of the, uh, what do they call it here?

2120
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:55,820
Uh, it's all there, like side scrolling fighting games, all in one collection.

2121
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:56,980
What the hell did they call it here?

2122
01:45:57,220 --> 01:46:02,180
The fighting or fighting game collection or something, although it's not, but it's not collection.

2123
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:02,460
Yeah.

2124
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:05,140
Beat them up or something like that, but they're getting their version of that this week.

2125
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:09,020
It's the one that has, um, Oh God, like I think it was it final fight.

2126
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:17,180
Isn't that captain commando, captain commando, those, all those stuff you already downloaded on Mame a long time ago, but now you do the round.

2127
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:17,940
Oh, here we go.

2128
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:18,180
Yeah.

2129
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:18,900
Final fight.

2130
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:21,180
Knights of the round, king of dragons, battle circuit.

2131
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:21,940
It's all that stuff.

2132
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:26,220
So, uh, which that collection is already out in dinosaurs.

2133
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:28,140
I don't know if that one's there.

2134
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:28,540
Yeah.

2135
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:28,940
All right.

2136
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:32,380
Uh, also coming out, just cause four gets this Japanese release this week.

2137
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:35,620
Mantis burn rising fighting ex layer.

2138
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:38,940
And, uh, that is it on the sixth.

2139
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:49,060
But of course they also, if we go over to the Nintendo switch, they are also getting their version of super smash brothers ultimate on the seventh, same day that we are.

2140
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:55,420
Um, so, uh, also coming out in Japan though, Sid Meier civilization six, which I still have to pick up on the switch.

2141
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:58,460
I heard somebody, I think target or somebody is having a sale on that coming up.

2142
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:11,420
So, which I think Bobby is okay when it's not an indie developer that I'm okay to seize, especially if I bought the game before, you know, if I'm buying the six for the second time, I think I'm allowed to take advantage of a discount.

2143
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:13,300
I think I will be, uh, have to look into that.

2144
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:24,220
But anyway, in Japan, it's coming out for the first time on December the sixth and that same Capcom collection is coming out in, uh, the switch on the switch, uh, for, uh, this week as well, December the sixth.

2145
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:28,180
Uh, also lastly, but not leastly, a cute little game on the switch.

2146
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:34,500
Don't let smash brothers take your eyes off of a game called little friends, dogs, and cats.

2147
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,220
That's right.

2148
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:39,060
Little friends, dogs, and cats is also coming out on the switch this week.

2149
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,060
You know what this game is?

2150
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:43,980
It's just fucking Nintendogs except Nintendo didn't make it.

2151
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:51,380
A company called Imagineer made it, but like looking at the screenshots and all this stuff, it's Nintendo.

2152
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:56,140
Well, you're not fucking the Nintendogs, but yes, it is a Nintendogs and Nintendcats basically.

2153
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:01,780
Which kind of begs the question, Nintendo did kind of let that one go, didn't they?

2154
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:04,060
They didn't, they didn't bring that back for switch, did they?

2155
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:07,340
Somebody thought this would be a good idea to put out, at least in Japan.

2156
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:13,500
Probably my guess would be because it's mostly touch screen controls and that would be difficult to do.

2157
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:14,140
Yeah.

2158
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:22,500
I mean, they do have like the touch screen stuff sort of like, because this console is a home console, not just a portable console, then they're like, yeah, no.

2159
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:23,620
You're right.

2160
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:26,340
And Nintendo probably doesn't want to do anything like that first party.

2161
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:30,340
There are some games, like what, Vaas, that you can only play with the touch screen.

2162
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:31,700
You can't even like play it docked.

2163
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:34,860
So there are some games that lock out certain types of modes.

2164
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:38,020
Like remember when Blaster Master Zero first came out, you couldn't use the pro controller.

2165
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:42,340
You can now, they fixed that mighty quick, but you couldn't like the first week or so.

2166
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:49,140
So, you know, there's, there's still some weird oddity stuff, but I don't think Nintendo themselves, you're right, because that game was very highly touch controlled.

2167
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:51,900
They're probably just not interested in revisiting it on the switch.

2168
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,620
And they're letting third party companies do it.

2169
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:58,060
Well, at least right now, it's maybe, it might be something that comes out later on, but yeah.

2170
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:04,420
Oh, and ActDeft corrects me in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying Vaas now allows for TV play.

2171
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:06,260
So they changed that at some point.

2172
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:06,940
Thank you for the update.

2173
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,100
I actually was not aware of that.

2174
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:08,620
Very cool.

2175
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:19,340
I might have to check that out now because I play a lot of, I know a lot of you guys are like, I play everything in switch portable mode, but like, no, I play most of my stuff docked.

2176
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:27,300
Like once in a while, like, especially if I'm on a flight or something, I use the, the portable mode, but I kind of prefer a docked mode whenever possible.

2177
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:28,980
So, all right.

2178
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:31,420
Well, how about the UK Loki with Dark Soccer not being here?

2179
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:43,580
Uh, we have Just Cause 4 coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Override Mech City Brawl on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Gear Club Unlimited 2 on the Switch,

2180
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:55,260
The Council Complete Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Hellblade Sensua's Sacrifice on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

2181
01:49:55,980 --> 01:50:06,140
Persona 3 and 5, The Endless Night Collection, Persona 3, Dancing in the Moonlight, and Persona 5, Dancing in the Starlight, all on PlayStation 4.

2182
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,740
Why do you have Gear Club Unlimited listed twice?

2183
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:16,540
Whatever, they're releasing it twice in the same day, so that's the thing.

2184
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:26,940
Then, of course, I know you're going to be, um, super excited about this, but of course they have the Fallout 76 merchandise, which is releasing as well.

2185
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:35,340
And the PlayStation Classic is coming out, which I think is also coming out over here in North America as well next week, but it's not technically a game release.

2186
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:43,980
Uh, Jagged Alliance Rage on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the Switch,

2187
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:52,460
Hello Neighbor Hide and Seek on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch, Subnautica on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

2188
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:59,980
and finally, we have the GameCube accessory for the Switch, and that is coming out, I'm assuming, as well, over here.

2189
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:06,060
But, hey, I don't normally list accessories, but game does, apparently.

2190
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:07,020
Alright, fair enough.

2191
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:11,660
Alright, um, this is the part of the show where we would open up the mailbag!

2192
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:20,300
If we had any emails. Of course, we didn't get any this week, but you can always send in more emails to participate at orangelandrater.com,

2193
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:25,900
and Loki, since we didn't get any emails this week, uh, let's talk about RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 4.

2194
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:27,900
Okay, I have no idea.

2195
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:32,380
Oh, you don't know? Okay, so, here's the thing. Kind of a controversial move for All-Stars.

2196
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:37,420
They're bringing two queens back from All-Stars 1, but here's the thing, Loki.

2197
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:43,820
All-Stars 1 was a flop, because what they did, they were only budgeted for six episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race.

2198
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:47,500
Like, I don't know who budgets the six. Like, this isn't the UK. Our seasons are much longer.

2199
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:51,260
It's like they're, like, budgeting for canvas bags, and then they make nylon bags.

2200
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:57,500
Exactly. That's what, that's, that's perfect. RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 1 was a nylon bag.

2201
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:03,260
RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 2 was a canvas bag. So the big, the big, uh, controversy was that they,

2202
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:09,340
they paired up queens. So it was that they had, had to have charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent,

2203
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:12,940
and synergy, because they were working in teams.

2204
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:16,780
Synergy? What is this? Fucking, uh, Pacific Rim or something?

2205
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:20,300
There's, there's a joke there with the acronym, Loki. Just think about it for a minute. Anyway.

2206
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:24,060
So, uh, anyway, so they were playing in teams, and so it caused, like, all sorts of, like,

2207
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:28,540
weird shit to happen. So one of the teams, Latrilla, which is Latrice Royale. You heard

2208
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:33,340
of Latrice Royale? She's great. And, uh, get those nuts out of my face. That's Latrice Royale.

2209
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:37,260
And Manila Luzon, who, if you ever, if you, you know, if you're gonna watch any lip sync

2210
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:41,820
from RuPaul's Drag Race, watch MacArthur Park, because, uh, Manila Luzon does a great job.

2211
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:45,340
They are coming back. So even though they were in All-Stars 1, they're also gonna be in All-Stars 4,

2212
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:50,060
but now it runs by the new rules, which is where the queens kind of eliminate each other.

2213
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:56,860
They get to pick from the bottom three, whoever wins the lip sync for your legacy, legacy, legacy.

2214
01:52:56,860 --> 01:53:01,820
So anyway, Loki, uh, going into RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 4, I am super rooting for Monique

2215
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:07,500
Hart. She's one of my absolute faves. That was from season 10. Okay. That's like a Monique

2216
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:13,340
Hart thing. Uh, she was in season 10 and she was brilliant, even if she committed the cardinal sin

2217
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:17,740
in my eyes of not knowing the lyrics to a Carly Rae Jepsen song when she had a lip sync for her

2218
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:21,020
life. So I'm hoping she gets her redemption this time. Now she got a little more coin.

2219
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:24,380
She'll be able to make some more outfits and yeah, that's, that's why I'm rooting for in this,

2220
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:28,780
but I think a lot of people probably rooting for like Latrice. She's an insanely popular queen.

2221
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:34,380
Honestly, there really aren't like any bad queens in this. And I'm, I'm very much not a person to

2222
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:39,100
talk down about drag queens. Uh, so even people like Valentina, Farrah Moan, I want to see them

2223
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:44,460
do well. So, all right, there you go. Yes. Thank you in chat. Act F says reading is fundamental,

2224
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:52,220
people also writing. So send your email next week to participate at orange lounge, radio.com,

2225
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:56,380
unless you want Rob Roberts to run down the RuPaul's holiday special, because that is going

2226
01:53:56,380 --> 01:54:02,380
to be a thing in the next week as well. We get super smash brothers. And a RuPaul's drag race

2227
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:07,660
holiday special in the same day, like December 7th is too much to handle. I'm just saying,

2228
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:13,580
all right, let's get into some more gaming news Loki. And so this is kind of just an

2229
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:20,460
evanability, I guess, basically. So with all these loot box controversies going on, and of course,

2230
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:27,100
we have overseas, you know, where the Belgium government has cracked down on loot boxes,

2231
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:33,820
and this whole report that came out of the UK, I believe, talking about gambling and

2232
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:39,180
young children getting into gambling, thanks to you, you know, the loot boxes being kind of

2233
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:47,500
very similar. So now, that all leads to this, where the Federal Trade Commission has said that

2234
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:55,100
they're going to be investigating loot boxes, regarding, you know, how they affect, you know,

2235
01:54:55,100 --> 01:55:01,420
children and gambling, and whether this is something that should be regulated like gambling.

2236
01:55:01,420 --> 01:55:11,100
So according to, I guess, they had Senator Maggie Hassan, who apparently spoke out about

2237
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:18,860
loot boxes, and I guess the FTC chairman, Joseph Simmons, they addressed, you know,

2238
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:23,740
I guess everybody to basically let them know, hey, this is something we're gonna be looking into,

2239
01:55:23,740 --> 01:55:27,260
because, you know, like those reports that came out of the Great Britain's Gambling Commission,

2240
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:32,780
they said, you know, given that the seriousness of the issue, I think it's time for the FTC to

2241
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:37,180
investigate these mechanisms to ensure that children are being adequately protected to,

2242
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:41,980
and to educate parents about potential addiction or other negative impacts of these games.

2243
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:46,780
And then they said, would you commit, you know, Hassan said, would you commit to undertaking this

2244
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:51,820
project and keeping this committee informed about it? And they said, yes. And they didn't really go

2245
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:54,540
into any additional details on what they're gonna do, but it is something that they're gonna be

2246
01:55:54,540 --> 01:56:00,300
looking at. And I can imagine not so good for the gaming industry because, you know, they've

2247
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:05,180
been kind of getting away with a lot. And of course, you know, the ESA came out against this

2248
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:11,500
saying, you know, hey, they're not gambling and this is not, you know, this, whatever, but you

2249
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:18,140
know what, it's, it's either- Now would be a good time to just let the loot box thing go, y'all.

2250
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:22,540
Now would be a good time. Well, the problem is like, they just, you know-

2251
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:27,020
Unless you're a free to play mobile game, I kind of, I kind of think when the game is free to play,

2252
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:30,940
then all bets are on. That's a pun. All bets are on, yeah.

2253
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:35,820
But like, look at like Fallout 76 again, you know, you have a $60 game that's broken as shit,

2254
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:39,020
and then they're still trying to sell microtransactions on top of all this stuff.

2255
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:45,260
That's not necessarily a loot box, but with the whole thing, and one of the thoughts I heard

2256
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:51,100
online was that the way that they designed their leveling system with the card, basically you

2257
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:55,980
unlock like a card pack in like bubblegum, it's almost like, you know, trading cards,

2258
01:56:55,980 --> 01:57:04,700
and each of the special cards add different perks to your abilities based on which ones you use at

2259
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:09,900
a time, but they're all randomized and sometimes you get duplicates. And they said that the way

2260
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:16,220
that that's designed is almost like they were going to monetize that system as a loot box,

2261
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:21,500
but then decided not to at the, you know, in the end. But it's something that if like,

2262
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:26,860
say for example, Fallout 76 just did very, very, very poorly and just kept, you know,

2263
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:32,060
sales not working out, maybe the game goes free to play, and then that could be something that

2264
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:37,340
they monetize on top of it. Interesting perspective from one of our listeners

2265
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:41,180
in chat, because this is a show where every gamer has a voice over at live.vognetwork.com.

2266
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:44,220
Kaijuto said, I'm going to have to get that out. You know how hard that's going to be to get that

2267
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:47,900
out of my vocabulary? When I keep saying live.vognetwork.com, I'm going to have to say,

2268
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:53,100
yeah, Twitch TV over to it. Anyway, that's going to be the hardest part about the transition is

2269
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:57,260
Twitch chat room. I know it's going to be different. All right. Anyway,

2270
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:02,300
but for now it's still a big sign that says, say Twitch, not live. I'm going to need that

2271
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:07,420
like big reminder. Don't fuck up, Rob. Anyway, Kaijuto says dump the loot boxes. It's not

2272
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:12,620
gambling. It's just a con job. Gambling would be spending money to win money. I believe getting

2273
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:19,020
prizes for money is like the carnival. That's not gambling, but it is some call that like the

2274
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:23,660
ticket spitters at like Chuck E Cheese or whatever you want, Dave and Busters. Some people call that

2275
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:29,020
gambling for kids. Well, it's basically, it's not that it's actual gambling, but the, I mean,

2276
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:36,060
sometimes it can be so like in, in the, when you're talking about like, you know, um, skins

2277
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:40,940
in like counter strike go, for example, when you could be able to turn those around and sell them

2278
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:46,460
for real money, you know, that is actually kind of gambling because you you're getting something

2279
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:51,100
that's worth something that you can sell for something, um, and actually make real money

2280
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:55,740
off of. Whereas like a lot of the loot boxes, that's kind of how they've skirted around it

2281
01:58:55,740 --> 01:59:03,100
before is because it's not technically gambling, but you know, the chance of getting things like

2282
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:08,940
that in the, the draw to like, Oh, maybe I'll get something, you know, good this time. Or they kind

2283
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:13,740
of tease you with, Oh, you got a rare item or something like that. It still gives you the same,

2284
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:20,860
your body goes through the same kind of chemical, um, changes that you would with like gambling,

2285
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:26,140
where you still feel that like impulse to keep doing it, keep playing it. And so it's not that

2286
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:30,940
you necessarily get a reward. I don't know anything about that says the guy who spent

2287
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:37,900
an undetermined amount of money in Vegas. I broke even, okay. I, I won like $120 the first night.

2288
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:43,340
I'm not even kidding. I won. And then I, I broke even it's just, it's like, you know, um,

2289
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:47,260
it's just a lot of things. There's a lot of things that could be for chance, you know,

2290
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:53,660
like these skin packs and stuff and, and they can say all they want about how, Oh, it's not gambling.

2291
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:56,700
It's not gambling. It's not gambling, but there's people that are like, you know,

2292
01:59:56,700 --> 02:00:02,540
I've spent thousands of dollars on this because I can't stop doing this. Or, you know, I have

2293
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:07,420
a problem with gambling and I play games to get away from gambling. And then this is,

2294
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:12,220
you know, trying to bring me back into it. I feel the same urge that I had when I was gambling

2295
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:17,180
that I do now with these loot boxes, there are people that have said that this is what they do

2296
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:22,140
as an escape is they play games and now it's coming back. I would love to invite like a

2297
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:27,500
psychologist or psychiatrist or, or some therapist, somebody who kind of knows maybe a little more

2298
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:32,780
about these types of issues, like the gambling addiction issues, who, who is savvy enough to

2299
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:36,860
know what gaming loot boxes are and things to really kind of get into that side of the issue.

2300
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:40,460
I bet that'd be fascinating to really kind of, cause like all that stuff you're talking about,

2301
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:45,500
I totally whole thing is a scam. It's a scam. If it was not a scam, it would just be,

2302
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:49,740
you pay X amount of money for X item. And that's it. The whole reason that there's

2303
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:53,180
chance is because there's a chance that you're not going to get what you want.

2304
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:57,500
And they know what chance that is because they set the up and they know what the odds are,

2305
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,380
but they're not telling me they just need to be transparent with the odds. And that's how

2306
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:05,500
we're going to get through this whole thing. Or just get rid of him. All right. All right.

2307
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:12,060
Anyhow, uh, moving on to, uh, a new TV series that is kind of based on gaming. And this is

2308
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:17,100
very interesting because the TV series that has been optioned by legendary, which, you know,

2309
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:21,260
they make some pretty big movies or legendary pictures. You see that logo. They've been a lot

2310
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:26,860
of good stuff. Um, there for television, not a movie, but television has opted a limited

2311
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:32,940
series based on console wars. This was a book that talked about Sega and Nintendo in the 90s,

2312
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:37,100
which a lot of y'all lived, right? A lot of y'all have feelings on this.

2313
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:43,660
Well, I used to know, uh, I was, uh, colleagues, I guess, with, um, a guy who he works for an

2314
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:49,340
independent, um, distributor. Now he used to do like a bunch of these, um, smaller games, like,

2315
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:55,900
um, one of the games he was distributing in the U S and like Mexico area was, um, the farming

2316
02:01:55,900 --> 02:02:01,340
simulator games and that kind of stuff. But he originally worked for Sega and he worked during

2317
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:10,620
their launch for, I think it was the Genesis or it was the Genesis or the dream casters.

2318
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:15,020
Some, some, I think it was the Genesis and he was telling us stories about like how they were

2319
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:19,660
just marketing plans and stuff like that. And some of those stories are really interesting,

2320
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:24,460
just like how, you know, by the seat of their pants type of stuff they were doing. So

2321
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:26,380
I would be very interested in seeing something like that.

2322
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:33,980
Now, some of the names behind this effort, uh, this is point gray pictures. They make a show on

2323
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:38,220
AMC called preacher. It's kind of a big show. You probably heard of that one. Uh, and some of the

2324
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:43,100
names at point gray, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver, Seth Rogan, believe it or not one of the names

2325
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:47,260
there. So, uh, not to say that like Seth Rogan is going to star in this or anything, cause I don't

2326
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:51,660
even know if it would be like more documentary style or if it's going to be like fiction,

2327
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:55,580
you know, that kind of portrays, you know, cause we've seen that before. We've seen fictional

2328
02:02:55,580 --> 02:03:01,020
accounts of big historical kind of things like, you know, in a, in a movie such as like my

2329
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:05,580
favorite historically accurate film, Abraham Lincoln, vampire hunter, right. Which is based

2330
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:09,980
on a book. Maybe not so much that, but like, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. When we were looking

2331
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:15,580
to watch stuff, they had one, it was about like, um, it was Michael Keaton in that, like, um,

2332
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:20,620
the McDonald, like the origin, like McDonald's or something like that. I forget what that was

2333
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:25,580
called. There's some new movie coming out where, uh, uh, uh, Batman guy, why can't, oh my God,

2334
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:30,380
Christian Bale, right? Yeah. Who, who, who plays Batman? Like give me about my son,

2335
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:34,460
but it's more like, you know, he's got that voice. So Christian Bale is playing Dick Cheney in some

2336
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:39,260
movie. It's kind of like that, like that kind of thing. Yeah. Right. So anyway, so we don't know,

2337
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:42,140
we don't know if it's fiction or documentary or where the hell we're going, they're going with

2338
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:46,940
it, but we'll see. Uh, also the producers behind the movie annihilation, which I don't think was

2339
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:50,540
a huge hit at the box office, but people that saw it, I thought enjoyed it. So I don't know,

2340
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:54,380
but anyway, uh, some of the producers there on this as well. So it'll be interesting to see what

2341
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:58,380
comes to this, you know, um, a lot of television and, you know, this is a topic that's probably

2342
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:05,900
much bigger than OLR. Um, a lot of, um, uh, television is getting more cinematic, you know,

2343
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:11,740
and I think a lot of this was really, um, kind of summed up when, remember the Twin Peaks limited

2344
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:15,900
series from last year, which I was a huge fan of. That's no secret, right? Cause I love, uh,

2345
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:20,460
Twin Peaks. I loved it back in the day and I was so happy at the new one, but that, that series

2346
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:25,740
ended up on like a French best film list and it ended up somewhere else as a best film list too.

2347
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:30,860
And people were like, but it's not a movie, it's a TV show. But at the same time, it was actually

2348
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:39,020
one giant script that was simply cut into episodes to be aired on TV. So those lines between what is

2349
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:44,540
film, what is television are getting more and more blurred as I think this streaming culture

2350
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:50,620
is causing more and more cinematic television to be produced. It's really fascinating. Yeah. Yeah.

2351
02:04:50,620 --> 02:04:54,780
So anyway, that, that is really a discussion for another show, but it's just, you know,

2352
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:58,060
I think it kind of just plays into all that. Cause I think that kind of shows you that this,

2353
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:01,980
this is probably something that's going to be built for one of the streaming platforms for sure.

2354
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:09,180
So we'll see anyhow. Um, moving on Loki. All right. So one game that did start off like

2355
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:15,260
fallout 76, but is now much better. No man's sky has yet another update that they, um,

2356
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:22,220
released relatively, uh, recently, I think it was actually not too long ago. They had, um,

2357
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:30,300
kind of like a community update. So with it, um, they had these new looks like,

2358
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:37,660
are these, uh, communication stations where you can send messages, I think across,

2359
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:41,660
I don't know if it's across like the galaxy or whatever, but they had like,

2360
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:46,460
you can actually do audio messages as well. I think hopefully these communication modules

2361
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:54,380
aren't going to be, um, all trash. Fuck you asshole. Whoever gets this. Um,

2362
02:05:55,500 --> 02:06:00,060
but they, of course, you know, new updates, different plant life that they added in the game.

2363
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:06,460
Um, yeah, but I like all these new updates. I really need to go back and play this. I've

2364
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:11,420
actually, I was looking at almost getting on PC again. And I want to go back into it for the

2365
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:15,580
third time. Cause you know, I was Bobby black Wolf and I, when we were getting more into streaming,

2366
02:06:15,580 --> 02:06:19,500
we're kind of going back and forth on the no man's sky remake. And we were like, what happens if I

2367
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:22,620
build a base on this world and you build a base here and we're kind of like figuring all that out.

2368
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:26,460
And now it's like, even since then. So that kind of died off. Cause we just kind of, I don't know,

2369
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:29,980
all too many other games came out cause it was that time of year. And now it's like, shit,

2370
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:34,460
they're giving us more reasons to go back and look again. But I love it. I love it. This is what

2371
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:39,980
a game should be. It was the visions. That's what it was. So they have this event, a community event.

2372
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:48,060
They went along with that as well. And so basically you're allowing, um, people to like share

2373
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:52,620
messages across the galaxy and stuff. Oh cool. So we can, we can have like a VOG community.

2374
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:57,100
Maybe. I don't know exactly how it works. If you, if it's like the, you can like leave behind,

2375
02:06:57,100 --> 02:07:02,140
like say like you go to someone's planet and then leave a message or if it actually you can kind of

2376
02:07:02,140 --> 02:07:06,060
already do that. If I'm not mistaken, you could make like a, well, you could put a message at

2377
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:09,820
your base. So you'd like build a base and have a message there. And I thought you could leave like

2378
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:16,140
a sign that had a message. I mean, my memory's a little sketchy. Maybe. Yeah. So interesting.

2379
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:22,780
I'd be into that. That'd be cool. All right. Uh, anyhow, um, games that are also getting updates,

2380
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:27,980
but not for much longer. Splatoon 2, shout out to Flaco Jones. Cause I know he loves Splatoon

2381
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:33,900
2 and does a lot of streams. Uh, sadly though, Splatoon 2 is looking at its last content update,

2382
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:37,580
but I mean, it's been like a year and a half since Splatoon 2 came out and they've been doing

2383
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:43,900
regular updates. So it had to end sometime. So anyway, version 4.3.0, uh, is coming out on

2384
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:48,540
December 5th and, uh, it's not like the biggest update in the world, but they are going to be

2385
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:53,820
doing, uh, a new bomb defense up DX, which is, I guess, a replacement for the bomb defense up

2386
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:57,820
and cold blooded abilities. Um, so yeah, there's just, you know, they're going to have some new

2387
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:02,780
gear abilities and a few new weapons as well, but don't look at for any like gigantic stuff.

2388
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:06,380
Um, but there is something called main power up as well, which will allow you to enhance

2389
02:08:06,380 --> 02:08:11,580
the performance of your main weapon. It will vary considerably from weapon to weapon. Um,

2390
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:15,100
there'll also be, uh, just, you know, some different looking weapons and stuff that you

2391
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:19,900
can kind of check out in the trailer if you want. Uh, now, even though December 5th is the last

2392
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:27,580
major update, Nintendo has said that SplatFests and balance updates will continue until July

2393
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:31,900
next year. So if there's any, you know, major issues, they will still continue to fix those,

2394
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:37,740
do the balance tweaking and all that stuff. And, um, again, SplatFests will live on through July.

2395
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:41,420
Hmm. Just in time for them to announce a Splatoon 3 at E3.

2396
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:45,020
Please don't. Don't make it. Don't. No, seriously. Don't make a third game of that.

2397
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:49,180
And not like other sequels for games that we need.

2398
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:53,100
I don't know. I don't know if I agree with you. I'm okay with that. If they, if they decide

2399
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:58,540
they're going to do a Splatoon 3 and they make it a new thing, I don't, it might be just, I don't

2400
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:04,220
see how they would have developed one that fast, but you know, if they have a Splatoon 3, that's a

2401
02:09:04,220 --> 02:09:11,180
new rich experience that offers some new stuff and new modes and things I'd be for it. I re I

2402
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:16,060
remember a day and age Loki when like every other year you'd get some new game in a franchise or

2403
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:21,180
shit. If you're Assassin's Creed, you get it every year. So if, you know, if Madden, a sports game

2404
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:26,220
can do a new fucking thing every year, Splatoon, I think could even go further and give some

2405
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:29,980
remarkable, not just roster updates, but remarkable content things and do that.

2406
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:35,020
I would be all for Splatoon 3 if it's worth it. You know, again, I, I just, I don't want,

2407
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:38,620
I don't want them just to make a Splatoon 3 for the sake of having something new to sell,

2408
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:42,860
but if they make it its own little thing, I'd be all for that. An Act Defton chat,

2409
02:09:42,860 --> 02:09:49,020
who's also a big fan of Splatoon says Splatoon 3, yes, please. Bobby Blackwell says,

2410
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:55,740
I would be for it, but they did not name Splatoon 2, Spla 2n, you know, that spelling,

2411
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:58,380
and therefore they no longer get the right to make sequels.

2412
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:06,620
Fine. I, you know, and I would be okay if maybe like the Splatoon team did a new concept. I bet

2413
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:09,980
a lot of Splatoon fans would be totally okay with that. What would you say about that, Loki?

2414
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:14,780
Like a different type of competitive game. That's just that creative team.

2415
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:16,460
I'm fine with that.

2416
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:21,020
Yeah. Cause they, they took a, a, a kill, kill, die, die shooter and made it about paint.

2417
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:25,740
They made it a family fun friend game. I, I, I, I'd give them that chance on, you know, other

2418
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:31,660
types of competitive genres. Why not? Maybe like a hero, hero battle or something. Who knows?

2419
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:37,900
Anyway. All right. Uh, vidpower in chat suggests for a new title, three splat, three furious. All

2420
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:42,620
right. You guys calm down. All right. Few more stories for you guys. Then we're going to open

2421
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:46,300
up the Skype line at orange lounge radio. All one word, but first Loki.

2422
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:54,380
So there was a developer that was, um, goes by the name thin matrix and they've been working on

2423
02:10:54,380 --> 02:11:01,260
a game called the coolinox for the last three years or so, uh, almost three years. And what's

2424
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:08,780
kind of unique about them is that they were live blogging the whole process, um, each week,

2425
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:18,140
you know, since February 19, 2016 and now November or as of earlier this, um, last month,

2426
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:26,380
the game has been released. So now, uh, you can pick up a coolinox. It's a like a life simulation

2427
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:31,420
game to basically create your own like biomes and you have different animals and stuff that

2428
02:11:31,420 --> 02:11:36,380
kind of exist in there and you kind of have to manage everything to make sure that, you know,

2429
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:42,140
the world is, um, you're cultivating and, um, shaping the world as you like. So it's kind of

2430
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:46,940
cool. Um, the different things in there, but I was watching some of the live blogs that he did, um,

2431
02:11:47,820 --> 02:11:52,060
talking about like some of the gameplay tweaks and different bugs that they ran into,

2432
02:11:52,060 --> 02:11:56,140
which is kind of fun, even, especially just right before release, just adding new features

2433
02:11:56,140 --> 02:12:03,020
and, um, it's very like, even just the videos were very relaxing. The game itself is like a

2434
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:08,300
very relaxing game. It's only like 10 bucks too. So is, does reading that stuff, uh, um, kind of

2435
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:11,580
help motivate you a little bit when you kind of see the trials and tribulations that our

2436
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:17,260
developers go through? Um, I've only watched like a video or so of that. I'm, I am like,

2437
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:24,060
I want to be motivated to do stuff. Um, I even was looking at, but it's hard. Well, no, it is,

2438
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:31,020
it, it's just like trying to like, there was another, um, like I w I read another,

2439
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:34,060
like, I don't know if it was, I didn't really read it. I watched it. It was like a,

2440
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:40,380
I don't remember which developer was, it was some developer of an indie game that I'd recognized.

2441
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:47,580
And he was talking about how like six, it's like six games you should program to get into the

2442
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:53,580
whole game dev cycle thing. So they basically said like, you do Tetris and then you do, um,

2443
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:59,900
it was like asteroids, Arkanoid. Um, I know the last one was super Mario brothers.

2444
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:04,940
And then, um, I'm trying to remember the other couple of games that they had in there as well,

2445
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:08,620
but it's basically, you know, cause each one teaches you something different. Plus finishing

2446
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:16,540
stuff is a good idea, but I don't know. Just do it. Just, just go remake a game.

2447
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:21,020
Yeah. And Bobby black Wolf and chat says, I remember telling Loki this. He said,

2448
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:25,900
fuck that. I don't have time for that. Bobby just wants to rub it in a little bit

2449
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:28,060
that you should have listened to him. And I don't, that's a kind of the,

2450
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:32,780
that's the joke. That's kind of like after I saw that and started thinking about it for a little

2451
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:36,860
bit, I'm like, I don't have time. I don't have time for one game, let alone like six games.

2452
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:42,300
Uh, speaking of indie game development, I just want to shout out again, why YR and his game

2453
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:46,780
falling plus, which I was dumb and I left out of my gaming week. Although to be fair, we spent an

2454
02:13:46,780 --> 02:13:50,860
awful lot of time pimping falling plus last week, but I do want to pivot one more time and say,

2455
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:55,180
it is released on steam. And I hope some of you guys will spend the two bucks, which I think

2456
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:59,500
might still be a dollar 50. I don't know how much for longer. Uh, but go spend the two bucks and

2457
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:04,540
check it out because, uh, yeah, I actually, I did a live stream of playing falling plus and, um,

2458
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:07,740
I kind of got the game, like the game, like clicked for me, you know what it was? I had

2459
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:11,020
to watch somebody else play it. So when I watched Bobby play it, I was like, Oh,

2460
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:14,700
I get it. Like, cause when I originally played it on Xbox 360, I don't think I knew what the

2461
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:17,900
hell I was doing, but this time, like watching Bobby play it, I was like, Oh, okay. I kind of

2462
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:22,860
understand a little more. So now I played it. And for at least a few minutes, Loki,

2463
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:27,500
I had the world record in the single-player mode because Bobby said it. And then I was like, well,

2464
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:31,340
we can't have this. So I did a live stream that was basically me beating Bobby's record.

2465
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:35,420
And that's why I called it. And it took me a little bit, but I finally got around to doing it.

2466
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:39,580
Um, and then here's what happens. So the minute I get that score, like, I think I stopped the

2467
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:44,220
stream and like two minutes later, I see my little steam pop up orange. Right. Is playing falling

2468
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:49,660
plus. And I'm like, I know what he's doing. I fucking know what that guy's doing. And sure

2469
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:54,860
enough, like a couple hours later, orange, right. Just like fucking annihilated us out of the water

2470
02:14:54,860 --> 02:15:00,380
with his ice score, but you earned it. Props to you slow clap. But anyway, no, all that joking

2471
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:05,100
aside. Um, one thing that I've kind of started doing and falling plus that actually like helped

2472
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:09,980
me a lot is I've tried to switch from using the controller. I actually find when I use the

2473
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:15,340
keyboard, I can do those trick shots a lot better. My timing is more precise because the

2474
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:25,100
Xbox 360 controller is, you know, crap. I don't want to say it's crap, but it's not MLG falling

2475
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:30,700
plus material. It's competent to get you through the game and enjoy the game and be happy with what

2476
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:35,820
you spent on it. But the keyboard is how I'm going to get MLG pro that's that is how I will

2477
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:41,900
destroy orange, right. Hopefully at some point and take my rightful place back on the top of

2478
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:46,780
the board was going to be hard. So, cause now I'm having to like reteach my muscle memory because,

2479
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:51,340
you know, like the, the kicking is one button, the jumping is another and the throwing is another.

2480
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:55,260
And it's like, Oh, well, I stopped there from which one was the throwing button. And you know,

2481
02:15:55,260 --> 02:16:00,380
I'm having to reteach my muscle memory, but it's fun. Like I'm, I'm into it. Like,

2482
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:03,260
I hate to be that guy, but I'm going to close on this thought.

2483
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:12,460
Y Y R cause I know you're listening like seriously switch port, please. Like I really hate to be that

2484
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:18,060
son of a bitch, but like I would play this game portable mode, like so fast. Like this was,

2485
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:22,620
this is like the perfect type of like lay in bed and play for like 10 minutes for you to sleep

2486
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:28,300
type of thing. So we need, we need like a Y Y arcade on switch. That's Oh my God. Oh my God.

2487
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:36,860
Just made it up. Y Y arcade that has like snake three 60 and, and, and pixels shits,

2488
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:40,540
although they'll have to rename it, but you know, uh, and all this, all these little games

2489
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:45,340
and falling on switch. I'm brilliant. And I'm probably getting hate mail from all

2490
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:50,460
we are right now for putting that out there in the universe. Make your own thing.

2491
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:57,820
All right. All right. And Y Y R does say in chat that, uh, his offer does remain

2492
02:16:57,820 --> 02:17:02,380
open from last episode. So if you listened to last week, can't hint, uh, you'll know,

2493
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:07,180
uh, what I'm talking about. All right. Y Y R says, if the numbers are good enough,

2494
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:12,780
I will totally go to switch at a boy, at a boy, make a, make a bank for it by making a pay,

2495
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:17,420
put the coin where the mouth is at a boy. All right. Sell some copies, buy, buy copies for

2496
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:24,380
your friends this holiday season. All right. One more story for you guys, uh, talking about

2497
02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:28,780
not so indie game development, but a smaller game, but a long running game.

2498
02:17:29,580 --> 02:17:35,420
And y'all know, this is one of my favorite franchises, uh, clue or Cluedo as it's called

2499
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:40,940
overseas. But here is a big board game named clue that they turned into a movie with Tim Curry

2500
02:17:40,940 --> 02:17:44,860
in the eighties. You might've heard of it. So anyhow, a clue, the classic board game from

2501
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:49,580
Hasbro is coming to the Nintendo switch. So Hasbro will bring games to the switch,

2502
02:17:49,580 --> 02:17:53,740
but to be fair, I think it's coming out on like mobile phones and all that as well.

2503
02:17:53,740 --> 02:17:58,540
Uh, so it's called clue or Cluedo, depending on where you live, the classic mystery game,

2504
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:03,100
uh, which actually is already out of mobile devices and steam. And it will soon be getting

2505
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:07,820
a release on Nintendo console, the switch. Uh, there's a little announcement trailer with all

2506
02:18:07,820 --> 02:18:11,900
the news and it, it, it kind of looked like the board game. Like it didn't look like they really

2507
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:15,500
changed it. Like if you've ever played the super Nintendo version of clue,

2508
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:19,900
which was the same as the Genesis version of clue, and I kind of love that adaptation,

2509
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:24,940
but they kind of changed the board game a lot for that. Um, so I think they, they, they kind of keep

2510
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:28,540
this a little more pure to the board game, but it's kind of neat because they have like the

2511
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:33,420
characters in different looks that you can kind of play as. And so they found some ways to kind of

2512
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:37,660
like nickel and dime you I'm sure, but also, you know, just make the game more customizable. So I

2513
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:41,660
think it's kind of cute. So I just thought it was cool that they are making clue cause I love clue.

2514
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:46,140
It's a fun board game. So it's cool that it's coming out for the switch. So kaiju doing chat

2515
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:51,740
says I have clue on my phone. It's dope. They also have clue, cool themes, but it's expensive.

2516
02:18:51,740 --> 02:18:55,820
It's like 30 something bucks to get all the stuff in the game. Well, unfortunately kaiju

2517
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:59,340
don't ain't nothing for free, but I wonder if you buy it on switch, would you just get all

2518
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:05,020
that stuff unlocked? I bet you would. Cause I doubt it's free to play on switch. So I don't know.

2519
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:09,100
We'll see. Make it free to play on switch. Yeah. All right. Uh, orange lounge radio,

2520
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:14,940
all one word on Skype. The Skype line is open and you can go ahead and give us a call. Orange

2521
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:19,500
launch radio, all one word on Skype. Um, as far as I know, even with the switch in the future,

2522
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:24,140
we're going to be holding onto Skype for a little while, uh, because now I won't be running on, uh,

2523
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:29,740
windows XP anymore, but we'll see. Anyway, uh, the phones are lighting up. Let's get to some calls.

2524
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:33,980
Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on everyone. It's Ron. Hey,

2525
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:38,540
Rama. How you doing? Uh, pretty good. Pretty good. We're also getting ready for the twitch

2526
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:43,820
transition too. I know you guys am a jam session or going through a similar, um, transition. So

2527
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:49,340
I'm excited. I'm excited to see how you guys implement it. Well, we've talked about, you know,

2528
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:54,460
throwing the camera between the different hosts each week or figure out a way to do a remote

2529
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:59,500
access or have like icon, like icons in a different host and it lights up. Well,

2530
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:03,500
we're going to figure something out. Yeah. You guys got it. Still got a little time. If nothing

2531
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:07,580
else, have a static image in your voices and they'll still be people to turn up.

2532
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:15,340
Well, yeah, that's speaking up. I already got the work going. So pretty much our Twitch page is up.

2533
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:24,060
I have like the little icon icon. They're saying we are going to go on live. Um, I believe January

2534
02:20:24,060 --> 02:20:29,900
15th. Yeah. That sounds about right. Based on some other timeframes I haven't been as public about,

2535
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:35,500
but I guess I could say now, um, the radio feed is, is targeted for closure in January next year.

2536
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:40,780
So, so Rama is trying to get in there before there is no radio feed anymore. Yes, yes, yes.

2537
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:47,820
But yeah, I mean, I'm really excited to see the new show or, you know, hear it most of all,

2538
02:20:47,820 --> 02:20:54,780
but you know, we have a couple other people I know who do a Twitch show similar to us.

2539
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:59,100
I've been watching them just kind of taking notes and so forth. It's honestly not a bad idea.

2540
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:03,900
That's great. I mean, I, I, I'm not trying to, you know,

2541
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:07,020
blow smoke up your ass, but I kind of learned from one of the best out there.

2542
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:14,540
Stop. Flattery will get you everywhere. So what's on your mind? I know you didn't just call in to

2543
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:20,300
kiss my ass. Although if you did like great, but, uh, what's on your mind tonight? I want to talk

2544
02:21:20,300 --> 02:21:28,380
about fallout 76. Oh boy. First off, did you buy it? No. Okay. Okay. So I just want that to be

2545
02:21:28,380 --> 02:21:32,380
clear up front. All right. What's your thoughts on fall out 76? I mean, if I really wanted the

2546
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:36,860
game, I would have, I would have got a subscription to elder scrolls online, just saying. All right.

2547
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:43,900
But, um, I posted this in the chat, so it probably got caught up in the scroll, but when I got up

2548
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:50,540
today, I got a message from a friend of mine and he sent me a picture. Now in this picture is a

2549
02:21:50,620 --> 02:22:00,540
fully customizable, fully skinned fallout 76 Xbox one X along with a skin to controller and swag for

2550
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:06,780
one of the, uh, Bethesda influencers. So I sat here and I started doing some thinking. Now I used

2551
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:12,700
to sell shirts for a living, so I could tell you the initial cost, how, you know, printing a shirt

2552
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:26,380
and resell it for now a nylon bag will run you about $12 wholesale eight, a nylon bag will run

2553
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:37,100
you about, I mean a canvas bag running about $16 sale $9 give or take. Now will you buy in bulk?

2554
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:45,340
It gets cheaper. So let's say for the sake of the argument, 1000 pre-orders for 76 collections

2555
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:56,540
edition for this instead of costing Bethesda $9 a bag that will probably cost them. I say maybe

2556
02:22:56,540 --> 02:23:05,260
$7 a bag, $7,000 right now, all of this is coming out of their, uh, marketing budget for the game.

2557
02:23:05,980 --> 02:23:10,460
Let's say it's about 10 grand. I'm just throwing numbers out there. It could be way more than that,

2558
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:16,780
but all they're doing for the influencers that's taken out from the budget. Now the brand new fancy

2559
02:23:16,780 --> 02:23:21,900
canvas bags that they're giving out, I could tell you that's probably gonna run you about $20. I

2560
02:23:21,900 --> 02:23:29,340
mean, I get that. Now the fact that they're handing out to these influencers fully skinned

2561
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:37,420
Xbox One X consoles and probably PlayStation 4 pro consoles as well. You're going to be very

2562
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:42,620
minimal discount from the manufacturer on these consoles and then skinny it on top.

2563
02:23:42,620 --> 02:23:51,180
So you're looking at maybe $400 for the pro and $500 for the X and that's with all the

2564
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:56,620
skinning and all of that. That's very typical. I mean, for the influencers to get like a special

2565
02:23:56,620 --> 02:24:01,420
console and things like that to show off, you know, that's a common trend. That's a trend that

2566
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:06,380
goes way back. Somebody you and I both know that may or may not be listening to this show right

2567
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:09,820
now has received something like that from a company in the past and I'll let them out

2568
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:16,220
themselves if they want, but, um, yeah. So, uh, that's not like an uncommon type of thing to,

2569
02:24:16,220 --> 02:24:21,820
you know, again, it's just, it's like how Loki, you worked in video distribution. You got free

2570
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:27,340
movies all the time. Yep. And I bet you got stuff on top of that too. Like, you know, uh,

2571
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:32,460
gift cards or, you know, other things to incentivize your sales. Right TVs, TV, you got

2572
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:37,980
a TV. That's right. You fucking got a TV once I remember that I've gotten. Yeah. HGTV have gotten,

2573
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:43,820
but yeah, that was, yeah. I mean, they just did that. So it's like that because you know what,

2574
02:24:43,820 --> 02:24:49,260
I mean, sure that stuff costs money, but it's all about, because in this case, Loki was pushing

2575
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:53,980
sales, you know, and if he, you know, surely remembers this TV, he's going to remember this

2576
02:24:53,980 --> 02:24:57,660
movie in the studio and probably be a little more incentive. That was a little bit different. It

2577
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:01,340
wasn't necessarily like we're doing this. So you, I mean, I guess it is like sell stuff,

2578
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:05,740
but it was more of like, if you sell this, we just, and they have money. It's basically that

2579
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:09,820
the company has money that they can use. They could either pay you just money, right. Or they

2580
02:25:09,820 --> 02:25:14,540
could buy something to incentivize you. It's, it's all part of their budget, their marketing budget.

2581
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:20,540
Um, but, uh, anyway, my point is, is that maybe Loki was, and in the way influencers are selling

2582
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:26,380
too, you know, whether we like them or not, the reality is many YouTubers have quite a following

2583
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:33,420
with millions of subscribers and $400 to get your product exposed to millions of people is honestly,

2584
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:37,500
it's a drop in the fucking bucket. It really is like, it doesn't, like, it doesn't matter what

2585
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:41,820
they spent on those consoles because like commercials to advertise on Comedy Central

2586
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:46,220
to probably less people than some of these YouTube channels are going to cost way more money.

2587
02:25:46,220 --> 02:25:50,380
So my point is with this, my point is with this, I ain't mad about these special consoles,

2588
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:56,540
these other things that influencers get. What I'm mad about is that this canvas bag that they got

2589
02:25:56,540 --> 02:26:01,580
was kind of that impression of, Oh, this is what you're getting with the professional edition. And

2590
02:26:01,580 --> 02:26:06,460
so people do these unboxing videos of look at all this stuff I got with a professional edition.

2591
02:26:06,460 --> 02:26:11,500
And it has that subtext of, I got this canvas bag and you will too, because they're advertising the

2592
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:15,900
canvas bag, whether they said that explicitly or not, like that's the impression you get.

2593
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:21,900
Whereas with the special PS4s and Xbox 360, a reasonable person knows I'm not getting a fucking

2594
02:26:21,900 --> 02:26:29,180
console, but I was promised a canvas bag. I get that. But the thing is that I'm just

2595
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:33,420
saying this budget, they took care of all the influencers. When they look at the rest of the

2596
02:26:33,420 --> 02:26:39,180
amount of budget, they're like, Oh, fuck, we can't afford the canvas bags. So we'll have to drop down

2597
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:44,780
a dollar and give them the nylon bag. I'm just saying they were probably right about financially

2598
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:50,780
affording it. They just probably didn't budget the marketing budget high enough for that. So

2599
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:56,540
the influencers and the VIPs hit the walk away with the cool swag while everyone who pre-ordered

2600
02:26:56,540 --> 02:27:01,500
just get the short end of the stick. Well, Rama, we're going to bust our butts and work

2601
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:06,620
a little harder and maybe we'll be in that influencers club. We used to be.

2602
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:12,860
But the industry changed and in some ways we changed too early. In some ways we're changing

2603
02:27:12,860 --> 02:27:16,860
too late, but it doesn't matter. It's not about me and free shit. I really don't care. I've been

2604
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:22,460
doing this show for shit for 17 years. No, I shouldn't say for shit because the reward I get

2605
02:27:22,460 --> 02:27:28,140
from it is you guys that fucking show up that send emails. I kid you not. I got, this isn't a

2606
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:32,780
joke. Okay. Or something I'm bringing up for like the sake of hyperbole or something like that.

2607
02:27:33,740 --> 02:27:38,300
I got a message and I'm being slow because I'm actually bringing it up on Twitter right now.

2608
02:27:38,300 --> 02:27:42,060
I got a message on Twitter this week. I'm not going to out the person that said it,

2609
02:27:42,060 --> 02:27:45,820
but I got a message, direct message. So you won't be able to see it online. Hey,

2610
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:49,660
I just want to let you know that you inspired me years ago on Horde house and on orange lounge

2611
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:56,380
radio. Hope you're having an awesome day. That that's why I do this. I don't keep your goddamn

2612
02:27:56,380 --> 02:28:02,300
brand and PlayStation four. That is worth 10 times more. Exactly. One time with anime next

2613
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:06,620
on a Sunday, I'm taking pictures. Somebody recognized me from the podcast and we took

2614
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:12,460
a picture together and I posted on my page. That is the reason why I go out and invest so much

2615
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:19,180
money and doing the show and telling me this is how this is how we do it. I just feel, you know,

2616
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:24,780
I understand you got to take care of, you know, I get that, but don't forget about the rest of

2617
02:28:24,780 --> 02:28:31,340
the squad that love and support your games. That's all I care about. I mean, come on,

2618
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:36,460
because you're looking from somebody who occasionally plays a few games from somebody

2619
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:42,060
who may pick up a collector's edition of a game once or twice a year. And I mean, honestly,

2620
02:28:42,060 --> 02:28:47,900
I have never been the biggest Bethesda fan. I mean, hell, if I want to sit there and play

2621
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:54,540
glitch games, I'll just say, you know, I'll invest that money. But the way, the way they

2622
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:59,340
handle that and the way they handling these, I'm just like, you know, I just have no desire

2623
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:05,740
to purchase another Bethesda game. If it's done by an outside studio and they publish it,

2624
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:11,900
I'm okay with that. That I will do. I'll buy used, but if it's there in house, no,

2625
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:16,060
I'm just going to step back to like, I'm good. I'm good.

2626
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:23,100
Um, you know, I just, Bethesda, I really think is, uh, I don't think they're going to be able to

2627
02:29:23,100 --> 02:29:27,260
live this one down quite so easy. I bet in the next week, we're going to see some type of better

2628
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:32,220
response from Bethesda. We'll see. I, I don't know if that's going to be that they're just going to

2629
02:29:32,220 --> 02:29:40,220
provide canvas bags or that they're going to make up with maybe a game giveaway of some sort. I

2630
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:42,860
don't know. I don't know what Bethesda does to make it right, but they're going to have to do

2631
02:29:42,860 --> 02:29:47,580
something. This is this 500 Adams or whatever. This isn't going to cut it. And to be fair,

2632
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:51,580
this is where, okay. Remember I told you when I started this whole thing, I said,

2633
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:57,340
Rob will try to cut the big company, some slack in the interest of fairness, wherever he can. Right.

2634
02:29:57,340 --> 02:30:01,340
Even though I think this canvas bag stuff is bullshit, but here's what I will give you

2635
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:05,580
this whole 500 Adams and that whole thing, that whole, like what the customer service cost of

2636
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:12,220
nothing. Well, here's the thing. That is probably what that outsourced customer service employee

2637
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:18,780
is empowered to do for somebody. And so, because I bet Bethesda has not come up with an official,

2638
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:23,660
what the fuck are we going to do about this type of situation? So, so what they did in

2639
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:28,380
that interim time was these customer service reps are empowered to give away five bucks.

2640
02:30:28,380 --> 02:30:32,700
So they gave away the 500 Adams that's through their official Twitter account.

2641
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:38,460
That was their response. I, I would even say that that could be all they are empowered to

2642
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:43,020
do until the executives in the boardroom do something better. So maybe I wouldn't

2643
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:48,780
say don't take it because it's garbage and I'm not paying $5 is a shit. It gives you,

2644
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:54,700
I swear to God. And I made the joke before it gives you a door and some succulent plants or

2645
02:30:54,700 --> 02:31:01,820
a beehive hairdo. Anyhow. All right. Uh, I should probably wrap up and try to take more calls,

2646
02:31:01,820 --> 02:31:05,580
but Rama always enjoy to hear from you. Okay. Right back at you. Yeah. Take care, buddy.

2647
02:31:07,580 --> 02:31:12,220
Orange on radio, all one word on Skype. Uh, some folks are talking about kind of like rewards and

2648
02:31:12,220 --> 02:31:15,420
things like that. A lot of very nice things being said about that message. I got, um,

2649
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:20,380
I guess that YYR says that's the sort of message I love to see as a developer as well.

2650
02:31:20,380 --> 02:31:24,220
That's a, that's a great point is that even like if there's an indie game you love,

2651
02:31:24,860 --> 02:31:31,420
like leave a nice review, leave, send an email saying like, I, I love you and I hate you because

2652
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:37,020
I spent all night playing your game and not sleeping. That type of stuff is going to go

2653
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:42,380
a very long way. I bet you anything. I love it. All right. Let's get to another call

2654
02:31:42,380 --> 02:31:46,220
here on the Skype line. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2655
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:51,100
Hey, uh, this is raging eater. Hey raging here. What's on your mind tonight?

2656
02:31:51,820 --> 02:31:58,460
Uh, no, a whole lot. Um, since I just want to get in, since this is going to be last to show on,

2657
02:31:58,460 --> 02:32:06,380
uh, vlog network, you know, before you transition to, uh, no twitch and real quick,

2658
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:11,740
I just have to, I have to correct a few things. Hey, we think the day is December 16th,

2659
02:32:11,740 --> 02:32:16,620
so you actually have one more week. Uh, and that may not be the final day. If I run into technical,

2660
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:20,860
that's, this is why the whole time I've been like, do not fucking hold me to a date. I am trying

2661
02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:26,460
because what I really want rage nater is to be on twitch in 2019. But if I can go, if I can pull

2662
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:30,780
the trigger a few couple of weeks early to work out the kinks and we have some real messy shows

2663
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:35,340
over the holidays, people will forgive us in the Christmas spirit. So that's the, that's the idea.

2664
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:38,300
But the other thing, the other thing is that vog network, and I want to be very clear on this

2665
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:42,140
vog network is not going away. I don't think you, but the way you kind of worded that is

2666
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:47,020
we'll be very clear vog network, still a thing, still working together to promote any podcasts

2667
02:32:47,020 --> 02:32:52,300
and each other. Just, it's just a different delivery mechanism. It's just, instead of,

2668
02:32:52,300 --> 02:32:56,140
uh, coming to you by UPS, it's coming to you by FedEx. That's all.

2669
02:32:56,700 --> 02:33:03,740
All right. Point, point taken. Uh, but anyway, um, since it's that time of year, we're all,

2670
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:09,820
you know, you know, all the, the major holidays are coming up regardless of what religion you

2671
02:33:09,820 --> 02:33:18,940
follow, assuming that you follow religion. Um, I would post a timely, uh, uh, topic, although

2672
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:25,340
it may be a little bit difficult to talk about since this is a live internet and show and a

2673
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:31,340
recorded podcast. You're a girl. You don't know necessarily know who's listening. Uh,

2674
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:40,460
but that being said, now, no, when it comes to gaming and, uh, geek related stuff, so on and

2675
02:33:40,460 --> 02:33:46,540
so forth, uh, you know, like have you taken advantage of, you know, you know, of any big

2676
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:53,020
sales like cyber Monday, uh, black Friday, or are you planning on taking advantage of

2677
02:33:53,020 --> 02:34:01,260
some before Christmas? And I, uh, would you like to drop not so solo hands is, you know, two others,

2678
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:06,540
you know, what you want for Christmas or, well, I know you can't necessarily say what you're going

2679
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:12,460
to give out cause who knows going to know who's listening, but right. Um, so I've gotten really

2680
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:16,620
super into collecting these little mini arcade cabinets lately. And I think I'm going to do a

2681
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:20,140
video for Twitch at some point where I actually show like my look because my collection is getting

2682
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:25,660
kind of impressive, right? Loki is getting pretty big there. So, um, I love more of those, but it's

2683
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:31,900
going to be hard to find out what I need and what I already have because chances are if I need it,

2684
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:37,260
I'm probably tracing it down right now. I will say the new, the new ones in the Walmart collection

2685
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:43,420
are the actual fix at Felix machine. And, uh, cause they, they miniaturize that in that cool.

2686
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:47,500
Jamie has it and I was playing it at her house on Friday. So it's, it's a cute little,

2687
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:52,460
the only thing it's missing is that Ralph doesn't go, I'm going to wreck it. Like that's gone,

2688
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:56,460
unfortunately. Cause they, you know, it runs on crappy hardware, but otherwise it's pretty

2689
02:34:56,460 --> 02:35:00,620
faithful. And then, uh, Ms. Pac-Man. So I'm trying to track those down right now. And I think I need

2690
02:35:00,620 --> 02:35:05,580
a Pac-Man version of the target line, but like how many times do I have to buy fucking Pac-Man?

2691
02:35:05,580 --> 02:35:11,420
I already have it in the Walmart lines. Anyway. Anyway. Uh, I also, I strongly hinted to the

2692
02:35:11,420 --> 02:35:16,700
hubs that I want to get that. And I mentioned this earlier in the show, the $80 one with bad dudes on

2693
02:35:16,700 --> 02:35:22,380
it and a bunch of the data East stuff. I'm looking at that. And I was looking at Atari flashback nine

2694
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:26,860
gold, you know, they're there on, they do those flashbacks every year and I've never bought one.

2695
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:30,940
I bought the Intellivision one, but I never bought the Atari one. So I kinda sorta want that,

2696
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:36,300
I think. So, um, yeah, that's some of the stuff on my holiday list as far as like the, um,

2697
02:35:37,580 --> 02:35:43,100
this, the sales and stuff, I have to admit, I didn't super take advantage of black Friday

2698
02:35:43,100 --> 02:35:48,380
or cyber Monday, especially when it came to games. Um, I pretty much already own everything

2699
02:35:48,380 --> 02:35:54,940
or I'm waiting on it like smash brothers, uh, for this season. But, um, the only thing I bought on

2700
02:35:54,940 --> 02:36:01,260
black Friday was to benefit OLR. I bought a webcam half off. That's one of those fancy,

2701
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:05,260
you know, Logitech, the newer ones that'll do the higher end video. Well, even though we're only

2702
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:12,700
going to do seven 20, but you know, HD, it'll be HD. Oh, cool. Yeah. Uh, anyhow. And they thank

2703
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:16,380
you, tiger claw. I have seen that link and that's probably how I'm going to end up getting the fix

2704
02:36:16,380 --> 02:36:21,100
at Felix. I was hoping it would be in stock at a local store. We joke about this Walmart in the

2705
02:36:21,100 --> 02:36:25,100
middle of nowhere because there's this back road. Have you ever drew? I don't want to say it on air.

2706
02:36:25,100 --> 02:36:28,540
I know what you're talking about. Okay. You've been to that Walmart. It's like, there's nothing

2707
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:31,180
around it. It's like in the middle of nowhere. It's like, why did they build a fucking Walmart

2708
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:34,780
here? Because eventually they'll build stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Sacramento is kind of growing that

2709
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:37,980
direction. Eventually they'll build stuff around it. But anyway, uh, I was surprised they didn't

2710
02:36:37,980 --> 02:36:40,940
have any in stock. Loki, let me let you answer the question real quick. And then I'm going to

2711
02:36:40,940 --> 02:36:45,980
turn the tables on raging or make him answer it. So did you do anything with the sales or what's

2712
02:36:45,980 --> 02:36:52,940
on your holiday list for, for games? Oh, for me to buy for myself. Well, just what would you hope

2713
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:58,940
maybe like the wife or the kids are looking at getting you today? She's like, what do you want

2714
02:36:58,940 --> 02:37:06,540
for Christmas? So let's sit. So a little backstory here. So my wife now follows me on Twitter.

2715
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:11,740
So I have literally no place to bitch about anything. Oh, did she, did she read some of

2716
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:16,300
your past stuff? Oh no, I took, I took care of deleting all that stuff a long time ago.

2717
02:37:16,300 --> 02:37:21,260
She's not going to go back that far. Anyway. So, um, so I have literally no place to vent

2718
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:26,540
anymore about stuff. So I'm going to vent here because that's what I did. So she knows she'll

2719
02:37:26,540 --> 02:37:30,940
never listen to this. Yes, exactly. So here's what I'm going to vent about. So like, speaking of,

2720
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:36,140
yes. So she asked me, you know, what, what do you want me to get you for Christmas? Which I don't

2721
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:40,780
like that because I feel that we've been married for how long and she's known me for how long and

2722
02:37:40,780 --> 02:37:46,860
she doesn't know what I like or she can't think of like, can't be creative in her own mind without,

2723
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:51,740
you know, coming up with something that she could think that I might like. She doesn't want to do

2724
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:55,660
that. She wants me to tell her, okay, get this thing. Okay. Well I'm basically telling her to

2725
02:37:55,660 --> 02:38:00,140
go to the store and pick something up for me that I could do myself. And it's most likely if it's

2726
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:04,700
anything like my birthday was, it's us going to the store, me picking it up and her going, see,

2727
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:09,820
here you go. You can't get anything else. So no, I'm not doing that, but here's what happened. Like

2728
02:38:09,820 --> 02:38:15,420
I was going to get her an air fryer cause she wanted an air fryer and stuff like that. So I

2729
02:38:15,420 --> 02:38:21,740
ordered an air fryer from Amazon and because she opens my boxes when they get home from, from stuff,

2730
02:38:21,740 --> 02:38:28,780
I told her, I'm like, I'm getting stuff sent in the mail from Amazon. I don't want you opening

2731
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:33,420
it up because at least it was like this when this new mixing board showed up, they just put a

2732
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:37,740
mailing label on the fucking mixing board box. Well, I specifically had them, like it was going

2733
02:38:37,740 --> 02:38:41,740
to like, Amazon does the thing. Like if it was going to come in a box that basically is like

2734
02:38:41,740 --> 02:38:45,100
that with just the mailing label on it, they have the option. Do you want to put this in a

2735
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:50,300
plain box so that they can't see what's inside? So I said, yes, put it in the plain box or whatever.

2736
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:57,260
So I told her, I'm like, I don't want, I don't want her opening up the box because I'm ordering

2737
02:38:57,260 --> 02:39:02,140
stuff also gifts for the kids too. So yeah, I don't want that stuff opening. So what does she

2738
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:07,740
do when I say, I tell her like, I don't want you opening this box up. She goes, Oh, what's coming

2739
02:39:07,740 --> 02:39:12,300
in the box. Is it a gift for me? I'm like, yes, actually it is a gift for you. Is it an air fryer?

2740
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:18,460
Is it a Roomba? I bet it's an air fryer. I'm like, you fucking ruined like the whole art of

2741
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:25,500
me giving you a gift and be nice about it. Like it's just, it's, it seriously pisses me off. It

2742
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:30,620
upsets me like, because I'm trying to be nice. I'm trying to like, like think about doing something

2743
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:35,500
nice and all I get in return is just like, let me just take that thunder away from you. Let me

2744
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:40,700
just take all of the effort out of it. Happy Hanukkah. It's just, it's fucking annoying.

2745
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:45,020
So yes, she asked me what I wanted for Christmas today and I'm like, I don't fucking know. I haven't

2746
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:48,060
been thinking about me. I've been thinking about what the hell to get everybody else.

2747
02:39:48,860 --> 02:39:53,180
So I don't know. I fucking don't know what the hell I would want for Christmas. Cause I,

2748
02:39:53,180 --> 02:39:57,340
how about it was suggested in chat that you offer up use of the 4k TV.

2749
02:39:57,340 --> 02:40:04,300
I can seriously count the amount of hours that I played on the 4k TV since we've gotten it.

2750
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:07,660
And I'm not going to be holding up all fingers. It's like three fingers.

2751
02:40:07,660 --> 02:40:12,220
Why don't you ask for another TV? We have a TV in the bedroom. It's 10 ADP.

2752
02:40:12,220 --> 02:40:17,660
She can fucking watch. All right. Look, whatever. Look, I appreciate low-key psychiatry session,

2753
02:40:17,660 --> 02:40:22,460
but I got to get rage leader. I got to turn this question on you like raising her. What about you?

2754
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:27,500
Are you, uh, what are you, what are you looking for for the holidays? Are you browsing the sales?

2755
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:30,620
Are you buying stuff for special somebody's what's happening?

2756
02:40:30,620 --> 02:40:38,140
Yeah. Uh, excuse me, clearing my soul. Um, I'm in a weird position. Um, my family has kind of

2757
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:44,780
gotten away from selling and bringing the holidays. Uh, you know, because. Reasons, uh,

2758
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:50,060
they wouldn't probably be too long to get into and probably not great for radio. Uh,

2759
02:40:50,060 --> 02:40:56,620
but so my family and I are not doing anything per se. Uh, so my options are really, you know,

2760
02:40:56,620 --> 02:41:04,380
either a, do something for myself or I've been, or, you know, uh, do something for Lily.

2761
02:41:04,380 --> 02:41:10,460
You know, I kind of opted to do something for Lily. Um, and you know, unfortunately I

2762
02:41:10,460 --> 02:41:16,380
couldn't really take care, uh, take advantage of the sales, uh, because of really shitty timing.

2763
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:23,500
Is the girl you've talked about before? Yeah. Okay. Um, no lungs. No, I did, you know, sit,

2764
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:31,340
you know, give her some stuff, you know, fairly early because, you know, things happen, you know,

2765
02:41:31,340 --> 02:41:37,100
and basically, you know, like early Christmas presents, uh, cheer her up. Like I gifted her

2766
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:42,940
like limbo. Surprise, surprise. I paid you pay full price for it. I know shocker, right?

2767
02:41:42,940 --> 02:41:47,260
Me, painful price for a game. Oh, wow. You must be really crazy about this person.

2768
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:51,900
Yeah, well, well, you know, here, here's the thing, you know,

2769
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:59,740
you know, I was going to wait for a sale, but, uh, you know, again, things happen, uh,

2770
02:41:59,740 --> 02:42:06,140
too long to get into. Uh, but I can't forget, give a gift early, just, you know, cheer her up.

2771
02:42:06,220 --> 02:42:09,340
Um, but why not love? He did. Yeah.

2772
02:42:11,420 --> 02:42:19,820
Uh, then of course, you know, you know, I also gave her like, um, the Dracula trilogy,

2773
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:27,100
uh, since that was on Seattle, I gave her to her. Plus I got Draco to trilogy for myself as well.

2774
02:42:27,980 --> 02:42:38,780
Um, then, uh, uh, then technically it's not, you know, geek related, but I also helped her out by

2775
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:44,060
giving, you know, pointing $50 towards her, uh, her rent. Cause you know, you know, again,

2776
02:42:44,060 --> 02:42:52,780
things happen. And then, um, then there was, you know, one other gift I've given her a plus one

2777
02:42:52,780 --> 02:43:01,500
that I'm going to be giving her, you know, early, probably with the next week or two that, uh,

2778
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:09,100
it would be highly inappropriate for me to talk about on stream. Um, but you can probably take

2779
02:43:09,100 --> 02:43:19,260
your guesses to what general area, you know, moving on games, games, games. Yeah. Yeah. But,

2780
02:43:19,980 --> 02:43:26,860
but yeah, at least I, the gifts I did give her a geek related. So, uh, but no,

2781
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:30,380
I'm not really expecting anything for, uh, for Christmas. Like you said,

2782
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:36,860
you know, family doesn't do anything for Christmas and, uh, you know, Lily's dying

2783
02:43:36,860 --> 02:43:42,460
really in a position to, you know, give out gifts. Uh, she's barely able to give out Christmas cards.

2784
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:50,940
So, um, so no, maybe you'll get a, maybe you'll get a poem or a coupon book for chores

2785
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:55,820
around the house or, you know, one of those things that, that, you know, you don't, you can't,

2786
02:43:55,820 --> 02:43:59,740
you put that, that Loki's kids will get for Loki because you can't really put a cost on them.

2787
02:44:00,860 --> 02:44:07,100
Yeah. Well, no, I, I, I know it sounds weird, but I kind of considering, uh, the opportunity

2788
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:13,740
to chat with her on a regular basis. No, my gift because no, I, I just enjoy, you know,

2789
02:44:13,740 --> 02:44:18,860
talking about, uh, talking to her on a regular basis, even about the mundane stuff.

2790
02:44:19,900 --> 02:44:24,780
What is up with tonight being like therapy night? All right. Look, I asked about the games.

2791
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:31,660
Yeah. Yeah. Well anyway, I take it up way too much time, uh, uh, doing your show. I'm sure

2792
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:36,620
all the people want to, uh, call in, not just me and Ron. So, uh, you might be surprised,

2793
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:41,660
but yeah, I appreciate the phone call nevertheless. And Hey, have a happy holiday.

2794
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:46,540
Okay. All right. You too. Take care. All right. Take care. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. All right.

2795
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:50,380
Let's see if anybody else wants to call orange launch radio, all one word on Skype, or, uh,

2796
02:44:50,380 --> 02:44:53,740
I guess if you still want to do the old fashioned way, one eight seven seven game, O L R. If you

2797
02:44:53,740 --> 02:44:57,020
want to give us a call, I haven't checked in to see if there's any last minute stories. I don't

2798
02:44:57,020 --> 02:45:00,540
know. I think we covered all the big stuff. I was looking there. I still haven't found anything.

2799
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:04,140
Yeah. There's not, not a lot of other big stuff going on that I can think of, but I will,

2800
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:07,260
I will try to leave that open for just a couple more seconds. If anybody wants to get through

2801
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:12,700
again over orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. Um, you know, I was thinking about the

2802
02:45:12,700 --> 02:45:17,900
Christmas gift question. There is still one game I never picked up that I guess I should

2803
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:23,100
kind of wait and see if maybe husband or somebody will, will, uh, get it, but I never did pick up

2804
02:45:23,100 --> 02:45:28,220
soul caliber six. So that, that's a game. That's a game that I guess I should, you know, hold out

2805
02:45:28,220 --> 02:45:34,300
for. Cause, uh, uh, that I don't know why I skipped it. I just, it was just the wrong time

2806
02:45:34,300 --> 02:45:41,580
to ask me for $60. So, um, as, as, uh, some of you, uh, in chat, I think I mentioned this on the show,

2807
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:46,220
Alan's between jobs right now and we're fine. Like financially, we're not like devastated cause I,

2808
02:45:46,220 --> 02:45:50,780
I make fine money where I'm at to keep us along. But, uh, I would really love for, you know, that,

2809
02:45:50,780 --> 02:45:56,540
that to all be sorted out and then I can start to drop more and more money frivolously on games.

2810
02:45:57,340 --> 02:46:01,500
I think that's kind of what it comes down to. Like something like smash brothers is like, okay,

2811
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:05,660
I know I'm going to play this game. I have to have this game, but like soul caliber six,

2812
02:46:05,660 --> 02:46:10,620
can I sit on that for a little bit? Even stuff like the Sega Genesis collection and the Katamari

2813
02:46:10,620 --> 02:46:14,860
stuff. I'm like, do I have to have that day one? Maybe I can hold off a little bit just while some

2814
02:46:14,860 --> 02:46:19,580
other things work itself out. So we'll see. Oh, Rama says soul caliber six was on sale for 35.

2815
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:24,780
Damn it. I missed it. Oh, well I'm sure steam always does a sale at the end of the year and

2816
02:46:24,780 --> 02:46:28,700
it is on PC. So maybe they'll, maybe they'll have it that price again or something like that. Who

2817
02:46:28,700 --> 02:46:34,220
knows? You never know. Anyway, the Skype line is not lighting up anymore. So I think we are about

2818
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:39,180
at the end of the show. They're down. It's down the $48. Oh, that's not bad at all on Amazon.

2819
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:43,340
Okay. That's not bad at all. Maybe I'll just end up picking that up. We'll see. Um, but anyway,

2820
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:47,900
uh, let's, uh, let's close up shop. We're going to, uh, end it for the week. We'll be back next

2821
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:51,740
week. Uh, dark soccer will be here in the house. That'd be nice to hear from her. So send some

2822
02:46:51,740 --> 02:46:55,660
emails, uh, give her something to read, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

2823
02:46:55,660 --> 02:46:59,020
Uh, let's go around and get some final thoughts. Well, actually, before we do that, I'll, I'll say

2824
02:46:59,020 --> 02:47:02,380
as I always do, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange lounge radio, uh, please tell a

2825
02:47:02,380 --> 02:47:05,900
friend about the show. Help spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2826
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:09,740
but you know, the voices have to be here. So, um, help bring some new friends into the show.

2827
02:47:09,740 --> 02:47:12,700
Uh, this whole transition we're going to be going through is a great time to do that. I think,

2828
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:17,500
I think more people will find a Twitch channel easier probably than they do how to listen on

2829
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:21,100
shoutcast or tune in or whatever you're using today, which no shade to tune in.

2830
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:25,100
They've done a great job for us for many years and I'm sad I can't pimp them anymore in a few

2831
02:47:25,100 --> 02:47:31,740
weeks. Um, but anyway, uh, let's, uh, if you enjoyed this too, you can also leave a review,

2832
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:35,340
a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Google play podcast, wherever you found the show,

2833
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:39,660
that stuff goes a long, long way. Support indie broadcasting no matter what. Even if you hated

2834
02:47:39,660 --> 02:47:43,980
this whole show, but made it to the end anyway, uh, just support it, support a show you do like,

2835
02:47:43,980 --> 02:47:48,300
dang it. Uh, cause there's many, any broadcasters out there who appreciate your support. Just like

2836
02:47:48,300 --> 02:47:51,820
we were talking about earlier, a little note, a little review, a little nice words goes a long

2837
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:55,580
way. You guys. Okay. Now let's get final thoughts. Um, Loki, your final thought.

2838
02:47:55,580 --> 02:47:59,340
My final thought is I'm probably have to load a new version of DDR onto the cabinet.

2839
02:48:00,060 --> 02:48:04,300
Cause I'm kind of getting tired of fourth plus already. I got tired of that really fast.

2840
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:07,740
I don't know. Like I played through all the songs like, and it's like, okay,

2841
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:12,380
now I've played through them. I don't know, but it will be better once I get the step

2842
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:17,020
mania machine going. Um, I'm still working, like I said, working on the theme for that

2843
02:48:17,580 --> 02:48:24,460
actually have Photoshop open so that, you know, working on it. Um, and then, um, then

2844
02:48:24,460 --> 02:48:28,460
everything will be in there. Then I want this, you know, I'll have so many songs to play,

2845
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:33,500
but then I'll have to make steps for songs that, you know, are missing steps.

2846
02:48:33,500 --> 02:48:38,220
I still need to come over and do a, a stream with you. So that'll be fun. Make that happen

2847
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:43,660
before Christmas. Um, so I guess, I guess that's it. Um, my final thoughts tonight. Um,

2848
02:48:43,660 --> 02:48:48,700
my final thought is, uh, I'm going to try to play at least one new video game this week,

2849
02:48:48,700 --> 02:48:52,060
uh, besides smash brothers. Cause I'll be playing that on Friday for sure. So try to play

2850
02:48:52,060 --> 02:48:55,580
one new game every week, at least for the rest of the year. And I am looking at,

2851
02:48:55,580 --> 02:49:00,140
I really, really want to get into doing more like video on demand stuff for Twitch. Um,

2852
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:04,220
so that's something I'm trying to look at doing to just, you know, all, all, all this,

2853
02:49:04,300 --> 02:49:07,740
all these projects, not enough hours. And then they get sucked into MMOs,

2854
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:13,420
but Oh well, that's what happens. So anyway, I'd like to stream more games. Um, other than DDR,

2855
02:49:13,420 --> 02:49:19,420
just, I don't have a really good place to do that. I have to probably clean the garage and then,

2856
02:49:19,420 --> 02:49:22,460
well, maybe you'll get something worked out just in time for summer to hit. Yeah.

2857
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:28,380
Hey, I was streaming games. It's only 120 degrees inside the garage down and we had no air. Yeah.

2858
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:33,740
Yeah. All right. Uh, anyway, that's it. We're done here. Uh, we're out for the night. Thank

2859
02:49:33,740 --> 02:49:38,060
you guys so much, uh, for listening to our show tonight and supporting us. We'll see you in seven

2860
02:49:38,060 --> 02:49:42,460
days to do it all again until then have a great week, everybody and good night. You've been
