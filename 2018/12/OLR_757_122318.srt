00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week, Square has an ace up their sleeve against the Kingdom Hearts League. The release doesn't include the entirety of the game's content. Shock went up to the ability to patch games, maybe? This is just one story. Join us for more on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 757 for this, December the 23rd of 2018, our last show of the year, because we're actually not going to be here next week.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My bad.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's okay, that's okay. Here in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, and Techmaster Loki joining me.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, I'm here.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As he does every Sunday night over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, the voice geeks network, where every gamer has a voice, and we do broadcast live every Sunday night at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And you can check out more great shows at VOG Network dot com, but we are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who had a great show tonight with some Sony PlayStation VR recommendations.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I know the news is getting a little bit slower this time of year, but we still have some things to talk about tonight.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's the time of year when everyone does their year-end recaps of, like, best games of 2018 and all the other, like, I don't know, a lot of it was just very, you know, slow news week type of articles.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Just like, here's how I unlock these games, or here's how I got enough platinum coins in, you know, the Nintendo store to be able to unlock this game for free, because I did surveys on websites.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And it's like, why is that an article? That's not an article.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's just, it's filler, it's clickbait, because people share that stuff on Facebook and all that.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's like, you need the right something, there's nothing going on!

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, fine.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, so I guess I'm looking in chat, and they're saying that the intro did not have audio tonight.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You'll hear it on the podcast, because I can easily fix it there, but we're learning some new things about video.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Jason actually did a wonderful video, he actually did the video introduction tonight, and for whatever reason, I must have made a boo-boo on my end and kept the audio muted on it.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So, that's why we started the Twitch thing in 2018, so that we could have a few test episodes, and then in 2019, we'd be like, good to go, and we could really start promoting and all that stuff.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But, hey, the date's correct.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The date is correct tonight, you know I have my eyes out for that this time, absolutely.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And lots of great feedback from you guys last week, thanks so much.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm already up to just about 100 followers over on the VOG Network channel, and that's so amazing.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Although I did notice that the ticker on the bottom had the episode number for last week.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, did it?

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What? Thank you.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's weird. I don't even, I don't think the episode number is in the ticker bar.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That said something. Maybe that was just reading one of the articles.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know, I don't know. Yeah, it's easy to get distracted with all this video.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So many things.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, and over in our chat, over at Twitch TV, Act F says Palindrome episode 2. Yes, that's right, 7570s.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's the same, forward and backwards. How do you celebrate a Palindrome episode? I'm not sure.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's see, going to Run, Jump, Stomp over at Twitch says it's an article because they get paid by the word.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, you know what, I mean, people are still using Facebook and social media and all that stuff.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Twitter is not going to slow down just because it's Christmas Day.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I mean, for one, not everybody celebrates Christmas, we know that.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But even that, you know, people work on Christmas, but it's just, you know, I think there's a lot of people too.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know about your family traditions, but I know in my family on Christmas.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So we would do, you know, and this was when I was younger, we would do the presents, we would open the gifts,

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we would do all that exchange. And then it was kind of like after the morning, it's like, all right,

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Christmas is kind of done. Hang out till three o'clock for dinner.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And for me, that would be a great time to go play whatever video game I probably got for Christmas.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But, you know, it was it's kind of like, oh, well, the holidays are over at that point.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And sometimes we would go to the movies. That's something we started doing later when I was more in my 20s.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I would love to do that, except that it's going to be crazy at the movie theaters.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah. And I know we're doing food, though. So like Christmas Day, we're doing at my house.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Christmas Eve, we're going to my mom's house to go open stuff there, which I just talked to her in the car.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So apparently my my niece is going to be opening some gifts earlier on because she's not going to be able to wait until the evening because the gifts are all going to be there.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So she's going to open her gifts and then she'll have to wait and we'll open our gifts and the kids will open their gifts on Tuesday.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And they have a lot of stuff. They have a lot of stuff. Any any games that you might benefit from, too, that you actually got your kids?

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, this is a bold strategy that I tried in order to get the switch.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So so we have so my thought originally, because I had get the wife a personal Blu-ray player so she can watch your Grey's Anatomy.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, no, no, no, no. Not like that. So originally my idea was I'm going to get the kids some games for the switch so they could play some new games that they were looking for.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But then I realized that's games and two, they're going to have games, but they're only going to have one console.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They're fighting over it. And that's not going to make for a good day for me.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So whereas most people like, well, just they'll get over it. My thought process was, OK, let's buy them each game systems.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And so they're going to be getting a 2DS and for the Soulja Boy console.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, no. And and four games each.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
OK, that's pretty nice. Yes, because apparently, you know, those GameStop cards.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Dad's got money. No, I don't.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You know, those GameStop cards that you pay for stuff and you get that stupid magazine each month and stuff.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, apparently you accumulate points with that that I was completely unaware of until this week.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I had like a ton of points that I could redeem for gift cards in the store, which then paid for a bunch of used copies of stuff and no complaints.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes. And plus the 2D 2DS systems, not the 2DS XL, because those are one hundred fifty dollars versus seventy dollars in the game.

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They're very reasonable. And that's and that's what the DS is really like meant to be at this point, is that the DS is really intended to be like that baby's first.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Not baby, but, you know, like tween slash kid first console.

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So they're going to get it comes preloaded with New Super Mario Brothers 2.

71
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So they got that Mario Kart 7, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Super Mario Maker for the 3DS.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then the one game that they'll fight over because they have different games each.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Josh is getting Super Mario 3D Land because he used to play 3D World.

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, sure. He was disappointed when we got rid of the Wii U because he couldn't play that anymore.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And it's basically the same game. And then Mario Party top one hundred for Danny because he likes playing Mario Party.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Speaking of Mario, and this is a random tangent, but since you brought it up and we are a video game show, after all, we do we are going to talk.

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you're new, because we just had our first show on Twitch, even though we've been doing this show for 16 and a half years, since 2002.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't expect that a lot of people necessarily knew what Shoutcast is or was listening to stuff within that.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So I know this whole Twitch thing is still a little bit newer for us. So we're adjusting to it too.

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hence why we have some bugs like the audio and the intro and things like that.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But otherwise, we do talk about games, of course, over the next few hours.

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And since you brought up Mario, the Mario, the game that was on the Wii U.

83
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So what New Super Mario Brothers U gets at Switchport like next month.

84
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And I totally forgot that that was going to be a thing until I saw some random article.

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The deluxe one has like that in the new Luigi U.

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, that game is the fault of where Bowsette came from and why we have all that crap.

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I mean, fan art. Because that was the one where you have, what was it, like Toadette or she gets the...

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't even remember what it is now, but I know it's where Bowsette started.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Was it in Peachette or something like that?

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes, it's Peachette. I think it's like Toadette meets Peach and then there's the whole thing.

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Maybe somebody in our chat remembers what all that is about over at our Twitch TV channel at VOG Network.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And yeah, something else. So a lot of the feedback from Twitch last week was very positive.

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But I do have a good friend that will always kind of like tell me like,

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
your tag's sticking out, you know, the nitpicky things that are going on and so forth.

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So was kind of giving me the feedback on OLR and saying that like at some points I was like on my phone.

96
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Like I got, oh my God, I got caught because remember you guys couldn't see us before.

97
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So that was like totally normal.

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is that, yeah, they'll be reading a story and I'd be like checking the headlines, you know,

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
what else going on, what's going on with my Twitter and all this other stuff and...

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Catching a Pokemon.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What Facebook gave me, Pokemon outside. Oh crap, you guys can see that.

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And it does look really weird when I do that.

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And also probably looks weird when I'm like turning back and forth.

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, because I'm not looking, it's hard to look at the camera and the chat room and the screen and you.

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And it's like, where do I look?

106
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But I got like, I totally, I'm not like complaining because they're probably watching and like,

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
are you really complaining about that on air? But no, I actually thought like, oh crap,

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that is like really good feedback and something like I'm not thinking of with this whole Twitch thing.

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So we are trying to make like small baby steps where I've tried to look at Loki more tonight.

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And but yeah, if you guys wonder like, why do I keep turning away over here?

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's because you guys' chat is over here and the stories and things I do.

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But as we move into next year and get a little more used to this

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and get that USB cable that will allow our camera to be further back,

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
we'll probably rearrange the studio a little bit so it's not so weird.

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But remember, we said that when we were going to first go to Twitch,

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the goal was do the same show, but do it on Twitch.

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And there'll just kind of be video there, but you know, we're going to try to,

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean the camera's not bad where it's at. I don't know really how much further back are we going to get.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, and I still don't know how when Jamie's back from her break,

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
because of course Dark Soccer, she's not here tonight. She's still on her extended work break.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But when she comes back, I'm not sure to what extent she's going to want to be involved.

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I still really love the idea of a Dr. Claw type thing where you can like see your hand.

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And that whole thing, so I'll talk to her about that.

124
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So we'll figure out how we'll set all that up, and I'm sure Alan, my husband,

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
will be thrilled at rearranging this room completely yet again.

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So there you go.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Run Jump Stomp in chat says, that chair looks really uncomfortable.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's fine. You actually, I don't know if it's Loki or me, but Loki, you prefer this to the couch.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Like I was like, you could just sit on the couch, but you kind of like something with the back on that, right?

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, this is fine. It's just the couch is really, you sink into it a bit.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And it was hard to have like the laptop, you know, on a TV tray and be able to do that.

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a lot easier with this.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, and Bobby Black Wolf calls out from the last show when I walked away.

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And it's like, you know, again, you guys could catch me doing that before,

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
but at some point, this little cup of water, I drink a lot of water while doing the show,

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
it runs out and I got to go fill up, but I'm going to try my best to hold it till the break tonight.

137
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But like if there's a potty emergency or something, I'm just going to go.

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's what you got to do. I'm just going to get up and go.

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Or Mr. Smush starts screaming. It is what it is.

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Although he's a little more well behaved now.

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He was losing his crap earlier, but I think he's under control now.

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah. All right, we're good. All right, well, let's get into news.

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We got some news going on this week.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I know it's a little bit lighter, but we do have some things going on in the news.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So let's get into it.

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
A big thing people are talking about on social media involving the most popular game right now in the world,

147
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
even if I don't play it as much, but I know tons of people do, it's Fortnite, right?

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, my son plays it a lot now.

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Although he doesn't play with people, he just plays the creative mode now.

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Because it's just fun for him to mess around with it.

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So apparently there's been some lawsuits regarding the dancing emotes that are in the game.

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So one of the things that Fortnite's known for is these famous dances within the game.

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And of course, apparently now we have Alfonso Ribero.

155
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What is up with your cat?

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Anyways, smoosh is up on the table where I got it. I'll be back.

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay. I heard him just like sneezing and whatever.

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Right after that whole talk about leaving.

159
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What are you going to do?

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So anyways, so with the whole thing being popular in the game, of course,

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
now Alfonso Ribero is basically saying that, hey, you guys stole my dance without even asking.

162
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And there's definitely been no compensation for it.

163
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So he filed a lawsuit against Epic Games regarding that.

164
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But then again, there's also, you know, video out there that TMZ provided saying that,

165
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
oh, hey, you know, he stole the dance from somebody else.

166
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But I think when he says steal, it's more like he took this part and this part from two other people,

167
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
something that they did, and then he mixed in some other stuff.

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And that's more just like creating your own thing that's not just straight up, right.

169
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You know, taking something and using it without any sort of permission or whatever.

170
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But basically saying, you know, hey, Epic has earned record profits off of downloadable content in the game,

171
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
including emotes like Fresh, which is the dance that they're referring to.

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yet Epic has failed to compensate or even ask for permission for Mr. Ribero

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
or use of his likeness and iconic intellectual property.

174
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I mean, definitely the dances. You could tell where it's from, obviously, in Fresh.

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Definitely alluding to Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

176
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But he's not the only one, though, that's also had issue with it.

177
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So apparently, and I'm not sure who this kid is, but they call him Backpack Kid.

178
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Basically, he was part of a performance that Katy Perry did.

179
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait, you don't know Backpack Kid?

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't know Backpack Kid.

181
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Y'all are gonna regret this Twitch thing.

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
No, no, you're not flossing. Fucking sit down right now. Sit down.

183
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We're not doing this shit. This shit is not happening on our show.

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Enough. The line, we're drawing the line there. We're not doing...

185
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You look fucking dumb. Just don't do that.

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Eventually when my kid comes to the show again, yes, he'll fucking do that.

187
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But no. We are too damn old to be doing that shit.

188
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And if we raise $50, we'll go back to Shoutcast.

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So anyways, Backpack Kid, who, you know, of course, made famous flossing.

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You know, the dance of the children.

191
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So he is, of course, joining the lawsuit as well.

192
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I thought there was another artist, too, that was basically saying,

193
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hey, what the fuck?

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But, I mean, let's be honest here, though.

195
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Like, the Carlton Dance has been a ton of fucking shit.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I mean, they had that emote, and I can remember Saints Row had that shit in there.

197
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But I guess it's just maybe because they're selling it as a separate thing instead of it being included.

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And then, who knows, maybe they'd ask for permission in that game.

199
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But maybe it's just because they're specifically selling it,

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and because it's the most popular game right now that it's caught the attention versus Saints Row, who...

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I think that's key, what you're talking about, is how they're selling it.

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Because I think, when I think of, like, pop culture dances and games,

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the first thing I remember is World of Warcraft.

204
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, yeah, and they have that in World of Warcraft.

205
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, like how the Draenei, I think, did the Toonok Dance.

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Like, they did a lot of meme stuff that they did.

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And I think the Blood Elf female does Britney Toxic.

208
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And, you know, they're very mainstream type of stuff.

209
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And, you know, well, what's funny now is that, you know, because World of Warcraft is, you know,

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
over, like, what, like 14 years old at this point,

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
like, a lot of the stuff that's in it is referencing things that were memes, like, 14 years ago.

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But still, you're right, like, dances have been in games for a long time, but in WoW, it was kind of built in.

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So what's the point between, like, parody and, like, making a profit off it?

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Is that really parody when it's just, like, lifting the dance?

215
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think it's just how identical the dance is, maybe.

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because you can copyright a dance, but I don't know why this would be liable for, you know,

217
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
some sort of restitution versus something else.

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Also, I should mention, though, that they're not just suing Epic Games as well,

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
they're also suing 2K games over NBA 2K, which also apparently has emotes in that game as well.

220
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I thought that was a fucking basketball game.

221
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why you're doing the Carlton is...

222
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No, why? Where's that coming from?

223
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I thought that was, like, a sportsy thing.

224
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Like, I have to admit, I'm not the biggest sports, but I know, like, in football,

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
when they get to the end zone and they do a touchdown, like, wasn't there, like, I remember,

226
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
like, wasn't there the guy, the Tebow or whatever his name was that would always, like,

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
pray, take a knee and do that whole thing?

228
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We don't talk about that now either.

229
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah, I know. Now we can't talk about taking a knee in the NFL, but I'm gonna say that for another day.

230
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So, but anyway, so yeah, I mean, what...

231
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Or in Destiny. Destiny is another one.

232
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Destiny has that too.

233
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

234
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So, are they, I mean, a lot of questions...

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I think what it is is because nowadays, games, whether it be a free-to-play game,

236
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
like, you know, Epic's Fortnite, which, that's fine if they're selling shit like that in the game,

237
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
because it's free-to-play, or Destiny and 2K, you know, NBA 2K, which are full $60 games,

238
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
that you also are paying for microtransaction bullshit as well on top of it,

239
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
because some of the money is not all of the money, and they need all of the money,

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and that's why they're doing this shit.

241
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It is gonna raise this, I mean, we've been talking for a long time about how, like,

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you know, intellectual property rights and trademarks and a lot of that stuff

243
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
really needs to be reevaluated in this digital era,

244
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
because so much, you know, we have so much homegrown stuff even,

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
like the stuff we're doing on Twitch.

246
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We still don't even, like, really have a question or an answer,

247
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and we have a question, we don't have an answer to, like,

248
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
what really is the legality when, like, you play a game and you're talking over it?

249
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Like, who really owns that?

250
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you really own that or does the game maker have a say in that?

251
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And, like, sure, a lot of us, because we do stream on Twitch,

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
we like to feel like we own it, but I've always said, you know,

253
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
if the game makers wanted to take a cut of some of the biddies,

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I wouldn't be opposed to it, but there needs to be an established rule,

255
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
a consistent rule, and something that's kind of like the accepted standard

256
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
of who owns what, because I also don't think the game company should own everything.

257
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You know, if we're making jokes and things like that, you know,

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
like, how does that all play out?

259
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I think a lot of the DMCA stuff needs to stop anyways,

260
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
just because of how it's being abused.

261
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I mean, there was a thing this week about a channel that got taken down

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
because a developer didn't like what they were saying about their game,

263
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and so they filed copyright strikes against their channel, which...

264
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's a YouTube problem. That's why we're on Twitch.

265
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Just not to be shady, but a little shady, but because, you know,

266
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
it's just, like, YouTube does not stick up for their content creators.

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh, no, not at all.

268
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Never ever. They always err on the side of ruling against them,

269
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
whereas I feel like, and maybe this is just my perception,

270
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
but I do feel Twitch, and I'm not just kissing butt because we're here now,

271
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
but I do feel Twitch does a better job of kind of sticking up

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and being a little more proactive for its user base

273
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
in some of the things that they do, if that makes sense,

274
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
especially when it comes to things like their muting policy.

275
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I think, you know, it's fair. Like, they have to do what they have to do to be legal,

276
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and I think what they're doing is kind of fair, and if you, you know, challenge it,

277
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
they have a process to look at it and all that stuff,

278
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
whereas I feel like YouTube just never errs on the side of the content creators,

279
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
so why would I want to create content for YouTube?

280
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm really not motivated to do that.

281
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So, all right.

282
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Going to our chat, Run Jump Stomp reminds us,

283
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Nintendo recently backed off about content creation.

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What's that?

285
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
See what you did?

286
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, yeah.

287
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Now they clip that shit.

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes, I know. I need to be thinking about that. That's going to happen.

289
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's going to happen.

290
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If the broccoli thing from our last radio-only show had been on this,

291
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that would have gotten clipped like 5,000 times.

292
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That actually got me thinking earlier this week, so...

293
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Clips help spread the show, whatever.

294
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't think... I wanted to tell the kids where they're actually going.

295
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No, you can't do it till the holidays.

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So, yeah, I think we're not doing that.

297
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I got it. I got it.

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Put a bunch of broccoli in a bowl, and then when they eat all the broccoli,

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
there's a Disney logo at the bottom.

300
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Well, they're never going to eat all the broccoli.

301
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, then they're not going to Disneyland.

302
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So, my thought was, though, it would be cool to do a mock Disney logo shirt,

303
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
but just have, let's say, Broccoli Farm in the Disney font,

304
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and then we can sell them to our listeners, because they want merch anyways.

305
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Would Disney sue, though?

306
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a parody.

307
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Okay. All right. We'll see what we can do.

308
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
If we... It's the Mickey head, is the hard part.

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, we wouldn't put the Mickey head. It's just broccoli.

310
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, okay.

311
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Broccoli in an actual farm, and then it just looks like...

312
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
All right. Leave that joke two weeks ago.

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Back to the Fortnite dances, Loki.

314
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So, how do you see this ending?

315
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I see it going to court, and we'll see if it actually...

316
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If they have a case or not.

317
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I say settlement.

318
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
These things always end in a settlement.

319
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Fortnite is pooping out the dollars,

320
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and they're just going to pay it off to shut these guys down,

321
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
but then what's that going to do for the future,

322
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and other games incorporating dances,

323
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
which I think, again, I can see where it's a little bit of a problem

324
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
when you're selling it in the stores as an enhancement,

325
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
or you're getting in the loot box as an enhancement,

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
but in World of Warcraft, it was just kind of there.

327
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It was a little bonus thing. It was a cute thing that they did.

328
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Saints Row, similar thing, right?

329
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah. It was just a silly thing.

330
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Exactly. It was a silly thing.

331
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Or maybe if they want to have the dance,

332
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
maybe they should at least license the song,

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
which I know for the Carlton, there's no real...

334
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I mean, we all know it goes with Tom Jones.

335
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's not, watch out, or I'll do that dance too,

336
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
but it's the whole Tom Jones, it's not unusual to be loved by you,

337
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
which isn't really... but you know what I mean.

338
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I know what you mean.

339
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
A lot of times, the dances go with a song,

340
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
so if you pay the money to get the song in your game,

341
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
maybe you could use the dance too,

342
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
but I think it's the whole fact that they are selling the dance

343
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
as a separate thing, and it's not just incorporated into the game

344
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
as a pop culture reference,

345
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
which could probably be sold a little more as parody, I guess.

346
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I think that's where ultimately the legal law lines

347
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
are kind of drawn a little bit.

348
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And Fortnite, we'll just have to think of other things to sell,

349
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
either original dances, but we know that's not...

350
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
People aren't really going to buy original dances.

351
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
They have merch already.

352
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I just bought my Sunday Fortnite 2019 calendar,

353
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and apparently they have characters or skins or something like that

354
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
that were actual... because I was asking them,

355
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
so do they actually have characters in this game?

356
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Because I see this one's named Leviathan,

357
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and he's like, no, that's a skin.

358
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm like, okay.

359
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Loki, they're yelling at me in chat,

360
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
because I won't do the Carlton.

361
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You're yelling at me in chat.

362
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You don't have enough room. You're going to injure yourself.

363
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That is not even...

364
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's what I could do with the space I was given.

365
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's not even...

366
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh God, I'm having to watch it back.

367
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Exactly. Witness the horror that is.

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
All right, anyway.

369
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

370
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I want to talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

371
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

372
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I didn't play a whole ton.

373
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think I've been busy shopping this week.

374
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I was actually trying to reflect back to what I played,

375
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and it's mainly just Pokemon Go.

376
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I've just been playing a little bit of that.

377
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I even forgot to do my stupid mystery box thing to get melted,

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
which sucks because it was the double candy event thing,

379
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and that would have been really helpful if I had remembered to do it.

380
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So yeah, I didn't end up doing that,

381
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and I don't...

382
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
DDR, I don't think I played too much.

383
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It just had to...

384
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
A lot of plans kept changing.

385
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I had to go places, and so I wasn't able to do that.

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I did try to stream on Friday,

387
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and it ended up being an issue where I wanted to load a new mix on there,

388
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and I have a drive that's supposed to read that disk fine,

389
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and it did, but then when I went to actually load the game after I installed it,

390
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
it just wouldn't read the disk again.

391
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So then I swapped drives out again to the one that I bought,

392
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
a replacement drive that was supposed to be the most compatible with the disk,

393
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and it won't read anything now,

394
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
so I had to put the old drive back in there,

395
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and at that point I was like,

396
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
fuck it, it's too late, I'm just not doing it right now.

397
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So I have all the parts to build the StepMania PC.

398
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I have everything now, so I just need to do it.

399
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I may end up doing that tomorrow.

400
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And then I also found out,

401
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I was trying to figure out what theme I wanted to put on there,

402
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and my problem was that the menus were too laggy,

403
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and then I ended up finding out by trying to move my StepMania install to my SSD drive.

404
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Not laggy on an official mix, but laggy on your StepMania setup, right?

405
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Laggy on my laptop.

406
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So it was laggy.

407
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I mean, it should be fine altogether, because StepMania runs on a toaster.

408
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It was laggy in the sense that the menus were kind of lagging as I'm moving stuff around,

409
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
like there was a little bit of jitter with loading images or something,

410
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and I couldn't tell why that was,

411
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and I was trying to find a mix that was pretty smooth

412
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
because I wanted to build off of it to do a custom theme.

413
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And so then I was like, hey, you know what, I wonder if it's this hard drive,

414
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
because I have a 5 terabyte 5400 RPM drive in there and then I have an SSD.

415
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I was like, well, let me put it on my SSD and see if that makes a difference,

416
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and oh, yep, that was the issue.

417
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So I have a 256 gigabyte NVMe drive, so that's about six times faster than an SSD.

418
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I mean, it's still technically an SSD, but it's 32 gigabytes per second,

419
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
so it'll be able to handle, it should be able to handle anything.

420
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So I'm thinking now I don't have to worry about the lag.

421
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I just will just pick something and go with that.

422
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But I don't know.

423
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I still need to come over and play DDR.

424
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I know I keep promising it.

425
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I did one of those dumb things I keep saying I'm never going to do again.

426
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I played one of those online Big Brother type games,

427
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
but this time there were 32 people in it, and I got to the end.

428
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm in the final three.

429
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So finally, a little bit of payoff, but I'm not going to win.

430
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I already know I'm not going to win.

431
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
They're actually announcing the winner in an hour.

432
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's not going to be me.

433
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But yeah, so that's been taking up a lot of my time

434
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
because I try to do a lot of chatting in the evening.

435
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It would be around a line.

436
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Apparently I didn't do enough, which is why I'm not going to win, but whatever.

437
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But I do definitely want to come by at some point and play on your machine

438
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
because I need to get thin again.

439
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Well, me too.

440
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I've been kind of slacking this week,

441
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and also eating 12 breadsticks is not going to be helping me any,

442
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but I don't care.

443
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I want them.

444
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So I really do need to get back into it after the year,

445
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the start of the year again.

446
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But I haven't really gained that much.

447
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm just kind of hovering in the same spot, like low 200s.

448
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So that's good.

449
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm not bouncing back up to 220 or something like that.

450
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So I just need to keep everything consistent and get back into DDR again.

451
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So not to derail you too much, but Loki, it's literally been three minutes,

452
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and look, there's a GIF of what just happened.

453
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The oil army works fast, and I am kind of embarrassed watching that,

454
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but whatever, what can you do?

455
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Now all we need to do is turn that into an emoji or whatever.

456
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, one of the Twitch emojis or whatever?

457
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
When we get biddies.

458
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't want to get sued, though. Isn't that like paying for a dance?

459
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Well, let me put it this way.

460
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That Carlton dance was so not the Carlton dance that we'll be fine.

461
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I couldn't remember the whole thing.

462
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I just know he does that thing with his arm.

463
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It'll be fine.

464
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Forget it. Forget it.

465
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You didn't really want to see it anyway.

466
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
All right, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

467
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That was pretty much it.

468
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I didn't play Katamari, sadly, even though I have it.

469
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I did download my free copy of Lego Lord of the Rings,

470
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
but I didn't play anything on PC.

471
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I probably will, though.

472
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
All right.

473
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Let me talk about my gaming week then.

474
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I did play Katamari because Loki, good old friend buddy pal,

475
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
bought me a Katamari Damacy reroll on PC,

476
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
so I was kind of trying to decide, do I want it on PC so I can mod it?

477
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Do I want it on Switch so I can take it on the go?

478
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And Loki made the decision for me, so thank you.

479
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I appreciate that.

480
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You can always buy it again.

481
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That's true. I could always buy it again.

482
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Actually, we're already going to buy it twice,

483
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
because the minute I was like, oh, Loki,

484
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I kind of exclaimed, oh, Loki got me Katamari Damacy.

485
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And Alan on the other side of the green screen is like,

486
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
wait a minute, that's on PC?

487
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I thought that was only on Switch.

488
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I was like, no, it's on PC.

489
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And he's like, I'm opening Steam.

490
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So we already ended up buying two copies.

491
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, yeah, I don't think it was on sale this week.

492
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, no, it's too soon with the sale.

493
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah, I've been trying to watch the Steam sales

494
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
to see if there's anything interesting on there,

495
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
but I've been not buying anything.

496
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Anything I buy, it's like, I'm not going to play that.

497
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's like, yeah, I could buy Earth Defense Force 5,

498
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
but am I really going to play that anytime soon?

499
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Probably not.

500
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So I just have to hold off and get set mania done.

501
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So then when set mania is done,

502
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and if I have any extra free time,

503
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I can go to actually doing game development again

504
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
instead of trying to develop a theme for set mania.

505
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Let me quickly talk about Katamari Damacy reroll, though.

506
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I didn't get to play a ton of it,

507
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
but I did open it up, play through the tutorial,

508
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
first couple stages.

509
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So it's the PlayStation 2 game,

510
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
but now all redone and widescreen,

511
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I guess would probably be the biggest change

512
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
because the original game was, what, 2002, 2003?

513
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It was right around when this show started,

514
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
when that game first came out for the PlayStation 2.

515
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It is funny, and a lot of people are razzing it for this,

516
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
is that it was a $20 budget game

517
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
when it first came out for the PlayStation 2,

518
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
but now they want, what, 40 bucks for it, right?

519
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
30.

520
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Oh, 30. Well, still, it's more than 20.

521
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah.

522
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But it is HD, it is all that stuff.

523
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So honestly, if you played the original,

524
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
then you know exactly what you're going to get.

525
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
They rebuilt the engine, so they rebuilt it in Unity.

526
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Low-key, it's the same game.

527
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's the same game.

528
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
They didn't really add a lot to it or anything.

529
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's the same game, which isn't a bad thing.

530
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And I realize, since it's been, what, a good 13 years at least,

531
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't know, probably longer,

532
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
since Katamari Damacy originally came out,

533
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
there's probably a lot of people maybe in their 20s or so

534
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
that didn't discover it when they were younger,

535
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and so now have a chance to discover it again.

536
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So if you've never played any Katamari whatsoever,

537
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I think it's definitely worth checking out.

538
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And for somebody like me who hasn't had a chance

539
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
to play it in a long time, I'm really into it.

540
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I have one minor bitch, though, about it,

541
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
because this was like, what are they smoking type of thing?

542
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay, so you haven't opened yours on PC, right?

543
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
No, I haven't.

544
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So here's the gag about the whole thing.

545
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So when you launch it, it comes up in a window that's 720p,

546
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
which, okay, whatever, like, where are my options to resize it

547
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
or anything like that?

548
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You have to play through the tutorial,

549
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
which includes the 5 centimeter to 10 centimeter,

550
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
like the first introductory stage,

551
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
before you get to that menu area

552
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
where the game brings up a special splash screen that says,

553
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
you really need to save your game right now,

554
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
or you're gonna have to do what you just did all over again

555
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
next time you open the game.

556
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And I'm like, what?

557
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But all right.

558
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Why?

559
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Weird ass design choices.

560
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I don't have a good explanation.

561
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But then once you finally do that,

562
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
you can go in and finally change the display settings.

563
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Absolutely.

564
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So you can play in 2K and, you know, all that.

565
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It will render in 4K.

566
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't know if that necessarily means it's using 4K textures,

567
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
but the game will play in a 4K window.

568
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I think all the textures are pretty low res, aren't they?

569
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's Katamari Damacy, you guys.

570
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's not frickin' like, you know, Madden 4K sport event of the summer.

571
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I keep seeing, like, you keep browsing the Steam forums for that game,

572
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and I see people running it on the GPD,

573
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
the GPD, like, portable little computer thing

574
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
that looks like a little handheld device.

575
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So that thing could run on a pretty low-end PC.

576
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, no.

577
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But, well, you know, of course they beefed it up and everything.

578
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But it runs, I mean, I like to play a lot of my games in 2K

579
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
because my graphics card is still a little, eh, you know,

580
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I just do really 4K video and things like that.

581
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But, I mean, it looks really good.

582
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Once you get past the tutorial and all that, it looks good.

583
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But it's one of those design choices where you're like,

584
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Namco, what are you thinking?

585
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Like, that should have been, like, the first menu that comes up.

586
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Or, I mean, some games just have a separate little application,

587
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
like Final Fantasy XIII, I think, has a separate app you run

588
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
to configure it all, and then when you go in the game it's all there.

589
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But I was like, what?

590
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
A lot of Unity games will have you just pop up the screen

591
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
that actually shows, you know, here's some settings,

592
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and then you go into the game and stuff,

593
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
but maybe they just didn't want people to know it was running in Unity?

594
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Or it's something to do with the lazy fucking port from the Switch.

595
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh, yeah, or it could be that.

596
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Because on the Switch, you wouldn't have to do any of that.

597
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The Switch has one mode to play that's probably 720.

598
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So that's probably, honestly, what it is.

599
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's just lazy fucking porting from the Switch.

600
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So that's why I kind of have to read it a little bit.

601
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I mean, don't get me wrong, the game's great,

602
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and you're only stuck in that mode for five minutes,

603
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
but it's still one of those things that makes you go,

604
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
guys, what a freaking, like, lazy thing that you could have done better, right?

605
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So it was just weird.

606
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But otherwise, I love Katamari.

607
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Other games that I've been playing this week include

608
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
same old, same old, wow, World of Warcraft,

609
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
because they had the new, they put out the new patch not that long ago,

610
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
so the Warlock I had now can do stuff in Darkshore,

611
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
which is like another, this means nothing to you,

612
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
another zone where you can do more, like, daily quests and things like that.

613
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Look, it's one of those things where I'm starting to get a little better at,

614
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'll do that on screen A, and then on screen B,

615
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm watching this week's Drag Race.

616
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Or I'm watching something I don't really need to watch,

617
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I just kind of listen to, like, maybe a talk show on cable or something.

618
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So I kind of just zone out and play wow

619
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
while I kind of absorb the information from whatever I'm watching.

620
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So I've been playing a little World of Warcraft like that,

621
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and a little bit of Final Fantasy as well,

622
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Shane and I were messing around in that game the other night,

623
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
because they have a winter event that I need to do.

624
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We got sidetracked, he was farming sheep.

625
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Don't they have, like, the blue mages coming soon?

626
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Blue mage, they dated blue mage June, or June, January 13th, I think.

627
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Don't quote me on that. I think the patch was January 6th,

628
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and blue mage unlocks one week later on the 13th.

629
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So they're, because they just did their live letter for, like,

630
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
explaining everything about this next patch,

631
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and everything leading up to the next expansion.

632
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But what I was going to say is the winter event is supposed to be a music game thing.

633
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So I haven't, yeah, I haven't really explored it yet,

634
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
but they've done some really cute events,

635
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
like, they had one where you went into a dungeon,

636
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
but it was, like, a holiday dungeon.

637
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I think it was, like, Halloween or something,

638
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
you went into one of the scary dungeons,

639
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
you had to avoid ghosts or something.

640
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And then I know they had one that was, like,

641
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the old school dungeon crawler,

642
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
meaning, like, think, like, Fantasy Star,

643
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
when you're in the first person dungeon,

644
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
but it's those really rudimentary walls,

645
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
because, you know what I mean, like,

646
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Ultima III had them, I'm trying to think of other games that had them back in the day,

647
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
but Fantasy Star is probably the best example of it.

648
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But they had one like that,

649
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
but it was really easy to play, because you would see that,

650
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
but you would see, like, a map right next to it.

651
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's just like you were navigating a maze with your arrow keys, basically.

652
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So they did something like that,

653
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
but I like it when they do, like, super cute things like that.

654
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
My favorite, not to get too off base,

655
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
my favorite holiday thing they've ever done in Final Fantasy XIV

656
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
was, I think it was the third anniversary of the game.

657
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
They did an anniversary event,

658
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and as part of the event, you would transport to this,

659
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
or teleport to this magical place

660
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
that was basically a workshop

661
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
where you interacted with the developers of the game.

662
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And they kind of, you know, there was a lot of tongue-in-cheek type of stuff,

663
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
but there was one, you talk to a character that basically represents it,

664
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and it's called, like, Yoshi P or something like that,

665
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
which is Yoshida, who's the director, producer of the game.

666
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And basically he says, like, the character says something like,

667
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm kind of paraphrasing here,

668
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
but, uh, we know that it was a rough road the first couple years,

669
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and we want to thank you so much for sticking with us,

670
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and, you know, we're gonna tell all these new stories,

671
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and you're here to, and I was like,

672
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
that was, like, it's just like a really nice thing,

673
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
it was a very humble type of move, because, you know,

674
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I think a lot of, there's a lot of awareness around Square Enix

675
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
about how bad the first version of Final Fantasy XIV bombed.

676
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But that was, like, so long ago.

677
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And that's where my head's at, is I'm like,

678
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
that was so long ago at this point, like,

679
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
forgiven, forgotten, because the game is, like, way better now.

680
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Wasn't it, like, 2014?

681
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Before that, like, I, no, maybe you're right,

682
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
maybe it was 2014.

683
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I mean, we're on our, let's see, Shadowbringers is 29th,

684
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
no, Shadowbringers is 2019,

685
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
uh, Stormblood was 2017, Heavensward 15,

686
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
so Realm Reborn was 2013.

687
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So the original Final Fantasy XIV was around 2011,

688
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I think, when that first came out.

689
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So, um, so, yeah.

690
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I think we could just give them a break now,

691
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
considering it's like, you know,

692
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
look at how some of these other games have launched.

693
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I think you have a pass.

694
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah, yeah, I think they have a pass.

695
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And right now, I mean, I don't know, like,

696
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
you gotta read everything on Reddit with a grain of salt,

697
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
but I do look at the Final Fantasy XIV Reddit once in a while,

698
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and there's a lot of people that are posting, like,

699
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
hi, I'm really pissed off at Blizzard right now,

700
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
so I'm coming over to Final Fantasy XIV from WoW,

701
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and oh my god, I love this game,

702
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I've been sleeping on it so long, and all this stuff.

703
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And to be fair, I mean, I'm not trying to, like, bash World of Warcraft,

704
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
because here I am, where I'm like,

705
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I've been playing XIV for so long, like, I just,

706
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I need to see other people for a little bit,

707
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
so I'm like, I remember this game I used to flirt with,

708
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
so I went back to World of Warcraft,

709
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and since I haven't played it seriously in so long,

710
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm like, I'm kind of, I'm kind of into this right now,

711
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
like, this is, this is something I haven't seen in a long time,

712
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
you know, and yeah, so I feel like,

713
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't want to say I'm on the opposite side of the fence,

714
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
because I truly, truly appreciate what both games bring to the table.

715
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But to bring it back to something you said earlier in the show,

716
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
in the beginning, about, like, articles that fill this time of year,

717
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and all the clickbait stuff,

718
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
a lot of, like, what is happening at Blizzard type of articles going up.

719
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Has Activision killed Blizzard?

720
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Has Activision hurt Blizzard?

721
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And, like, you know, outlining, like, all of the weird things

722
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
that Blizzard has done this year, obviously Diablo Immortal,

723
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
but now this Heroes of the Storm thing we got into last week

724
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
has a lot of people feeling raw,

725
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
apparently it's already affecting the game,

726
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
you try to go in there and look for matches,

727
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and it's taking longer and longer, because people are just like,

728
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
well, if they're done, so am I, peace out, you know, type of thing.

729
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And then World of Warcraft, not everybody's really happy with the expansion,

730
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I mean, I don't, maybe it's because I kind of didn't really play a lot of last one,

731
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
but I'm like, I'm into this expansion, whatever,

732
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
like, I'm not interested in raiding or endgame stuff,

733
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
but as a dirty, filthy casual, it's cool, you know what I mean?

734
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
There's a lot of people that are like,

735
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
has Activision, like, fucked Blizzard beyond repair?

736
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And a lot of that talk going on, so it's kind of interesting, I suppose.

737
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So, going to chat at Twitch TV and VOG Network,

738
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Renji221 over there says,

739
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
you talk about games coming back from a bad launch,

740
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I think No Man's Sky is another good example. Oh, absolutely.

741
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You know, it joins a club with Diablo 3, in my opinion,

742
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I mean, even though we talk about Diablo Immortal,

743
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
part of the reason why Blizzard wanted to take that template for Diablo 3

744
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and make it a mobile game is because Diablo 3 was saved.

745
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
But remember, when Diablo 3 first came out, ooh,

746
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but Final Fantasy XIV, you know, is another great example of that.

747
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So, yeah, we do live in this really interesting era

748
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
where video games can be saved.

749
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Some people would argue Destiny 2 is in this club as well.

750
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Is that when Destiny 2 kind of first launched?

751
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, there's some problems, but it's come a long way.

752
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah, but a lot of that has to do with just being non-transparent

753
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
with your users that are just changing shit and,

754
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
oh, oh, now that you discovered it, I guess we should tell you about it.

755
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And it's like, fuck it, fuck that shit, you know?

756
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Oh, I don't know. They're trying, I guess.

757
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But Destiny, I've never been able to get on board with that game.

758
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And it sounded cool, but I was like, eh.

759
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I should probably revisit it. I mean, I do own Destiny 2.

760
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I bought it when it first came out.

761
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It got free, so.

762
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Well, yeah, because they gave it away not that long ago,

763
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
so hopefully you all pick that up because that's done now.

764
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But even if you didn't, you can still get the base game super cheap

765
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
because they really want to sell you the expansion.

766
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
They don't really want to sell you the base game anymore.

767
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
They want to make their money off the expansion.

768
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
They want to sell you the in-game currency.

769
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And all that stuff, too. And Carlton dances, or whatever.

770
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Anyway, also in our Twitch chat,

771
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
DJ Rama S says, Blizzard has become complacent.

772
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Some people are arguing that a little bit, too.

773
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Some people are saying that that's the pressure Activision is putting on them,

774
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
is that Blizzard is not putting out games fast enough.

775
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But, I mean, the Blizzard formula has worked with them for so long.

776
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
When they do put things out, most of the time it's really, really good.

777
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Diablo 3 was an exception.

778
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I mean, I don't know. I don't know.

779
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We'll have to see what the next big thing is.

780
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I still think Blizzard does better than a lot of people.

781
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But look at Overwatch.

782
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Like, Overwatch is a game changer in so many ways.

783
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And people forget, like, Blizzard also made Overwatch.

784
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That is a game that's been out for quite some time.

785
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
People still talk about it.

786
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It is changing the landscape of esports as we know it, right?

787
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So you can't say that Blizzard is just doing nothing but fucking up.

788
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
There's a lot they're getting right, too.

789
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I think Overwatch is the best example of that in a lot of ways.

790
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But that's just my opinion.

791
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Which, by the way, is something else I played this week. Overwatch.

792
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I saw so many friends of mine streaming Overwatch that I was like,

793
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I need to get in there and play some Overwatch.

794
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And I've been missing out.

795
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And I haven't done any of the holiday event. Well, now I have.

796
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But I hadn't at that point done, like, any of the holiday event.

797
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I need to get some of the loot boxes and all that good stuff.

798
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And I love every match right now has that new Ashe in it.

799
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The one that Jennifer Hale voices, the cowgirl.

800
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And just, like, every minute or so you just hear,

801
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Baa! Because that's her ultimate.

802
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
That's what she calls Bob in.

803
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So you just hear, like, you'll hear it from across the map.

804
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Baa! And it sounds like...

805
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
This is obscure, but have you ever seen the YouTube clip

806
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
of, like, the husband calling contest at the state fair

807
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
where the old ladies get on stage and they're calling their husbands?

808
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That's what it sounds like.

809
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Somebody out there has got to know what I'm talking about.

810
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But that's what it sounds like to me when Ashe calls Bob

811
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
from down the hallway or whatever.

812
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Act F says, Overwatch is kind of screwing up too with some things.

813
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'd love for you to elaborate on that, Act F.

814
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, what can't join this club?

815
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Mass Effect Andromeda. Wow. Way to kill my mood.

816
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Thanks a lot for that. Jerk.

817
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Alright, anyway. Spyro says, I played Overwatch last night.

818
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's pretty fun. Yeah, I'm still a fan.

819
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I watched the holiday event.

820
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It was a lot of Yetis falling off cliffs.

821
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I haven't really played...

822
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Like, there's a whole thing with Mei and Winston and all that stuff.

823
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I haven't really got into that or played that, really.

824
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So, yeah. I don't know.

825
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Anyway. Alright, let's move on.

826
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'll try to get... If I can work it in later,

827
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'll get Act F's follow up on the Overwatch thoughts.

828
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But I want to get into the news, so let's get to it.

829
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Loki. Not a lot of news this week.

830
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
This is in a normal week. I'm gonna be honest.

831
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
In a normal week, I don't think I'd want to give this side any attention,

832
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
to be quite honest. I think it's...

833
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We know this side is shady, right? This side is shady.

834
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And so, now we're hearing some other shady stuff.

835
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah, so apparently G2A, who wasn't very legit to begin with.

836
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I mean, a lot of people dealing with stolen keys

837
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
or just all sorts of thievery and stuff.

838
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Well now, apparently they said that they are charging users for 180 days of inactivity.

839
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So if you haven't logged into your G2A account,

840
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
for 180 days, you'll be charged one pound.

841
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And it'll be taken from the G2A wallet.

842
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
A dollar, essentially.

843
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah, one dollar.

844
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If you want to convert it into, you know, our money.

845
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And apparently they said, you know,

846
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
there's gonna be an email sent three days before the charge

847
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
to remind users to log in to void the fee.

848
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And if there's no funds in the wallet, then they won't charge anything.

849
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
That just...

850
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's just, it's basically their reasoning for this.

851
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
They said, it costs money to upkeep accounts.

852
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Bullshit.

853
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
This includes server maintenance, IT infrastructure.

854
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Come on, you guys. It's data in a fucking table.

855
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's bullshit.

856
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
As a supervised financial institution, we must meet many requirements

857
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
related to the monitoring service of each account.

858
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Really? There's monitoring?

859
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
See, that's the thing.

860
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I've heard of banks charging this kind of thing.

861
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Like, if you don't have enough money and savings,

862
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
or checking, or you're not having enough deposited,

863
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
that's when they charge you like that monthly service fee or whatever, right?

864
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
But that's a bank.

865
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That's not some shady website that's stolen you,

866
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
or allegedly stolen you keys from other places or whatever,

867
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and turning around and reselling them and that sort of thing.

868
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It's not a bank.

869
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's a very different type of thing.

870
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Just don't do business with them.

871
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Just make it easy.

872
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Shitty company is still shitty.

873
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I was gonna ask, how would you feel if somebody like Steam

874
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
enacted a rule like this, but they're not gonna.

875
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That won't be a problem, because I'm always logged into Steam.

876
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I can't think of anybody that would have to charge me that.

877
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, I know. I still try to log into Steam once a week

878
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
to just maintain my trading card eligibility.

879
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I couldn't tell you the last time I've had a pack of trading cards drop.

880
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Do people even still do the trading card thing on Steam anymore?

881
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I got a pack.

882
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It was in my box.

883
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I just sold off a bunch of the cards that you get

884
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
doing your Game of the Year awards or whatever.

885
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Three cents!

886
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You vote. Yeah, so you get that.

887
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Woo! Three cents!

888
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So yeah, I've been getting a ton of email notifications

889
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
because I've been selling cards.

890
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Because I'm like, I don't give a shit about these cards.

891
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm not doing anything with them.

892
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm just gonna sell them because people are dumb enough to buy them.

893
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And so, you know, I like a dollar.

894
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
RunJumpStomp in their chat over at VOG Network on Twitch says,

895
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
How is this legal?

896
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
When I first read it, I was like, wait a minute, isn't that illegal?

897
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But I'm thinking of the gift card thing.

898
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So I don't know if this is true in every state,

899
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,000
but like, gift cards in California cannot decrease in value if they're inactive.

900
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And they can't expire.

901
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And they can't expire or anything like that.

902
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The only way you can get screwed on those is if the company goes under.

903
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Like if you have a Kohl's card or something.

904
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Borders.

905
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
RadioShack. You have a RadioShack gift card?

906
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Twice or us!

907
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You're fucked at this point. There's nothing you can do.

908
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You can try and take it to the bankruptcy quarters, honestly.

909
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Like usually there's a period of time that you can use it with the liquidator,

910
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and then that's it. It's done.

911
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So that's really the only way you can kind of get screwed out of those gift cards

912
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
that the company goes under.

913
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But otherwise, like if you find a Best Buy gift card in your couch from like 2004,

914
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and it's got 15 bucks on it, Best Buy has to honor it.

915
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So that's, at least in California.

916
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I don't know about other states and all their laws.

917
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I know there's other states that have similar laws.

918
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But unfortunately, this isn't exactly a gift card, I guess.

919
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And G2A, I'm sure, can't even be based in the states as it is, hence why it's one euro.

920
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
We all know it's a little bit shady, because they're probably not running in the US.

921
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
They're probably running in a more friendly country to some of the things they do.

922
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah.

923
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But yeah, so sadly that law wouldn't apply over there,

924
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and you're kind of dealing with international issues anyway.

925
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah.

926
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Also, then Run Jump Stop says,

927
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I don't get how companies can change the terms of service after the fact.

928
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Unfortunately, they do it all the time.

929
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It's in their terms of service that they can change the terms of service.

930
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It is that, but sometimes you launch Steam.

931
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Just watch, next time you launch Steam, after a couple weeks, it might say,

932
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
you need to accept our newest update before we can get into it,

933
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and you have to scroll through and agree again.

934
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And a lot of games with persistent online worlds and things like that will do that.

935
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Some of them will be nice and tell you in very plain words.

936
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Here's what we changed.

937
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I want to say Discord.

938
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I talk good about them a lot.

939
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
They do something like this.

940
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Because they phrase it in a funny way, like,

941
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
here, for a normal human being, here is what we have changed in the thing,

942
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and then you get the full legal language underneath it.

943
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You know what I mean?

944
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But companies, I guess, don't always do that kind of thing.

945
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So, you know, technically, when you scroll down and agree,

946
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
technically, technically you're accepting it.

947
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But I've still seen class action lawsuits and all that stuff happen anyway.

948
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yeah.

949
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Like when PlayStation had a class action lawsuit,

950
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
even though I believe it is in their terms of service,

951
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you agreed to arbitrate or something like that.

952
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Like, it doesn't stop a lot of that stuff from happening.

953
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yeah.

954
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
If a lawyer wants to take the case, they'll try it.

955
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So, let's see.

956
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Going to chat for some more comments.

957
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Bobby Blackwell says it needs to get up to the courts,

958
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
and unfortunately nobody has the money to keep fighting all the way up to the Supreme Court.

959
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The Supreme Court has never heard a case involving a software terms of service.

960
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Very interesting.

961
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I guess that's true.

962
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The last big Supreme Court case I can think of involving games,

963
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I'm sure there's been others.

964
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The one that comes to mind is the one here in California where it was Schwarzenegger,

965
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
the governor at the time, versus, I forget the name,

966
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
but it was that whole thing about the mature games being sold at GameStop.

967
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Right.

968
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
They had to check the ID, and the Supreme Court struck it down

969
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
because there was no consistent measure about what made a mature game, basically.

970
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It was turning into a matter of opinion.

971
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Are nipples being shown? Yes.

972
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Mature game.

973
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah, exactly.

974
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And it brings that whole thing into who's to say what's mature for you versus what's mature for me.

975
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Like, some people might allow their kids to hear the F word and the S word,

976
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
but would never want them to see a boob.

977
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But some of it is complete vice versa.

978
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Like, a boob's a boob, but I don't want you using the F word.

979
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And that's really up to a parent to decide.

980
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Run Jump Stomp says that Mario has nipples.

981
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yes.

982
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And he is very mature.

983
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Mamma mia.

984
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Alright, anyway.

985
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So, yeah.

986
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I won't be using G2A anytime soon.

987
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I hope this is the type of thing that just kind of stays with them

988
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and their weird kind of business practices.

989
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But, yeah, I'm not going to be exactly going over there to use their services anytime soon.

990
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And I imagine you guys probably won't either, so let's move on to our next story

991
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
that has to do with Microsoft and their All Access offer.

992
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
The All Access offer was the subsidized Xbox One bundle that was available at certain Microsoft stores.

993
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Of course we don't have any nearby, unfortunately.

994
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
No. Well, I mean, there's one in the Bay Area, which I've been to a few times.

995
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It looked kind of cool. I wanted to...

996
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
They're nice stores.

997
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I haven't been in the one, but I did want to actually...

998
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You know what's funny about those stores, though?

999
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I swear to God, the last time I was in the one in San Francisco

1000
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
was in that super nice mall, like, Kitty Corner from the Metreon.

1001
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yeah.

1002
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's where the movie theater is. It's in there.

1003
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It's on the third floor.

1004
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
The last time I was in there, I swear to God, every computer, everything, it was Fortnite.

1005
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Everybody was playing fucking Fortnite.

1006
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
What?

1007
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
On the Xboxes, on the laptops.

1008
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Fortnite?

1009
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Fortnite, Fortnite, Fortnite.

1010
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
They were probably playing each other.

1011
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
No Forza, no Minecraft?

1012
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Well, they would have a computer up front that was running Forza that nobody was playing,

1013
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
which is a crime because Forza's great.

1014
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Yeah.

1015
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But, yeah, no, Fortnite, Fortnite, Fortnite.

1016
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That's all they were demoing on all those computers.

1017
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But anyway, I do...

1018
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The Microsoft store, obviously, there's a lot in common with the Apple store, a little

1019
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
competition head to head there.

1020
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's very well lit, very, you know, lots of people.

1021
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's the hangout.

1022
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Everyone goes to the hangout there.

1023
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It is.

1024
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But anyway, so you could get this all access deal at these stores.

1025
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You would be in a two year agreement and you could get an Xbox One or an Xbox One X for

1026
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
kind of like a lower or cheaper price.

1027
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And then you get Xbox Live Gold and the Game Pass.

1028
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And that's a big deal because the Game Pass is the like Netflix of Xbox games, basically,

1029
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
which, you know, is one of those things that I think is just going to get bigger and bigger

1030
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
as we move into 2019.

1031
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It's a great service.

1032
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And 2020.

1033
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I mean, it is.

1034
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And I'm really curious.

1035
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I really suspect when we start talking about PlayStation 5 and Nintendo, I feel like they

1036
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
won't get on the bandwagon until later.

1037
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
They're like kind of with the Switch online, the classic libraries, like you tried that

1038
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
whole type of thing.

1039
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But I would be very curious to see what Sony is going to do to respond to this, like with

1040
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
PlayStation 5, because I think it's gonna be something that's built into PlayStation

1041
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
5.

1042
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Yeah.

1043
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Like I looked at the classic library.

1044
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
In fact, I was going through there and it's like, here's the new games.

1045
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm like, yeah, that's nice, I guess.

1046
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yeah.

1047
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So anyway, the point is, Microsoft is ending this program on December 31st, 2018.

1048
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So the all access bundle will be seized at the Microsoft retail location.

1049
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So you still have a little bit of time for this.

1050
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But what's interesting about this, Microsoft isn't saying that this is going away forever.

1051
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It's just going away for now, because this whole thing was a test to see if this whole

1052
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
thing was going to be viable in the first place.

1053
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So, but they're already kind of hinting it's coming back.

1054
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So I would assume, yes, it's viable.

1055
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You seem to offer it more places other than the Microsoft store.

1056
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Well, there's that.

1057
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And I wonder if Microsoft isn't going to let it go to sleep and hibernate for a little

1058
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
while and then bring it back.

1059
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
When, Loki, when did they bring it back?

1060
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
E3, because the floor is virtually theirs and theirs alone at E3 this next year.

1061
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So they could unveil the new pass.

1062
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And wouldn't it be great if they had a diskless console or something?

1063
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I'm fan wanking here, but wouldn't it be something if Microsoft had some type of new console

1064
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
to go with this whole thing?

1065
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You know what I mean?

1066
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah.

1067
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah.

1068
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Diskless console.

1069
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
We'll see.

1070
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
We'll see.

1071
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Or their new console.

1072
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Maybe they're going to do something with that.

1073
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't know.

1074
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And this whole thing, because I think Microsoft really wants to push this game pass thing,

1075
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
but I don't know.

1076
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I mean, we'll see.

1077
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I think E3 would be really the time to see about that.

1078
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So anyway, I mean, it was a contract plan, but it wasn't like, it wasn't shady.

1079
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Like I do think overall it was a decent deal if it's what you wanted, if it worked for you.

1080
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I mean, yeah, I think, you know, it's a decent deal.

1081
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Looking in chat over at VOG Network on Twitch TV, Runchum Stomp suggests that Nintendo will

1082
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
do it sometime in 2030.

1083
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yes.

1084
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Maybe for the Switch 2, Switch U or whatever they end up doing next.

1085
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I gotta tell you, like, their stuff, that is the hardest thing about Nintendo consoles

1086
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
is their stuff does not depreciate in value, according to them.

1087
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They don't drop the prices of anything because like, Mario Kart 7, I remember purchasing

1088
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
that when that first came out.

1089
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's still full price.

1090
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
You know, Wii U games in particular are now getting more expensive because Nintendo is

1091
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
essentially like, just put them all on a boat, set it out to sea and set the boat on fire,

1092
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
metaphorically.

1093
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Nintendo is like, has cut ties with the U at this point.

1094
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So it's kind of driving the Wii U game prices up at this point, because now it's like they're

1095
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
collector's items, because how many people really ever had the Wii U and the Wii U?

1096
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's interesting how that's all playing out.

1097
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Because I was looking at some of the, like, I'll see the eBay ads come up online.

1098
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I'm like, why are these games selling for like $60, $65?

1099
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh, because Nintendo isn't making them anymore.

1100
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So if you want to get them, this is like the only way to do it.

1101
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's ridiculous.

1102
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
A little bit, a little bit.

1103
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
But, you know, a lot of rare game consoles, this kind of thing tends to happen, right?

1104
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
We can go all the way back to like the Sega Saturn, the Dreamcast.

1105
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I mean, heck, probably a black band Final Fantasy 7 or Suikoden 1 or 2.

1106
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Those still go for, Suikoden 2 I think still goes for a lot of money, doesn't it?

1107
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So, I mean, less than it did before it came out on the PlayStation Classics.

1108
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But I think as a collectible, those things still make a lot of money, if I'm not sure.

1109
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
If I'm not mistaken.

1110
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So, Bobby says, if I didn't have a bandwidth cap, I'd be all over Xbox Game Pass.

1111
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah, I mean, that is something they may have to address, maybe cut a deal with the cable providers.

1112
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I think the bandwidth caps are going to have to start to give a little bit,

1113
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
as more and more people really start to push back against the cable providers.

1114
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I think just as we get more 4K streaming, I think market demand is going to force those caps up.

1115
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I do think that'll have to happen.

1116
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They'll just put laws in place that'll eliminate bandwidth caps and then they'll still throttle instead.

1117
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Well, I don't think they can now because like certain states kind of danced around the net neutrality thing

1118
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and like California passed a stronger thing and it's going to be interesting now that the house is going back to blue.

1119
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I don't know politically if that can be countered now at this point or what the deal is going to happen.

1120
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.

1121
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I don't know. I'm not going to get into politics that much, but it will be interesting to see how the net neutrality thing keeps going.

1122
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Yeah, and a few folks in chat talking about the net neutrality thing, but remember now states,

1123
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
because California is like, oh, hell no to what, you know, the FCC did and all this.

1124
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
So now there's going to be that fight.

1125
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And y'all know this being the good old U.S. S.A., it ain't going to be solved overnight.

1126
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
There's going to be a new president no matter which team it is.

1127
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
There's going to be a new president before this thing is solved.

1128
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
You know what I mean? Yeah, it's going to go on for years.

1129
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So we'll see. I, I really feel like what's ultimately going to happen is probably like some other FCC guys going to come in there and strike the whole thing before the legal courts and all this like ends up ultimately figuring it out because that's that's the way things tend to run in my opinion.

1130
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So anyway, let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.

1131
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So there's this indie game Celeste that's actually been selling very well. They've sold 500,000 copies.

1132
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's been, I think it got like Indie Game of the Year or something like that during the game awards.

1133
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Yeah, game awards got some good stuff. I have friends that really love that game.

1134
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But anyways, what with that, though, Matt Torsen, the creator of the game, basically said, you know, hey, we're working on some farewell levels that are going to be ready in 2019.

1135
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
They're very hard and we'll be announcing what's going to be next for us in the years as well.

1136
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Also with that, they're saying that they're the soundtrack has sold 6000 copies across all platforms, been streamed on Spotify four million times.

1137
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And I didn't even know it was on Spotify.

1138
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah. And if you haven't picked up a copy of Celeste yet, well, guess what?

1139
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
If you happen to have Xbox Live Gold, then you're going to be getting that as one of your free games with gold in January.

1140
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
So it's going to be Celeste for the month of January for Xbox One.

1141
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And then for the the 16th through February 15th will be WRC.

1142
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And then on Xbox 360, you're getting Lara Croft, Guardian of Light and Far Cry 2.

1143
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Those are some good picks, too.

1144
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah.

1145
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Guardian of Light. It's a little bit old at this point, but that was a good game.

1146
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
That was a good co-op puzzler thing.

1147
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But yeah, I'm now and now I'm from a from a consumer standpoint, I'm kind of happy I slept on Celeste now that I get the free copy on Xbox.

1148
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But I know I know the developer doesn't make as much money when you do it that way.

1149
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But they have sold a half a million copies.

1150
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You know, it's Celeste is on like a million different platforms.

1151
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
If I like it that much, I'll probably end up double dipping.

1152
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It'll probably come out on Sony's platforms as well.

1153
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So I thought Celeste already was on Sony's platform as a game.

1154
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Oh, no, not as a free game.

1155
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
No, I think, you know, usually when it's free and one, it becomes free on the other eventually.

1156
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yeah, you're right. You're right. That's that's very true.

1157
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So, yeah, I need to check out Celeste.

1158
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's one of those games that's like supposed to be like bang your head on the wall hard, but it's a lot of fun.

1159
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So, yeah, I need to it's just one of those games.

1160
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
There's only so many hours in the day to play games, especially when it's not the job you get paid to do all day long.

1161
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
So, yeah, I got to have to pick that up at some point.

1162
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So anyhow, and some folks in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network absolutely agree.

1163
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And Run Jump Stomp says, if these are very hard, I wonder how you would classify the other levels as far as difficulty goes.

1164
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Ain't that the truth? Because my understanding is the game is kind of hard to begin with anyway.

1165
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So anyhow, let's move on and talk about another thing that's been circulating the blogs.

1166
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And that is this whole update to Spider-Man on the PlayStation 4, which is a game a lot of people are enjoying.

1167
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And people were saying, hey, what are we going to get?

1168
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,000
What are we going to get the Spider-Man suit from the Tobey Maguire starred movies with Sam Raimi, if you will, movies from what?

1169
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:44,000
What was the first one of those, like 2002, 2003, when the old trilogy started somewhere in the aughts, the early aughts somewhere when that series started.

1170
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And people really wanted that Spider-Man suit to the extent that they were like doing social media campaigns and Reddit posts and all this crap online to like,

1171
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't want to say bully Insomniac Games into doing it, but it kind of was like, I mean, like back off. Jesus. You know what I mean?

1172
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Well, it's like we've given you all the other suits.

1173
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I know. Well, first off, the game is pretty fucking good. Isn't that the most important thing?

1174
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Like, do you really like, I can't believe a bunch of mostly boys are complaining about dress up online.

1175
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I mean, really? Jesus. Anyway, but the Sam Raimi suit, it did end up coming out.

1176
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Now, before we, because I'm sure I'm not looking at chat at the moment, but I'm sure it's going to light up with this before then.

1177
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I don't see this as them giving in to demands because to get an agreement like this takes time and agreements and paper and somebody had to design that suit for the game.

1178
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So this was a weeks, if not months long process that was probably on some original design document a long time ago about post launch follow up thing.

1179
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Like this was in the works for a long time.

1180
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But unfortunately now people have the perception of, yay, we won. We complained, we bitched, we cyber bullied and we got what we wanted.

1181
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
We changed Mass Effect's ending and then we changed, we added a suit to Spider-Man.

1182
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So it's kind of unfortunate that there is the perception that this type of behavior works because Loki, I don't understand, why do, and it is kind of an issue with gamers.

1183
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I mean, I don't know, do film buffs do this too? I don't know.

1184
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I don't even know why it matters.

1185
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's an issue with gamers that they bitch and bitch and bitch because games have DLC and because games can be changed after the fact.

1186
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
To be honest with this game, I don't even know why.

1187
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Why is it gamer culture that fucking does this?

1188
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Because they have the comic book suit in there that's pretty awesome because it's all done in like the comic book print style and everything.

1189
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,000
And it looks like, you know, it makes everything kind of like hyper real because it's so, you know, comic book-y.

1190
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
But I don't know. I don't know why people are bitching about the one specific suit.

1191
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
If you showed me like a bunch of Spider-Man suits, I wouldn't be able to point out which one is the Sam Raimi suit.

1192
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
So maybe I'm not the, I am not the target demographic.

1193
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I still haven't played the game and it looks awesome, but I haven't played it.

1194
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yeah, and I'm with you there. Like, am I really going to figure out the subtleties of the Spider-Man suit and all that stuff?

1195
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Probably not. I don't know.

1196
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It could be worse. It could be like the, you know, Joel Schumacher Spider-Man suit where giant nipples are on it instead, you know, but...

1197
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Uh, TigerKalonChat says, yeah, Sonic fans are complaining about the silhouette of that Sonic the Hedgehog movie poster and want Paramount to fix the design.

1198
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Yeah, but it's...

1199
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
That's a little different.

1200
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It's a...

1201
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Here's why. Here's why it's different. Here's why it's different.

1202
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Because it's not a game. It's, it's a game's representation in film when games do not have the best track record of moving to film.

1203
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Some have been okay, like the original Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider's done alright, you know, both the Angelina Jolie movie one.

1204
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I think, like, the Pokemon Detective Pikachu looks awesome.

1205
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah, I mean, I love Silent Hill, but Resident Evil, I mean, was a huge, I mean, even though the game's influence is not, I mean, what?

1206
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's a garbage movie.

1207
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
But it's, it's a popcorn movie.

1208
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
It's a fun popcorn movie.

1209
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
A lot of gore fans really like that type of stuff. It's a scary movie. People love that stuff.

1210
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I think I saw one, I didn't really watch any of those movies. I saw one in the middle. I don't even remember which one it is. It literally didn't matter, but...

1211
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Like, it was just entertaining. It was stupid. I knew nothing. I mean, it's like, there's all these, okay, I see the tie, oh, and there's Wesker, okay, cool.

1212
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
It's just, it's just group of humans that get picked off one by one in hideous ways.

1213
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And somehow we're the Matrix now. I don't know.

1214
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It's weird.

1215
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
But, I mean, but there's a lot of, okay, but we know there's a lot of bad movies, too, right? Like, I got two words for you.

1216
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Uwe Boll. Okay? Remember that guy's name? Right?

1217
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Or even more recent, Rampage.

1218
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:58,000
That was a choice. But, anyway, with that whole thing, so what my point is, we don't often see games represented very well in film.

1219
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So now it's like you're taking this fucking icon. Sonic the Hedgehog is a icon, not just of video gaming, but, like, of our youth, especially in your 30s and 40s.

1220
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Heck, even your 20s, you still know who Sonic is? That was a character that's always been around.

1221
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Think about the Mario Brothers movie.

1222
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Well, think about how that turned out. Imagine that now.

1223
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I mean, that is just like, what the fuck is that? Where did you get that from this?

1224
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I mean, I don't understand that, but in the Sonic thing, it's like...

1225
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:45,000
So it's different, and I'm never for, like, bullying or, you know, telling people to hurt themselves or horrible things about them and their families like that.

1226
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:53,000
That type of behavior on social media is garbage. I know none of you engage in that, but if you're even thinking about it, don't.

1227
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:02,000
But I'm all for sass. Just a little sass, right? Just a little constructive sass, a little tongue-in-cheek sass is fine.

1228
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And so when I do see some of these, like that poster of Sonic's legs up in the air on the Golden Gate Bridge, that whole thing, like, that needs to be sassed.

1229
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
You know what I mean? Like, it looks weird. So...

1230
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It's just like, I don't know. They're complaining in chat, but also they're saying Double Dragon is the movie that gives nightmares to neighbors.

1231
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:34,000
See, you have to understand, that point in the 90s when they were making, or even like I should say, the 80s, it was just like, everything is judge dread.

1232
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
All of the movies that come out, they're all like this post-apocalyptic future movie. Like, that's why Mario Brothers is like that.

1233
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It's like, it's fucking judge dread. You know, even Double Dragon is post-apocalyptic. It's... I don't know. None of them, they were so...

1234
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:58,000
They just wanted an excuse to make this type of movie, and so they got a property that they can kind of sort of pull in that direction, and that was it.

1235
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:06,000
AJ Twist at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says, I had high hopes for Sonic after the Detective Pikachu trailer, then the poster happened.

1236
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Yeah, that Detective Pikachu trailer, that caught me off guard in a different way. Like, I was not ready to see, like, a real Jigglypuff or that whole thing.

1237
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:23,000
But I'm curious. Like, that one, I'm not gonna sass that. I'm curious. I still wish it was Danny DeVito, but I gotta let it go. I'm curious about that movie for sure.

1238
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And Tigerclaw says, I hope the movie embraces the absurdity of Sonic being in the real world.

1239
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:40,000
You know what? If the movie is self-aware, if it's like the Twitter account, and it's tongue-in-cheek, and like Renji221 points out, Jim Carrey is playing Eggman.

1240
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I am gonna go see it day one, just because of that.

1241
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:50,000
If they let Jim Carrey be Jim Carrey, then maybe it'll be like Showgirls funny. You know what I mean?

1242
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
So bad it's kind of a John Waters film.

1243
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
A John Waters Sonic movie.

1244
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Things I never knew I needed. Oh my god. That would be the best.

1245
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That would be so fucking weird.

1246
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Oh, man. Anyway, if you don't know who John Waters is, like, just cinematic trash masterpiece.

1247
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:16,000
His most mainline thing was Hairspray. Like, the original one in the 80s with Divine, not after they made it a musical.

1248
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And we're not gonna talk about John Travolta. That was hideous. But the musical is still pretty good.

1249
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And I think they did a live one on NBC or one of those networks a couple years ago, and it was alright, too.

1250
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So, anyway. Yeah. And some folks in chat are saying, I'll wait for a trailer for Sonic.

1251
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And I'm, we'll wait, but you gotta sass those posters just a little bit, I think. Just a little bit.

1252
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Alright, anyway, let's do a couple more stories, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.

1253
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
So, unfortunately, with some of these older systems, they're just not getting updates anymore.

1254
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I know Grand Theft Auto 5 was doing that with the Xbox 360 as three versions.

1255
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Now, the same thing's gonna happen to Minecraft. Unfortunately, Minecraft on PlayStation 3, Vita, and Wii U are getting their final updates.

1256
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I didn't see Xbox 360 mentioned there, so I don't know if they quit that earlier or if they're still gonna be updating the 360 version, but I know it's basically the same thing.

1257
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:17,000
So, the final console update, apparently, is coming and says, well, actually, it's already out.

1258
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:24,000
So, they updated that on December 19th, and it's adding a Nightmare Before Christmas mashup pack.

1259
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And that's it. You're done. You wanna play Minecraft now? You can go play the Java.

1260
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
But now you can beat Jack Skellington. Yay.

1261
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You can play it on Windows 10. Honestly, though, if you really wanna keep up with current stuff, Windows 10 and the Java versions aren't bad.

1262
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Like, surprised how good it is. No 4K pack, though.

1263
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Tons of people playing it on Switch, too.

1264
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Switch 2, yeah.

1265
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Obviously, with the portability and just the success that the Switch has been, it's a huge console for Minecraft, for sure.

1266
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Yeah.

1267
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So, yeah, I mean, how many people... I mean, well, I'm sure there's, like, kids and, you know, not every home can upgrade.

1268
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Not everybody's in this, you know, financial place where they can just willy-nilly upgrade.

1269
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And you don't really need to, though. I mean, it's nice to have the new stuff, but, like, it's also...

1270
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I mean, I remember playing Minecraft 1. They didn't have all the new stuff in there, and it was just fine the way it was.

1271
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Yeah.

1272
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I wanna go back and play it. It gets so boring.

1273
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah.

1274
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Because there's nothing really to do in the game. I mean, you can survive and stuff, but then it just, like, it gets boring.

1275
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I still wanna do the VoG network server, but then we got sidetracked with this whole move to Twitch and my knack of getting sucked into MMOs.

1276
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And it wasn't just the OLR move to Twitch, but I think we just started, like, streaming more on Twitch in general, and it was kind of like that thing kind of...

1277
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And then you got your machine, and that whole Minecraft thing fell on the back burner. But maybe that's a 2019 thing we need to bring back.

1278
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:48,000
You know what? We'll do a VoG Minecraft when Microsoft puts out the frickin' 4K pack. Finally.

1279
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
That'll give me a reason to go back and check it out, that's for sure.

1280
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Or even just, like, with mods now, like, I finally figured out how to do Forge, Minecraft Forge, which is their modded client that you can use for the Java version.

1281
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:14,000
It makes, like, loading mods with, like, visual changes easier. I just, setting up the servers and stuff and keeping that stuff running was really hard. That's all.

1282
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Runjan Stomp in chat points out, I'd love it if they brought modded stuff to consoles. Well, that would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?

1283
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
But then they can't sell it.

1284
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:30,000
No, they can, and they are. So they are doing, like, mods, sort of, with the console versions. You can buy these different updates.

1285
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:43,000
But it's not changing much within, like, the console space. It's not like, you know, adding, like, guns. I mean, you can sort of do that, but it's very basic, is what I'm trying to say.

1286
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:55,000
But if you go in any of the modern Minecraft versions, they have a storefront where you buy skins that people make, or you can buy mods to the game that changes, like, just how stuff sort of behaves.

1287
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And you can even create your own, but it's not as robust as, like, what you can do on the PC where you can just kind of keep adding shit to it and you can put Pokémon in there and all this crazy shit.

1288
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah. It's more of like, oh, I can change the creeper to, you know, look like this, and now it acts like this, you know, give a different AI behavior.

1289
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,000
You think they'll ever do a Minecraft 2, or you think they're just gonna stick on the original forever and ever and ever?

1290
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Yeah, I think they'll eventually update it. It's money.

1291
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's money. It is money.

1292
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Alright, speaking of money, there's one game that's making a lot of it, that's for sure. It's Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. I mean, duh, right?

1293
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Like, I'm about to tell you the Super Smash Brothers broke sales record. It's, like, most obvious news story of the year, I'm sure, but let's talk about it anyway.

1294
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Three million units in eleven days. That's a big deal.

1295
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
That's pretty good.

1296
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Like, I remember back in the day when, like, a million sold was, like, a runaway, like, hit.

1297
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Now, granted, a game like, I think, like Wii Sports, but I don't know how you count that, because that was bundled in with the Wii, but even something like Tetris,

1298
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I think those games sold, like, forty million. Like, it's up and up, but still, eleven days, three million, that's a really good start.

1299
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
In fact, it makes it the fastest selling Switch game so far.

1300
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:19,000
And, of course, Nintendo put out a press release to brag about this whole thing, that the Switch sold 8.7 million consoles between the launch in March 2017 and November 2018.

1301
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
So, it is now the fastest selling console of the generation. That's what Nintendo's saying.

1302
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
And they're also saying Nintendo is the top selling publisher of fiscal 2018.

1303
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Digital eShop sales are up 105% in 2017 over 2018. And, yeah, lots of good statistics, too.

1304
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Pokemon Let's Go, also a million seller.

1305
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Super Mario Party, also a million seller.

1306
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So, they're doing pretty well over there at the Switch.

1307
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,000
But I don't think that news really surprises anybody, but it is kind of neat just to hear, like, how much that is.

1308
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
That game, Super Smash, sold fast.

1309
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And do you think it's really going to be the last one they ever make?

1310
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
No.

1311
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:11,000
No, they got it. But I wonder if they're gonna, you know, allow the director of the game to go make new stuff, you know what I mean?

1312
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Just have someone else put...

1313
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,000
You can't tell me that one person can only make a fighting game. I mean, just have other people do it.

1314
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I want Sakurai to do another Kid Icarus game. I want that franchise to come out.

1315
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I want him to do whatever the fuck he wants. He's earned it.

1316
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Honestly, I wish PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale would come back.

1317
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I didn't think it was that bad of a game. They didn't play it, though, so I could be wrong.

1318
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
But I have it free. It's in my library somewhere.

1319
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I would love that on PlayStation 4 because I like the idea of mixing two different stages together and having them battle it out and stuff in there.

1320
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Like, really obscure stuff. You know, like, Patapon versus, like, God of War creatures or some ridiculous crap.

1321
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I think they could have made it work, but...

1322
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:02,000
But Smash Brothers is so, so, so, so good. I actually played that, too, this week. I forgot to talk about it in my gaming week.

1323
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But, I mean, that's just a given. Making a little progress in the worlds and spirits and all that stuff.

1324
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So, it's just a fantastic game. It's really a must-have if you're a Switch owner unless you just know it is not your type of game.

1325
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Like, otherwise, I really can't recommend that game enough.

1326
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
RunJumpStomp says Sakurai said no new Kid Icarus for, like, 25 years. Well, that's a bummer because I love that series.

1327
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Well, from him, maybe somebody else can do one. I don't know.

1328
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Well, the Kid Icarus game that he released last time, was that very good?

1329
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:37,000
It was... I liked it, but it was a departure. It just didn't feel the same as the original. You know what I mean?

1330
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It wasn't, like, Kid Icarus, like...

1331
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Like, I would like something that's Kid Icarus, but, like, that 3D Metroid they made that was a remake of the second game.

1332
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
But it was, like, totally different.

1333
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Oh, yeah, the 3DS?

1334
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Yeah, like, I would like that with Kid Icarus.

1335
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Like, especially if Nintendo is going to insist on the 3DS still being around.

1336
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I would like to see, like, a 2D Kid Icarus there with, like, some of the difficulty, maybe some ways to cheese it when it gets really hard.

1337
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
You know, and the dungeon exploring, I really loved in Kid Icarus. The music was always fabulous.

1338
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I just love the Greek mythology, cute, you know, the way they do that.

1339
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And the Eggplant Wizard is a great character that needs to shine again, right? So, there you go.

1340
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Is he an assist trophy in the game?

1341
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I'm sure he's got to be. He's not a character, that's the sad thing, but Palutena is, and Pit and Dark Pit.

1342
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And I'm almost positive, most positive Eggplant Wizard is a spirit, if nothing else.

1343
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Because those trophy things are kind of gone, it's all the spirit stuff now.

1344
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So, I'm almost positive Eggplant Wizard is one of those.

1345
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So, anyway, I love Kid Icarus, but every week here on the show we talk about other types of classic games.

1346
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I'm pretty sure Kid Icarus has been a classic game of the week, so if not, it better be soon.

1347
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So, we're going to get into the classic game of the week and check out in the gaming vault what is the classic game that has been picked for us this week.

1348
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So, let's get into it.

1349
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And so we take a step back through space and time and this magical time machine to cover the classic game of the week.

1350
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,000
But this week it's going to be something a little bit different, because Dark Sakura, unfortunately, she's been a little bit ill,

1351
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:19,000
and she is actually on mandated voice rest right now due to laryngitis-adjacent issues without getting too much into it.

1352
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Because that's her business, but unfortunately she can't even help us out this week with the classic game of the week.

1353
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So, I thought, even though it's awesome when I fill in and get to do my picks and Loki gets to fill in and do his picks,

1354
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I thought, you know, we should try to have guests here more often, even if we have to kind of fire up Skype or get folks here in person

1355
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
to do some of these picks when Dark Sakura is not available for whatever reason.

1356
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
So, please welcome back to the show. I know it's been a little bit, but Alan is here.

1357
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Hello.

1358
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Hi, Alan. How are you doing?

1359
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I'm pretty good. How are you?

1360
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Good. It's been a little while since we've had you here.

1361
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I know even though we live together, which makes you a very easy guest to have on the show, we have a very close relationship.

1362
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Let's just don't know.

1363
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But you have other commitments on Sunday nights, so you can't always be here during the show.

1364
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Yes. Or when I was working, Sunday was like my Saturday, so I just wanted to be off work.

1365
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Yeah, I hear you.

1366
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Now, before we get into the Classic Game of the Week, what do you think about, since you live here,

1367
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
what do you think about all that's changed with the video transition and all that stuff?

1368
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You did a really good job of hiding how messy our house is.

1369
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
See, I've talked a lot on this show about radio magic, but now that, my dear, is television magic.

1370
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah, know your angles, both for pictures of yourself and of your studio.

1371
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
That's right. If I could mount that camera higher so it's more like, you know, camera up, chin, you know,

1372
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
get rid of that double chin, I would, but I've only got so much to work with.

1373
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,000
All right. So anyway, Alan, you're here to give us your pick for the Classic Game of the Week.

1374
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
It's got to be something 10 years older or more.

1375
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yes.

1376
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And I know you've played a lot of different stuff than Dark Soccer or even myself,

1377
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
so I think you've picked something kind of a little different, right?

1378
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So what is your pick for Classic Game of the Week?

1379
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:06,000
My pick for Classic Game of the Week is a PC title that came out in 2003 by Microsoft Studios,

1380
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
designed by Digital Anvil, and its name is Freelancer, the universe of possibility.

1381
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Freelancer was directed by Chris Roberts of Wing Commander fame.

1382
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,000
The game was announced by Roberts in 1999, but of course, Microsoft likes to eat up game studios.

1383
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Digital Anvil was purchased by them, which really kind of put some kinks in the development of it,

1384
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
but it did come out a couple of years after it was originally intended.

1385
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Now, I assume you were a big Wing Commander fan back in the day, too.

1386
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Well, yes. I really liked the...

1387
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Well, like the first two games. I don't know. They kind of...

1388
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Once they got into the full motion video, then it was kind of like, is this really Mark Hamill? What?

1389
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And especially that movie was not great.

1390
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Which I did not see.

1391
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I mean, you should keep it that way. But the first two were great.

1392
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
The problem with Wing Commander is that I just was never any good at it.

1393
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
The controls were too, I don't want to say realistic, but I just had a hard time steering the ship.

1394
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And when I could steer the ship, I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with my missiles.

1395
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And it was one of those games that really did not take well to newer PCs,

1396
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
because it didn't have like the slowdown built in or whatever. Like it didn't have a way to...

1397
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Oh, yeah.

1398
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I'm sure there's ways to play it now. I just haven't explored it in a long time.

1399
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I don't know if it's on one of those like, you know, old...

1400
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I imagine if you ran Wing Commander on DOSBox, you could just enter a code that says like,

1401
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
suppress the CPU cycles by XML, and that would slow it down.

1402
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Anyway, sorry, it's not about Wing Commander, but same guy.

1403
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Same guy. And what he wanted to create with Freelancer is he wanted a way to play,

1404
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,000
like have a multiplayer experience, which in 2003 was a very lofty goal,

1405
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,000
because WoW was not out yet. And I think the real only the big MMO that was out.

1406
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And this is not an MMO. It's a single player campaign game with a multiplayer element.

1407
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:09,000
The only thing really was like, you know, land party games like Command & Conquer or whatever,

1408
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
or Starcraft. But then, of course, yes, EverQuest was the big MMO.

1409
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Ultima Online, probably.

1410
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Ultima Online, yeah.

1411
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So also, one thing that I noticed is that this game has some weird...

1412
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I don't want to say that BioWare or Mass Effect stole from this, but like, for example,

1413
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
there are nodes like the Mass Relays where you jump to a system.

1414
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Something similar is in this game, where if you want to go from one star system to another,

1415
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
you have to go to a jump point, and you go through like this thing,

1416
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
and you get spit out into a different star system.

1417
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:47,000
And Jennifer Hale, who is very prolific in the video game Voice Over World,

1418
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
plays Junco Zane, who is basically your main...

1419
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Like, you play Trent, who's voiced by Ian Zierling, I think, from 90210.

1420
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Oh god, the 90210 guy, okay.

1421
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Yes, yeah. So he's the voice... Yeah, actually, George Takei is in it as well.

1422
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Oh my.

1423
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So yes, it does have some pretty big names in there.

1424
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So yeah, I just noticed like, oh, there are some weird sort of...

1425
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
If you want to reach a little bit, Mass Effect connections.

1426
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Does it play like Wing Commander? I mean, I know it's still like a space game.

1427
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:27,000
That's the thing. It was the first space sim combat game where I found it very easy to pick up,

1428
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
very easy to learn how to play and be good at it very quickly.

1429
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I believe you can do a first person cockpit view, but your ship is kind of like...

1430
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Basically, you can see the thrusters of the ship. So it's like a third person.

1431
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Kind of like the camera sitting on the butt of the ship.

1432
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:55,000
And you pretty much do everything. You steer and you also target the enemy spaceships with the mouse.

1433
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It's all mouse driven. Most of it is.

1434
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And you know how in games like that where you have to shoot where the ship is going to go?

1435
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
So if the enemy ship is halfway across the screen, you want to shoot a little bit to the left of that

1436
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
so that it will fly into your bullets?

1437
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Yeah.

1438
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
The reticle that it gives you makes it very easy to figure out how that works.

1439
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Because in Wing Commander, I always had a huge problem with how the predictive targeting worked.

1440
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Even though the graphics, I believe, were a bit stunted,

1441
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,000
it didn't necessarily have what would be considered 2003 graphics for the PC,

1442
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
it did get a lot of acclaim for how pretty it was.

1443
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Some of the star systems, when you've got a planet sort of over a nebula, it's a really gorgeous game.

1444
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And we can see that now on Twitch, at least. That part of it.

1445
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It does look a little... I think it's a little more ahead of where a lot of games were in 2003.

1446
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
2003 was more like the PlayStation 2 era, right? So yeah, it's a little bit ahead of that.

1447
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:03,000
The NPCs, aside from three or four core NPCs like Jennifer Hill's character,

1448
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:10,000
all have the same sort of flat, square mush face, kind of like the family in Katamari Damacy.

1449
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
If you look in the video that's playing right now of the gameplay,

1450
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
you'll notice that some of the people kind of look the same.

1451
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,000
But the really big, ambitious thing that I was saying earlier that Chris Roberts wanted to create with this

1452
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
was a persistent online state with a real economy.

1453
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So that up to 128 players could log into basically a game server, like one that you hosted yourself,

1454
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
and if you logged out and logged back in, you could resume your career,

1455
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
but the universe would have kept on even though you personally were not there.

1456
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And basically the plot of it, the first player or single player campaign mode is

1457
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
you are a freelancer, which means you buy and sell ore from different star systems.

1458
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
You know, buy low, sell high, blah, blah, blah.

1459
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
But then you discover that you were used to smuggle alien artifacts,

1460
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
and you discover the secret alien race that's going to kill humanity,

1461
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
which is also kind of like a Mass Effect thing.

1462
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
So you start as, you know, just like a Han Solo type character pretty much,

1463
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
and then you end up saving the universe.

1464
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Spoilers.

1465
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Yeah, I know.

1466
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Just kidding.

1467
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Isn't it kind of like those Mass Effect-y connections that make you kind of think of that game fondly now,

1468
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
or what is it about this game that made you think it's worthy of a classic?

1469
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It's been probably 10 years since I last played it,

1470
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
but I know I've played it from start to finish at least twice.

1471
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Just because visually how pretty the outer space looks and how fun.

1472
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Like the combat is genuinely really fun because of how easy it is to play.

1473
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
And I believe there are multiple difficulty settings.

1474
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Don't quote me on that, though.

1475
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But yeah, you can take breaks from the story if you want, except for at certain set points.

1476
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
So if you really want to do more of the economy thing, you can do so.

1477
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:12,000
What Chris Roberts was picturing in his mind when he pitched Freelancer was really EVE Online.

1478
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
EVE Online is sort of what he really would have liked,

1479
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
which was way too ambitious for Anvil or Microsoft to have done at the time.

1480
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:29,000
But when he was trying to describe it, ultimately I feel EVE Online is sort of the actual execution of what he wanted it to be

1481
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:38,000
because in multiplayer mode, all you really did is you could fight enemies and pirates and buy and sell different commodities.

1482
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
But that was really it. And once you got over that, once you made money, there wasn't shit to do.

1483
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Quickly before we wrap up, how did you find this game? Was it because you followed Wing Commander?

1484
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I probably saw it at Electronics Boutique.

1485
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I bought, even before PC games had download codes at GameStop. You can't get PC games at GameStop anymore now at all.

1486
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Well, you pretty much are buying a card with a code on it.

1487
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Yeah, but I don't even see those anymore.

1488
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:11,000
But yeah, no, I was just PC gaming and came across this game probably within a year or so after it came out, maybe 2004, 2005.

1489
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Saw that it was by Chris Roberts and really enjoyed the purchase.

1490
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Awesome. Well, there it is. If there's nothing else left to say, your classic game of the week.

1491
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Freelancer for the PC by Microsoft Studios. Awesome pick. One that I didn't know a lot about really until today, even though I was probably more focused on console gaming at the time. I don't know. Maybe my PC wasn't good enough.

1492
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:46,000
The last thing that I'll make that was kind of neat is that the end game for the single player campaign is once you save the galaxy, blah, blah, blah, you're then sort of put back into the universe and you can do whatever you want.

1493
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:59,000
But again, that gets very boring because it's just you in this huge universe buying and selling the same commodities. So it's kind of like the end game is kind of really fall short.

1494
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Is this something people can still play? I mean, you said it was the servers were on your end, right?

1495
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yeah, I think you can host the server yourself.

1496
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1497
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Also, I should have said at the beginning, it was the Freelancer is technically the sequel to a game called Star Lancer, which I want to say Star Lancer was available on the Dreamcast. Freelancer was PC only and Star Lancer flopped really bad.

1498
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And Freelancer actually sort of elevated the legacy of that series because Freelancer was a very good game where Star Lancer was not.

1499
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Gotcha. Well, great.

1500
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So now I'm done.

1501
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:43,000
All right. Well, thanks, Ellen. That was a great pick. Quickly, I know we got to get back to the show, but just like in general, how's your gaming, like your present gaming world going?

1502
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I'm playing Overwatch ranked mode again because I took like, I don't know, five or six months off. I missed.

1503
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
How do you like Ash?

1504
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
She's fun. I'm not particularly good as her because I'm not good at snipers.

1505
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Stop!

1506
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Yeah.

1507
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
We'll quote Jennifer Hale again.

1508
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
True, yeah. Legend, icon.

1509
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Yes, because, yeah, we did meet her at GamerX. We have a picture with her.

1510
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Here's the part where Bobby in chat goes, Jennifer Hale was on my show.

1511
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Yeah.

1512
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Yeah, I know.

1513
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And but her voice is so recognizable to me now that even when she's putting on a Southern twang like Ash, I'm like, Jennifer, I know it's you.

1514
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So the Dark Souls thing finally ran out for you?

1515
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Yeah, I was playing the hell out of Dark Souls 2.

1516
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
But after a couple hundred hours, I basically got, this is not relevant to the classic game of the week, but...

1517
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
That's okay.

1518
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:45,000
In Dark Souls 2, you can get a ring where if you equip it, you get a strength bonus on your bare fist so you can punch the shit out of monsters rather than the big giant Buster swords that normally Dark Souls is associated with.

1519
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:53,000
You have to go through this really tedious mess to get that ring. So I did a playthrough just punching the shit out of monsters.

1520
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Nice. All right.

1521
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Just like Boxer Girl, like a fight, like kung fu.

1522
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
But even if you put Dark Souls away for now, you'll probably come back to it in a few months time.

1523
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I still have not played Dark Souls 3.

1524
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And we do have to give a quick shout out to Akuma JP who fixed that situation.

1525
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Yes, my son, my handsome boy.

1526
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Not Akuma JP, but the Solaria Mibo.

1527
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Yeah.

1528
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I thought Mr. Smoosh was your son.

1529
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Yeah, I have many sons.

1530
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Okay.

1531
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Solaire of Astora is an iconic NPC from the first Dark Souls.

1532
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It's hard to describe the fixation with him.

1533
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:37,000
He doesn't make any appearances in Dark Souls 2 or 3, which is a shame, but he is an iconic part of the Dark Souls or Demon's Souls legacy.

1534
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And you were able to get the amiibo.

1535
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And I was able to get the amiibo.

1536
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
No thanks to Gamestop.

1537
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Yeah, no thanks to Gamestop.

1538
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Apparently they had all sold out by like May.

1539
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
So dumb.

1540
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Because remember, Dark Souls Remastered for Switch was supposed to come out then.

1541
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Yeah.

1542
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
But it came out in like October.

1543
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Yep.

1544
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:58,000
So yeah, Akuma JP was like, I can just go there everywhere here.

1545
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
What do you?

1546
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Yeah.

1547
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
So he mailed me one and also some candy, which is now all gone.

1548
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
So thank you for the candy.

1549
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Thank you.

1550
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
All right.

1551
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
We do need to get back to the show.

1552
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
What can I say?

1553
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I'm a little partial to you, Alan.

1554
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I'm always going to let you have a little more time maybe than the average guest.

1555
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Well, this is played during the break, so you're probably eating right now.

1556
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
That's awesome.

1557
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Yes, I'm hiding my time trying to shove an entire pizza.

1558
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
And making coffee and going to the bathroom.

1559
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yes, as one does during a three hour radio program.

1560
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
But we do need to get back.

1561
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Alan, thank you so much for being here.

1562
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Any last parting thoughts for our listeners this week?

1563
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Constructive criticism about the studio video quality.

1564
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Please no like rude comments.

1565
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Okay.

1566
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Yeah.

1567
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
No rude.

1568
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Everyone's been really cool so far.

1569
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Okay.

1570
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Right.

1571
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Bye.

1572
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So we're back here live in studio episode number 757 of our show in progress for this

1573
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
December 23rd of 2018, or as my sister used to call it, Christmas Eve Eve.

1574
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
So I don't know if you've ever heard that term before.

1575
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Is that just me?

1576
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
No, I've heard it.

1577
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It was trending on Twitter earlier.

1578
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Was it?

1579
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Oh, well now it's well now it's not cool to say anymore than if it's something all the

1580
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
kids are saying, I suppose now.

1581
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Anyway, so thanks to Alan for filling in for the classic of the week.

1582
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I thought that was a good choice, a game I didn't know a lot about.

1583
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
So I learned something.

1584
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So I think that's something we'll kind of continue to do in 2019.

1585
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I mean, we love it when dark soccer is here and able to do stuff, but you know, things

1586
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
happen and sometimes you can't always be here to do the classic game of the week.

1587
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
So I'd like to do more.

1588
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I mean, you've, we've done a ton of games by now, so we should get more guests in to

1589
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
do stuff.

1590
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
It'll be fun.

1591
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
So we'll try to do more of that in the future.

1592
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Anyway, of course we are live at twitch.tv slash vog network and we hope some of you

1593
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
listening out there on the podcast feed will join us for a live show some night.

1594
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
For those of you that are finding us through twitch TV, we hope you will check out our

1595
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
podcast.

1596
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We are of course taping a live audio podcast that we've been running for 16 and a half

1597
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
plus years.

1598
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Uh, that's available over on iTunes, Google play podcasts, pretty much all the favorite

1599
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
places to get podcasts except, except not yet Spotify.

1600
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Uh, that's a 2019 thing cause we are going to kind of be moving hosts behind the scenes.

1601
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So, um, I got to get all that taken care of and then we'll end up going to a Spotify,

1602
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
but none of that, none of that's going to affect like you guys downloading and all that

1603
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
stuff.

1604
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
So, all right, let's get back, I suppose, into some news.

1605
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
We need to do some rapid fire news for you guys here.

1606
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
All right.

1607
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
So you may remember that the whole clusterfuck of, uh, fallout 76, well Bethesda is trying

1608
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
to make good with, uh, people that have stayed with the game.

1609
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,000
So now they basically announced on Twitter that anybody that has launched, logged into

1610
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
fallout 76 during 2018 will receive a copy of fallout classic collection on PC, which

1611
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
is fallout, fallout two and fallout tactics.

1612
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And so, uh, no word on how you'll be able to get those, but I'm sure code within their

1613
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Bethesda launcher or something like that.

1614
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Who knows?

1615
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Um, so stay tuned for that if you're playing the game.

1616
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:49,000
And then of course, um, some unfortunate news for the uncharted movie.

1617
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:56,000
It's apparently speaking of movies, I have concerns about apparently, um, they had, uh,

1618
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
lost their director.

1619
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:05,000
So, um, right now they are, uh, without a director on that, you basically said that

1620
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,000
the closest to the starting line is uncharted and it's, that's a massive title.

1621
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Uh, we have a very good strip.

1622
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
We have our star Tom Holland, and now that is subject to schedule and additional casting.

1623
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:25,000
But as I say right now, it seems that most, um, be most near the horizon, but I don't

1624
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
know what they're going to do now without, I guess I'll have to get a new director and

1625
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
see how that goes.

1626
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
But yeah, I'm not a hundred percent on this movie either.

1627
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
It's just, I'm very skeptical with movies do change their directors a ton.

1628
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I mean, we know there's the very controversial guardians of the galaxy three and all everything

1629
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
that's gone through, but you know that it's not uncommon for movies to lose directors.

1630
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Yeah.

1631
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
So I mean, but let's just hope it's not a sign of abandoned shit.

1632
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
It's probably just one of those, this project's taking too long to get off the ground.

1633
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I want to go do something else here.

1634
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:01,000
He's doing the, um, I thought they said James Gunn's doing the, um, the second, um, suicide

1635
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
squad.

1636
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1637
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Wasn't the suicide squad.

1638
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It was the other one with, it's like an all female on.

1639
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Oh yeah.

1640
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I don't remember what it's called, but I know what you're talking about.

1641
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Yeah.

1642
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yeah.

1643
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
DC picked him up.

1644
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
That's which is the obvious solution to that whole thing is that if Marvel doesn't want

1645
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
him here, Aquaman's apparently pretty good.

1646
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Is it?

1647
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
That's fine.

1648
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I never get to the movies.

1649
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
It's that we actually, we were looking at going to see a movie last night, but there

1650
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
was like nothing where we were like, ah, we were, well, the wreck it Ralph sequel.

1651
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
We almost spider man.

1652
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

1653
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I don't follow the comics.

1654
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
You don't have to.

1655
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
It's so good.

1656
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Okay.

1657
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I'll have to consider checking that out.

1658
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Alan really wanted to see the widows, that movie, but it's already gone from theaters.

1659
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I want to see also immortal engines by here.

1660
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It's not very good, but I just want to see it cause it looks interesting.

1661
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Okay.

1662
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
But I would actually, if I had the choice between immortal engines and spider, I go

1663
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
see spider man again.

1664
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I want to go see wreck it Ralph still the new it's it's good.

1665
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It'll be there for awhile.

1666
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
It's good.

1667
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I could probably even wait to see it on video and the spider man is really good.

1668
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
All right.

1669
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Oh, you're not the only one that's saying that.

1670
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
A lot of people are saying that new spider man movie is pretty amazing.

1671
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I mean, I've seen wrecking Ralph to wreck Ralph too was, it was a cute movie, but spider

1672
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
man was just like, after you see it, you're like, damn, I need to go see that again.

1673
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
We get it.

1674
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Damn.

1675
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
All right.

1676
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, all right, let's talk about the NES switch online.

1677
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Of course, you know, you can play classic Nintendo games on switch online.

1678
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Still curious.

1679
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So they're going to bring us in January, but we had some new games in this December.

1680
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Uh, we had Ninja Gaiden or excuse me, Ninja Gaiden.

1681
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Uh, we had, uh, adventures of Lolo.

1682
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Uh, we had, uh, they, they did a couple of those, like I'd forget the column with the,

1683
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
like the modest SP.

1684
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:47,000
So they did one for Metroid and then they did one for, um, dr Mario.

1685
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
But anyway, um, apparently, and I didn't know this, if you actually use the NES controllers,

1686
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
cause those are out now.

1687
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yeah.

1688
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
If you actually use the NES controllers with this, you actually get different color scheme

1689
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
and you get different sound effects that actually sound eight bit.

1690
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So it's just like this little Easter egg.

1691
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
If you are actually using those old controllers, I guess that's neat.

1692
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Kind of neat.

1693
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Now this is what I think is more neat is that it was also discovered that with the new super

1694
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Mario brothers, you on switch, that whole thing that's coming out, that game is going

1695
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
to support the classic controllers.

1696
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So even though Nintendo made no promises beyond the switch online, you know, because of course,

1697
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
with that, those classic controllers are only having so many buttons.

1698
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Not every game is going to want to natively support that.

1699
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
But I guess because Mario games are generally pretty much the same, right?

1700
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
So you only need the two buttons.

1701
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So they actually made it so that the new super Mario brothers, you on switch is going to

1702
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
use those classic controllers if you want.

1703
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
That's kind of neat.

1704
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
But what's that new super Mario brother?

1705
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Well, I was going to say a new super Mario brothers that originated on the DS.

1706
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
So I was going to say, uh, yes, I was trying to think if it was DS and there was a Wii

1707
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
version in the Wii U.

1708
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Because if it was on the Wii and they used the Wii remotes and those only had two buttons

1709
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
as well.

1710
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
So then that makes sense.

1711
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Yes.

1712
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
But technically this is a Wii U port, but yes, I mean for sure what you're saying there.

1713
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I'm more curious because I remember on the Wii U version, the second player could like

1714
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
draw on the screen and do something.

1715
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I'm just assuming that's just gone or maybe you could do it in portable mode and touch

1716
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
the screen.

1717
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
But I, it's probably not really a thing anymore.

1718
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I don't think it's a thing.

1719
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I think they just probably took it out.

1720
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
It was like, ah, it's just one of those things that's going to go.

1721
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And instead you get things that inspired Bowsette memes.

1722
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
So enjoy it.

1723
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Uh, speaking of things to enjoy in Nintendo products, uh, Firewatch is on the Switch.

1724
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I don't know how many of you have checked out Firewatch finally on the Switch because

1725
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
it was on a ton of other, it was on PC, it was on PlayStation 4.

1726
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I loved Firewatch, but you know, I love the walking simulators, which I still don't like

1727
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
that title, but if that's what they're going to call it, fine.

1728
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Um, I just recommended today, everybody's gone to the rapture to somebody who hadn't

1729
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
played it yet.

1730
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I was like, oh, you got to play that game.

1731
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
But anyway, Firewatch is really good too.

1732
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And it's on the Switch and apparently they've actually hidden away a Nintendo 64 controller.

1733
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:00,000
There's actually a little Nintendo game called forest 64 and you can find this like it's

1734
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
a little Easter egg and uh, yeah, I think it's just like cute little things to find

1735
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
in the game.

1736
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
So, um, yeah, neat.

1737
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I like those little things.

1738
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
They did that same thing in a gone home.

1739
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Another one of those kinds of games that finally came out on the Switch.

1740
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
They did almost like the super Nintendo games that were hidden in the sister's room or

1741
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
something like that.

1742
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Right.

1743
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Yeah.

1744
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So yeah, not, not unheard of to see these types of callbacks.

1745
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
So anyway, there you go.

1746
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Uh, there's some rapid fire news for you in what is otherwise kind of a slower news week,

1747
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,000
but we still got some things to cover, including release dates, question mark.

1748
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I really see is this, this is Christmas week.

1749
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I just don't know if anything at all is coming out this week, but it's worth checking in

1750
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
anyway.

1751
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
There, there's nothing.

1752
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
There's nothing that's coming out.

1753
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Um, console wise as far as like, um, an actual physical release or anything.

1754
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Sure.

1755
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I'm sure there'll still be some indie titles, but yeah, we don't get a list of those.

1756
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
We got nothing on both fronts unfortunately.

1757
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So, all right, well there's one release in Japan, actually a couple.

1758
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
There's one major release in Japan and a few minor ones.

1759
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Uh, but the major release in Japan this week on December the 27th Diablo three eternal

1760
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
collection gets its Japanese release this week.

1761
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
So that's not something a little something cause you know, Christmas is kind of different

1762
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
in Japan.

1763
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
It's not necessarily the hysteria it is over here.

1764
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Uh, but there's also on the switch, they have go vacation and Shin Sengoku Musou seven with

1765
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Moshu then DX.

1766
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
So you have that to look forward to on the switch.

1767
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
It is still a slow week, but at least it's not completely barren.

1768
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I don't know about the UK Loki.

1769
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Imagine it's pretty slow over there too though.

1770
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Nothing there.

1771
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Nothing there.

1772
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Yeah, nothing coming out until the 10th.

1773
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Uh, black Mamba in our chat says, I heard Final Fantasy seven is coming to switch in

1774
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
2019.

1775
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Is this true?

1776
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I don't think they dated it, but it was in their last direct.

1777
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
They did.

1778
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
It was all the fun things.

1779
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Yeah.

1780
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
10, 12, seven.

1781
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
No, cause they skipped eight.

1782
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
So not all the file fantasies cause remember everybody was like, where's eight though?

1783
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,400
But the eight, cause let's be real, they're all ported PC releases pretty much right.

1784
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,480
Or they're ports of versions that have already come out.

1785
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:17,160
Now even though seven had a really old PC release, it had a somewhat newer PC release

1786
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:21,540
and it had more importantly that PlayStation four release.

1787
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:26,440
Remember when, um, at the PlayStation expo one year they announced it was before they

1788
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,320
announced the fantasy seven remake.

1789
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,860
They announced fantasy sevens come to PlayStation four and everybody loses their shit.

1790
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:33,860
And they're like, yes, it's the classic final fantasy.

1791
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:37,360
And like they go back to the audience, everybody's just like complete stone face.

1792
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,360
Like really?

1793
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,360
Bitch.

1794
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,400
Do you remember that?

1795
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,400
When they unveiled that?

1796
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:42,400
Yeah, it was funny.

1797
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,880
So anyway, that's the version I think they're probably doing on the switch.

1798
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:45,880
And so there's what?

1799
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:51,600
Seven, nine, 10, not 11, 12, and probably some other stuff too.

1800
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,600
I'm forgetting in the moment.

1801
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,360
Why not 11?

1802
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:58,320
I know because I don't, I don't know if square knows where I feel like file fantasy 11 is

1803
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:02,680
that thing that just kind of exists in a dark room somewhere and nobody's really checking

1804
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,680
on it.

1805
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:08,360
The mobile version is supposed to be coming out mobile version or like I check it out

1806
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:13,320
on like, you know, cause switch can't run, you know, 14 we'll just get a remastered

1807
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,800
11 and I'm fine with that.

1808
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:19,680
Uh, Dr. Studio says, I thought I heard eight issue was licensing the music.

1809
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:20,680
Well, that would be weird.

1810
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,880
Wasn't all the music in an original, except unless maybe there was some weird agreement

1811
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,600
with Faye Wong eyes on me.

1812
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,040
Like I don't, would that really be a thing?

1813
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:29,160
I don't know.

1814
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,560
So I guess I could be surprised.

1815
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:35,400
Maybe they had a guest artist or something, uh, that, Oh, dark to see it says it's the

1816
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,320
one song eyes on me.

1817
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:40,280
So maybe, you know, you could do the Konami thing.

1818
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:45,280
No, you could do the Konami thing and get someone new to sing it.

1819
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,480
I'm down.

1820
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:50,360
Act Def says maybe it explains why there's only two songs in smash.

1821
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,360
Cause you know, the final fantasy stuff in smash is pretty thin.

1822
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,840
They really didn't go out of their way to add new fall fancy stuff where it's like everything

1823
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:59,040
else kind of like has like new fancy stuff.

1824
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,960
It's just really bother with this cloud.

1825
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:02,960
It's fine.

1826
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:03,960
All right.

1827
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,720
This is the part of the show where we would usually get it in the mailbag.

1828
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:11,560
However, there were no emails this week.

1829
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:15,160
If you want to send us emails, you can send those emails to participate at orange launch

1830
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:19,920
radio.com but unfortunately when I opened up the mailbag at participate at orange launch

1831
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,920
radio.com there were no emails there.

1832
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,480
So you know what that means?

1833
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:28,080
I get to spend some time talking about RuPaul's drag race, all stars for hooray.

1834
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,560
So did you see this week's episode?

1835
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,560
Nope.

1836
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,560
I didn't.

1837
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:36,520
The lip sync with the lip syncs this season have been on point.

1838
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,560
The one, this, I'm not going to spoil everything cause I probably, everybody's not watched

1839
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:43,280
it, but the lip sync this last episode was so good.

1840
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,280
So good.

1841
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,280
I, it was, it was good.

1842
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,920
I can't wait for the next episode of reading is fundamental, cheap plug to talk about it.

1843
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,920
It was good.

1844
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:52,240
But here's, I'll tell you this, this has got a lot of people talking in the community.

1845
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:58,040
The next episode, the one that airs this Friday leaked because wow.

1846
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,920
Cause everybody has to have their own Netflix thing.

1847
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:05,080
So RuPaul's production company, wow presents world of wonder on their plus service where

1848
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:10,120
they do like uncensored drag race and other, you know, uh, specials and things like that.

1849
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,120
Wow.

1850
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:14,800
Plus or whatever overseas accidentally posted the third episode early.

1851
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,360
Oh, but you know what happens once it's on the internet is always on the internet.

1852
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:22,880
So it's over on Reddit and you know, they're trying to hide it.

1853
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,400
You kind of have to know like what corners to look and where, but if you really dig for

1854
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:28,400
it, you can find it.

1855
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:32,280
And so I already saw this Friday's episode because if I didn't watch it now, I was going

1856
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:33,280
to get spoiled.

1857
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,560
So I had to watch it before somebody else could spoil me.

1858
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:40,320
So obviously I would never spoil for those that are keeping themselves away from it.

1859
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,720
But this week's episode is pretty darn good too.

1860
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,760
That's all I'm really going to say, but I'm still rooting for Monique Hart.

1861
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,320
Do you know who Monique Hart is?

1862
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,320
No.

1863
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,320
Okay.

1864
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,320
All right.

1865
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:54,440
I don't know anything about three words, Loki Brown cow stunning.

1866
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:57,120
That's all I need to know.

1867
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,120
Okay.

1868
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:02,160
It's really must like their, their dairy products.

1869
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,760
Um, looking at, uh, it, Oh, Bobby Blackwell.

1870
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:06,760
Okay.

1871
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,040
You can ask this about an email segment.

1872
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:12,480
Bobby Blackwell asks, so what happened on survivor?

1873
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,660
So I can tell this little side story has nothing to do with gaming, but if you're not going

1874
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:18,100
to send emails and I get a tangent time.

1875
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:20,080
So I don't know if you knew about this trip I took.

1876
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,280
So I took a trip in the middle of the week.

1877
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:25,080
We drove down on Wednesday and drove back on Thursday.

1878
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:27,800
We went to LA and here's why.

1879
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:32,920
We were trying to get into the survivor finale in LA that they do at CBS studios.

1880
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:36,400
And one of my friends, Kami, she got in through the seat filler.

1881
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:41,040
All our female friends got in, all the males did not get in.

1882
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,040
Hmm.

1883
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:44,200
I wonder what that's all about, but maybe it was just a coincidence.

1884
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:48,200
But anyway, um, actually this girl that I met while I was down there, that's kind of

1885
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,780
hangs in the same kind of group.

1886
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:51,520
She was right in the front and center at the very beginning.

1887
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,520
You could not miss her.

1888
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,520
So that was pretty cool.

1889
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,480
We were watching it since we didn't get in, we went to watch an East coast feed at somebody

1890
01:45:56,480 --> 01:46:01,040
else's place and we got to, uh, you know, um, uh, kind of watch there.

1891
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,920
And when we saw this girl in the front row that we knew it was like, Oh my God, we know

1892
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:05,920
her.

1893
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:06,920
So that was, that was kind of fun.

1894
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,040
And so here's the thing though.

1895
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,920
So I didn't just drive all the way to LA to like do nothing and end up watching an East

1896
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:11,920
coast feed.

1897
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:12,920
I mean, I met new friends, new people.

1898
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:18,780
That's always fun, but we knew the place cause you know, people talk, we knew the place where

1899
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:22,600
all the people that were on the show that felt like doing after partying, we're going

1900
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,440
to go, we knew what bar they were going to.

1901
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:28,360
So like some dumb survivor groupies, which is funny cause you know, I used to be obsessed

1902
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:29,360
with the show, right?

1903
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,360
Like I used to watch it all the time.

1904
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:34,360
And I kinda like when I started doing more podcasts like on Wednesdays and stuff, I kind

1905
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:35,680
of fell out of the habit of watching.

1906
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:39,580
So I haven't watched religiously, but I've caught like two or three episodes this season

1907
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:41,400
and this, this last season was pretty good.

1908
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:45,340
So we went to the place in LA where all the people were going to show up and they did.

1909
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:49,900
So we got to meet a lot of the people and a lot of, you know, the people that were on

1910
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:51,920
it previously all showed up too.

1911
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,360
So that was kind of fun.

1912
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:57,600
You know, I didn't, I didn't recognize any everybody and I don't like to do the picture

1913
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,960
thing an awful lot because I feel like then it's like you're asking somebody, you're going

1914
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,480
up to somebody and going, can I get a picture?

1915
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,480
Can I get a picture?

1916
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:05,440
And then like, you know, you take that picture and they're like, okay, thanks.

1917
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,440
Have a good one.

1918
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:10,500
And I'm like, I think that's so like, I don't know, like I would rather like talk for like

1919
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,260
two minutes to somebody.

1920
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:15,760
So I didn't really get a lot of selfies, even though we got to talk to like, uh, Gabby was

1921
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,600
one I know for sure that we ran into Allison was out front.

1922
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:21,080
If you don't watch survivor, these names mean nothing to you.

1923
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:25,040
Uh, but anyway, yeah, so, and, and the guy who won was there too.

1924
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,200
So it was, it was a lot of fun.

1925
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:31,200
So um, but I, the person I did run into that I had to get a selfie with and you have no

1926
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,800
clue who this person is, but if I like survivor, I really like big brother, which is the really

1927
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,480
trashy one right in the house.

1928
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:40,480
Yeah.

1929
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:44,540
I met Arisa Cox and I wouldn't expect you would know her, but anybody up north might

1930
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:47,280
know her cause she's the host of big brother Canada.

1931
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:51,880
So she was there at the survivor thing because I think ET Canada was covering it because

1932
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:54,480
there's a lot of people in Canada, they don't have their own survivor in Canada.

1933
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,480
They have their own big brother.

1934
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:56,480
They don't have their own survivors.

1935
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,480
They watch ours.

1936
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,180
So I think she's kind of the bridge.

1937
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:04,220
Like she does the little like correspondence for survivor in Canada.

1938
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:05,220
So that was my moment.

1939
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:08,840
That was my little celebrity encounter for the Canadians that listen, that might know

1940
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:09,840
who I'm talking about.

1941
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:10,840
She was really nice.

1942
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:11,880
She was really patient.

1943
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:15,320
This drunk guy offered to take a picture of us and he was just being really awkward and

1944
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:16,880
it was like a really super awkward moment.

1945
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:17,880
I was like, Oh, it's okay.

1946
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:18,880
I'll get a selfie.

1947
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,680
And I was kind of like, I'm like looking at her, I'm like, I'm so sorry.

1948
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:22,680
You know?

1949
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:23,680
She's like, Oh no, it's funny.

1950
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,680
You know, type of thing.

1951
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:27,400
She was really like humble and she's, you know, asking me some questions about like,

1952
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,080
how do you, how do you watch it down here?

1953
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:33,140
And I was like, girl, you know, there's places on the internet and she's like, you know,

1954
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:35,140
so it was, it was cool.

1955
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:36,140
It was cool.

1956
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:37,140
Anyway.

1957
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:38,140
Um, I love this.

1958
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:41,640
Bobby in chat says I robbed as one show on Twitch and then he immediately goes to Hollywood.

1959
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,560
Oh, you know, but now, now they did, it was fun.

1960
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,600
I met, met some friends.

1961
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,520
I've known online for a long time and that was, that meant more to me than people on

1962
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,520
a TV show.

1963
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,040
I watched twice there.

1964
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,040
They're all normal people.

1965
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:56,080
You guys, it's just, it's just Hollywood.

1966
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,080
It's just a show.

1967
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:58,080
Just like this.

1968
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,080
All right.

1969
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,080
Anyway, that's enough.

1970
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,080
That's enough about weird, crazy.

1971
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,560
I can't believe I did that, but it was one of those things where my friends were like,

1972
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:05,560
do it, do it.

1973
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:06,560
Why not?

1974
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,560
And I was like, you know what?

1975
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:08,560
Good point.

1976
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,720
Like I could use just a random trip.

1977
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:10,720
Why not?

1978
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:11,720
Let's do it.

1979
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,720
So it was fun.

1980
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,720
Anyway.

1981
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:14,720
All right.

1982
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:18,520
So we're getting into some actual video gaming news now that I've told my little midweek

1983
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:24,000
a trip story and let's get into, uh, what's going on with, uh, trophies and what they're

1984
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
telling us, right?

1985
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Yeah.

1986
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:32,120
So there's this, um, feature that they've launched, I guess, called, uh, my PS4 life.

1987
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:37,440
It's some sort of marketing campaign that is like a highlight video of a player's individual

1988
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,440
stats and milestones.

1989
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:45,060
So based on that, um, I guess with the game they're talking about, like how many of like

1990
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:49,720
a certain trophy out of how many people played the game, you know, what percentage you had

1991
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:56,900
and based on that information, you're going to extrapolate how many copies of a game sold.

1992
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,160
So people used math.

1993
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,240
People use math to reverse engineer.

1994
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:02,920
People math this week.

1995
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,600
And that is the headline on Kotaku.

1996
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,600
Yes.

1997
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,520
So they, they have, I have to give a little crap.

1998
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,520
Come on.

1999
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,360
They, uh, figured out like some of the player counts for certain games.

2000
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,920
So for example, Doom has 3.9 million people playing the game.

2001
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:20,040
The Last Guardian, 1.94 million, um, people playing that.

2002
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:23,840
Uncharted Lost Legacy, 3.9 million.

2003
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,520
Wolfenstein, uh, 1.4.

2004
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,760
Detroit Become Human, 2.4.

2005
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:31,800
Red Dead Redemption, 6.1 and so on.

2006
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:35,680
Fallout 76, only 407,000.

2007
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:38,480
To be fair, I bet that game hasn't been out as long as the others and you have to

2008
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:39,520
earn those trophies.

2009
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:40,520
Well, I mean, okay.

2010
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:41,520
They're still, they're using the math.

2011
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,520
Nevermind.

2012
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:46,560
Cause even if only 0.1% of people have a trophy, you can still kind of figure some things out

2013
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:47,560
that way.

2014
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,560
That's interesting.

2015
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,560
Yeah.

2016
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:55,320
But, I mean, there's room for error too, because there's only so many decimal points

2017
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:56,400
in those percentages.

2018
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:00,720
So obviously, I mean, we know these are just like estimates and they, there may be some

2019
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:04,880
gray area cause some people buy games and then never unlock any trophies.

2020
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:09,800
Some people bought the game, returned it, or so, so, and it went a second hand sale

2021
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:10,800
basically.

2022
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,240
So they still have the trophies on their account, but now somebody else bought the same copy

2023
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,800
and has their own trophies.

2024
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,640
So it's, it's not quite, it's not proof proof math.

2025
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:20,040
No, for sure.

2026
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,640
But it's interesting when we don't necessarily always get the sales number.

2027
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:23,640
Yeah.

2028
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:25,320
They haven't been releasing a lot of sales numbers anymore.

2029
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:27,200
They don't break it down like the MPD used to.

2030
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,640
Um, now it's a lot of that's private unless they want to brag about, oh, look at how well

2031
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:31,640
our console sold.

2032
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:34,160
Hence the Smash Brothers story from before the break.

2033
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:35,160
Yeah.

2034
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,160
Yeah.

2035
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:40,280
Uh, going in chat at live or see that live.vognetwork.com will still work, but at, uh, at a Twitch TV

2036
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:44,560
vog network, uh, active says people did math and obtained results more at 11.

2037
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,560
Yep.

2038
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:46,560
Pretty much.

2039
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,280
But that, that's the kind of stories you get on Christmas and new year's week when everybody's

2040
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:52,800
finally on vacation, I think at this point of the year.

2041
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,720
So let's move on to something else overseas that might be a little more serious.

2042
01:51:56,720 --> 01:52:02,920
Uh, in Germany, legal action is being pursued against Nintendo for their no cancellation

2043
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,640
eShop preorder policy.

2044
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:05,640
Uh, yeah.

2045
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:10,080
If you didn't know that, if you try to preorder something on Nintendo, uh, you cannot take

2046
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,080
back seas.

2047
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:14,360
Uh, you can't have it built in that they can do that.

2048
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:18,880
So, uh, they say, uh, when you go, it can't be, they, so they tell you, it's not like

2049
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,880
you're surprised.

2050
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:23,700
It is, it's in that little print that a lot of you probably don't read, but people will

2051
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:27,480
try to call customer service and it's not something that they really do.

2052
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:32,800
So, uh, the Norwegian consumer council initially kind of started to try to change this policy

2053
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:38,340
but now the German consumer protection authority has collaborated with the Norwegian consumer

2054
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:43,220
council and is now going to take legal action against Nintendo Europe because Nintendo Europe

2055
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:45,020
is based in Germany.

2056
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:48,320
Now if you think our courts are slow, so are theirs.

2057
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:52,400
So it's not something that's going to happen overnight, but, uh, there's some, uh, further

2058
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,320
details about what's going on here.

2059
01:52:54,320 --> 01:53:00,560
Um, Nintendo did cite the article 16 of the European consumer law directive in their defense

2060
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:05,280
and it says it doesn't have to allow cancellation if quote, the performance has begun with the

2061
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:10,040
consumer's prior express consent, which they're doing with the pop-up and with the acknowledgement

2062
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:13,660
that he will lose his right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed

2063
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:14,800
by the trader.

2064
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,840
But in the retort, the Norwegian consumer council said the company plainly states that

2065
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,360
all purchases are final.

2066
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:24,180
According to the right of withdrawal laid out in the consumer rights directive, such

2067
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:28,640
terms are illegal until the game can be downloaded and launched.

2068
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:33,280
The seller cannot prohibit the consumer from canceling their preorder, which makes sense.

2069
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:37,120
They really shouldn't be able to do that yet is a little weird because I mean, unless you've

2070
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:42,800
actually downloaded the game, I mean, I don't understand you haven't downloaded anything

2071
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,800
yet.

2072
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:44,800
Well, who cares?

2073
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:45,800
Let's, let's ask this question too.

2074
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:49,200
Why is anyone preordering anything anymore?

2075
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:53,100
Because people preorder stuff because they're either really excited about, they want to

2076
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:57,000
actually buy something because they know that they want it or they're doing it because of

2077
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,280
some sort of bonus that they're throwing in.

2078
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:02,680
And that's really, that's the whole preorder culture.

2079
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,680
I understand.

2080
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:05,440
It's got to be the bonus.

2081
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:11,280
It makes sense in the sense of like physical copies because you have to know what to, you

2082
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,680
have to know what to bring in as far as inventory.

2083
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,720
And so you need to have those preorders that gauge a number of like, here's how many copies

2084
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:20,240
we need to bring in at this location type of thing.

2085
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:24,920
But it's just, I buy a lot of stuff online and so I want to lock in that release day

2086
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:28,460
shipping from a major online retailer that I use.

2087
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:32,520
And so, uh, you know, that might be as, but that's about as far out as I preorder.

2088
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:39,240
Usually I've had a copy of Kingdom Hearts three on preorder since like 2013 because

2089
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:44,160
said major online retailer accidentally listed it for like $40 at one point.

2090
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:47,760
And so like I preordered it then and so now they have to honor that price.

2091
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:48,840
They don't have to do shit.

2092
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,800
They can cancel your order and then I guess they could, but they better not.

2093
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:52,800
That's not a nice thing to do.

2094
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,280
I'll cancel my prime.

2095
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,280
I won't.

2096
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,040
But anyway, I don't think they're going to do it.

2097
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:02,760
I think they are still on re because if you think about it, when the, uh, they were, um,

2098
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:07,560
giving you the 15% discounts or 20%, whatever the hell it was anyway, that was about the

2099
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:08,560
equivalent of that.

2100
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:09,560
Anyway.

2101
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:13,380
Now, yes, they got rid of that, but they're probably just writing it off for this one.

2102
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:17,520
You know, how many people got what I got and are still locked into it?

2103
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:22,360
Probably not very many, probably also in related news, Kingdom Hearts three is like actually

2104
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,660
a real thing that's going to happen.

2105
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:27,660
I kind of can't believe it.

2106
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:28,660
You know what I mean?

2107
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:31,560
Like, I feel like this game has been like a non-existent thing for so long and now it's

2108
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:37,600
like actually going to happen and it's really weird, but anyway, um, Bobby Black Wolf points

2109
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:41,800
out in our chat that he got the same detail, uh, but, uh, he wishes he was getting it on

2110
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:46,000
Xbox one X probably because of the four K stuff and you know, the things his, his theater

2111
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
can do.

2112
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,240
But for that price, he'll deal with it.

2113
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:52,880
He says, uh, and then act F says, I can only imagine dark soccer's ears burning right now

2114
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,280
with everyone using the word preorder.

2115
01:55:55,280 --> 01:56:00,700
Well, unfortunately, whether it's gram grammatically correct or not, that is the term that everybody

2116
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:01,700
kind of runs with.

2117
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:03,400
So that's what we're using here too for now.

2118
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:08,560
And really you shouldn't preorder games because agreed just in the like nowadays, like a lot

2119
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:14,920
of stuff gets released, even if it's like a well known, like a quality Bethesda, most

2120
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:18,040
of the, okay, but that's the games where the most of them come out.

2121
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,040
They're functional.

2122
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:22,640
I mean, and they, they're not terrible.

2123
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:26,120
They granted kind of said that with a question mark, they're functional.

2124
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:27,120
Yeah.

2125
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:32,720
They're, they're, I mean like Skyrim and oblivion and like, and you'll follow three

2126
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:33,720
and stuff like that.

2127
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:35,800
I mean, they were functional.

2128
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:36,800
You would be satisfied.

2129
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:37,800
Okay.

2130
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:38,800
This is a full game.

2131
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:39,800
You know, whatever.

2132
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:43,320
It's not completely broken out of the gate like it is with like the fallout 76 or a lot

2133
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:47,040
of these games are releasing kind of in a broken state because, Oh, we need to get

2134
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,320
it out right away.

2135
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:52,160
So that's kind of one reason why you don't want to necessarily preorder because it could

2136
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:54,000
be a broken mess for a very long time.

2137
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:00,120
And if they're more interested in selling those emotes and DLC than fixing the game,

2138
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,540
you're going to be stuck with a broken game for a long time.

2139
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:07,640
Why should you have to give them money upfront to be a beta tester for their fucking product?

2140
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:11,400
I think there'll probably be less and less people preordering in 2019.

2141
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,520
I just, you know, especially now that you know that if you do it with Nintendo, you

2142
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:15,520
can't cancel it.

2143
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:18,800
I mean, I don't know how many people are really like, like, you know, if you want super smash

2144
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,240
brothers, like you're not canceling that shit.

2145
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,240
You know what I mean?

2146
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:25,980
Like it's very rare, but I can also see people's personal life circumstance.

2147
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:30,660
Like what if you preordered a bunch of games and then heaven forbid you lose your job or

2148
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:34,220
you have a huge financial emergency of some other sort and you're like, all right, something's

2149
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:35,220
got to go.

2150
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,360
I better cut back all these games.

2151
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:40,720
But if you did that with Nintendo, you can't, we'll just don't do it through their eShop.

2152
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:46,000
You can do it at like a game store and because you're only putting $5 down there and you

2153
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,740
can go in and cancel your game.

2154
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:54,440
And they'll invest your $5 and then give you just the $5 back and keep whatever got invested.

2155
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:55,440
Yeah.

2156
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,440
Cause that's how it works.

2157
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:57,440
Some of these games.

2158
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:58,440
So like, I don't understand.

2159
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:59,440
I get it.

2160
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,600
Like the, you need to know how many copies of something and that's more of like for obscure

2161
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:05,680
games, like, like, Oh, if I wanted to get earth defense force, you know, the day it

2162
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:10,640
comes out, I might want to preorder that because if I want a physical copy, they might not

2163
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,840
order a lot of those because they're not expecting a lot of people want it.

2164
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,880
So that would be something I would need to go in there and actually order a copy of.

2165
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:22,480
But if it's like Red Dead Redemption 2, they're ordering all the fucking copies they can get

2166
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:26,480
and you're not going to have a problem getting that in, you know, getting that day one.

2167
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:31,200
Um, of course they'll tell you that it's going to be a problem, but you know, Bobby Blackwolf

2168
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:36,480
in chat says I preorder hardware like rock band stuff, but that that's different because

2169
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:39,960
you know, there'll be limited supply and some companies have real problems keeping

2170
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:40,960
them in stock.

2171
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:41,960
Right?

2172
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:42,960
Nintendo.

2173
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:44,360
You know what I mean?

2174
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:47,320
So anyhow, it'll be interesting to see what comes of this.

2175
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:51,160
If Nintendo is going to be forced to change their policy in Europe anyway, remember there's

2176
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:55,600
no reason why it would just be Europe that changes, but uh, it is interesting as we're

2177
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:01,120
starting to elect more and more people from, you know, the generation X and millennial

2178
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:08,640
generation into, um, Congress and into elected offices, you get more and more people that

2179
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:09,640
are familiar with it.

2180
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:16,560
God, I fucking cannot wait for some computer literate people to be in the fucking Congress

2181
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,560
and Senate.

2182
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,280
I already caught house in the Senate.

2183
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:23,520
It's happening slowly, but it's not fucking like I know everybody's watched the clips

2184
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:30,060
online of like people trying to explain to senators, you know, here's what an I or here's

2185
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:31,340
what Android is.

2186
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:32,340
Here's what Google is.

2187
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:33,340
You know?

2188
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:34,340
Oh, my iPhone's not working.

2189
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:35,340
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

2190
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,340
We don't make that phone.

2191
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:42,100
You know, we talking about, it's the same thing is it's like, I just want like somebody

2192
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:45,300
that knows what the fuck they're doing to be voting on it.

2193
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:48,540
Like you can't vote on the internet if you don't know what the fucking internet is.

2194
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:49,540
Grandpa.

2195
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:56,420
I mean, seriously, just fucking like if you're that incompetent and stupid with it, you shouldn't

2196
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:57,820
be voting on anything.

2197
01:59:57,820 --> 01:59:58,820
You should be out.

2198
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:01,180
What's his whining term limits?

2199
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:02,380
What's what's her name?

2200
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:05,100
I don't want to get too political, but I do crack again.

2201
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:09,020
This person I know is super controversial because she's she's really, really left.

2202
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:13,380
Alessandra Cortez, I know you're talking about, right?

2203
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:14,380
Sorry, guy.

2204
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:15,380
I'm so sorry.

2205
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:18,260
I just don't have the news articles in front of me and I forget the name in the moment,

2206
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:19,860
but I'm actually complimenting her.

2207
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:21,020
I think it's cool.

2208
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:24,060
Like politics aside, I don't want to bring that up right now, but like just the fact

2209
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:28,780
that if you go to her Twitter, she posts pictures of herself on Friday nights watching Drag

2210
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:30,340
Race, holding a glass of wine.

2211
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:33,680
And I'm like, politicians can be just like us.

2212
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:34,680
It's amazing.

2213
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:35,680
You know what I mean?

2214
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:36,680
It's like, it's like that.

2215
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:39,780
Now that feels like a representation of me.

2216
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:40,780
You know what I mean?

2217
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:47,700
You didn't feel represented by the guy that spent all that campaign money on Steam games.

2218
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:48,700
Maybe a little bit.

2219
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:50,900
Maybe a little work of gold or whatever the hell it was.

2220
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:51,900
Thank you.

2221
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:52,900
The chat room.

2222
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:53,900
Uh, saving me there.

2223
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:54,900
Ocasio Cortez.

2224
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:55,900
That's her name.

2225
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:56,900
That sounds, that sounds right.

2226
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:57,900
I don't know.

2227
02:00:58,020 --> 02:00:59,020
Michael pointing out.

2228
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:02,860
Ted Lou has a computer BS in computer science and a BA in political science.

2229
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:04,280
So there you go.

2230
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:09,620
And DJ Rama S says she's being nerfed in the Senate as we speak, but she's in the house.

2231
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:10,620
Isn't she?

2232
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:13,260
Anyway, I don't want to do, I don't want to do blog, but I couldn't help but think of

2233
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:17,660
that when we talk about, you know, more and more game aware people like, you know, we'll

2234
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:18,660
never forget.

2235
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:23,140
I just brought this up in the show recently in that Supreme court ruling where like one

2236
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:26,880
of the Supreme court justices offices, like all the staff knew mortal combat.

2237
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:27,880
They all played it growing up.

2238
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:28,880
You know what I mean?

2239
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:29,880
Exactly.

2240
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:35,320
It's a very different way of looking at it than when it was 1992 and you had what Alan

2241
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:39,300
Tipper Gore, whoever it was up there going like, you know, kids today are playing this

2242
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:44,000
filth and you know, holding up a copy of night trap, which is the most ridiculous fucking

2243
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
game in retrospect.

2244
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,800
If you just can't keep up with what's going on out in the world, then it's going to be

2245
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,600
hard to be able to make rules about it.

2246
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:56,260
It means, I don't know, then didn't you re you know, you have to rely on lobbyists to

2247
02:01:56,260 --> 02:02:00,220
tell you what's going on and they're like, well, you see this, you know, free open internet's

2248
02:02:00,220 --> 02:02:01,220
bad.

2249
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:02,220
You need to do this.

2250
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:03,220
Oh, okay.

2251
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:05,460
Cause you don't know the fucking going on.

2252
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:08,780
I mean, it's, it's just dumb, but anyways, enough politics, enough politics.

2253
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:09,780
Next story.

2254
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:10,780
Anyway.

2255
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:16,460
So speaking of things that aren't so great, I see now I used to be a huge fan of the lemmings

2256
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:24,660
and you know, back when geo cities was a thing, I used to do drawings of back when it was

2257
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:25,660
what spectrum?

2258
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:27,540
Holobyte was the company that made it right away.

2259
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:28,540
Yeah.

2260
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:29,540
Psychosis.

2261
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:30,540
Oh, okay.

2262
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:33,380
Um, which, you know, originally it's right.

2263
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:34,380
You're right.

2264
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:35,380
You're right.

2265
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:37,820
DMA done designs, you know, did, uh, grand theft auto and stuff.

2266
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:39,460
So lemmings lemmings too.

2267
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:41,620
You know, I used to, that'd be doing my jam.

2268
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:48,500
Um, well now they have lemmings coming out, uh, mobile platforms and if you've never played

2269
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:53,300
lemmings, just say it was these little, you know, cause lemmings, they just follow blindly.

2270
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:54,300
Like that's what a lemming is.

2271
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:55,300
Right.

2272
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:57,940
But they actually made a little character out of it and they would be, they would March

2273
02:02:57,940 --> 02:02:59,700
in a line and like it was a puzzler game.

2274
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:00,700
Right.

2275
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:03,260
Like you had to get the lemmings to the exit without letting them die.

2276
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:06,300
But you had to make like builder lemmings, you had to build a wall.

2277
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,700
So the lemming would like turn around, go the other way.

2278
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:10,240
Like it was a puzzle game basically.

2279
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:16,020
So, um, here's the only thing about this because it is a mobile game.

2280
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:20,380
You know, there's the mobile tax, which is the tax on your patients and on your wallet

2281
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:25,860
because, um, in the game, of course, you know, because you have the different types of lemmings

2282
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:27,660
that you can create moves and stuff like that.

2283
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:31,980
Apparently, according to some of the chat comments here, each costs one in game currency

2284
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:33,100
to do a move.

2285
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:38,980
And if you run out of moves, then you have to wait two hours or for 20 more of said currency.

2286
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:45,700
And otherwise you're going to buy like gold to do a move, I guess.

2287
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:48,380
I would have thought maybe to unlock new boards or to get it.

2288
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:49,380
I don't know.

2289
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:52,300
That's what I'm reading, but you know what, here's the thing.

2290
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:56,180
So if you want to check it out, it's pro it's free to play.

2291
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:57,180
So check it out.

2292
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:58,180
You don't like it.

2293
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:01,420
Or if it's just bullshit with the fucking microtransactions, delete, delete.

2294
02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:05,140
I mean, it's, that's the easiest thing I could recommend.

2295
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:07,540
Comments from our chat over at a Twitch TV vog network.

2296
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:10,180
Uh, DJ Rama S says, I fucking love lemmings.

2297
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:11,540
Pretty, pretty simple comment there.

2298
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:12,980
But I mean, it looks like lemmings.

2299
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:13,980
It looks pretty cool.

2300
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:18,380
It's just, I, I, uh, what's that wheel?

2301
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:22,420
I just saw it spin a wheel and like you get like super lemmings or different things, but

2302
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:23,420
character lemmings.

2303
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:24,420
Oh Lord.

2304
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:25,420
Anyway.

2305
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:29,340
Uh, Brack, the man has played this a little bit, a comment here saying I'm a pretty hardcore

2306
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:34,940
lemmings fan and I've been playing a bunch of this mobile game and what a bummer.

2307
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:35,940
I'm sorry.

2308
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:36,940
That's fine.

2309
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:39,180
I've been playing a bunch of it and I hate it.

2310
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:43,100
I don't know why, but I can't stop playing it.

2311
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:44,100
I hear that.

2312
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:46,660
Uh, Dr. C says I did like lemmings on super Nintendo.

2313
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:48,780
I think we rented it once or twice back then.

2314
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:49,780
Yeah.

2315
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:52,980
That was around the time that it was, you know, really at its peak on PC was like lemmings

2316
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:58,020
and lemmings too, you know, with all the music on the ad lib card and all that stuff back

2317
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:59,020
in the day.

2318
02:04:59,020 --> 02:05:00,020
So yeah.

2319
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,020
The originals were great.

2320
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:03,380
I had lemmings two on PC and lemmings one on NES.

2321
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:05,400
They did a PlayStation version, didn't they?

2322
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,400
They had to.

2323
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,400
They probably did.

2324
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:08,400
Super lemmings.

2325
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:13,900
Funny enough, the last lemmings game that came out was a PlayStation mobile title.

2326
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:19,780
So I think it was also a mobile port as well, but it was also on a PSP and Vita.

2327
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:20,780
So they have that.

2328
02:05:20,780 --> 02:05:25,300
Um, but I mean, it's all right.

2329
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:26,300
All right.

2330
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:29,500
Well, uh, this is, you know, we were talking about Kingdom Hearts three a little bit ago

2331
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:34,220
and some people are getting an even better deal than, uh, the, uh, pre-order at a cheap

2332
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:35,220
price.

2333
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:37,300
Some people are already playing it.

2334
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:38,380
That's right.

2335
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:42,540
Even though the game is not supposed to come out until January 29th, some people already

2336
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,540
have it.

2337
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:45,260
Six weeks in advance.

2338
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:50,340
Uh, and this was confirmed, uh, developer, uh, Nomura confirmed copies of Kingdom Hearts

2339
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:52,260
three are out there six weeks ahead of schedule.

2340
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:54,220
Of course, they didn't say how it happened.

2341
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:59,980
If you want to believe rumors, there's some indie retailer in Mexico that put one on the

2342
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:00,980
street.

2343
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:01,980
I don't know.

2344
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:04,200
But my question is how the hell did they have it that far out?

2345
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:09,140
That's I really thought it's the, it's the distributor or whoever's, well, it's, it's

2346
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:13,860
really, it comes down to Sony's fault because Sony doesn't know any of these distributors

2347
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:18,700
shouldn't or companies shouldn't be shipping that product to these distributors that early

2348
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:21,860
and they shouldn't be shipping it out to the stores that early and the source shouldn't

2349
02:06:21,860 --> 02:06:23,220
be putting it out that early.

2350
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:29,100
So it's just somehow maybe copies fell off of a truck out of a duplicator or something

2351
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:30,100
like that.

2352
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:32,660
I don't know, but it shouldn't be out that early.

2353
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:36,420
Now here's the interesting thing in the statement from Nomura over on Twitter on the official

2354
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:42,740
Kingdom Hearts Twitter is that he's telling people to avoid clips, avoid spoilers, obviously,

2355
02:06:42,740 --> 02:06:44,420
you know, that's the type of thing he wants to do.

2356
02:06:44,420 --> 02:06:47,780
I'm sure Twitch is shutting that down as is YouTube.

2357
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:52,480
You know, it's, I, I believe it's against Twitch terms of service to stream a game before

2358
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:56,980
it's officially out unless of course you have permission, you know, you have a, you're a

2359
02:06:56,980 --> 02:07:01,740
media outlet or something, but that's, that's special circumstance.

2360
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:08,540
But anyway, apparently Nomura confirmed the epilogue and a secret movie, which apparently

2361
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:10,860
is some of the biggest spoilers out there.

2362
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:12,620
They're not on the disc.

2363
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:15,660
They will be released later just in case.

2364
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,220
And this was the case.

2365
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:22,220
So the biggest spoiler, I mean, some spoilers will leak, but the biggest ones can't.

2366
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:25,140
They are locked or they're, they're not on the disc.

2367
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:28,180
So you have to actually download a day one patch to get it.

2368
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:32,020
Uh, yeah, it's released at a later date just in case, so they will not be shown before

2369
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:33,500
the game's release.

2370
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:37,140
And Nomura continues, we want everybody to equally experience the full game after its

2371
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:38,140
release.

2372
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:40,340
So we ask for your continued support on its matter.

2373
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:44,260
We're grateful that fans have been warning each other already about the spoilers and

2374
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:45,380
so on and so on.

2375
02:07:45,380 --> 02:07:47,340
Do they finally kill Donald Duck?

2376
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:53,660
That would be a great, I told you, bitch, if you don't heal me this time, it's over.

2377
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:56,980
Heal please.

2378
02:07:57,020 --> 02:08:00,860
So anyway, I, and I may, maybe that is the, no, I made it up, I made that up, but I know,

2379
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:02,180
and they're not going to kill a Disney character.

2380
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:03,180
Give me a break.

2381
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:04,700
Um, well maybe they do.

2382
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:05,700
Maybe that's the gag.

2383
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:06,700
Maybe they do.

2384
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:07,700
I don't know.

2385
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:09,700
They might kill one of the square characters, but they're not going to kill a Disney character.

2386
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,700
So I don't know.

2387
02:08:10,700 --> 02:08:15,060
So I don't know if it's those kinds of spoilers or, you know, so and so was X, Y, Z all along

2388
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:18,580
or what it is, but just be careful surfing the internet.

2389
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:21,420
There's a lot of people that are very sensitive about spoiler stuff.

2390
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:25,740
So, um, you know, but, but like on the, the Kingdom Hearts, Reddit and stuff, they're

2391
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:29,760
not letting people talk about it and those sorts of things.

2392
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:33,460
So just keep it in your pants till January 29th when everybody can play it.

2393
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:38,820
But it is, it's fascinating that it did leak this soon.

2394
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:40,820
You know what I mean?

2395
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:41,820
Yes.

2396
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:42,820
Yeah.

2397
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:48,220
Um, what happens though, if you are somebody perhaps in Mexico or in another country or

2398
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:52,620
in a remote area, like in Alaska where you don't have a strong internet connection to

2399
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:55,400
download this stuff on a day one patch.

2400
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:57,400
Now what do you do?

2401
02:08:57,400 --> 02:09:00,500
I think that's a good question too, is it's like, well, this move kind of screws those

2402
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,620
people.

2403
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:04,460
It's gotta be a day one patch that they're doing that and they can't like, what if I

2404
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:06,140
can't connect to the internet and do it?

2405
02:09:06,140 --> 02:09:11,020
So is it, are we just at the point where it's like, if you don't have internet, you shouldn't

2406
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:12,820
have a piece PlayStation four.

2407
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:15,220
Is that just where we're, is that where game companies are at?

2408
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:17,100
Yeah, that's interesting.

2409
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:22,420
I really feel like that is just kind of like the unspoken, like nobody wants to say that.

2410
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:25,220
And I'm not saying that, but the industry, the industry is saying that with what these

2411
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:28,580
actions here is their basis to say, if you don't have internet, maybe PlayStation four

2412
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:34,220
isn't for you or, or Xbox one or you know, anything that is, is really online a lot.

2413
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:38,780
And I think this may be especially so with PlayStation five and what we get to for the

2414
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:44,340
next generation and act Efton point act Efton chat says it is what it is, Robin, that there's

2415
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:45,340
really nothing.

2416
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:48,300
Not going to make anybody not buy the game because they're going to have to download

2417
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:49,300
a huge day.

2418
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:50,300
One patch.

2419
02:09:50,300 --> 02:09:53,300
It's not, that's not going to change anybody's mind.

2420
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:57,540
No, you might have one or two Twitter, crazy people that are like, this is an outrage,

2421
02:09:57,540 --> 02:10:00,820
but it's just, it's just not, it's not going to change people's mind.

2422
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:06,500
I mean, it's, it's the day and age where like, you know, of course you have internet.

2423
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:08,660
What don't you have internet?

2424
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:09,660
Don't you have phones?

2425
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:12,740
Don't you have a phone?

2426
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:16,060
Just a few more stories before we try to get to the Skype line tonight, and then we'll

2427
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:17,060
wrap up.

2428
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:19,860
I don't know if Skype is going to work tonight, you guys though, but we'll try.

2429
02:10:19,860 --> 02:10:25,980
It's going to be so long story short, um, the Skype thing on the old, the old thing,

2430
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:27,820
like finally died.

2431
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:30,820
And so I have to get Alan to do, since we're going to be off next week, I have to get Alan

2432
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:34,940
to do the upgrade on this computer so that way I can run the new stuff and then we'll

2433
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:36,140
be able to do that again.

2434
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:38,940
Or I've got to be able to do it over here, but long story short, I got to run it off

2435
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:39,980
my phone.

2436
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:41,700
But I think in this period, we're going to be gone.

2437
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:45,140
I can get Alan to do those upgrades in this PC and then I'll be, I'll be all good and

2438
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:49,940
can run the new Skype and have this on windows 10 and all that stuff and, and be set.

2439
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:50,940
So that'll be nice.

2440
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:55,220
But yeah, they finally killed Skype on the old windows, which we knew was coming in like

2441
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:56,380
November or something like that.

2442
02:10:56,380 --> 02:11:00,300
So Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, filthy animal.

2443
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:03,940
So all right, anyhow, uh, let's get to a few more stories.

2444
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:04,940
Loki.

2445
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:11,400
So Blizzard is going to be, if you are going to be cheating in Overwatch or breaking rules,

2446
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,660
it's going to go on your permanent record.

2447
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:17,260
They're going to have this, I'm going to note this in your file, the, yes, they're this

2448
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:18,560
Overwatch league.

2449
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:24,520
Uh, they've got a discipline tracker that's basically going to log any sort of infractions

2450
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:29,360
that players have, um, in different events and you'll be able to actually view those

2451
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:30,360
infractions.

2452
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:36,680
Um, they said that the tracker is, uh, seven players have already been penalized according

2453
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:37,680
to the tracker.

2454
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:45,160
Um, and of course, league play doesn't start until February 14th, but, um, they're going

2455
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:51,440
to be conducting, I guess, full reviews of players conduct in history and, um, gamers

2456
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,440
as well.

2457
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:58,100
Um, when they're picked up by teams and just going to be, it's, um, apparently players

2458
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:03,040
who are not in an Overwatch league team could face suspensions or fines if they returned

2459
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:04,600
to league play.

2460
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:11,520
Um, but yeah, it's, it's interesting that they're really keeping track of all that stuff.

2461
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:15,360
Uh, of course, you know, they've been punishing them for other things other than breaking

2462
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:20,120
rules, but like making, you know, racist, shitty things on their Twitch streams and

2463
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:21,120
stuff.

2464
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:22,120
Yeah.

2465
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:23,120
Yeah.

2466
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:24,120
We know about that.

2467
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:25,560
So I was, I was, I was, when we brought this up, I was fascinated, like how many people

2468
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:32,600
were already on it and it seems like the most major infraction is some type of like bot,

2469
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:36,280
bot botting, um, like power leveling and a low B account.

2470
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:37,280
What do they call it?

2471
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:38,280
Thank you.

2472
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:41,000
So it's been count boosting for two account boost account boosting.

2473
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
That's what it is.

2474
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:46,040
And that's when you get like a high level player who plays something low, like a throwaway

2475
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:48,960
account or something to play against like lower level players.

2476
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:53,600
Or, uh, I want to say it has something to do with like helping people get up into the

2477
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:55,340
big ranks fast.

2478
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:59,120
Like basically you go play on a low account, you play really, really, really well and you

2479
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:01,840
kind of like boost the skill level of that account.

2480
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:05,440
So whoever really wants to play it can play with higher level people, if that makes sense.

2481
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:08,400
I don't know why you would do this, but people probably play pay money for this.

2482
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:09,400
Yeah.

2483
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:12,120
They have had one person that's been a find a thousand dollars for account sharing.

2484
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:17,760
Uh, one person that was suspended three games for selling an account and obstructing league

2485
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:18,760
off.

2486
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,960
Is it official, official investigation?

2487
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:21,960
Then try to hide it.

2488
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:24,120
Uh, act F says it's called smurfing as well.

2489
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:25,880
I knew there was another term for that.

2490
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:26,880
Yeah.

2491
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:27,880
So interesting.

2492
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:30,520
Uh, when the new, the new season of the league hasn't even started.

2493
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:32,560
Um, and I know they unveiled all the new teams.

2494
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,200
There's a lot of new teams out there.

2495
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:39,200
Uh, I did not see if there were any more women maybe with all these expansion teams.

2496
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:43,000
Cause you know, I was kind of like, where are the women at?

2497
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,560
And uh, the two I looked at didn't have any, but to be fair, I haven't looked at all the

2498
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,460
new teams, so I don't know.

2499
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:53,240
But I'm, I'm preparing myself to be extremely disappointed that we're not progressing much

2500
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:54,240
in that.

2501
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:57,980
But is it because they're just not allowing women to play or is it just because women

2502
02:13:57,980 --> 02:13:59,400
just don't want to do it?

2503
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:02,940
I think they aren't trying hard enough to find women.

2504
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:04,120
That's kind of what it is.

2505
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:07,480
Or, you know, recruit, train, build up women.

2506
02:14:07,480 --> 02:14:08,480
You know what I mean?

2507
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:12,320
I think there's, there's, there's tons of women out there who love Overwatch.

2508
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:15,880
Like go to any anime convention and people that are dressing up and a lot of people posting

2509
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:20,440
online, there's tons of women that love Overwatch and I'm, I'm sure just like there's plenty

2510
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:22,640
of boys who want to get good at it.

2511
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:25,920
There's plenty of girls who want to get good at it and are trying to get good at it too.

2512
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:32,040
But for whatever reason, we're just, because gaming has typically been a very bro culture,

2513
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:35,680
and I've kind of addressed this before, I don't want to retry the wheel too much, but

2514
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:40,840
you know, we're just not making those kinds of opportunities and we're not, you know,

2515
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:41,840
it's great.

2516
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:45,040
We have at least one, but I don't want just a token.

2517
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:50,520
You know, there should be several women in the league for folks to look up to and aspire

2518
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:51,520
to be.

2519
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:53,640
But again, I have not looked at all the new teams.

2520
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:58,560
If somebody wants to correct me and let me know there's, there's more folks joining Aguirre,

2521
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,560
that would be fantastic.

2522
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:04,800
But, oh yeah, and Act F points out, there's a lot of Overwatch girl streamers and they're

2523
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:05,800
pretty good.

2524
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:07,200
Don't know if they're pro level players.

2525
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:11,660
Well, you know, it's, you have to kind of open, you start at the local level with the

2526
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:13,300
tournaments and things like that.

2527
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:17,520
But if the tournament culture is toxic to women and not accepting women and women get

2528
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:21,760
in there and they just get like awkwardly hit on and you know, and I'm probably not

2529
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:22,880
the right person to talk about this.

2530
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:27,280
You know, maybe Dar Sakura or other women out there can talk about some of the experiences

2531
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:30,480
of weirdos at these events or not feeling welcomed.

2532
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:35,520
And I think what we can do as dudes is just welcome everybody.

2533
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,520
That's all we have to do.

2534
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:38,320
Make sure everybody feels welcome.

2535
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:44,000
It seems that a lot of people that are like focused on being very good in like video games

2536
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:49,360
tend to be a bit more introverted and socially awkward and don't necessarily know how to

2537
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:53,200
conduct themselves normally around people in general.

2538
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:56,200
We can correct that appropriately too.

2539
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:01,280
We can call that out and say, Hey, like you really shouldn't say that to somebody.

2540
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:03,040
You know, we can do that too.

2541
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:04,040
You know what I mean?

2542
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:06,040
And that's probably missing to be fair.

2543
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:07,040
That's probably a big part of it.

2544
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,400
So anyway, I didn't mean to retread that whole ground.

2545
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:11,420
Sorry, but I had to come up and I do.

2546
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:13,560
So it's, it's something I feel strongly about.

2547
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:14,560
All right.

2548
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:18,200
Anyway, uh, we do have one more story for you guys tonight and it is about the, this

2549
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:20,160
brand new toy for kids.

2550
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,840
I don't know if it's something your kids are probably too old for this at this point because

2551
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:27,280
it's a new Fisher Price toy and it looks like, it looks like an Xbox controller.

2552
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:28,960
So it's like something for like babies.

2553
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:32,400
It looks like an Xbox controller with little like numbers and letters all over it.

2554
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:38,840
But here's the hilarious thing is that apparently somebody at Fisher Price actually programmed

2555
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:41,640
up up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

2556
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:45,520
Be a start into this controller.

2557
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:50,560
So when you do it, it actually like will like flash and play a special sound and all this

2558
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:51,560
stuff.

2559
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:54,560
So it's kind of like, it's really one of those funny things that they did there.

2560
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:55,560
So it's awesome.

2561
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:56,560
Yeah.

2562
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:59,280
So it actually will like, you know, call out all the letters and shapes and all that stuff.

2563
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:00,280
It's kind of fun.

2564
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:02,720
So a little, a little hidden secret thing that they did there.

2565
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:08,240
So um, cute is the type of thing you'd buy for a new kid.

2566
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:09,240
New baby.

2567
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,240
Yeah.

2568
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:11,240
Yeah.

2569
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:12,240
New baby.

2570
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:13,240
Probably more so, but something that the adult, cause you know, sometimes you can't help it.

2571
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:14,240
You can't play with your baby's toys.

2572
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,680
You're like, you kind of play with it a little bit.

2573
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:16,680
You're going to try.

2574
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:19,440
Well, somebody did clearly.

2575
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:21,440
Clearly it's like, Oh, Hey.

2576
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:22,440
Yeah.

2577
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:23,440
All right.

2578
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:27,560
So anyhow, um, I'm going to try to get Skype open here in a moment.

2579
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:30,800
I needed to do this on my cell phone, but I got to sign out of my other account to do

2580
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:31,800
that.

2581
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:34,160
So while I'm switching that over on my phone, uh, Loki, I don't know if you have any last

2582
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:35,400
minute stories.

2583
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:41,480
Um, if our Skype line is kind of flopping tonight as well, you can also feel free to,

2584
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:47,240
uh, send us questions in our chat room, uh, over at Twitch TV and we'll get to some of

2585
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:50,700
those, um, questions in chat as well.

2586
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:52,600
So we'll get to that here shortly.

2587
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:56,520
I just have to switch over cause I'm signed into my personal account right now and I'm

2588
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,580
going to switch over to the orange launch radio account and then we can start taking

2589
02:17:58,580 --> 02:17:59,580
some calls.

2590
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:02,920
So while we wait for that, I don't know if we have any, uh, last minute stories, last

2591
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:03,920
minute stories.

2592
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:07,640
We can talk a little bit about the Soulja boy game console and I mean, okay, I'll be

2593
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:08,640
fast.

2594
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:09,640
Long story short.

2595
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:16,160
Um, he is drop shipping these like retro game consoles that you see like in like mall kiosks

2596
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:17,160
and stuff like that.

2597
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:23,000
Basically these consoles that emulate other systems and have like all these illegal roms

2598
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
thrown on there.

2599
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:29,400
Um, and then he's calling them the Soulja boy game consoles and stuff and it's like,

2600
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:34,160
that's bad enough at as it is, that's these really shitty Chinese knockoff consoles that

2601
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:35,440
have stolen roms in there.

2602
02:18:35,440 --> 02:18:39,240
But then he's just doubling down on that shit basically when people are calling him out

2603
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:43,280
on it and saying, Hey Nintendo, I, you might want to take a look at this because there's

2604
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:47,680
fucking NES roms on this shit and then Ted has come after people for a lot less.

2605
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:52,240
Uh, so now he's just like, you know, fuck all you guys, I don't give a fuck of what

2606
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:53,240
Nintendo does.

2607
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:55,720
You know, come at me bro type of shit.

2608
02:18:55,720 --> 02:19:01,700
And so, you know, he's been posting stuff on Twitter and that's been not so necessarily

2609
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:07,780
nice and um, to which people have basically said like myself, that's not going to end

2610
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:12,620
well for you sir, but it'll be interesting to see how that goes.

2611
02:19:12,620 --> 02:19:13,860
All right, let's see if this works.

2612
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:14,860
I'm going to try to do it live.

2613
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:16,060
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

2614
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:18,060
Who's this?

2615
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:20,580
Oh, I'm not hearing it.

2616
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:21,580
Hold on.

2617
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:22,580
Rage nator.

2618
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:24,180
Uh, it might be cause my volume is all the way down.

2619
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:25,180
Try again.

2620
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:26,180
Rage nator.

2621
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:31,740
Oh, I was worried about, wait, maybe, maybe the issues over here.

2622
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:32,740
Hold on.

2623
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:34,740
I'm going to try to fix one thing over here real quick.

2624
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:35,740
I don't know.

2625
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:36,740
Live radio folks.

2626
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:37,740
I know.

2627
02:19:37,740 --> 02:19:38,740
That's television.

2628
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:39,740
Oh, you know what?

2629
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:40,740
No.

2630
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:41,740
I had this knob all the way down, so I bet that's why we couldn't hear him.

2631
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:42,740
Try again.

2632
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:43,740
Rage nator.

2633
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:44,740
Are you there?

2634
02:19:44,740 --> 02:19:45,740
Can you hear me now?

2635
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:46,740
Yes, we can.

2636
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:47,740
Good.

2637
02:19:47,740 --> 02:19:48,740
I just needed to touch the knob.

2638
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:49,740
All right.

2639
02:19:49,740 --> 02:19:50,740
Anyway.

2640
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:52,740
Um, I can link that very well.

2641
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:53,740
Thank you.

2642
02:19:53,740 --> 02:19:54,740
What's on your mind tonight?

2643
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:55,740
Rage nator.

2644
02:19:55,740 --> 02:20:01,740
Uh, well since I already asked the question to Bobby, I can't, I didn't ask you now, especially

2645
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:05,740
since this will be your last show for the year.

2646
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:12,900
Um, what would you say is, uh, your game of the year or games?

2647
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:14,400
Game of the year or games.

2648
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:18,260
We're going to address this a little bit on our first episode back to give us a little

2649
02:20:18,260 --> 02:20:21,520
time to play more games, but give us an early preview.

2650
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:24,340
What do you think is in contention for your game of the year?

2651
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:26,740
Loki, what do you think is in contention for your game of the year?

2652
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:30,500
Um, contention, I would say probably Super Mario Odyssey because I picked up my Switch

2653
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:31,580
in April.

2654
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:35,100
So I mean for me that was kind of, you know, it was a really good game.

2655
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:39,300
So um, yeah, I'd probably be one of them.

2656
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:43,460
I really like, I didn't play a ton of games this year, at least I don't remember.

2657
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:48,340
I have to go back and think about it, but I would say absolutely expect to hear Tetris

2658
02:20:48,340 --> 02:20:49,900
Effect in my list somewhere.

2659
02:20:49,900 --> 02:20:53,260
I just haven't decided where it's going to be yet.

2660
02:20:54,260 --> 02:21:04,380
Yeah, um, now, uh, you know, I'm not totally sure if I guessed this last week or not, uh,

2661
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:11,660
but just in case I did not, um, seeing as Steam is having their Christmas sale right

2662
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:14,540
now, did you pick up anything?

2663
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:18,340
Not yet, but I'll probably go through my wish list later because I did see some games were

2664
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:20,940
down to like $5 or something like that.

2665
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:25,100
Look guys, I have Rage Nator trapped in the box, just like I had Bot Culture last week.

2666
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:28,980
Get me out, get me out!

2667
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:33,820
But not yet because thankfully Loki already bought me the Katamari Damacy, that wasn't

2668
02:21:33,820 --> 02:21:38,620
technically a sale though, but that was a Steam wish list purchase of sorts.

2669
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:45,340
So that's kind of where my holiday playtime has been, at least so far.

2670
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:48,620
Oh, excellent choice.

2671
02:21:48,620 --> 02:21:49,620
I agree.

2672
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:50,620
What about you?

2673
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:51,660
Do you have anything?

2674
02:21:51,660 --> 02:21:53,180
Like, tell us one game real quick.

2675
02:21:53,180 --> 02:22:03,380
Uh, well, um, I only got one thing, a piece of DLC, it's the Deluxe, uh, Edition Upgrade

2676
02:22:03,380 --> 02:22:12,820
to, um, what was the game, uh, Shadow Warrior 2, uh, that DLC is normally like $10, it was

2677
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:18,620
75% off, um, I already had the game for free.

2678
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:26,460
I only got the DLC because, for the soundtrack and to a lesser degree, the diary book, but,

2679
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:30,860
um, that was really the only thing I could have before, I just barely scraped together

2680
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:33,380
the $250 for that, so.

2681
02:22:33,380 --> 02:22:38,260
Well, there's also still a lot of time, because the sale goes on until what, like June, or

2682
02:22:38,260 --> 02:22:39,260
June?

2683
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:40,260
June.

2684
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:41,260
Until June!

2685
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,260
I don't like it.

2686
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:46,900
January 3rd, yeah, there it is, and it's January 3rd at 10am, so, um, you know, early in the

2687
02:22:46,900 --> 02:22:50,060
morning on January 3rd, but it's going through January 3rd, and I'm sure there's gonna be

2688
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:54,380
a lot of people that will get, like, gift cards and things that they get over the holiday

2689
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:57,900
that they'll want to spend on the store, and it seems like Steam no longer, like, I remember

2690
02:22:57,900 --> 02:23:01,680
they used to do this whole, it's on sale for this much, for these four hours, they kind

2691
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:03,020
of just stopped doing that, because they really-

2692
02:23:03,020 --> 02:23:04,740
They do different things each day.

2693
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:09,860
It switches up, I like to, I tend to go to the Game Deals subreddit, and I watch stuff

2694
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:12,580
through there, because they'll tell you, like, all these different sites that things are

2695
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:17,060
on sale, and you may even see, like, free games, like Humble was offering, like, a free

2696
02:23:17,060 --> 02:23:19,380
LEGO game last week, and a free LEGO game this week, so.

2697
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:20,380
Oh, cool.

2698
02:23:20,380 --> 02:23:21,380
I've been adding stuff-

2699
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:23,180
Oh, is it, doesn't the Epic store start giving away games?

2700
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:28,020
Yeah, Epic Store is doing Subnautica right now, so you can pick that up, um, so you may

2701
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:31,580
want to do that, I think I already have that, though, so I haven't really picked it up yet,

2702
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:33,060
I may do it anyways, but.

2703
02:23:33,060 --> 02:23:37,140
Your gaming backlog isn't big enough, oh, I did see that, and it's on Loki's screen,

2704
02:23:37,140 --> 02:23:38,140
right now, so Caliber-

2705
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:39,900
Hey, and look how many games I have right now!

2706
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:41,700
No, 573, no Konami!

2707
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:42,700
Yeah.

2708
02:23:42,700 --> 02:23:47,340
Uh, Soul Caliber 6 is 33% off, so I may, that may be the one that finally gets me.

2709
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:52,380
Alright, well, Rage Nator, I'm gonna let you go to try to see if we get any more calls

2710
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:53,380
in, okay, buddy?

2711
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:54,380
Yeah, sure.

2712
02:23:54,380 --> 02:23:59,980
Uh, one thing, uh, before I, uh, do let you go, uh, just in case, you know, just in case,

2713
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:06,140
there's, uh, some people that, uh, listen to this show, but don't necessarily listen

2714
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:09,620
to Bobby's show, um, right now-

2715
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:13,100
Which isn't a good life choice, by the way, but, that's fair, there's only so many hours

2716
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:14,100
in a day, fine.

2717
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:19,940
Yeah, um, I mentioned, at least mentioned in Bobby's show, if you happen to have, uh,

2718
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:27,340
Xbox 360 or, uh, Xbox One, if you go onto their video store, they're having something

2719
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:33,220
going on, uh, where they're giving away free first seasons, a lot, a lot of anime series,

2720
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:39,380
so if you happen to like anime, or just looking for something to watch, anything to watch?

2721
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:42,300
Free entertainment, might as well grab it.

2722
02:24:42,300 --> 02:24:46,140
Makes sense, give away the first season to get people to buy season two and three, makes

2723
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:47,140
sense, makes sense.

2724
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:49,220
All right, buddy, thanks for the tip, have a good one, okay?

2725
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:50,740
Yeah, all right, have a good one, bye.

2726
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:51,740
Yep, you too, bye-bye now.

2727
02:24:51,740 --> 02:24:56,940
I swear to God, I don't remember half of these games that I purchased these.

2728
02:24:56,940 --> 02:25:01,580
I need to, like, seriously, well, first off, I need to find a place to do streaming in

2729
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:05,860
my house, aside from my garage, I wish it wasn't all in my garage, the house is just

2730
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:09,900
not that big, but then I need to go back and play all of these games, just randomly

2731
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:16,580
pick a game off my Steam list every day, and just do a stream of stuff, cause I have, like,

2732
02:25:16,580 --> 02:25:28,300
I don't even know where I got half of this stuff, this is ridiculous, um, let's see.

2733
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:31,420
That was, okay, now I can, that was weird, because somebody called, and then it like

2734
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:35,820
disconnected, it wouldn't connect the call, so I had to call them, isn't that weird?

2735
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:39,340
Yeah, Skype is all sorts of broken.

2736
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:44,220
Well, let's be real, the way I got it set up right now is like super crazy, but it works,

2737
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:46,260
so who are we gonna trap in our box now?

2738
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:49,580
Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio, who's this?

2739
02:25:49,580 --> 02:25:54,860
You can't say I'm trapped in a box, because I'm used to living in a box, I'm currently

2740
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:58,060
living in a box as we speak, okay?

2741
02:25:58,060 --> 02:26:02,740
Cause you live in New York City, and how much are you paying for that shoebox?

2742
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:07,580
I can't even joke, we're not that far from San Francisco, and it's worse in San Francisco

2743
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:09,020
if you can believe it.

2744
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:14,880
Oh, I believe it, but it's like I tell people, you walk into my apartment, I have a galley

2745
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:15,880
kitchen, okay?

2746
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:20,980
And the galley kitchen is like six feet, and then you turn around, and that's the boiler

2747
02:26:20,980 --> 02:26:27,380
room, once you come out, it turns into this square, where, if I drop a piece of paper

2748
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:32,180
my place is a mess, but on the plus side, you can't see it, but the diagonal across

2749
02:26:32,180 --> 02:26:37,460
from me is the coffee pot, the toaster oven, the air fryer, the popcorn machine, and the

2750
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:41,060
microwave, and the fridge, so I'm good.

2751
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:45,660
I love it, I love it, you know what, and you live in New York City, one of the most fabulous

2752
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:52,020
places in the world, so you know what, it's awesome, but I bet it's great when you bring

2753
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:53,020
the ladies over.

2754
02:26:53,020 --> 02:26:59,620
See, there's a reason why I got rid of the bed and put a futon in, I'm like, I get it.

2755
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:02,020
They're all living in shoeboxes too, Rama.

2756
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:09,500
Some of them, some of them, I'm just saying, I like to entertain my ladies, but I don't,

2757
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:13,780
they understand I'm in a small shoebox, I just don't want them to get, well, you know,

2758
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:18,580
like that's why I got rid of the bed, and put in a futon so it looks like a friggin'

2759
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:19,580
couch.

2760
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:24,080
Nice, hold on, I'm trying to see if I can, wait, how do I do this, how do I show you

2761
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:25,080
my video?

2762
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:26,320
Are you seeing our video?

2763
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:29,060
I'm seeing your video.

2764
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:30,660
Are you seeing me?

2765
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:35,020
Yes, I see you, I see the Final Fantasy IX poster behind you, the Borderlands 2 poster

2766
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:36,020
behind you.

2767
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:41,620
I want you to see this guy, down here, I'm showing you Mr. Smoosh is like down on the

2768
02:27:41,620 --> 02:27:45,740
ground right here, so sorry, I can't change the whole camera setup right now, but anyway,

2769
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:49,820
sorry, completely derailed the show to show off Mr. Smoosh to one individual, but worth

2770
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:50,820
it, okay?

2771
02:27:50,820 --> 02:27:53,460
Alright, anyway, Rama, what do you want to talk to us about tonight?

2772
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:57,180
I'm gonna cover that real quick, and I'm gonna tell you something geeky I just did.

2773
02:27:57,380 --> 02:28:02,940
In response to you, Mr. Smoosh being on camera from time to time, that gave Mako-chan the

2774
02:28:02,940 --> 02:28:10,020
best idea, so what we're doing when we go live, she is gonna position her camera on

2775
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:11,660
our staff cat, Damian.

2776
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:12,660
Perfect!

2777
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:17,540
And they'll see how long he'll stay there, you know, but you'll hear him purring at least

2778
02:28:17,540 --> 02:28:20,300
80% of the time because he's a loud son of a bitch.

2779
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:24,380
Genius, I love it, no, that's a fantastic idea, why not, why not?

2780
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:28,140
And if the other, if the first cat leaves, that's just gonna have to be where Patty's

2781
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:31,420
gonna have to be like, oh, I gotta get a second cat.

2782
02:28:31,420 --> 02:28:32,700
There is a second cat.

2783
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:34,700
A third cat.

2784
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:38,420
Don't give her any ideas!

2785
02:28:38,420 --> 02:28:40,900
I can't help it, I can't help it.

2786
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:46,140
Oh, you are such a designated enabler, and I cannot wait till the two of you meet.

2787
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:49,300
She is going to collect you like Pokemon!

2788
02:28:49,300 --> 02:28:50,740
Did you hear that, Mr. Smoosh?

2789
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:52,620
You're inspiring others.

2790
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:55,460
You're inspiring people, he's licking his paws, he doesn't give a shit what I'm telling

2791
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:56,460
him.

2792
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:57,460
Alright.

2793
02:28:57,460 --> 02:29:01,180
You didn't have anything gaming to ask us this week?

2794
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:03,780
No, I wanted to share something pretty cool.

2795
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:08,700
Now, I don't know if you've seen lately, if a lot of people are geeking out their Christmas

2796
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:15,180
trees and stuff like that, I got friends who have Funko Pops on theirs, I actually got

2797
02:29:15,180 --> 02:29:20,980
off my lazy tuchus, did a live stream yesterday, and put together my geeky little tree, and

2798
02:29:20,980 --> 02:29:24,860
I'm going to see if I can get a little vision of it over here.

2799
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:29,180
Which unfortunately is not going to come through on our own Twitch feed, but yes, I do see

2800
02:29:29,180 --> 02:29:34,380
a silvery tree with the giant ball ornaments that are very standard, and some Christmas

2801
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:36,100
lights there.

2802
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:39,180
I do see that coming through on this.

2803
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:41,860
Yep, we sort of see the tree, yes.

2804
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:46,820
And I'm slowly turning it, and if you look carefully, there is a Luigi ornament on the

2805
02:29:46,820 --> 02:29:47,820
tree.

2806
02:29:47,820 --> 02:29:49,580
Oh, there sure is.

2807
02:29:49,580 --> 02:29:50,580
How about that?

2808
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:57,680
Yeah, so I wanted to share that off, but I also wanted to know, are y'all geeking up

2809
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,180
your holiday trees this year?

2810
02:29:59,180 --> 02:30:00,180
I'm just curious about that.

2811
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:05,220
So we didn't set up a tree this year because of the cat, actually, because the place where

2812
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:08,940
we would usually set up the tree, Smush is not going to allow that to happen.

2813
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:13,100
So he would knock that shit over so fast, it would make your head spin.

2814
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:17,980
But when we do set it up, somebody got us an ornament set that actually has a Playstation

2815
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:19,540
controller, a Nintendo controller.

2816
02:30:19,540 --> 02:30:23,500
I mean, they're not official, they kind of look like knockoffs, but they're close enough.

2817
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:27,700
So little knockoff controller ornaments, and it's really cute and nerdy.

2818
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:32,460
I like that, but I don't know if you've seen, but there's actually people who have posted

2819
02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:38,600
pictures of their Christmas trees where it's halfway decorated, and the rest is just bare

2820
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:44,340
so the cat can't reach it, or they put up a clear plastic border around it where the

2821
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:46,500
cat can't get past it.

2822
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:51,300
I have seen that, and it's something to definitely consider for a future year.

2823
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:54,820
But the thing is, we like to put it in the window so you can see our tiny little tree

2824
02:30:54,820 --> 02:30:59,260
from the street, but that is the exact spot where Mr. Smush goes every day.

2825
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:00,260
That's his TV.

2826
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:03,300
He goes to perch in the window and look at all the other cats that run out in the street

2827
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:06,020
and wonder, why can't I be outside playing with them?

2828
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:08,700
And it's like, you're not built for that, kitty.

2829
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:10,900
Somebody wanted you to be a show kitty.

2830
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:14,740
Oh, he just looked at me like, what do you mean?

2831
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:16,340
Alright.

2832
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:17,340
That's precious.

2833
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:19,900
Alright, Rahm, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up, but thank you so much for the

2834
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:20,900
call.

2835
02:31:20,900 --> 02:31:21,900
Hey, no problem.

2836
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:24,500
I also had to represent my quote unquote ugly Christmas shirt.

2837
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:25,860
Hey, I loved it.

2838
02:31:25,860 --> 02:31:29,940
It's Fra-gee-lay with the leg lamp for those obviously that can't see this call.

2839
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:30,940
Love it.

2840
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:31,940
Alright, take care, buddy.

2841
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:32,940
Alright, take care.

2842
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:33,940
Alright, bye bye.

2843
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:34,940
Bye.

2844
02:31:34,940 --> 02:31:35,980
Alright, there you go.

2845
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:37,260
That's gonna do it for our Skype line tonight.

2846
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:40,620
I'm not gonna take any more calls on that for right now.

2847
02:31:40,620 --> 02:31:43,180
Let me see though, I wanted to see if there were any questions in chat, and then also

2848
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:45,980
just check in one more time to see if there's any last minute stories.

2849
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:49,320
I mean, I know it's been a very slow news week, but I also I've seen you prodding over

2850
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:52,900
there, Loki, while I've been trying to look at all this stuff.

2851
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:56,860
I'm just looking for something and not finding anything.

2852
02:31:56,860 --> 02:32:03,260
I am noticing in chat, they're talking about their own nerdy trees here is that let's see.

2853
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:06,580
Black Mamba says I'm gonna get a doggy crate for my tree.

2854
02:32:06,580 --> 02:32:10,060
I think I saw a post on Facebook earlier that was something like, why aren't my presence

2855
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:12,940
barking yet?

2856
02:32:12,940 --> 02:32:13,940
Let's see.

2857
02:32:13,940 --> 02:32:16,780
Brack the man says we have a regular tree and then a Harry Potter tree.

2858
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:19,340
Well, that sounds like fun.

2859
02:32:19,340 --> 02:32:20,940
So very cool.

2860
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:21,940
All right.

2861
02:32:21,940 --> 02:32:23,500
Well, I guess that's it.

2862
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:27,260
I guess we're about to wrap things up and get to our final thoughts tonight.

2863
02:32:27,260 --> 02:32:28,540
We will not be back next week.

2864
02:32:28,540 --> 02:32:31,140
We're gonna take next week off the 30th for the holidays.

2865
02:32:31,140 --> 02:32:33,540
I know Loki has some family stuff going on.

2866
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:35,220
Dark soccer will still be out.

2867
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:39,740
So I may do something on my personal channel, but it won't be anything like OLR, but just

2868
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:41,780
play a game with listeners or something.

2869
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:44,940
Or I might, I might just take a night off myself and go out, do something I don't usually

2870
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:45,940
get to do Sunday night.

2871
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:46,940
So we'll see.

2872
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:51,180
But I hope everybody has a wonderful Christmas for those that celebrate a fantastic new year

2873
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:53,020
and anything else you might celebrate this time of year.

2874
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:55,060
I hope it goes very, very well for you.

2875
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:57,680
And we are so looking forward to continuing this in 2019.

2876
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:01,100
You know, this last week and this week, these are the first two episodes on Twitch and now

2877
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:03,940
it's like, you know, we get to do next next time, huh?

2878
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:04,940
Get the audio in the intro.

2879
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:05,940
That was my fault.

2880
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:06,940
We get to open that.

2881
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:08,940
Oh, the time capsule.

2882
02:33:08,940 --> 02:33:09,940
Yes.

2883
02:33:09,940 --> 02:33:10,940
Yeah.

2884
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:15,300
We showed this on Twitch now, sorry, podcast listeners, but now we actually get to, you're

2885
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,300
right.

2886
02:33:16,300 --> 02:33:17,300
This is something to look forward to.

2887
02:33:17,300 --> 02:33:18,300
Sorry.

2888
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:20,940
You're gonna have to look at my behind a little bit there, but look, you can actually see

2889
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:23,820
that we're going to open this guy in the new year.

2890
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:27,600
That's our little Vader time capsule that we made and I'm trying not to show my butt

2891
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:33,900
on stream or my, my naked rear end or something there.

2892
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:35,620
So trying to move around carefully there.

2893
02:33:35,620 --> 02:33:36,660
There you go.

2894
02:33:36,660 --> 02:33:38,180
So that is something.

2895
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:39,180
Yeah.

2896
02:33:39,220 --> 02:33:40,540
That Spyro says, Oh yeah.

2897
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:41,540
Don't forget about the time capsule.

2898
02:33:41,540 --> 02:33:42,540
Dark to see.

2899
02:33:42,540 --> 02:33:43,540
Oh yeah.

2900
02:33:43,540 --> 02:33:44,540
Glad Loki remembered.

2901
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:45,540
So good job.

2902
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:46,540
So there it is.

2903
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:48,700
You have the time capsule is, uh, gonna, gonna happen there.

2904
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:52,100
So all right.

2905
02:33:52,100 --> 02:33:53,100
That's it.

2906
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:54,380
We're going to wrap up here.

2907
02:33:54,380 --> 02:33:56,740
Another, uh, another day here at orange launch radio.

2908
02:33:56,740 --> 02:33:59,300
Thanks so much for tuning into the show and listening to us.

2909
02:33:59,300 --> 02:34:01,880
If you like what you heard here at orange laundry, no, please tell a friend or five

2910
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:03,420
about this feed.

2911
02:34:03,420 --> 02:34:06,680
Please feel free to follow and all that stuff here on Twitch.

2912
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:10,600
We're still making our way to a affiliate, hopefully soon, and we'll be able to do the

2913
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:12,640
subscriptions and all that fun stuff as well.

2914
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:18,640
Uh, loving the clips you guys, uh, made, don't clip that last thing, Jesus, uh, for the most

2915
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:22,040
part, loving the clips you guys made and, uh, all the other stuff too.

2916
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:23,040
This is great.

2917
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:25,440
I'm loving Twitch and we're just going to build on it in 2019.

2918
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:30,680
My whole goal is to improve one thing every show, and then, uh, we'll, we'll get it.

2919
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:35,480
We'll get in a really good place, uh, you know, by the time mid 2019 rolls around, but

2920
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:37,520
we definitely need, uh, to build up our following here.

2921
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:40,840
So tell a friend or two about the show, a nice five star review on a place like iTunes

2922
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:41,840
goes a long way as well.

2923
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:44,280
For those of you that are still listening on the podcast feed, Hey, we're doing it for

2924
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:45,280
you guys too.

2925
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:47,020
And, uh, thanks for listening that way.

2926
02:34:47,020 --> 02:34:51,360
And we appreciate a nice review wherever you may, uh, consume your podcast.

2927
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:55,040
So with that, uh, we're going to wrap up for the night with any final thoughts.

2928
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:57,240
Uh, Loki, any final thoughts you have for us tonight?

2929
02:34:57,240 --> 02:35:01,160
I'm hoping to start streaming again, um, this next week.

2930
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:06,940
I really been, it schedule's been just kind of crazy with just like stuff changing last

2931
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:12,100
minute, like having to pick up kids and stuff and, um, you know, running out of time plus

2932
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:19,660
fighting with my stupid goddamn DVD drive and reading my not so legit disc in the drive

2933
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:21,440
to load different mixes on there.

2934
02:35:21,440 --> 02:35:25,040
So I may have to go back to extreme and just leave it there until I put step mania on the

2935
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:28,760
machine, but I'm hoping to put step mania on the machine sooner than later, cause I

2936
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:32,800
have all the parts and I just need the, I'm probably gonna build a PC tomorrow cause it's

2937
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:33,800
pretty fast.

2938
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:40,160
Um, and I got a little windows 10 on there, but I do want to get a, a, a custom theme

2939
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:41,560
done for step mania.

2940
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:46,400
So hopefully it won't take months to do, but we'll get some working because I want to do

2941
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:49,840
a lot of fun stuff and step mania is really going to kind of energize me in the plane

2942
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:53,200
more because it'll be not the same set of songs all the time.

2943
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:55,400
It'll be like hundreds of songs to play.

2944
02:35:55,400 --> 02:35:58,440
So it'll be a lot of variety and fun stuff.

2945
02:35:58,440 --> 02:35:59,440
Awesome.

2946
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,440
All right.

2947
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:04,400
Um, my final thought is, um, looking forward to playing more Katamari and Rossi more stuff

2948
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:05,400
in my backlog.

2949
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:08,280
Yeah, I haven't really played like any ingress lately.

2950
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:09,660
I've kind of like fallen off on that.

2951
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:12,120
So hopefully get back on some of that stuff as well.

2952
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:16,960
And um, yeah, I'm just, uh, I'm excited to, uh, do more gaming and streaming and focus

2953
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:21,540
on a lot of that in 2019 and continue our relationship here on Twitch.

2954
02:36:21,540 --> 02:36:24,560
And thank you guys so much for joining us and listening to the show tonight.

2955
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:26,400
Um, I think that's it.

2956
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:27,400
We're gonna wrap it up.

2957
02:36:27,400 --> 02:36:28,400
We'll see you next year.

2958
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:32,920
