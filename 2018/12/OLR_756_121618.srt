00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 756 for this December the 19th of 2018. I am Rob Roberts. He is Techmaster Loki.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's a big move over from Shoutcast where we've been for, and some people don't realize this, we've been on Shoutcast for 16 and a half years.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's a long time.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:21,000
A varying degrees of Shoutcast and now we are on Twitch, which is a big move. Well, it's not, I mean, as Jason kind of referenced in the intro there, it's not really like the first time that we're on Twitch because we did the Justin TV, the precursor thing.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Right.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We did like the simulcast, but it was really like, I don't even know if any clips are still out there on our old.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't remember. I just remember playing games on like the TV while we were doing the show. So we had something to actually display, but I don't remember. We didn't film anything, did we?

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I sort of vaguely remember it.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was on, it was on Justin TV. I mean, we were doing like a simulcast, but it was really like, it was like you would just have the static camera there and you weren't really getting like the actual mixing board audio that you're getting through this new setup that we have here.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It would just be like our hollow voices in the garage and you couldn't even hear the Skype callers or anything like that. But this whole transition has been a process.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I really do think it's it's the right move for Orange L'Ange Radio, probably one, admittedly, we probably should have made about two years ago, maybe, maybe sooner back.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But I'm happy we're here and hopefully going to get some new faces here checking out the show and yeah, talking, talking about the news and everything.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So where do we begin? Well, shout out, of course, to Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers. Usually this is a three host show.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But a little while back, Dark Soccer had a conflict with her day job. So she actually works on Sunday nights right now. So unfortunately she can't be here. She should be back here full time in February.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Not that she's going to be on camera or anything.

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, it is the show.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She'll be behind the camera.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It is the show where every gamer has a voice, not necessarily a face.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But, you know, we respect that. Like there's a lot of people that can be I think our community has always been very welcoming.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And every experience I've had on Twitch has been really cool. Like, you know, I have a personal channel over at Rob Roberts.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Cheap plug. But, you know, every experience I've had has been really cool. And I haven't had a lot of like, you know, weirdo people.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But I totally respect like she don't want to be on camera or any guests that we have here, because I was actually asked that question randomly.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Like, are you gonna make your guests be on camera?

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, I'm not going to make anyone do anything. If you want, we'll have Pikachu dance and to you as you talk.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And that will be that will be what it is. And yeah, we'll work with that.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So. All right. And of course, we are in chat as we usually are over at our Twitch TV channel.

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You still can access everything over at live.voggenetwork.com.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Of course, we want you to still check out VOG Network and all the other great shows that make up the Voice Geese Network.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The live ones like Bobby, Anime Jam Session and the non live ones as well. Hooked on Bond, Electricista Hood, Gamers Gone.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wow. The list goes on and on. Check it all out.

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And and some folks giving some feedback on some of the voices right now over.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I guess I'm sounding a little low, but you're something a little high, but I'm looking at the recording and everything seems OK.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think the positioning of the mic and now now I can show this to you.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You could see I've been tired about must be up on your face.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The mic has to be up in your face because when it's not like look, if I put it just a little bit away.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My audio like really drops. So it's really.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, the distance is very important, but we're working on that.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I know you can do things with gain and other stuff. It's a brand new mixing board, a brand new computer that's dedicated to the video end of things.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Whereas we were going to have an upgraded computer that works with some of the things so I can do stories and all that.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But yeah, lots, lots and lots of changes here at Orange Dawn Studio, but a lot staying the same, you know, for folks that aren't able to participate live on Sunday nights

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and aren't able to come now see what fat, middle aged men we actually are doing this show.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not as fat. That's true. I'm still very middle aged, but I'm not as fat as I was.

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I've been working on it. I've been closing all my ring. I've lost a few pounds.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Although I must say the last month has been a little bit on the eased side of things.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I haven't been as strict and I've been. The holidays, things are going to happen. What can you do?

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They have the 12 days of snacking at work. So, you know, I have to have the 12 days of snacking.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I have to have the 12 days of snacking. You know what I'm going to ask after last week's show, are you snacking on broccoli?

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you mixing in the broccoli? No, it's a popcorn. It's all been popcorn this week.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com in our Twitch room.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's going to take me a little while to get over some of these things I've been saying for years.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But VG realness says this is such an exciting moment. And I agree, it is an exciting moment.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I want to give a shout out quickly to Bobby Black Wolf. You know, you guys all know who he is at this point.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But everything that you see on Twitch, I know on the podcast, you know, let me kind of describe what's going on.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But you actually can see now what we're going to be talking about and what we're talking about right now.

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Kind of like I think some shows only ESPN do this. I mean, I don't really do the whole sports thing very often.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Drag Race doesn't do this. I couldn't tell you. But like, you know, the nightly the 24 hour news ticker.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And that's what we have at the bottom. We have that whole, like, you know, glorious headline down at the bottom.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But not only is it pulling in top headlines from a variety of different websites, but it'll actually say, like, here's my Twitter.

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Here's my personal channel. And so that way we're not disturbing the podcast listeners every few seconds with,

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
thanks for the follow. Thanks. We do want to acknowledge new followers. That's all acknowledged down here.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So you still get and we'll give you a shout out at the end after we're done with the recording.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And, you know, because we we really appreciate the follows. We're trying to work our way to Twitch affiliate status.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You guys have been we we were 50 followers in before we even went live tonight.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So like that the hardest thing you have to do already done. So thank you guys very much for all your support of the show.

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Like it means so much and has made this very, very exciting.

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Quest Buster over in the Twitch chat room says we'll also see the awesome food brought in from time to time.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I already ate it. Sorry, it was subway. It was it was it was not great.

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I was just it's because I had Pete. Well, I didn't really have pizza.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They had like a piece of pizza and like a breakfast sandwich, both both parts of meals that my kids didn't need.

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I have that. And so I was like, well, you know, I should probably just get like a subway sandwich so that it's somewhat low calorie.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So I did that and I hated it. But it's what I eat every day.

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's just it's not the same subway. It's like I have a particular subway that I go to like my work routine.

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So there's one that it's on the way of the show here and they don't get it right.

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's just the people near my work. They know what I order every day. It's the same thing.

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And it's just like they. Oh, yeah, you haven't usually. Yeah, sure. OK. And then these make it and it's great.

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I love some of these cars. We get a few more of these chat comments and then I want to quickly reintroduce the show a little bit.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But I hope I see your name right. I'm sorry. Oh, Tejero asks, is it sunny there?

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry if I butchered your name. No, it's actually raining.

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And now now my fear is, is the power going to go out during our first show?

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because that would know that would be a hoot. It's not windy. It's just raining.

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
OK, well, that's good. That makes me feel a little bit better. And K Arts one over in Twitch wants to know.

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So now that we have video SimCity action news reenactment, when? Careful what you ask for over on.

84
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Did you notice we did a little something something over on Twitch, a little little just a little something and a little little something that wasn't in the podcast, but just like a little extra little bumper.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I hope to do more things like that. Silly little pre-shows. And that part of that is inspired, inspired by a variety of things.

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But probably primarily when I do Rocky or a picture show over at The Colonial, they do pre-shows to get the audience hyped up.

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And they'll show things like they show the the rock band Snack Bar that's like we have all your fucking money and like it's really funny.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think it's from Adult Swim or something. I don't know. They show it. It's hilarious. They'll show like a Tim Curry music video, gets everybody hyped up.

89
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There's an infamous one of John Waters and he's saying, don't smoke inside the theater.

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And he takes a big puff on a cigarette like, don't you wish you could be enjoying this right now, but don't be an asshole.

91
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's great. It's an infamous clip out there. But anyway. All right. Let's talk about video games. We're going to get into it.

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm going to ask Loki to kick it off with this story about Discord.

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But first, I do want to reintroduce the show since it is kind of like the first show over on Twitch.

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And there might be some new people checking out for the first time either here or in the archives.

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hello, we are Orange Town Radio. Our first broadcast was June 23rd, 2002, and we decided to put this show together.

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Myself, Dark Sakura and Loki joined us from day one because we all met playing a little video game called Dance Dance Revolution.

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So music games are still near and dear to our hearts. We met playing Dance Dance Revolution and other music games.

98
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Like I was always into Bust a Move or Groove, depending on which side of the ocean you're on.

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Or Parappa the Rappa was a huge thing for me, too. You know, we got into all types of music games.

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And, you know, then we kind of shifted into covering more general games because music games were kind of fading a little bit.

101
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And then right when we make the move to covering all the games, Guitar Hero comes out.

102
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And music games are all the rage again. But that's alright because we love all games.

103
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We always have a fondness in our heart for music games.

104
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's okay because Activision killed it really quickly, too.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's right. Actually, the thing went offline not that long ago. It's very sad.

106
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But also, you know, the whole thing we envisioned is that when we used to play DDR, we used to go to the diner right across from the arcade.

107
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And we used to just sit around, you know, eating unhealthy things like mozzarella sticks and so forth.

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And we'd sit at the table and we would just talk about, like, did you hear what they're doing with that game?

109
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Or what's going on with, you know, your Soulcalibur character?

110
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I fought your character in that one mode that everybody used to play as Soulcalibur at the arcade.

111
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Was that, like, Conquest or something like that?

112
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah, something like that. And so, you know, we always just sit around and talk about that.

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And we wanted to kind of, like, bring that to a virtual space where everybody, no matter where they are, can kind of join in at the diner table with us.

114
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So, you might want to eat a little healthier, though, so get your broccoli sticks and join us.

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And, yeah, while we talk along what's going on in gaming news.

116
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But we are going to get into, for our long-time listeners, they're waiting for, let's do it, let's get into this week's news.

117
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So what are we going to start off with tonight?

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We'll talk about, since last week we talked a little bit about the Steam store and how they kind of decided to tweak their revenue split with publishers.

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Especially publishers that sell over, like, 10 million copies of a game.

120
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So they're going to give you a little bit more money, like 25%, if you happen to even get close to that.

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then, of course, to rebut that, Epic Games Society said that they're going to put out their own game store.

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And they're going to give you 88% of the revenue, because that's better than the 30% that they're taking on the Steam store.

123
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And then Discord's like, but we'll give you 90%, and 90% is better than 88%.

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And so, of course, that's what they're doing now, because with yet another game launcher.

125
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Because you remember, you know, Discord is now offering some games through their storefront, or they have a storefront, I think.

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I've never actually explored it, but...

127
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I have a little bit.

128
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Discord, you know, and I've talked about this on a previous show, like, Discord is doing a lot of things right right now.

129
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I'm not on a payroll or anything, but it was incredibly smart that they gave this thing that, you know, people were paying for with TeamSpeak and Slack.

130
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They were giving it away for free, and then they just kind of, you know, started to subtly slip in there.

131
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, we noticed what games you play, and we're just going to start showing you headlines for all these games you play.

132
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, and here's all your friends they're playing.

133
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And for streamers, it's great, because if I'm streaming, people see that, right, in their Discord.

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And I love that, as a streamer, right?

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Except, sadly, since this is tied to the VoG network, nobody may know.

136
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, I'll just have to...

137
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll have to promote OLR other ways, such as through the VoG network Discord, available at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

138
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Bing.

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Anyway, but, you know, promote that way.

140
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But then it was like, oh, hey, wouldn't you like us to scan your computer, find all your games, and have a game launcher all in one place?

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's like, oh, sure, why not, you know?

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And now it's, oh, by the way, now we have a store, so you can add to that.

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's, like, very interesting how they built that.

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But, yeah, and now if you subscribe to their thing, you get some free games, which is another, like, huge...

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You know, obviously we know, like, Humble has the monthly bundle.

146
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We have Discord is in on that.

147
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Twitch gives away games.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Twitch, Epic Games Store is giving out games.

149
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, PlayStation and Xbox have been doing it forever, so...

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Subnautica is free on Epic Games Store.

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, so, love it.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Anyway, yeah, so, is this gonna be a good thing?

153
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I mean, how low can you go as far as how much of the revenue is gonna be taken out of this?

154
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think that's about as low as you can go without actually just saying, hey, you can put them on there for free.

155
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We don't wanna make any money from it.

156
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Are they still gonna be curating some of the content in there, though?

157
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because that would be my concern, is that are we just gonna get, like, you know, all sorts of questionable things like we've seen on Steam?

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, yes.

159
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Garbage games.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They are gonna be curating it, so they kind of described it as basically a boutique bookstore of game stores.

161
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So they're not gonna necessarily open the floodgates to everything like Steam did.

162
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But it's gonna be a little bit more curated, I guess.

163
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
PixelPaka is in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, says, people can sell on itch.io without giving away revenue, any revenue to Twitch itch.io.

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
However, it means the developer has to deal with the PayPal, et cetera, transaction fees.

165
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Which, again, I just gave the old address.

166
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But luckily, live.vognetwork.com forwards to the new Twitch.

167
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Right.

168
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because I'm gonna say the old one a lot tonight, sorry.

169
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And itch.io, it's a decent way to do that as well, but it's more, it's not so much, I don't know how they promote stuff on itch.io.

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If it's actually, like, they don't really, I think, have a storefront where it shows you a bunch of stuff.

171
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's more of just, it's a place that you can put up your storefront.

172
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Kind of think of it like a mall, a shopping mall that you can put your own kiosk up to sell your game.

173
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's not necessarily gonna be like, you know, Steam where they're, well, maybe Steam's a bad comparison because they're not necessarily doing anything to promote your game either.

174
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Except burying it under crap.

175
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know. Sure, why not?

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You know, competition is good because competition's how you get down from, you know, taking 70% of your revenue home to 90%.

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So, why not?

178
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I wanted to go to the email, our mailbag. I don't usually do it this early in the show, but we got a really good email from somebody whose viewpoint I really respect on this, so I want to get to it.

179
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If you want to email our show, you can. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

180
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I know in the last episode I threatened to take it away, but we got some good emails this week, and as long as you guys continue to use it, we'll still use it too.

181
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We won't have to punish you this time.

182
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What?

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So we won't have to punish you this time.

184
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, no punishment this week, which is a bummer because All Stars 4 Star...oh, another time.

185
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
For those that don't know, if you're new on Twitch, I always threaten if we do not get emails, I use that time that we dedicate to emails to give you a RuPaul's Drag Race recap of what's going on.

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Which is great because I don't watch any of it, so...

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
My favorite television show.

188
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I totally need to be recapped on all of it.

189
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Three words. Brown cow stunning.

190
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Alright, anyway, let's get to the emails.

191
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hello LR, I figured I'd pop a message over to the old outdated mailbag for old outdated people because why not?

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And you can tell this is coming from YYR from that tone.

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Regarding the Persona 5 character that was added to Smash, maybe Persona 5 isn't on Switch yet, but let's face it, it's 99% guaranteed to happen.

194
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Persona 1 through 4 all got releases on dedicated portable gaming consoles.

195
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Persona 3 portable on PSP and Persona 4 Golden on Vita both sold well.

196
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Are they really not going to release 5 on Switch?

197
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't gamble much, but even I'd bet on this happening.

198
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I think it's probably going to happen to, it's just a matter of when, but we'll see.

199
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Alright, obviously I didn't skip to the email to read that part, but I want to acknowledge all of YR's perspectives, but let's get to this next part.

200
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Regarding the Epic Games Store, and now the Discord Store, offering bigger shares to their developers.

201
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Actually, I'm not upset about this at all.

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It only goes to show that you get what you pay for.

203
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Would I like to get more than 70% of the revenue?

204
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Sure, but for that 18% or 20% difference, 1.

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
My games support integrated leaderboards, a critical feature in score attack games like mine, and I don't have to run any servers.

206
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
2. My games support Xbox One, 360, DualShock 4, Switch Pro, and Steam controllers, and all I had to do was implement one of those.

207
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
3. My games have achievements for those who enjoy chasing them.

208
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
4. My games support cloud saving, even for Windows to Mac and Mac.

209
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
5. My games can't be copied or pirated willy-nilly, because they can detect whether they're running through the Steam client, and can quit if they're not.

210
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
6. Steam support has gotten back to me very quickly when I've encountered any issues, and they've been very thorough when reviewing my builds.

211
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If I released my games anywhere else, they'd have none of this or close.

212
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The price difference is justified in my opinion. My customers get more and I get more.

213
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Now, if Epic and Discord can offer comparable service in the future, that'd be awesome. I hope they do.

214
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But if not, then dollars aren't everything. You know what is? The experience that I can deliver to my players.

215
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And right now, on Steam, it's better.

216
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What do you think about that perspective from YYR? Because I'll admit, when I first heard this story, I was like, oh, more money for indie developers. They're going to love that.

217
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But as YYR is kind of outlining these things like leaderboards, online, controllers, a lot of things that make it easier, it kind of did make me go, oh, that's interesting.

218
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well, I know Epic's doing stuff for online. They have, I think, some APIs that they're putting out to help with cross-platform play and stuff.

219
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm sure because these storefronts are a lot newer than Steam, that maybe some of that stuff is forthcoming, but we'll have to wait and see.

220
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's more of just at least there's options out there. And if anything, maybe it puts a little bit of pressure on Steam to consider maybe increasing the revenue share that developers get.

221
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So that can be bad. But ultimately, it's going to be just up to you where you decide you're releasing your game with what's more important to you.

222
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Do you want a few additional percentage points in your revenue or do you want all these other features?

223
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
VG Realness comments, I guess Steam has the right to essentially charge you for this service as they are providing you more than competitors.

224
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Good point. But do you think that Steam will still kind of cave in to some of this pressure?

225
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I mean, remember, we heard about some of the changes they were doing to their store, but this was before Epic made their move and now Discord's making their move.

226
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you think Steam is going to feel some social pressures of sorts to drop that percentage down, which honestly could have a big impact on a company that isn't exactly releasing a lot of games?

227
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No.

228
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Their bread and butter is Steam right now.

229
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't think they're actually going to have...

230
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Mostly. HTC Vive, I know somebody will say it, but VR. But, you know, there are other things they get into, but let's be real, the bulk of it right now is Steam for them.

231
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,000
No. I don't think so. Because I think a lot of, right now, there isn't a lot of games leaving the storefront to go strictly to the Epic Game Store.

232
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There's a couple indie games that are exclusive on the Epic Game Store right now, but it's not going to make or break them.

233
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think they're making so much money from it right now.

234
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,000
They haven't done crap for that platform at all, as far as fixing a lot of these problems with all these games just being on there.

235
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Fake games or Bitcoin miners disguised as games and all of that.

236
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And, of course, now with loot boxes and the gambling and stuff, now they've made Counter-Strike into a free-to-play game.

237
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They're just making money from all sorts of avenues. I don't think they really care right now until it makes a significant impact, and then they'll make a change. But, no.

238
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm so curious to see if there is going to be any type of counter-response, but, I mean, you lay something out, good stuff out there.

239
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Not to spoil something that's coming up later, but it happens inevitably, but we know that, you know, because the Epic Store is affiliated with Unreal Engine and all of that,

240
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I know YYR gives a lot of props to some of those things built in with Steam, but it seems like the relationship between Epic and Unreal is going to provide some of that as well.

241
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Like, there's going to be perks to releasing on the Epic Store because of things in the Unreal Engine.

242
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I mean, I guess you could take anything in the Unreal Engine and put it on Steam or what have you, right?

243
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, you can.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Do you think Epic might wall some of that for things that are just their store, or are they going to try to sail through that on cost?

245
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't think that they're going to do that right now. I mean, they're not walling off anything, because I think that, you know, they're trying to get people on that storefront.

246
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't think they would just all of a sudden start breaking the engine or, like, walling things off to that one storefront.

247
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But, I don't know what they necessarily offer there, but I gotta imagine that they've got somewhat comparable stuff.

248
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I just don't know all the details, because I haven't published anything, as you may be aware.

249
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Because you haven't finished anything!

250
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Haven't finished, started anything.

251
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Bobby Blackwolf reminds us in chat, Epic gets 5% of all revenue from an Unreal Engine game on Steam, because that's what you pay to use the Unreal Engine.

252
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So they don't want to wall things off from Steam. Good call out.

253
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Bobby also wants to point out, now I know I just said I wasn't going to name all the followers and all that, but it is worth noting, we're on night one here at Twitch.

254
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Even though we created the channel a long time ago to save the name, this is our first official night of broadcasting on Twitch.

255
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And, Loki, we just got our 69th follower.

256
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Nice.

257
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Nice. Thank you for that. Oh, even Smush. Smush isn't, I don't know if the mics are sensitive enough to pick him up. Probably not.

258
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He's across, he's all the way.

259
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I actually, I had to actually mess with the game so that when he starts screaming for food around 7 o'clock, it wouldn't pick him up on the stream.

260
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I know you all really want to see and hear Mr. Smush, but, and that's my cat for those who don't know.

261
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But, A, Mr. Smush is going to do whatever the hell he wants to do.

262
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
B, if I'm trying to make a point, I don't really want the cat screaming in the background, because you all are going to think we neglect him or something.

263
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And that's totally not the case. I love him more than anything.

264
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He's a cat. He'll whine whenever he wants.

265
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Exactly. He's a cat. Every cat owner knows what I'm talking about.

266
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Just like my cat. Like, every, like, I will literally drop treats down for her. She'll eat them. I'll walk across the room to refill her water. I'll put the water down.

267
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I look at her and she's like, more treats? More treats? Like, I just gave you some goddamn treats.

268
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
In chat, I'm being asked, Pod Culture asked, what's in the box next to Rob? I don't know which box he's referring to.

269
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This is a stand. So, I have a stand next to me. What might be the thing that Pod Culture's noticing, this is actually a stream deck.

270
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So, this is a thing that I actually spent money on, but, you know, Elgato's not paying me to advertise it.

271
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But I will say, I kind of like it a lot. It's very convenient and it actually controls the sidebar news stuff.

272
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I can see exactly how many people are watching on Twitch right now as it updates. I can kill the mics with a button press, which I won't actually do.

273
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's been pretty neat. So, that's one of the things that is, you might see me poking out a little bit there is that thing there.

274
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And that's the other scary thing about video is that now, like, now you're gonna see all the times when, like, Loki is doing a story and I just get up to go to the kitchen.

275
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Or, I get up to do something else, it's like, oh, maybe I should-

276
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So, anyways, this week, we have lots of stuff going on.

277
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Alright, anyway. Let's move on. Oh, wait, no, didn't we have a little more on, like, what stores are doing? I thought there was one more little thing to this.

278
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Then we'll move on to our gaming weeks.

279
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh, what they're doing? I don't give a crap.

280
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
They're doing things and it's significant.

281
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Alright, look. Oh, I thought we had another, oh well. I guess maybe we're, oh no, that's the story we're coming up with later.

282
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Alright, so I'm just, I'm all mixed up, what can I do? Let's get to our gaming weeks.

283
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing this week?

284
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Sadly, uneventful. I have not been playing DDR this week.

285
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Only because I've been getting ready to put in the step mania component of my cabinet.

286
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So I got all the parts for that, finally, so I'm going to be running a Ryzen 3 computer that's an APU.

287
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And just some, you know, keeping it really compact.

288
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's literally going to be screwed to the inside of the monitor housing of where the monitor would be.

289
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I have an HDTV in there right now.

290
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So, getting all that, I got all the hardware, I got a lighting board, because originally they had lighting boards that you can buy.

291
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:05,000
They're like, I don't remember what they're called now, but they were based off of a pack drive, which is a device that's from Ultimark that's used to drive lights on an arcade cabinet.

292
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And they use it for, like, you might be familiar with the iPack and stuff for like a main machine or something like that.

293
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So this is their light controller thing.

294
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's more of like, I think on those cabinets, like lit up buttons and stuff, you can control this.

295
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So I got that, but it's called a lit, it's lit or lit something, lit board, I don't remember who it is.

296
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But some guys making, it's using Arduino and like a breakout board for the lights.

297
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So it's very comparable to what the $200 board is, but only $50.

298
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So I'm beta testing that, so we'll see how that works.

299
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And then, of course, I already had a JPEG, actually I have two JPEGs, so hopefully one of those will work.

300
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And then it's been just fighting with StepMania to try to get a theme that I can use.

301
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's like, I've been spending a lot of time making like, you know, logo and stuff for a fake mix that I'd put on there.

302
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But I need, since I'm not, I haven't really dabbled in theming on StepMania,

303
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
aside from one time when I just kind of changed the color of a max theme or extreme theme to like make a max 3 or something.

304
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And I did that for Roseville Golf Land at one time, but that was more of just like image editing,

305
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and I didn't really change any of the Lua scripts or anything.

306
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So now I'm trying to find something I can base off, but every theme that I've messed around with is broken in a different way.

307
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Like some will be too laggy, some will just not support the features that I want.

308
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's just been trying to find one to build off of, and it's been frustrating.

309
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So I've been just messing with that.

310
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
We need to get some b-roll for next week, because they're actually asking in the Twitch chat,

311
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
does Loki have photos of his hardware adventures?

312
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But you do, you have your own stream, but you're playing DDR on your stream.

313
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Our Twitch channels will crawl across the bottom at some point.

314
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, yeah. So you can, in fact, this week I'll probably be playing again, because I do need to go back and do that again.

315
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And I haven't actually put the hardware together, but I mean, that's going to take like a day to do that.

316
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And then I just have to install Windows 10 on there, because I don't think Windows 7 recognizes a Ryzen 3 chip.

317
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So yeah, I'll be doing that. This week I'll probably be playing Fifth Mix, because I'm going to get rid of Euro Mix 2, because it's driving me nuts.

318
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And then, Pokemon Go. I've been playing a little bit of that. I've been meaning to play Pokemon Let's Go.

319
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I've had like a Wartortle in my Pokeball Plus for like a week now.

320
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh yeah, I think some poor thing's been imprisoned in my Pokeball for like three weeks.

321
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Like the kids, they're like, I usually have them play with the Pokeball Plus in the car while we're taking them to school.

322
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And then they're like, do you have something different in there now?

323
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
No, it's the same when they're like, oh, I don't even want to play with that anymore.

324
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
All that changes.

325
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I want Pikachu back in there, because Pikachu makes noises. I'm like, but Pikachu's level 70, he doesn't need to go any higher.

326
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Do they understand the different chirps and everything? I'm always like, what garbage bit noise chirp is that Pokemon?

327
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Well, the Pikachu will make all sorts of noises, and they think that's great, but they don't like Wartortle.

328
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And I don't necessarily either, but I'm trying to get a Blastress.

329
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Life is hard.

330
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Exactly, well, you know.

331
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So, yeah, it's been that. I bought Katamari Damacy reroll.

332
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I still need to.

333
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But I have inflated, I have it on PC.

334
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That's okay, they have your money. That's all they want.

335
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I have it on PC. It's joined my backlog of everything.

336
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And then, yeah, that's pretty much it. The only thing I played on PlayStation this week was the Harry Potter movies, because the kids wanted to watch it again.

337
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I need to watch them, too. I'm going to come over and watch it with the kids.

338
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Cheap plug, though. Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse. Fucking amazing. Go see it. Amazing movie.

339
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It is literally the best Spider-Man movie to date. I mean, it's so good.

340
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I believe you. Let's see. Before I get to my gaming week, somebody had asked in chat, Codeman had asked in chat, are we going to talk about the Kingdom Hearts 3 leak?

341
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It wasn't on our show roll for tonight. Yeah, I saw it on Discord, actually. Again, over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

342
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Somebody actually posted on the Orange Lounge Radio channel that there was a leak, I guess probably overnight or yesterday, where the retail version, there's a box print of an Xbox One is out there somewhere.

343
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But what's interesting about it is that there is a follow-up from the director of the game or something on Twitter that basically says, and guys, feel free to correct me in chat if I'm wrong.

344
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's part of the beauty about having a live chat room, live fact-checking. But I believe in the statement, they basically said the epilogue and the bonus scene aren't on the disc.

345
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:12,000
They purposely left that out for a day one patch just so this wouldn't leak, which I actually think is really smart, in a way. So, they left the movies out for a day one patch, which, you know, big games always get day one patches.

346
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:22,000
They should put a terrible ending on it, like a really stupid ending, so that's what people ruin, is this fake ending. That'd be hilarious. A dog ending. UFO ending.

347
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Why can't we get a UFO ending for Kingdom Hearts 3?

348
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Well, maybe it'll happen. You never know.

349
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It just comes down to the end and it's like Sora standing there with Mickey and stuff. He's like, hey guys, I got something to admit to you. I don't know what the fuck is going on in this entire story right now.

350
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Like, I gotta be honest, we've been killing these things and I have no fucking clue why I'm here.

351
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And Shane in chat, or Shad Leland, excuse me, brings up a point that was something I had thought about too, asking, is it smart? What if someone buys the game and they live in the boonies and have terrible or no internet? Then you don't get the full game.

352
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I mean, that's certainly a perspective worth talking about, but, you know, high speed internet is getting to more and more places, but okay, if you live in remote Alaska or somewhere that maybe doesn't have the most reliable high speed internet or it's satellite or something that's very expensive,

353
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and maybe you're a Kingdom Hearts fan, you know, you may not get to see the epilogue because it's not on the disc.

354
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Unless maybe they offered it for download and you could go, I mean, I don't know, that seemed really silly, but I know like some companies have done that.

355
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You can like download a patch that you install via like a USB driver. At least that was something we could do on 360. I don't think we really do those anymore though.

356
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's just kind of one of those, if you're not online, too bad. Maybe new game consoles aren't for you.

357
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You know, you're going to miss out if you're not on the internet. It's just the way it is.

358
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I guess, so you'll just have to read about it or something. It'll be unfortunate.

359
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You'll have to watch it on YouTube. Oh wait, you don't have internet. Can't watch YouTube, I guess.

360
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Don't be mean. Don't be mean. Also, breaking news from our Discord that missed our show roll for tonight because this broke after the show was finished,

361
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
but SSJ100Matt actually posted over in our Discord that Colin Kroll passed away.

362
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And even though you might wonder what that name has to do with gaming, he was the co-founder of Vine, which, I mean, Vine has brought us so many great six-second clips of things.

363
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Love Vine. And also the popular game show app HQ Trivia. And I think most people have tried that app.

364
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't know. I played that app once or twice a long time ago, and then I was like, I'm too stupid for this, and it's a waste of time.

365
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And it was like a lot of bugs and things like that, so I just kind of stopped. But I think some people still play it. I don't know.

366
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So, did you ever play HQ? No. Anyway, I'm not saying the app is going away, but it is very shocking that this individual has died because he's only 34 years old,

367
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and the headline says that apparently it's a drug overdose. So, yikes. Don't do drugs, kids. That's really sad.

368
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You never hear about drug underdoses.

369
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Stop it. Alright, anyway. Yeah, it's really kind of, yeah, yeah, Kaijuto in chat is a fan of HQ Trivia.

370
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So, yeah, I mean, whatever you feel about Vine or HQ Trivia, those have still been, like, big things.

371
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And I will give HQ Trivia this. You guys know I've stanned this for the longest time is on the Xbox 360.

372
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
They used to have one versus 100, and that was so much fun to play, like the live game show thing, right?

373
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So, HQ was, like, kind of that? Like, it was different. But, you know, it was a little bit of that same feeling.

374
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So, I'll give it that, even though it was kind of so buggy I stopped playing. But you guys know I miss that like crazy.

375
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Maybe now that we have the Twitch outreach, maybe I can make a personal plea to the folks over at Microsoft to get interactive game shows back because I really miss those.

376
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You better listen to me, Rob. You want your one versus 100? You know what you can do? You can play fucking Fortnite like everybody else.

377
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
There's your one versus 100. No.

378
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You can play Fortnite and your PUBG.

379
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I've already told you about my Fortnite experiences and how I'm just like, what do I do in this game? I'm gonna go hide in this house, open the door.

380
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, I just got a shot in the face, but somehow I got 65th place. I mean...

381
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
My son loves playing that game. He just will not stop talking about... Well, he plays as a creative mode.

382
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So, there's Fortnite creative mode, which is like, hey, it's like Minecraft, except you build crap in Fortnite and stuff happens.

383
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't know. I don't really know what you do in that game.

384
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's so...

385
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I don't want to play it.

386
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,000
No, I mean, it's not that hard of a concept, Loki. I mean, you want to outlive everybody else and the little bubble gets smaller and smaller.

387
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So, you're forced to interact with other people.

388
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That's all of the games.

389
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Well, yeah, that's the battle royale mechanic and Fortnite just kind of did it early on.

390
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I would only say first, but they did it early on. They did it very well. So, it's worked out for them.

391
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The cartoony thing has made it very appealing to kids for some reason.

392
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It should be like battle rail, battle rail.

393
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah. Anyway.

394
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Like you should be randomly thrown out there with a random weapon.

395
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:06,000
All right. Anyway, my gaming week. Before we got on all those breaking news tangents, which we tend to do tangents here at Orange Launch Radio.

396
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But I was going to talk a little bit about my gaming week.

397
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And honestly, since I've been so busy trying to get this, what you're looking at, set up, I haven't had a lot of time to play games.

398
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But I did play some Super Smash Brothers online, as I'm sure a lot of people have been doing if you're a Switch owner right now.

399
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I was streaming some of that, did some stuff with my buddy Delvin at VG Realness on stream.

400
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And just having fun with that, playing with some viewers.

401
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And I still need to work on unlocking some of those characters. I've been playing very slowly.

402
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But I really do enjoy the like the quest mode, the spirit mode.

403
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I kind of like it. I know some people think it's a pain in the ass just because it goes on and on and on.

404
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But it does kind of give me like something to do.

405
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's something for me to do. Just if I'm not wanting to go to bed yet, I'm just kind of chilling.

406
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And just like, oh, I'll play a couple of these matches and knock it out.

407
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Have you unlocked all the characters yet?

408
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
No, no, I'm not quite there yet. But maybe about half.

409
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So, still working on it. I don't know, it hasn't been a huge race for me to unlock them.

410
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Save if there's going to be a party or a get together or something and people want to play whatever character they want.

411
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But I've got a good chunk of them so far at this point. So, we'll see.

412
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And then I've also been playing more World of Warcraft because they just dropped a patch in that game this week.

413
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And I've been working on my little warlock in that.

414
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And I'm up to item level 350, which probably doesn't mean something to a lot of people.

415
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But to those of you that do play WoW, you know, I've been grinding to get better loot and all that stuff on my Warcraft.

416
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So, there's that.

417
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Little bit of the incidental stuff like Pokemon Go.

418
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I've barely touched Ingress. I've just been so busy with everything else.

419
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So, yeah, just, you know, trucking along a lot of the same games I've been playing.

420
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I do really need to get to Katamari Damacy reroll, though. I might do a stream of that once this all settles down.

421
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And we are comfortable that our video transition to Twitch has been successful.

422
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I heard that, well, the port of that game has been kind of, well, rushed, I guess.

423
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,000
They, like, cut out the English language, like, in the cutscenes or something like that.

424
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
There's no English language in there.

425
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You can patch it back in on PC. They have a way that, of course, people have made to fix that.

426
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Of course. That's part of the reason why I'm sure people are buying it.

427
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
That's why I got it on PC for all the...

428
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's made in Unity, too, from what I hear.

429
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So, I'm looking forward to the mods on that.

430
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yeah, so that'd be awesome.

431
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
All right.

432
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Well, we're going to get right back into the news, but I do want to just remind you guys.

433
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
We are here live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

434
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And if you miss a show for whatever reason, you can always download the podcast, which is available just about everywhere where podcasts are sold, including iTunes and Google Play.

435
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
All that good stuff. So, check out Orange On Radio.

436
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Please consider leaving us a nice review while you're there. That stuff goes an awfully long way.

437
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So, we will be back next week, and then I think in two weeks you said you might not be here.

438
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Maybe.

439
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So, we'll still...

440
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We may or may not be here kind of in that break between Christmas and New Year's.

441
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But then come 2019, we're really going to try to, you know, obviously we got enough set up on Twitch to bring you this tonight.

442
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But we're really going to try to like keep, you know, I want to get a better shot that's going to include more and, you know, more of the studio and make it a little more studio-y in here and try to get all that going for next year.

443
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
That's a lot more studio-y in here than it was, right?

444
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah. So, it's the lighting, isn't it?

445
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's the lighting.

446
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's not like a dank cave anymore.

447
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You know what's funny? The lights actually came with the green screen that I use, but I only really use the green screen because the lighting in the office, the office is so small it actually kind of works.

448
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Like it's good enough for the green screen to work and for what I need on my personal Twitch.

449
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But it came with these guys and now these guys are paying off.

450
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Trust me, it was a really dark cavern man cave.

451
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Although, you know, a gender discriminatory free cave and all that stuff.

452
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It was just very dimly lit, like yellow lighting and probably candles too at some point.

453
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So anyway, let's get into some more gaming news though.

454
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I think we're ready to move on into this week's news.

455
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So, Loki, why don't you start us off?

456
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah, so one of the big things that happened this week was that Blizzard had scaled back on Heroes of the Storm.

457
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So they were actually, you know, taking some developers off of Heroes of the Storm and putting them onto other properties and projects right now.

458
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So along with that though, they did announce that they're going to be canceling the esports stuff related to Heroes of the Storm for 2019 as well.

459
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Unfortunately, they forgot to tell anybody that's involved in the esports with Heroes of the Storm.

460
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
They just kind of like, oh, hey, you guys are learning about it now as well.

461
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So, you know, of course that didn't go over well.

462
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
If they had told them early, it probably would have leaked.

463
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I mean, not that I'm defending that choice, but I can sort of maybe understand why they felt that was a risk they didn't want to take.

464
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't know, but basically, you know, for example, one of the team's, I guess, Method, their general manager stated that,

465
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:32,000
we are troubled by the way the announcement was made, namely the impolite choice to use social media and to share such a message that effectively ended the careers of hundreds of players,

466
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
content creators, casters, production crews overnight and broke the hearts of countless fans.

467
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
As someone who is, and this is Wolf Schroeder, who is one of the casters basically,

468
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:57,000
as someone who has commented Heroes of the Storm since 2015, I mostly really feel for the 200 plus pro players who have lost jobs via a blog post today.

469
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I always loved casting heroes, so it's tragic to see it suddenly, or go suddenly.

470
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Thanks for all the kind messages today, friends.

471
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So that sucks, especially for a lot of people that make this basically, you know, their livelihood.

472
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Right, and I'm not defending this choice and how Blizzard did it, but I mean, what's to stop another league from still forming outside of Blizzard being,

473
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I mean, is they just worry, the money's not going to be, you know, everything good takes money, is it just a concern that the money's not going to be there?

474
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I mean, there's so much that's homegrown, especially in this day and age where any idiot can build a Twitch channel, you know, like,

475
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I mean, and I say that, that they can go and, you know, maybe form something, I mean, but it wouldn't, the dollars wouldn't be there, I get it.

476
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah, I think it's that, but put all your eggs in one basket, though.

477
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Well, that's a very interesting, like, reality of esports, I think, in a way.

478
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And again, I don't want to sound like I'm being disrespectful, it's just one of those, because actually I really do enjoy Heroes of the Storm,

479
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and other than Overwatch League, HGC is probably the one thing I have watched before, because I don't get into it enough where I really follow the teams closely,

480
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I couldn't tell you who's on what team or whatever, but I just like to watch because I learn about the characters and how to play them better,

481
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and so I kind of learn a lot of that watching that. Like, watching football is not going to make me better at football, you know what I mean?

482
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Watching baseball is not going to make me better at it, but when I watch Heroes of the Storm being played live, sure, there's a lot that's not going to make me better at it,

483
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:43,000
but I learn things about team composition and skills that you take and why players do certain things that maybe I don't get from other sports.

484
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So, I will say, two Heroes of the Storm's complement, and the HGC and all these people that have been working with it,

485
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I don't consider myself hardcore with Heroes of the Storm, I casually play once in a while, but I enjoyed what I got out of watching these professional matches.

486
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So I, too, am sad to see it kind of just end like that, that was Thanos snapping, actually, and that's what happened here.

487
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Only half of it's gone.

488
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Well, I mean, but the soul still burns, but you know what I mean, there's still going to be-

489
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I think that's Soulcalibur.

490
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I know. There's still going to be fans streaming it on their personal Twitch channels, like Heroes as a spectator sport is not necessarily dead,

491
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:32,000
but my whole point with this, bringing it back to esports, is that it's something kind of unique that we don't deal with with football and baseball and basketball on ESPN,

492
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
like those sports have been around forever and they're not really changing majorly.

493
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yeah, but it's not necessarily, though, so much the participation in that, but even, for example, there was one of the casters, Tetcher,

494
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:59,000
basically said that he's been making $4,000 a month since during the season, and he received a day rate from Blizzard that he relied upon to pay his rent and bills,

495
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and it was his only source of income outside of his stream, and so unfortunately it's like almost losing your job,

496
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
so it's not necessarily that, yeah, they're not going to get the income from the actual event, the prize pool or whatever,

497
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:26,000
but they're also not getting the other income for keeping this whole tournament scene going, including all the commentating and running, filming, all that stuff.

498
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But it's also like a scary reality for people that are involved in esports playing, is that one day this can happen,

499
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
you know, one day there's going to be a new game and people move on from the old game they were playing,

500
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,000
and so, I mean, I hope, it's kind of like, I've kind of joked about this and I don't want to say joke, because it's, you know what I mean, though,

501
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:56,000
like I'm serious about this, even though it sounds like I'm being an asshole, but I'm being serious is that what happens if you're a Twitch streamer

502
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and that's how you make your living, or you're a YouTube, you're a YouTube person and that's how you make your living, right, because there's people that do that now,

503
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and then YouTube makes a rule that like fucks you and your income gets cut by like two thirds in like a month or whatever,

504
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
like are you saving money for when the bubble breaks on any of that stuff, like that's the scary stuff.

505
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Us, and I know you're probably looking at this going, the irony of you doing this while you're doing a podcast live on Twitch,

506
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
but the reality is we haven't made shit from this show in 16 years.

507
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Nothing to lose.

508
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:39,000
No, I've lost a lot actually doing this show, but exactly, you know, it's fine, you know, I'm not going to miss it when it's gone,

509
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
that sounds terrible from a financial perspective, I'm not going to miss it when it's gone, but obviously I'll miss it terribly,

510
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
but you know what I mean, like, and again, people, if they want to make a living off YouTube and they have that talent,

511
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
they want to make a living off esports, that's their prerogative, but it is this weird reality of one day it could end.

512
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Well right, and I have to also wonder too, like with this, that Blizzard's going to have new games that will be esports, I guess, compatible,

513
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,000
what's going to happen then when they're trying to get, you know, these people to come on, hey, come participate in our new esports game.

514
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yeah, completely forget that we fucked over all those people before, but hey, come join the new stuff, come on over, we won't fuck you over again, right away, promise.

515
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I mean, I guess, you know, now that I'm thinking about it here, because we do that a lot, we just kind of brainstorm a lot,

516
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
now that I'm thinking about it, I guess there are a lot of like basketball and baseball players who might get an injury,

517
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and then they can't play anymore. That does happen, you know, and it's like, well, I think there's insurance and stuff that happens in those scenarios,

518
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
but I don't know all the specifics.

519
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Well then they're going to have to turn to esports, which some of them will.

520
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Some of them have, I think, some of them do commentating and stuff, I don't know if there's a lot of players, but some of them do like commentating and all that stuff, so, anyway.

521
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Bionic limbs, I say.

522
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So anyway, YYR in chat says they doomed their future esports prospects outside of Overwatch, and I think that might be referring to the way this was all announced,

523
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:28,000
but even Overwatch is going to fade one day. I mean, there are very few, and I love Overwatch, but there are very few games that are very, very old that still are played competitively.

524
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Smash Brothers Melee on the GameCube.

525
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Counter-Strike.

526
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'll give you that Counter-Strike. There's a handful, but not a ton, you know?

527
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's, you know, and I'm sure Overwatch is probably worthy of being in that, you know, that grouping, but that is for the public to decide at the end of the day, right?

528
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Right. I don't know.

529
00:48:49,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Well, we'll see. I just, Activision hasn't had, or I should say Blizzard hasn't had really good luck with messaging this year, especially recently.

530
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Doing a few more chat comments over at Twitch, SH2100Matt does verify there is insurance, he watches a little more of the sports ball stuff than I do,

531
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
but says there is no insurance if the league shuts down, which is kind of what happened in this scenario.

532
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
KArts1 says, as much as I love Heroes of the Storm, in the back of my mind, I always had a feeling that this would eventually happen, LOL.

533
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Oh, I'm sorry. LOL. League of Legends. Sorry. League of Legends.

534
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
LOL. LOL.

535
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Sorry, I was like, wow, that was really harsh to laugh at it. Sorry.

536
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:42,000
League of Legends and Dota have such a market share on the genre, and Heroes of the Storm never really took a large chunk of that.

537
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's interesting because I've played all those games, and personally, just as a player, I've always preferred Heroes of the Storm because it's a little bit more easy to learn, easy to get into,

538
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
but that's also why I think some people prefer Dota.

539
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Easy to shuffle our developers off of so that we can make other games appropriate for Chinese markets instead of them being banned there?

540
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yes. Alright, anyway.

541
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:15,000
S2100matt says, all it takes is someone to put the money towards the League if Blizzard or Activision were allowed. Well, we'll see, but now they've also announced that the developers are kind of being shifted to other projects,

542
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:24,000
that they'll still have a crew working on Heroes of the Storm, but that Blizzard is working on a bunch of other stuff right now, and they need some of the key developers other places.

543
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So you sort of get that sense that Heroes of the Storm, while it's still going to exist, it's still going to be happy to take your money, like it's not going to necessarily get gigantic content upgrades in the future.

544
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Kind of like where Diablo 3 is at.

545
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Aside from canceling, obviously they have to make the announcement for canceling the esports stuff, but why do they even have to announce that they're going to shuffle people around in their company?

546
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Why is that something that needs to be like...

547
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Because Blizzard wants to remind you there is more coming than just Diablo Immortal.

548
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It didn't help! They didn't make it better. They made it worse. It didn't help. People are still thinking that, you know, well, they're fucking things over, and then they fuck things over even more.

549
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Bad dog. Bad. Didn't do it right.

550
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
YY Orange Chat says, I did see a thread on Reset Era this week that basically was like, Blizzard was told to ship more games and spend less time on them.

551
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And of course, you know, you have to take all that kind of anonymous forum post with a grain of salt, but I mean, this is where a lot of people have wondered, is Activision's influence.

552
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Some of these changes too, Mike Morhaime kind of officially left not long ago either.

553
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Like, are some of these changes starting to show their not-so-fantastic sides? I don't know.

554
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
We'll see.

555
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
We'll see.

556
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
All the mighty fall at some point.

557
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It's depressing though. It really is.

558
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Well, you know what? The Mortal Kombat franchise looks to still be going, and it's still going to be doing pretty well.

559
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Mortal Kombat 11, I think a lot of people are looking forward to. There is going to be customizable variants in the game.

560
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Esports-focused multiplayer mode, so there's something you can take up if you want.

561
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
We're all esports now.

562
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
We're all esports now. Well, but fighting games have always, they have EVO, you know, there's always kind of been like a place for them, and you know.

563
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah, fine.

564
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm pretty sure, you know, I don't think Street Fighter V has been going so well, so I'm sure people are waiting for, I shouldn't say that.

565
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Because then I'll get the Street Fighter V fan that's like, fuck you, you don't know what you're talking about.

566
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
But, you know, just, it's been a bumpy ride. I think we all agree with that.

567
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But Mortal Kombat 11, you know, people are gearing up and getting excited about this.

568
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
They want to remind you that if you pre-order the game, Shao Kahn is going to be a bonus character that's playable.

569
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Mortal Kombat 11 will have a new game engine, a new personalization system, which I'm assuming is create your own character.

570
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So I'm sure that's going to go well, based on what we see in Soul Calibur and all that stuff, right?

571
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I see no problems with Soul Calibur. What are you talking about?

572
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Especially when you consider the personalization system is now in a game where people die horrifically.

573
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Like, nothing's going to happen with this. Maybe personalization doesn't mean you actually create the old characters.

574
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Just that, like, clothes, accessories, and stuff, you can kind of build on the existing ones.

575
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Maybe that's what they're going for. That would make a lot more sense.

576
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Yeah, okay.

577
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
New fatalities and a new gore-tech system. Oh, joy.

578
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
They should have a creative fatality.

579
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
What the fuck is gore-tech?

580
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It's a made-up word.

581
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They are saying the multiplayer is oriented towards esports and personalization systems daily news, updated rewards, and so forth.

582
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The limited edition will have a steel case and six extra characters in the combat pack pass.

583
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Excuse me. One of those characters, potentially Spawn?

584
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah.

585
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Mortal Kombat has been getting some, you know, bigger name characters, licensed characters.

586
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Well, we had Predator, we had Freddy and Jason, right? We've seen, you know, a few of them.

587
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Spawn, although ironically, has been in Soul Calibur, right? The Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2.

588
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Probably the one people didn't play as much because everyone wanted the GameCube one with Link, right?

589
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
But the Xbox one had Spawn.

590
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
However, a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything with Todd McFarlane, who of course is the man behind Spawn, asked,

591
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
would Spawn be available to be in the upcoming Mortal Kombat game?

592
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
McFarlane said, I believe he's on his way, dot dot dot.

593
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So, did he let the cat out of the bag a little early? Is he just fucking with people? Who knows?

594
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
What do you think about Spawn as a potential character in 11?

595
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I love Spawn. I'm fine with that.

596
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
You know, there's supposed to be a new Spawn movie, I thought.

597
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yes, I know.

598
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
That's the thing we were working on.

599
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I know that they're doing that. I watched the original Spawn movie because at the time I was really into Spawn.

600
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
In fact, what's kind of funny, my dad was delivering to the...

601
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:53,000
At the time, he was delivering for FedEx to the same video distributor that I ended up working for at some point.

602
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So at one point, he was just delivering to them and they would get screeners and whatnot.

603
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But he got me the Spawn standee that went along with the movie.

604
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I had a giant Spawn standee in my room.

605
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Not to mention, I mean, just to give you an example of how much I love Spawn,

606
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I had on my wall a mural of Spawn and the Violator.

607
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Like, a giant fucking mural of that shit.

608
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Which was great when we were selling the house, because they're like, wow, there's a giant fucking demon on that wall.

609
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I don't get a creepy feeling from this house.

610
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It was the cover of issue 16, if I remember correctly, which had the Spawn from there.

611
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And then, I think it was issue 7 or something like that. It was a Violator from one of those.

612
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
But they basically drew it on the wall and they painted me a nice mural, because that's what I wanted.

613
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And it was awesome.

614
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Everybody else was creeped out by it, but it was so awesome.

615
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It was cool.

616
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So, if I really liked Mortal Kombat, yeah, I'd still be down for it, but I don't really care for Mortal Kombat.

617
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But Spawn's awesome. I'll totally go see the movie.

618
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You know who really likes Mortal Kombat? My husband, Alan.

619
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Even though I'm like, eh, it's so gross now. I love the old ones. The cartoony ones are great.

620
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I heard a rumor they're going to do the trilogy again, Remastered.

621
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I thought I picked that up. I don't know if it was on Discord or where I picked that up.

622
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Remastered again?

623
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Well, I think fans did it already, so I don't know if that's crossing wires with the fan project.

624
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I thought they did that already, like an Xbox 360.

625
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Well, they did, but it was just the games ported.

626
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Oh, you mean like actually recaptured everything?

627
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yes, yes.

628
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Fine.

629
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I was going to say, there was actually, someone was saying, I don't know if they wanted the petition or something,

630
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
but they wanted Doomguy in Mortal Kombat, which I could totally see that.

631
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Sure, I'm for that. I'm for that.

632
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Well, that goes right into what we're going to talk about next, doesn't it?

633
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yes, it does. So Doom just had an anniversary, a 25th anniversary actually.

634
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
The game was released December 10, 1993.

635
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And to commemorate the anniversary as well, John Romero had a livestream that he did,

636
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and during that livestream he announced a sigil, which is a Doom megawad.

637
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And for those who may not remember, a wad of course was the container files that they used to store all the levels and data for the game.

638
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So this giant megawad file that you can get, and it contains nine new single player and multiplayer levels.

639
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And it's basically a giant mod from the original creator of the game.

640
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So that's pretty awesome.

641
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And then he basically said, I wanted the levels to feel like they belonged in the original game as if they were the true fifth episode.

642
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,000
There's more detail in the levels than episodes one through four, but not overly so.

643
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I believe that the people playing sigil will recognize my design style,

644
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
but see new things I'm doing because this episode does not take place on a military base.

645
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It takes place in hell, which is new to me within the Doom design space.

646
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:24,000
There's massive room in episode five, mission six, that contains the coolest room I've ever created in any map.

647
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So sigil's going to be coming out in February, and it will be free to download.

648
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And then he's also going to be doing some limited edition fan boxes as well, full of goodies like floppy disks, a soundtrack,

649
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and apparently if you buy the deluxe edition, a pewter statue of his own head on a spike.

650
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Because that's, that's awesome.

651
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Would you, you know, Doom has had so many like fan wads over the years, it seems so weird that like,

652
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
it's just like you're kind of getting what fans have been doing for forever, but it's kind of cool.

653
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But it's the original creator, that's awesome.

654
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It is cool, it's nice to see him kind of like jump back in the waters and so forth,

655
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
but is this going to be like something we've just never seen before, or is it just, I want to check this out because...

656
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's cool, it's just like, I mean, I haven't played it yet, because I'm surprised I haven't played it yet.

657
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I think I actually have it, but the Duke Nukem 3D that they did, the world domination or whatever one they had,

658
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:32,000
the last Duke Nukem 3D remaster or whatever they put out, they had the additional episode in there as well.

659
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
That's kind of the same type of thing, except I don't think that was the original creators that made that episode.

660
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It was more of just, hey, we're throwing a new episode in there, yay.

661
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So, yeah, it's cool. It's free. I'm not going to complain, you know.

662
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I like free stuff.

663
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And plus, you know, the fact that Doom has been supported for this long, I mean, it's ridiculous. 25 years.

664
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And that, the new Doom was pretty good too.

665
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Yeah, new Doom was awesome, but even the original Doom, they've got so many tweaks and stuff to it now,

666
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
and they even have a Battle Royale Doom thing as well.

667
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And I believe it's one of the Xbox One compatible, because I had it on Xbox 360, and it's Xbox One backwards compatible.

668
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Sadly, I don't think you can do any of this stuff. I wish you could.

669
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I don't know. Not without modding, maybe, but a lot of those games still use the same WAD files.

670
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's just, you know, they rebuild the launcher.

671
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
All right. Well, let's move on to another game kind of crossover thing that's coming up.

672
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Capcom and CD Projekt Red are teaming up for a Monster Hunter event.

673
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So, in Monster Hunter World, in a free event that's supposed to launch in early 2019,

674
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
you are going to get to have Geralt in the game. Of course, Geralt from The Witcher,

675
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
which is, again, one of those games that, like, I really, really need to, like, sit down with the 70 hours and play that game,

676
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
because the little bits I have played were great, and it's just, you know, so many games, so little time, right?

677
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It's the gamer's crisis that we've been dealing with forever.

678
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
But anyway, with this, the expansion is actually called Iceborne, and so there's gonna be freezing ice biomes

679
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
that'll be a little bit new to the game, and this is all part of more Monster Hunter World content.

680
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
More information in the spring, so I don't think it's gonna be, like, you're not gonna get this in the next few weeks or anything.

681
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It's still a few months out, but that's pretty cool. There's also gonna be a new event quest,

682
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
which allows 16 people in groups of four each to team up towards a common goal.

683
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
That comes back on December 20th. Also, ooh, and I might have to check this out.

684
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Oh, darn it. It's going on now, and I missed it. A free trial from December 11th through December 17th.

685
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Just buy the game. It's, like, 20 bucks.

686
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I'm thinking Witcher.

687
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Oh, yeah, no, Monster Hunter World.

688
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I have some friends that play it and seem to enjoy it, so...

689
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I was gonna say The Witcher. Yeah, I've been...

690
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Every time I see it go on sale, I'm like, ooh, maybe I should get it.

691
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And I'm like, you know, when you buy that, you're never gonna play it because

692
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
you have all these other games you haven't played yet.

693
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
But, yeah.

694
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Cia Tiberian Chat says, I'd rather have Geralt throw up in Monster Rancher.

695
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Well, he had a cameo this year already in Soulcalibur VI, so they're putting him out.

696
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The CD Projekt Red's kinda...

697
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I'd just rather have Monster Rancher come back,

698
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
but then again, we don't use CDs anymore, so what the hell would that be?

699
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
He could be a character in Mortal Kombat 11, maybe?

700
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I don't know.

701
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Anyway, now, Monster Hunter has previously collaborated with Final Fantasy XIV,

702
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and they are saying that that was a pretty well-received collaboration.

703
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I can tell you from the Final Fantasy XIV perspective, it was a cool fight.

704
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Like, they did, like, a boss fight, basically, but...

705
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And then the way it ended, you had to, like, loot the boss similar to how you would in Monster Hunter.

706
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Like, it was a little different.

707
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Ooh, they should make Monster Rancher, but instead of using CDs to unlock the monsters, it would be, like, image files.

708
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Okay.

709
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So it's like, you know, hey, that picture of that giant dick I found on the internet,

710
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that just unlocked some, like, really strong, like, monster. That's awesome.

711
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
No. No, no, no.

712
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
No?

713
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
All right. Well, maybe.

714
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
All right, let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

715
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Yes. So, because we were talking about fighting games, let's talk about Street Fighter V

716
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
and all the great choices that they're making. All those great damn choices.

717
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So, somebody at Capcom had the fantastic idea, hey, you know where we haven't advertised yet?

718
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
On the players and everywhere else. So, that's what they're gonna be doing.

719
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
They have...

720
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I remember this coming up a little bit last week.

721
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yes, but now that we get to see what it looks like.

722
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Got it.

723
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And it looks, like, fucking terrible. Like, it's everywhere. Like, it's ridiculously everywhere.

724
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And apparently...

725
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:54,000
By the way, we're selling space on our studio wall. If you want to sponsor us, we'll put, you know, we'll put stickers and things over there.

726
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
A lot of this stuff is... Look at this. This is a poster for Final Fantasy XI. You know how old that is?

727
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It's gonna come back. I mean it.

728
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Kingdom Hearts.

729
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Kingdom Hearts. The first Kingdom Hearts. Like, a bootleg scroll from the first Kingdom Hearts.

730
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And look, all the way... I know it's washed out by the light a little bit because I can't get the lighting perfect in here.

731
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Pop'n Music XI for the PlayStation 2.

732
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Didn't we have, like, an Indigroove or something? Like, Indigroove 2 poster that was signed by Kyle Ward or something like that?

733
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
We might have that around here somewhere. We have a lot of stuff we didn't... We kind of ran out of wall space for.

734
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Unfortunately, it's not on cam. Maybe I'll move things around.

735
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Yeah, we have an actual Dance Dance Revolution machine marquee over here.

736
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And our picture. Our happy 300th episode picture that was drawn.

737
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Remember? We were 300 episodes in. Remember that?

738
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah.

739
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
But this Borderlands 2. Actually, Codeban saw that in chat. He's like, is that the poster I sent you?

740
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Yes! It was signed by Randy Pitchford.

741
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And it's actually signed?

742
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It is. It's signed by many people from the team.

743
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I still have, in my garage, framed up a true crime... Well, at the time it was true crime.

744
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I don't know what city it's gonna be because this is E3. We're not announcing what city it is yet.

745
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Spoiler. It was New York.

746
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So, I have that poster signed by the entire cast as well, which...

747
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's got Tracy Lords that signed it. That's neat.

748
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Anyways, since I was distracted by everything else that's in here...

749
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So yeah, they have this whole advertisement mode that literally plasters this logo.

750
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
For example, they're doing the Capcom Pro Tour right now, which...

751
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It's just plastered everywhere. Like, on the arms of these players, on this giant belt that they have...

752
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's fucking ugly. It's just stupid. You can opt out of it.

753
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:43,000
They want you, of course, to opt in on it because if you opt in on it, you get some additional fighter bucks, whatever the fuck they call it, to unlock shit in the game.

754
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It's not worth it, but it's optional.

755
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
But, you know, I can't wait until the next thing that comes out, you know, like...

756
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Old Spice or whatever the fuck they're gonna, you know, match up with this.

757
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I can't think of what other terrible possible, like, sponsors they could have.

758
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Totino's Pizza Rolls.

759
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
That's an awesome sponsor. I'm sorry.

760
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Okay, fine.

761
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I love food.

762
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
But I guess this isn't as bad as maybe Cup Noodle in Final Fantasy XV.

763
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I mean, that was ridiculous, but that was over the top. This is just obnoxious.

764
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It was. It was. The little, like, armor and stuff that uses that was always a little bit crazy.

765
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It's just obnoxious. But you can turn it off. But it's terrible. So don't...

766
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Just... It's better if you just turn it off because, I'm gonna tell you right now, if they find that this is effective, they're just gonna make it fucking worse.

767
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So it's... Just... Just turn it off.

768
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Alright. Let's move on for one more story here before our Classic Game of the Week.

769
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,000
And we're gonna talk a little bit about the Mega Man Legacy Collection, which is a classic game collection of sorts, right?

770
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Yeah.

771
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
The Mega Man Legacy Collection has Mega Mans 1 through 6.

772
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Now, what you may remember, this was already released a while ago on the PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

773
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And then they came out with the version on Switch.

774
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Well, for the most part, they were the same, except the Switch introduced a rewind feature.

775
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So you could actually, you know, if you screw up in the game, which I do a lot, you could hit a rewind button and, like, instantly replay it, basically.

776
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Kind of like, I do this a lot in Forza Horizon as well. Also has a rewind button and I use it a lot there.

777
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:29,000
So anyway, they ended up actually patching this feature in to the PC, the PlayStation 4, and Xbox One versions three years after the release.

778
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
At least they're still working on it.

779
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Yeah, I know. That's kind of cool. So now you can rewind in those versions as well. So that's pretty cool. Sorry, 3DS owners. You're screwed.

780
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,000
But I guess they figure most of you may be upgraded to Switch by now. I don't know. But what can you do?

781
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So there it is. The Mega Man Legacy Collection updated, which is a game that I've played maybe a little bit of on Switch.

782
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I probably need to play some more of. But those classic Mega Mans.

783
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Yeah.

784
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Which one's your favorite?

785
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Two, maybe?

786
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I would say two is probably my favorite as well, even though I know there's so much love for three and that the bosses from two are in three.

787
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It's just I just choose the one I'm always going to remember.

788
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Yeah, I remember three as well. I don't know. It's been a long time since I played all this.

789
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I did at one time, like, beat, I think, all of them. But I don't remember. It's been so long.

790
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
All right. Well, I think it's about time we get to the classic game of the week and figure out what's been picked out.

791
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It's not Mega Man, unfortunately, but I think it's another good one. So what do you say we get to the classic game of the week?

792
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Sounds good.

793
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,000
All right. And tonight we're playing with a new kind of magic. So this is all it's new, uncharted territory.

794
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Well, as Arthur C. Clarke says, any technology suitably advanced enough is indistinguishable from magic.

795
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
But one thing is, of course, going to be consistent. That know it all, Dark Saga or Jamie Summers is still here with us.

796
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Hi.

797
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Hi, how are you?

798
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I'm OK.

799
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Good. Good to see you here.

800
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
A peddler enjoyed us all week.

801
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah, except unfortunately, just the magic isn't quite there yet for us to see you here.

802
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Not if I can help it.

803
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Twitch thing going on. I've got to get those wigs ready.

804
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I know. I know you're doing this, but we're here talking about the classic game of the week.

805
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah, as we always do. That is still going to be consistent. Always.

806
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Never.

807
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Yup. Except when it's not, because once a month you do something different.

808
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But we'll talk about it.

809
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I already did the different. I know. But I did that live.

810
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Different is fun. Anyway, let's get to it. It's the classic game of the week.

811
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week tonight?

812
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Nineteen X X.

813
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
The war against destiny.

814
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I know. Sounds pretty dramatic for, you know, a fucking shooter game.

815
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It is a vertical scrolling shooter by Capcom released in 1996.

816
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:39,000
It takes place before a fictional war in 19XX as a lone pilot.

817
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Tries to defeat an entire army by himself trying to prevent another world war.

818
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Which would escalate to a nuclear apocalypse.

819
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Apocalypse.

820
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Apocalypse.

821
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Sounds like a prolapse.

822
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Alpaca lips.

823
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
More like alpacas.

824
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I don't know. Given the way the world is, it's more of a prolapse.

825
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Anyway.

826
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Anus or something. I don't know.

827
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Wow.

828
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Anyway, it is the fourth game in a series of World War II vertical shooters by Capcom.

829
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:15,000
The other games in the series were 1942, 1943, the Battle of Midway, 1941, Counterattack.

830
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
They were all on Capcom CPS1.

831
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Released through 1984 through 1990.

832
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
This one is a CPS2 game so it had a different style from the previous games.

833
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
It also was followed by 1944 The Loopmaster in 2000.

834
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Which may end up being a classic game in the future.

835
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Womp womp in the future.

836
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So you select one of three planes.

837
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Each one has different ratings and speed, power, and their homing attack strength.

838
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And so they fly through the levels.

839
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
The three primary weapons can be used by either picking up their respective items.

840
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
You have a fire that does Vulcan bullets, a straight firing laser, or multi-directional missiles.

841
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
By holding the button one, you can charge them up to shoot a special missile.

842
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Sorry, my brain instantly went to gachamon.

843
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I want to fire the bird missile!

844
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Anyway.

845
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Or that was more like G-Force.

846
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I don't know. He always wanted to fire the bird missile.

847
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I don't watch the animes.

848
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So I don't know.

849
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Girl, don't even lie.

850
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Maybe once in a while.

851
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
You've watched some things.

852
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Maybe a little Pokemon.

853
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yeah.

854
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I listen to- I watch what-

855
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I know a certain somebody in this room went to go see the Pokemon movie with the very first one.

856
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So.

857
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
That is true.

858
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Twice.

859
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I was just saying, I saw it with Amanda.

860
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Remember Amanda?

861
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I remember.

862
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
She's adorable.

863
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
When you told the person with the small penis to shut up.

864
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
No.

865
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
That was not a Pokemon.

866
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I would not say that at Pokemon.

867
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
That was a grudge.

868
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Oh that's right.

869
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
That movie was great too.

870
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Anyway.

871
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Oh hi.

872
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
19XX.

873
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Yeah.

874
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
XDX.

875
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
You also-

876
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Not 20XDX.

877
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Which is a great Mega Man club.

878
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
19XDX.

879
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Well at any rate there you also get smart bombs that can clear out the whole page.

880
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Whole page.

881
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
The whole screen with all the projectiles on the screen too.

882
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
You can also charge them up so each level of charge gets a different effect.

883
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
If you are shot- I was going to say shart.

884
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
If you are shot down while charging a bomb.

885
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
The bomb does not go off.

886
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Which is sad.

887
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
It should just go off and clean everything while you reload.

888
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So at the end of every level you get additional points for the number of bombs you still have

889
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,000
in a rank of 1-5 depending on the percentage of enemies destroyed.

890
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And for the time it took you to take down a boss.

891
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And a bonus for every medal collected which is multiplied by rank.

892
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
After beating the last level you also get a large bonus for the number of lives you

893
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
have remaining.

894
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It has been ported to GameTap which I wasn't aware of.

895
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,000
But it was not released in the Capcom Classics collection as it is considered a modern game

896
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
according to Capcom.

897
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,000
It was commended for having some of the cleanest looking animation, multi-level backgrounds,

898
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
digitized explosions and various streams of patterned enemies place.

899
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
19xx among the cream of the crop.

900
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That was from Next Generation magazine.

901
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
He also did find that the various methods of attack set it from different shooters and

902
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
gave it a 3 out of 5 stars.

903
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That's kind of middling though.

904
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
But the words are nice.

905
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
So yeah, again to go through the whole series starting at the beginning we have 1942, 1943

906
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
The Battle of Midway.

907
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Also called 1943 Kai which I'm sure you've heard of before.

908
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I think you did at least one of these games before.

909
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm sure I have.

910
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I think I did 1942.

911
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
There was also 1941 Counterattack, 19xx The War Against Destiny.

912
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
1944 The Loopmaster and 1942 Joint Strike.

913
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And there you go.

914
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Alright.

915
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
The classic game of the week.

916
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
19xx.

917
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
19xtx.

918
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
There it is.

919
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And 20xtx is not the sequel.

920
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
No.

921
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
This was the first of the series on CBS2.

922
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Alright.

923
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Well that's going to do it for our classic game of the week.

924
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,000
But Dark Sakura, any final words as we go back to our debut on Twitch?

925
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Actually I was double checking one thing just to see what the other one is released on.

926
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Actually 1942 Joint Strike was actually an Xbox Live Arcade and PSN copy so it never

927
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
had an arcade release.

928
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Well there you go.

929
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
But The Loopmaster did.

930
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And The Loopmaster was also CPS2.

931
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Alright.

932
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Enough about playing shooty pew pew games.

933
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Although they are a good series.

934
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Is there a great series?

935
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Well some of them were kind of meh.

936
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But they were all Capcom's foray into it and certainly maybe they were a little bit bitter

937
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
about World War II.

938
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I don't know.

939
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Any parting words as we go back to our debut on Twitch?

940
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We have done a lot of tweaking behind the scenes getting this shit working.

941
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
We've been working real hard.

942
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Ever since we saw that preview footage from Bobby Blackwell I was like,

943
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Oh crap.

944
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
We are not ready.

945
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
You are not prepared.

946
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
But I think we're prepared now.

947
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
We're good.

948
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Alright.

949
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And my voice has finally decided to go off.

950
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Fuck it.

951
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So last words.

952
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Words.

953
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Alright.

954
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,000
We're back here live with our episode number 756 in progress tonight.

955
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
You know the date was wrong on the top this whole time until like somebody told me like

956
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
just maybe like 20 minutes ago before we went to the last game of the week.

957
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
So yeah.

958
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Boy.

959
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
It's certainly.

960
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You know it's the first night.

961
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Things are going to go wrong on Twitch.

962
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
What can you do?

963
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
It's a huge change.

964
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Again we did things one way.

965
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
16 and a half years.

966
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So this is definitely a little bit different for us.

967
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
But we are going to get back into the show.

968
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Thank you guys so much for you guys joining us along in our chat over at Twitch TV slash

969
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
vog network.

970
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Of course is the channel where you can you know subscribe and follow along and watch

971
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:52,000
ourselves and Bobby Blackwell on Sunday nights in 2019 the kids over anime jam session are

972
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
also going to make their move.

973
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Yeah.

974
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It's exciting.

975
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Yeah.

976
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And who knows.

977
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
We're looking for more shows especially those with video.

978
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
You know the talk shows type of things would definitely be interested in working with some

979
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
more individuals in that capacity.

980
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I do want to stress that the current vog network and all the shows we work with there.

981
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
We're not like getting rid of given those show shout outs and things like that.

982
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Unfortunately we've lost a few shows over the last year you know just the shows of pod

983
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
faded for various reasons you know pod culture just finished up.

984
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Critical Myth I know was taped in their last episode and they were on their way out.

985
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I think Power Ranger Pride is said they're they're pretty much done but there's still

986
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
a lot of great shows there that are moving on and we hope to still work with them and

987
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
find ways to promote each other and keep promoting independent podcasting because that's what's

988
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
all about.

989
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
We got to support independent podcasters.

990
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So and thanks you guys.

991
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I love that it's flea and chat says you guys are doing great.

992
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yes.

993
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Thank you.

994
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
We appreciate that.

995
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
We're trying we're trying our best.

996
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
All right.

997
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
But I'm I'm trying almost my best.

998
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yes.

999
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I so since we haven't hit affiliate status yet you can you know view all the previous

1000
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
stuff.

1001
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I do want to point out and there's a whole article over VOG Network that explains this.

1002
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
If you want to watch the archives in the future once we really get things kind of locked down

1003
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
here the way the way we envision them long term we are going to have that that you have

1004
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
to be a subscriber for the twitch channel to be able to see all the old videos.

1005
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But the podcast none of that is going away.

1006
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
So you know the free audio podcast we would never take that away or make you pay for that

1007
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
all the sudden but only the video is going to be something where it's a subscription.

1008
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
But so many of you I think have the prime accounts anyway and you get a free one every

1009
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
month.

1010
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So I mean just toss that over to VOG Network and you'll be able to access the archives

1011
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
again.

1012
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
We are not an affiliate of twitch yet.

1013
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
We just kind of think that's that's the design is we're hoping to get there pretty soon and

1014
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
then we'll be able to open that up to you guys.

1015
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
But if you guys want to make clips and things like that I don't remember if non affiliate

1016
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
they can do the clips and the hot.

1017
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
But if you feel like making clips of something of this show is funny or whatever we have

1018
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
another broccoli farm moment this week or what have you.

1019
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Feel free to clip away.

1020
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You do that stuff all you want.

1021
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
That's not that old already.

1022
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
You haven't.

1023
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
The joke isn't as funny as it was last.

1024
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
No it isn't.

1025
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
It's really it's kind of kind of come and gone.

1026
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's sunset.

1027
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
We'll see the broccoli farm.

1028
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Well I still want to hear how that goes over when you finally tell the kids where you're

1029
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
really going.

1030
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh I'm sure they'll be really excited and then ask us every single day where we're going.

1031
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Yeah because my one son doesn't understand the concept of time very well.

1032
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
All right.

1033
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
All right.

1034
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Well let's get back into some news.

1035
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
We have some rapid fire news some quick stories we want to get into here before we get to

1036
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
like the mailbag and stuff.

1037
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:44,000
So apparently the SNK 40th anniversary collection has gotten an update with additional 11 complete

1038
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
games for free.

1039
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So they have split this up against three downloads but you get Beast Busters, Bermuda Triangle,

1040
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Chopper One, Fantasy, Much Mobile, Osmo Wars, Paddlemanium, SAR Search and Rescue, Suzuki

1041
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
versus Commander, Time Soldiers and World Wars.

1042
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I need to pick up that collection.

1043
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Crystallis alone.

1044
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I love that game on NES.

1045
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I used to play a ton of Bermuda Triangle on the NES.

1046
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Yes.

1047
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Yeah.

1048
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
So it's available for free.

1049
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So check it out.

1050
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Love that game.

1051
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And then of course Nintendo has stated that they're going to be discontinuing the SNES

1052
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
and NES classics after this holiday.

1053
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So basically this is the last chance to get them.

1054
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And finally it's not hard to get these things.

1055
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
No.

1056
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
But you need to get them now.

1057
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
You gotta get them now because if not you're gonna be stuck at the PlayStation Classic.

1058
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Which is being marked down by the way.

1059
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Already.

1060
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
It's $75.

1061
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Where?

1062
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Target.

1063
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Right now.

1064
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Already.

1065
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Target.

1066
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,000
In fact earlier you could get it for $75 on Amazon plus a $25 gift card to Amazon.

1067
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
It's $50 bucks.

1068
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Uh oh.

1069
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Uh oh.

1070
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Alright.

1071
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
And they're modded already completely.

1072
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
You can put whatever game you want.

1073
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I hope Sony has learned a couple things.

1074
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And maybe we'll get something a little different next time.

1075
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
We'll see what happens.

1076
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So.

1077
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
They tried to half-ass it.

1078
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And unfortunately.

1079
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yeah.

1080
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That's not gonna work out well for them.

1081
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Well.

1082
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
But the NES and the Super Nintendo Classics.

1083
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
They're pretty good.

1084
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
You know.

1085
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Unfortunately.

1086
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
You know.

1087
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You can't really.

1088
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Well.

1089
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
If you mod them you can add new games to them.

1090
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
But officially you can't add new games to them or anything.

1091
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
You're kind of locked into those games.

1092
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
But that's.

1093
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
That's.

1094
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
They're still.

1095
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
They're good picks.

1096
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
They're good picks.

1097
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Unofficially though.

1098
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
You can put whatever the fuck you want on there.

1099
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I know.

1100
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So anyway.

1101
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
A lot of that classic library for NES stuff is moved on to the Switch online.

1102
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
That's kind of where they want you to go now because they ink pay that every year basically.

1103
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
They did recently update the Switch online.

1104
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Nintendo Switch online library.

1105
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
With some new games.

1106
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Including the Adventures of Lolo, Wario's Woods, and Ninja Gaiden.

1107
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Which I had talked about this week.

1108
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I actually had played Adventures of Lolo a little bit.

1109
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I forgot to mention that in my gaming week.

1110
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
So there's those.

1111
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
But they also added.

1112
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
They've been kind of doing this every month.

1113
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
They add bonus SP modes from other releases.

1114
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So there were some bonus SP modes.

1115
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
There was Dr. Mario SP and Metroid SP.

1116
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So in Dr. Mario SP you basically start right near the end.

1117
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
So you can see like a rare animation thing that you don't normally see unless you beat level 20.

1118
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So Dr. Mario SP kind of lets you go right to that.

1119
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Basically.

1120
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Or right before that.

1121
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
You still have to do a little bit.

1122
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Metroid SP.

1123
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
This one's interesting.

1124
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
All they are, they're save states.

1125
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
That are just basically preloaded.

1126
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
So the Metroid one starts you off at Ridley.

1127
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
So you have all the items and everything you need.

1128
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
You start at Ridley and you can go in and just kick Ridley's ass.

1129
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Which is really not difficult.

1130
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I remember it being a lot harder as a kid.

1131
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
But hint.

1132
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Just freeze all those fireballs then blast away with missiles.

1133
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
That's really all you have to do.

1134
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
And it's very very easy with the ice beam.

1135
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
So you can fight Ridley there.

1136
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And I think they're probably doing that because of Ridley's appearance in Super Smash Brothers.

1137
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
So they want to remind people.

1138
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Because a lot of people probably aren't going to be able to play their own way there.

1139
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
So you can kind of check that out as a classic or whatever.

1140
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
No word yet though what's coming out next year.

1141
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
You know we've kind of known for the rest of this year.

1142
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
What is going to be coming out.

1143
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
But we don't know what's coming out in January.

1144
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
So Nintendo still has to kind of announce that.

1145
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
So we'll see what comes out next.

1146
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Alright anyway.

1147
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Moving on to a new Final Fantasy character coming to Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.

1148
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Which I know some people are really addicted to on their cellular phones.

1149
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
That was the game that Ariana Grande was actually in.

1150
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
You remember that?

1151
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
My favorite Final Fantasy character Ariana Grande.

1152
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Well you might have a new one.

1153
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Because Katy Perry is coming to Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.

1154
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
That's right.

1155
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Katy Perry will be in a commercial.

1156
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Which features one of her songs that I guess she's out there promoting.

1157
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
And she'll also be a character in the game.

1158
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
So the promo started earlier this week.

1159
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And good luck trying to get her as an unlocked character in the game there.

1160
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So you can check out the little commercial out there featuring her song.

1161
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Immortal Flame is out there on the YouTubes and all that stuff.

1162
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I'm sure she knows what Final Fantasy is.

1163
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
To which they say in chat.

1164
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Oh my god. Wig. I feel that.

1165
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Let's see.

1166
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Now you're talking.

1167
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Now you're talking.

1168
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I can get on board with that.

1169
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
That one I can get on board with as well.

1170
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Pixel Pacas reminds us this isn't the first time that Katy Perry's teamed up with video games.

1171
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Katy Perry was also in The Sims 3.

1172
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Remember when she sang all those songs in Simlish?

1173
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I remember that.

1174
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
No.

1175
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I don't.

1176
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Cause you don't want to.

1177
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Cause I don't care.

1178
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Alright.

1179
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Let's move on and check out what's in stores this week.

1180
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Loki.

1181
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
What's in stores is a bunch of cookie in my mouth.

1182
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Sorry bad timing.

1183
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
We're gonna do it anyways.

1184
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Do you need help?

1185
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
No I'm good.

1186
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Alright.

1187
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So is the cookie.

1188
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Yes.

1189
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So we have London Detective Mysteria on the Vita.

1190
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
What's that?

1191
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
A Vita?

1192
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Warhammer Vermintide 2 on Playstation 4.

1193
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Dragon Quest Builders 2 on Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4.

1194
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And would you believe it?

1195
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
That's it for this year.

1196
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
That's all folks.

1197
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
No more games.

1198
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Well I mean you know it is the big busy time of year so it makes sense.

1199
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Well over in Japan there's still a few releases cause the holidays are a little different.

1200
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
So the cycle of gaming releases changes a little bit.

1201
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
But on the Playstation 4 Dragon Quest Builders 2 is out this week.

1202
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So I think I like the first Builders game so that might be interesting the sequel.

1203
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And I know the Switch is supposed to be getting that as well.

1204
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
That's out on the Playstation 4 this week December 20th.

1205
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Kunio-kun a world classic collection is out this week.

1206
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Brave Neptunia.

1207
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Sakai Uchiyokatsumoko Seiyuu comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.

1208
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Onimusha Warlords on the Playstation 4 this week in a regular and a limited box.

1209
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Battle Princess Madeline is coming out this week as well.

1210
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana in a Christmas gift package.

1211
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
So I'm assuming that's another price reduction and just a repackaging of the game.

1212
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Do they have cookies in that package?

1213
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I don't think so.

1214
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I haven't heard about a Christmas cake being included with that or anything like that.

1215
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:55,000
On the Switch this week I want to see that Dragon Quest Builders 2 is out on the Switch as well.

1216
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Also Kunio-kun which I mentioned is there as well as Onimusha Worlds.

1217
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Katamari Damacy Encore as they're calling it in Japan that is out this week.

1218
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So we actually got that one a little bit earlier than they did in Japan so that's kind of cool.

1219
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
So that's what you have to look forward to in Japan this week.

1220
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Also a lot of price reductions kind of around the board.

1221
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Just things moving into the best collection and so forth in Japan.

1222
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Loki are you able to do the UK dates while we get the mailbag ready to go?

1223
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Yes sadly not much going on in the UK as well.

1224
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
We've only got one game coming out over there.

1225
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Bridge Constructor Portal.

1226
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
They're finally getting that on PC, Mac, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

1227
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Oh and of course Android and iOS.

1228
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Alright.

1229
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
So it's coming out over there now.

1230
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Alright well it'll pick up again in the new year though.

1231
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Because we have some like Kingdom Hearts is a huge release here.

1232
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Next year is going to be pretty busy so lots of stuff coming out.

1233
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Hold on brace yourselves.

1234
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Alright well let's move on we're going to get to the mailbag.

1235
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
So if you want to email our show you can.

1236
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Participate at orangelaundrydo.com is the place to send your emails.

1237
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Earlier in the show I started an email from YYR because I wanted to get his perspective on the whole stores thing.

1238
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Yes.

1239
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I didn't finish it.

1240
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Oh my god.

1241
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I should probably do that shouldn't I?

1242
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:15,000
So anyway YYR saying anyway I'll finish this email giving you my opinion on the possible cutting of the mailbag segment.

1243
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
OLR is advertised on the show where every gamer has a voice.

1244
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Well some people use Twitter.

1245
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Some people use Facebook.

1246
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Some people use Instagram.

1247
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Some people use Discord.

1248
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Some people use Twitch.

1249
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
No one uses Google Plus.

1250
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Some people well they can't after a certain.

1251
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I think after April you can't even if you wanted to.

1252
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Some of my Ingress pals still use Google Plus because Ingress was a Google thing.

1253
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
So there's a community there but you're right.

1254
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Ain't nobody using Google Plus in a few more months.

1255
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Anyway some people use Skype and depending on where in the world you are the popularities of all these can vary widely.

1256
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
But every gamer has email.

1257
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Every gamer.

1258
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And I'll leave it at that.

1259
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
So like I said if you guys keep using it we'll keep it.

1260
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
But they can only take so much of RuPaul's Drag Race talk when we have no emails.

1261
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I'm hoping again introducing this show to a new audience on Twitch and all that stuff.

1262
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I'm hoping that'll help grow things but we'll see.

1263
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Rock on OLR and best of luck on Twitch.

1264
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I hope we get a million listeners by next week.

1265
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Well I heard we were up to 74 followers on the network so that's pretty cool.

1266
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I'm going to have a lot of names to read at the end of the show.

1267
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
So alright awesome.

1268
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Thank you very much otherwise for that email YYR.

1269
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Let's go to some other emails that we got.

1270
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Including let's see I think this one.

1271
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
It's from Rhetortainment.

1272
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I'm looking at our chat too over at Twitch TV at VOG Network.

1273
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Yeah PixelPakas is talking about they closed Google Plus early because there was another data issue.

1274
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
They bumped it up to April and I think he's found a story that says that.

1275
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Yeah it was supposed to be like over the summer and they bumped it up to April because yes there was yet another data issue.

1276
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
But then they closed Facebook because of all their data issues.

1277
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Not yet.

1278
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Anyway Rhetortainment emails us saying dear Mr. Smoosh and the other broccoli heads.

1279
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Recently a business has opened in my area that has been discussed on OLR before.

1280
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Round one.

1281
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Yes we have a round one in the Salt Lake area and it's just as glorious as I've heard you people gas on about.

1282
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I haven't heard that. I haven't heard gas be used as an expression of a good time in a very long time.

1283
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
This makes me wonder the following.

1284
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Are there any other businesses that you people adore that you perceive to be local treasures.

1285
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Or at the very least don't have much of a presence outside of California.

1286
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Know this up front.

1287
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
There are in and out burger locations outside of California.

1288
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
We have many of them in Utah and they're OK.

1289
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
A bit overhyped but not that bad.

1290
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
That was from Broccoli Entertainment as he's renamed himself this week.

1291
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
So thank you for the email.

1292
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:51,000
What do you think places here locally or in California that people are missing out on not having other places.

1293
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I got a couple answers.

1294
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
So I think this is in a lot of big cities.

1295
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
But Fry's Electronics.

1296
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Yeah I've had to go there three times this week because of all this shit.

1297
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
So there's that because they don't have Radio Shack anymore.

1298
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Most know most of the stuff I was buying.

1299
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I get a radio once you go to Fry's or you're like I don't need Radio Shack anymore because they have way more so.

1300
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I know that Fry's is on the other side of town. That's the only my only complaint about it.

1301
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
It's true. Yeah. Yeah. For me it's like kind of a trip over there for you.

1302
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,000
It's a little shorter to get to the one. But yeah for me it's like I got to go.

1303
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I got to get on the freeway. So yeah there's all that. So that's one.

1304
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
But I would say locally here in Sacramento where our show is based if you didn't know that.

1305
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
There's a food chain that's here kind of locally and I think they're starting to spread to like some of the Bay Area.

1306
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But like it's so good that my friends in the Bay Area come here to eat there. It's Jack's Urban Eats.

1307
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
It's like salads is that you know they usually made a face.

1308
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
You don't like them. All right. They're good. Not that great.

1309
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
My pals from San Jose will like come up to eat at Jack's because it's like this big deal.

1310
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,000
But you know I think you know what I think is is hyped the squeeze squeeze burger.

1311
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I think that's over. Yeah that's over hyped. People love it. It's with that.

1312
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:10,000
They put a gigantic piece of cheese on it so that it's not a gigantic piece of cheese.

1313
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I'll have you know. So what they do use me. Well hello. We got to get it correct. OK. Sorry.

1314
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
So what they do is they put it's a cheese skirt. So they basically create a burger.

1315
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
They put the burger down. It's on the grill and everything.

1316
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And then they take shredded cheddar cheese and they just literally dump way too much fucking cheese on it.

1317
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And then they put a lid on it and squeeze some water under so that steam melts the cheese and you get this giant fucking thing of cheese that's on there.

1318
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And then you eat your burger and the burgers is kind of it's all right. But the cheese is really good except the cheese is super greasy because cheddar cheese.

1319
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I ate there a couple of times when I was working in Sacramento for my company's innovation shop and I got over it after about two times.

1320
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I was just like yeah I'm not eating here ever again. It was all right.

1321
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Why why are says I don't understand how you can walk into an in and out and get super yummy feeling burger for under five bucks when nowhere else can do the same thing.

1322
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I like in and out but like people go crazy about it. I'm like I like them but they're always they're always so crowded.

1323
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:23,000
You know what I mean. Like it's just like it's like this event thing and I'm like it's OK. It's it's good. It is a good burger and fries for a good price.

1324
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I don't like Burger King burgers are fine. Like I don't know I just I would go there like in and out is OK but it's not like here's the thing I need to go there.

1325
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:41,000
My like friends from like Chicago and the East Coast because I guess they don't really have this out there but they think some of them think that the bigger deal out here is Jack in the box and they're everywhere.

1326
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:51,000
So it's like it's like giant balls like McDonald's out here. They're everywhere right. But like because of like let's be real that company really caters to stoners.

1327
01:32:51,000 --> 01:33:07,000
So they have like they have all these munchy things on the menu right. Right. Like look they have a late night snack box that's like two jalapeno poppers some mozzarella sticks a small fries like you know what audience that's catered towards because they only sell it.

1328
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Well they did that in the commercials. It's like you know. Yeah. Like what was it tacos or whatever. Ninety nine cent tacos or something like that. Like how many should we get. Ninety nine. Yeah.

1329
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So yeah. So I think I like Jack in the Box just because I think I like the sourdough sandwiches they do there is not really a thing you see everywhere else. And yeah I just like OK.

1330
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Can't eat there anymore but you know you know what else. Somebody in chat earlier had said let's see because I want to get proper proper credit. W 0 4 says Pinkberry there.

1331
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:59,000
They were everywhere now but I don't go there as much as I used to know. I like now is cheese is the one. Yes. I was just supposed to go there. Yeah. Yes. Men cheese with their dole whip yogurt land which had the Nintendo promotion it closed here.

1332
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:09,000
So we can't go there anymore. Remember when they had the Nintendo promotion all the flavors were Nintendo and the spoons were Nintendo. Oh my kids love it but no. Yeah no it was a couple of years ago. So it was that.

1333
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:22,000
So let's see a couple more comments in our chat. Bobby Blackwell says we actually had a local place called Stoner Burger here. They tie dye everything on the wall. The town basically ran them out of town because the imagery. Great food though.

1334
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I like round table. That's local. Oh yeah. Best pizza. But I'm biased because I work there. No it's it is. It's more expensive though. Like you can't get two pizzas for 10 bucks or whatever. It's a little pricier but it really is like half off delivery days or something.

1335
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I never go there. All those companies better be paying us for those free shout outs. But that was an email. Let's move on to which you know it pisses me off is my local round table they used to have.

1336
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:57,000
See they have these like I guess royalty programs. So there's this one that's I remember it's called now but a lot of different places share it's done with your phone like a phone app or something like that.

1337
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:09,000
So then I had all these points you know built up on it. They got rid of it and then they brought it back. I'm like you fucking assholes. I had like free twists on there so they can't go to that place anymore because they fuck up my order every time.

1338
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:20,000
But that's just the employees that necessarily I'm not going to hold that against round table themselves because their pizza is fucking good but it's just the employees not always the sharpest.

1339
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:31,000
You are a former employees. Yeah but fuck up orders like that. Do they have mountain mics everywhere because that's kind of like like that one day we're sick around table we'll have mountain mics.

1340
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Yeah mountain mics is pretty good too. I don't know if that's all over the place. I don't know. I don't know what's local what's not. I don't see mountain mics in Atlanta though so maybe they are like pizza.

1341
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:50,000
That's good. But that's everywhere. That's on. But we don't have a lot of them here. No. And I'll tell you what the other thing we don't have. And then I swear to God we're moving on.

1342
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:58,000
The other thing we don't really have in California which surprises people like here's the one that's going to really surprise you that like is a delicacy for me when I travel.

1343
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Dunkin Donuts. Now recently in SAC we got like two of them. Yeah there's one right by my house there. OK. Which couldn't be any further for me. Yeah. So like to me I still like it's it's I almost eat Dunkin more often when I travel the one I'm here.

1344
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I've had their doughnuts and I was just kind of like it's the coffee it's not about the doughnut. Oh OK. OK. Coffee because I didn't have the coffee but I had the doughnuts and I was like the doughnuts are OK.

1345
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I would rather that you were like something else because your doughnuts are kind of crap.

1346
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Yeah I know Raginator in chat says Dunkin Donuts are a dime a dozen here in Buffalo. Yeah. Most of the places I visit on the East Coast they're like everywhere. They're like Starbucks here.

1347
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:56,000
You know every big doughnut place that's around here. Starbucks is also not Starbucks. Yeah Starbucks is fucking everywhere. What was the other one. Krispy Kreme I rather they would have been a Krispy Kreme one more and I swear to God we talk a lot about food for a gaming show but this one this is huge because if we're going to talk coffee I don't have a coffee drinker but here's the one you're missing out on in my opinion.

1348
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Dutch brothers the best those little there are those little stands and parking lots you have to drive. Oh yeah. They're starting to get more of them. Yeah. Yeah.

1349
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:15,000
It is the best. Super sugary. Probably not good for you coffee but it is amazing. Like if you're a Starbucks fiend go try that when you're in California.

1350
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:28,000
We're missing out on these fucking like I don't know what they call them but you know it's those like topless coffee places. It's like like the ones and I don't check bikini baristas.

1351
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Yeah. Bikini baristas we're going to see now on that shit. You put that in fucking laws against it here. Oh it's whatever.

1352
01:37:39,000 --> 01:38:01,000
It's whatever. I mean we need that because it's like fucking I I not I don't really care for it. You know the Dutch brothers shit that they have it's just it's just it's overrated and they fucking block. Try going into a parking lot that has the Dutch brothers it's fucking impossible to get around in there because it's just like lines.

1353
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I know the fucking as it's good and we went there. I've been there before. All right. But yeah no more free commercials. No more free commercials. You're all paying up with free stuff. All right. Moving on. Let's get to an email from pixel pockets who used to go by MXC in the chat but now on Twitch pixel progress.

1354
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Well it says hello. The new video format is fantastic. Sure it's changed but it's changed for the better. I wanted to send an email to say thank you folks for continuing to do all our year after year and for inspiring me in many ways.

1355
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Yours was the first podcast I ever listened to back in 2004 2005. Just remember just remember we were a lot younger than we looked a lot younger. I didn't have a beard. I was you know more of a skinny legend back then.

1356
01:38:42,000 --> 01:39:04,000
But it's a different time anyway and has remained in my weekly rotation years later way back when I first started listening in. I wanted to start my own podcast. It never happened until this year. My friend was looking to start a new podcast called the pixel X pixel that might be pixel cross pixel pixel cross pixel primarily about Japanese media games anime etc.

1357
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:17,000
And we decided to do one together. It's only six episodes in so far but we're having fun. Good job working in your free promo but I support that. That's awesome. And keep having fun. Yeah because when it's not the most important it's no longer fun.

1358
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:28,000
It's it's done for one of our anniversaries. I emailed to share being thankful for Rob as being an openly gay gamer which I did not have gay people in my life to look up to.

1359
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:39,000
It's a bit funny to look back on this point with tons of LGBTQ folks in my life now but I'll always be thankful for or during a tough time of my life. Thank you. That means more than you can know it really does.

1360
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Or is my favorite part of Sunday evening. I'll keep listening and now watching as long as you folks keep going. Well we'll see how long it takes for them to kick us off twitch. But I think we're in a good spot.

1361
01:39:51,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Thank you so much pixel podcast is very sweet email. And people are being very nice tonight because Bobby Black was asking first tears on twitch. Not yet. Not yet. Getting close though Frodo swaggin sends us this email and I think this is another very nice one.

1362
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Hey well our Frodo swagins here. Just wanted to write in and say congrats on the move to twitch. I'm really excited to see your show get bigger. There are way too many people missing out on this wonderful show.

1363
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:28,000
You mentioned possibly taking emails away in last week's episode. Just make sure to have another way for us to write in and say hi if you do. That's one of the great things about this show is being able to write in and participate.

1364
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I've I've taken my claws back a little bit from where I was last week. You guys keep using it. We'll keep reading them. Also I've heard a lot of episodes on here where people talk about what games help them get through hard times.

1365
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Rocket League is mine. That's for sure. But I realized that Orange Andrea was something I'm going to look back on and say that it played a big part of my life. I love knowing that once a week your show is always going to be there not forever obviously.

1366
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:03,000
But you have been at this for years and it means a lot to me. It means a lot to many of us. I'm certain that's ironic that. Yeah I swear I didn't like order these emails or only reading the good ones I swear.

1367
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I really look forward to hearing the podcast every week. So thank all of you for all that you do to keep this show going. I've said it before but I'll say it again. I've heard lots of podcasts but OLR is my home. You three are awesome people heart.

1368
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Can't wait to see the first twitch stream. Thank you so much Frodo that these nice comments that is that is the fuel that keeps it burning for a long time. So thank you guys so much.

1369
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:41,000
So there you go. No questions in those emails though just some very nice compliments a podcast plug that I'll have to check that out too. Yeah maybe I'll learn a thing or two about my pronunciation because I need to work on that for Japanese release dates.

1370
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Are you guys good at pronouncing things special pockets because I'm excited to learn. So any anyhow.

1371
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Justin is in our chat room that says can we stop acknowledging that OLR may someday end. It's making me think about my own mortality and I don't like it.

1372
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I had the honest honest to God. There was a point where I think we made a joke in an early episode. There's a song in the game pop and music which I know some of you know which I think I know across from the car freeze.

1373
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:23,000
But there's a song called 7 7 7. And it was said in an earlier episode. Oh well if OLR only keeps going until like 2019 you'll get to play 7 7 7 on episode 7 7 7.

1374
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:36,000
And I was like give me a break. We're not going to be here in 2019. But now I'm look I'm reevaluating only if you know I'm a part of your way. Some of my earlier words are coming back to haunt me a little bit.

1375
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And now you know maybe this whole twitch move and hopefully discovering some new people out there in twitch land. Maybe that's going to be the push we need to really move towards episode 1000 which again I always thought was like no fucking weekly show gets to a thousand.

1376
01:42:50,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Maybe if you do like three a week or something or multiples a week you might get to a thousand. No weekly show gets to a thousand. But I'm sitting here going you know we might get to a thousand Loki.

1377
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Or we ended at nine ninety nine and you never get that satisfaction of watching the odometer in nine ninety nine point one ninety nine point two. That's a good idea too. I like that.

1378
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:23,000
All right. Anyhow there you go. That's it for the mailbag tonight. I think it's time for us to get into some more news. But remember you can always email us participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

1379
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I should I should put that on the see ideas for next week. I should put the email address up there that maybe more people will use it off to do that. The right email address and we'll put the right email address with the right date. Yes I will do that. Meanwhile how about new games.

1380
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:59,000
All right. So there's this game called high tail which is being developed by a studio called high pixel and high pixel it will high pixel studio just to say high pixel is actually a team that runs this large Minecraft map.

1381
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:14,000
One of the world's biggest Minecraft servers and they've teamed up with right games to build this game called high tail and high tail as you may imagine since you know a lot of this is based around Minecraft is a Minecraft like game.

1382
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:30,000
So they had an announcement trailer looks very similar to Minecraft. Same kind of art style. It's going to be a voxel based game but there is also you know like kind of you know it's a little bit more geometrically pleasing.

1383
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Just all blocky. What's kind of unique about it though they did have an adventure mode that's going to have a full narrative with dungeons and boss fights and the single player campaign as well.

1384
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And of course they're also going to have the creative mode as well. And you'll be able to design your own levels and whatnot with some like really elaborate set of tools they were shown like you can even like stream videos and stuff into the game which is kind of cool.

1385
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So it's supposed to be set to release in 2019 on PC. So I guess we'll have to see what happens there. But it looks interesting. I'm interested in it because I dig Minecraft but I thought you know with Minecraft there's not a lot of structure as far as the story goes.

1386
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:33,000
So like kind of doing the survival mode stuff can kind of get boring if you're playing by yourself. And even with like mods sometimes it's just kind of I don't know it's hard to stay interested in it I guess. But this is pretty cool. So I'm willing to check it out when it comes out.

1387
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Yeah. You know as far as this Hypixel goes you know I've kind of been itching for something kind of like new in the Minecraft universe for a little bit like I really want that super 4K texture pack to come out.

1388
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I know haha 4K graphics in Minecraft but I mean like the water effects and everything else look really really good with all that. So I would like that to kind of you know give the game a kick in the pants and it just kind of feels like I don't know Minecraft's been around several years now.

1389
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:04,000
You know like it's ready to let's look at where's Minecraft 2 or what's next for Minecraft.

1390
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Well this almost seems like it could be like a Minecraft 2.

1391
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Exactly. That's what this kind of feels like is that all right if Microsoft isn't kind of jumping on it maybe we got another company. And I know Minecraft clones are a dime a dozen but you know you got some pretty big names behind this including huge Minecraft fans.

1392
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And you know obviously Riot Games which really I don't think they're known for anything really besides League of Legends. I mean they're not they may have other stuff they're not really known for anything outside of League of Legends. I'm sure they're itching to get outside of that box. So yeah this could be very interesting to see where it goes.

1393
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Yeah I'm curious to see as well so stay tuned. Keep an eye on it.

1394
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:48,000
It's Flee says in chat have they said anything about the 4k lately. No they announced it like two weeks ago and they never really dated it like you kept thinking it was getting close but then it like never actually happened.

1395
01:46:48,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Yyr in chat says 4k is the shiz. Yeah I can't wait too much. I mean I don't even need the 4k graphics. I mean my computer monitor I guess will handle it but certainly not on my Xbox One which I still have a crappy TV for but whatever right.

1396
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:23,000
So yeah I I'm trying to see real quick if they've mentioned anything better not in a while like if you look for the news and stuff like it's been quite some times they've really talked about when it's coming out like I see the last mention of it was kind of talking about a delay and that was like months ago.

1397
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Yeah my favorite comment though on this. What happened to the Minecraft SuperDuper graphics pack. It got super duper delayed.

1398
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:45,000
It sure did. Yeah. So here's the comments official comment. They said Minecraft developer here. The graphics team is still hard to work on this. It ended up being a ton more work than initially anticipated.

1399
01:47:45,000 --> 01:48:00,000
The graphics part of our engine is quite honestly simply not built for this. And when we tried to put all the new features piece by piece things went bad performance even on the Xbox One X was between bad and inconsistent during all of the internal play sessions we had.

1400
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:12,000
It will come but we don't have a release date yet. The gameplay team has been hard at work on update aquatic and the rest of the engine team has been working on the switch release just to give you an idea how fucking old this is.

1401
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Now the switchboard is out and going. I don't know. So they're still working on it. But makes me wonder though because like they have like high res texture packs since like you know Sonic ether is unbelievable shaders and shit like that.

1402
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It's on the Java version and it looks just like that. Why can't they do another console version. I don't know. Interesting. Seems like it'd be easier but maybe not.

1403
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Well some people are playing in four K. Some people are playing in VR VR is something that's growing of course as well. I know I'm still playing a little bit Tetris effect here and there.

1404
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Although I keep forgetting to check the weekend challenges. I just realized shoot yesterday came and went and I never went in and looked at the weekend challenge for Tetris effect. So bummer.

1405
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Well I keep forgetting to play the game altogether. You should get on that because it's seriously probably one of my favorite games that released this year. Totally.

1406
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:22,000
So anyway but as far as VR goes there's an ongoing dispute that was going on between ZeniMax and Facebook. Facebook of course owns Oculus and ZeniMax and Facebook finally settled this whole thing.

1407
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Which is interesting that there's a settlement because I thought there was a judgment already of five hundred million dollars. There was a judge that found that ZeniMax claims held merit and awarded a five hundred million judgment.

1408
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:42,000
It was halved on appeal. So I don't know if there's like an appeal to the appeal or what happens next. But yeah like for whatever reason they sat down in a room and they worked it out.

1409
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Of course we don't know. We don't know how much money they ended up getting out of the whole thing because of course terms of the settlement were not disclosed which is pretty customary.

1410
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:57,000
So CEO and chairman of ZeniMax Robert Altman said we are pleased that a settlement has been reached and are fully satisfied by the outcome.

1411
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:08,000
While we dislike litigation we will always vigorously defend against any infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties.

1412
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:19,000
And Facebook said we're pleased to put this behind us and continue building the future of VR. So I guess at least they don't have to worry about litigation holding things back.

1413
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:30,000
But of course we'll never know the good stuff so to speak. So all right. Well let's move on and we will get to the Skype line soon and I'll tell you a little bit more about that when we get there.

1414
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
We have a few more stories before we get there. So Loki what's up next.

1415
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:47,000
So as I alluded to earlier when we're talking about you know what these different platforms offer as far as developmental tools Epic has announced that they are offering services to help cross platform gaming.

1416
01:50:48,000 --> 01:51:00,000
So what they did is they are allowing launching their suite of cross platform services which is going to be available for PC Mac iOS Android PlayStation Xbox and Switch.

1417
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:14,000
And it's basically going to allow developers to use the same tools that they had for you know Fortnite that's going to be free for developers and will be open to all engines all platforms and all stores.

1418
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:24,000
They can be mixed the match says developers see fit and it allow them to basically aid in the cross platform play.

1419
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:36,000
So services including like cross platform log in IDing friends voice chat parties matchmaking data storage achievements etc.

1420
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:45,000
And that's pretty awesome that they offer that and they are not you know it's not something that's necessarily going to be locked down to their store.

1421
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:58,000
It's just like hey use this you know maker games better. So cool. I'm glad that's out there a little bit goodwill that they're putting out there.

1422
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Yeah. And this was kind of the thing I was alluding to at the top of the show we talked about what could their marketplace kind of give on others.

1423
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Although I think we kind of arrived at well since unreal is still making money off of steam games. It's not something they're going to really lock away but it definitely pushes this narrative that we saw you know Sony kind of resisting for a little bit.

1424
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:29,000
It's definitely kind of wondering so cross play is the future get on maybe the whole cross play thing though with you know being able to like log in and something that maybe you need an unreal account or an epic account to do that.

1425
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Wouldn't that be interesting. But I mean that's free. So it's not horrible but it's you know signing up for that newsletter so we can tell you about those sales.

1426
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:48,000
You can uncheck that. I guess it's interesting why we are in chat says sounds like it sounds like at least a sprinkling of the steam features that I mentioned earlier.

1427
01:52:49,000 --> 01:53:03,000
But see the thing though is that is something that you can also still use on steam because they're not locking it down to their stores. They're basically saying it's going to be available for you know all engines so you can use in unity any platform any storefront.

1428
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:23,000
So it's going to be kind of its own separate API type stuff. Neat. All right. Well let's move on and talk about Carmen San Diego coming to Netflix. Now you know if twitch muting wasn't a thing I would play that Rockefeller song right now but maybe Loki can give us a rendition.

1429
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:38,000
No. No I do. I tried everybody. I tried. All right. Anyway but I don't know who's looking forward to this. It looks like could be interesting. The Carmen San Diego series on Netflix is coming out January 19th 2019.

1430
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:49,000
So now there's some new images that are out there. Entertainment Weekly has a whole preview of the 20 episode series. So it's like an animated kids thing like half hour little bits and pieces.

1431
01:53:50,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It will be divided into two parts. Carmen's enigmatic past that led to the criminal career and the present day heists that take place around the world. Gina Rodriguez will be voicing Carmen San Diego and also will star in a live action film in 2019.

1432
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:22,000
So that's kind of that's pretty cool. I like to get the Carmen San Diego Cinematic Universe. Can we get like you know maybe all the other PBS edutainment like Cinematic Universe. You know we'll get like Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street reading Rainbow Square one television math net.

1433
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:37,000
It's all together. Yeah just one giant like a fighter game. Absolutely. Yeah absolutely. So yeah they released some screenshots and so forth. It kind of looks like this particular Web site is talking about it looks like an old flash animation which makes me think of like strong bad and things like that.

1434
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I don't know. I think it looks a little better than that. But yeah it could be it could be interesting to see those old games wrong Brad needs his own Netflix show. Yeah.

1435
01:54:48,000 --> 01:55:00,000
See it to bury in chat says it's a shame that Rita Moreno isn't going to continue being The Voice. She's still on another Netflix show. She's in that once upon a time reboot which I think has another season still coming and it's it's great.

1436
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I mean it has nothing to do with games but it's great. And if you're like oh but it's the 70s show reboot it's it's it's completely different. Like yes same character ideas they totally made it different.

1437
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:21,000
So that's where you can see Rita Moreno if you if you want to at least there's that. So Bobby Black Wolf and Chad says Carmen San Diego math net square one. They're all here.

1438
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Hey there's some really crazy ass rumors about DLC characters upcoming that they might all be from other series and stuff. So who knows. Who knows math. Yeah.

1439
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Oh sorry. See debris correct me it's one day at a time. Not once upon a time. I guess I'm thinking of the and the ABC series with all the Disney characters one day at a time.

1440
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Dar Tetsuya over in the twitch chat suggesting Oregon Trail the movie. I'm kind of surprised. I mean I'm sure they've done like westerns and more historically tilted pieces but I'm surprised they haven't done like the game the movie.

1441
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:09,000
You know what I mean. The Oregon Trail. Just make it a game show. How would that work. I don't know. The Oregon Trail game show. Yeah but you have to do like physical challenges to like not die.

1442
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And then you make do we for the river do it. Well I'm seeing debris points out Carmen San Diego and Oregon Trail both have card games now so you can you can make those life altering decisions in the card game.

1443
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:34,000
So there's that is that not not good enough for you. We should just mix the two decks together then we have where in the Oregon Trail is Carmen San Diego. Yeah I like that. That is good.

1444
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:48,000
We'll leave it at that with the catch up to her but we're going to die of dysentery. We don't let you move on and do a couple more stories and we're going to try to open up the Skype line. I say try because this part we haven't been able to test so well.

1445
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:58,000
So I'm a little worried it might not work. So we're going to try our best. If we aren't able to get Skype calls though I think we have some unused stories we get into a few more things we probably just talk about to buy us a little more time here tonight.

1446
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:13,000
But for now Loki with a few more stories for us. So apparently Charles Martin a voice of many things including one iconic character Super Mario.

1447
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:28,000
He has made a world record for the most times voicing a single character. So and when we reached for comment Charles Martin a said woohoo.

1448
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:48,000
So basically he's voiced Mario 100 times in 100 different performances. So a hundred times. Are there that many Mario games or like things that feature Mario. I guess maybe. Yeah. Did he do commercials for the cereal and that stuff. Maybe I guess it seems like a lot.

1449
01:57:49,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Kids won't eat that cereal. It's still sitting there. I'll eat it. Bring it over. Is it expired. I don't think I would eat it if it's stale. It's they eat some of the marshmallows and like these aren't as good as Lucky Charms. We're not eating this crap anymore.

1450
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I'm like but you had me buy that for you. What the hell. We want more fruit loops. Why we are in chat suggests I was going to say how is it only a hundred times. I don't know.

1451
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Well unfortunately there Mario shown up in more than 100 games but he's only been voice acted since what the end 64 era. Yeah. Yeah. And that was kind of barely at that. So although Mario never really talks in full sentences. It's always like you know.

1452
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Well yeah. Well it's just what that's what it is. Don't give me that look.

1453
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
All right.

1454
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Fine. Lastly he did. He did voices for Skyrim 2 which I'm on a meant Charles Martin who didn't do a voice for Skyrim.

1455
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I didn't hear Mario and Scott. Well maybe I haven't played the switch version so maybe he was in Skyrim.

1456
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:10,000
He's been in other games though. He was in a bit trip runner 3 Mario. I'm sorry. No Mario. Sorry runner 2. Yeah. And he's like even in the intro he's like this is Charles Martin and you're playing runner 2 or something like that.

1457
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:23,000
So he's he's shown up in other stuff. He doesn't just do Mario. OK. Yeah. All right. But I'm. Hey I think. Was he like an official representative of Nintendo or something. I thought he was. He should be by now. I think he was the early day.

1458
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:31,000
That's how he was found. Anyway let's move on and talk about lastly tonight our last official story tonight anyway that you'll see over on the lovely sidebar over there.

1459
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:43,000
The ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum if you're on this side of the pond. Many people notice that ZX Spectrum is getting a new game 30 years after it's been finished. That's right.

1460
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:54,000
It's a new game called Quadron a new developer a developer Andy Beal who goes by Cosmium online finished the game Quadron back in 1998.

1461
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:10,000
But the publisher that he was working with Palace Software kind of just left it behind. So there was no label and no future. So he ended up doing other stuff like he did theme park on the Sega Mega Drive the conversion there Sega Saturn racer called high octane.

1462
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:31,000
But I'm assuming some type of copyright or hold must have expired now that it's been 30 years. So this game Quadron which is kind of like robot on 2084 is now being released UK publication retro gamer reached out Andy Beal dug out the title and did a little tweaking little engineering.

1463
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:43,000
And now you can check it out. You can buy it if you want on itch.io for five bucks which apparently I didn't realize this itch.io has like a pretty big library of ZX Spectrum games.

1464
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:55,000
So that's kind of neat. So yeah classic computing you know I'm going to end the first twitch show officially anyway with a with a ZX Spectrum or a retro story that's for sure.

1465
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:07,000
So anyway I'm going to chat over at live.lognetwork.com which is now linked to our twitch chat. See it Tabiri says Mega Man ZX Spectrum Quadrant.

1466
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Why not. Why not do it that way. Let's do it. All right. I think it's time that we open up the Skype line. We're going to try this and it may or may not actually work.

1467
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:25,000
It may be a little bit flaw filled but we're going to try it and we're going to take your calls on our Skype line so you can go ahead.

1468
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:33,000
And those of you that are actually watching on twitch. Yes I am kind of rigging this up as we go. And that's how it's going to have to work this week.

1469
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:45,000
So they're coming up on the desktop not on my iPad. I don't know iPad or I want them on my iPad not the desktop. So let me quit on the desktop and see if that makes them roll over to the iPad.

1470
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:54,000
That's what I need. So yeah we're figuring this out live. So while I attempt to take a phone call Loki maybe you have a last minute story or a few that you want to get into.

1471
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Yeah we could talk about there was an Infinity Blade that was added to Fortnite because you know Epic made a game called Infinity Blade and apparently the Infinity Blade was too overpowered and ended up coming up in some tournaments and stuff like that and screwed with the balance of the game.

1472
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:19,000
So they have vaulted the Infinity Blade because it was too epic for the game and they're going to reevaluate and re balance it.

1473
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:37,000
I actually saw some gameplay of people playing with it and basically allowed you to destroy any sort of structure with like one hit. It was kind of ridiculous but basically the way it ended up is anybody that was able to get the Infinity Blade pretty much ended up winning the game.

1474
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:51,000
So that definitely needed to go. So that's the thing. I mentioned Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse so because that of course just came out in theaters.

1475
02:02:51,000 --> 02:03:14,000
But Sony wants you to preorder that digital copy when that's going to be coming out on the PlayStation storefront as well. So you can preorder that and if you do preorder that you also get a nice into the Spider-Verse skin the Miles Morales Spider-Man skin for your character in the Spider-Man game.

1476
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:23,000
So definitely check that out. Which by the way I'd like to mention if you haven't seen the movie yet there is a post credits scene that apparently is really awesome.

1477
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I did not stay for it because my kids would not want to stay that long past the credits but apparently is really awesome and involves Spider-Man 2099.

1478
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:42,000
But I wanted to see that but I didn't get to. I'll just have to wait for the digital version of the movie to come out before I actually get to see that unfortunately.

1479
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Questbuster over in the Twitch chat agrees the post credits scene was really good.

1480
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Oh man. I guess I'll just have to see the movie again. Which I do want to see it again. Just it's going to be a while. Can't see the kids again.

1481
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Still want popcorn in me.

1482
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Alright the Skype is still open. I see missed calls but I don't see current calls coming in. Like they're not ringing through.

1483
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:14,000
But you can see that people have tried to call but unfortunately it's not ringing through over to ye olde iPads.

1484
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Apparently Skype sucks.

1485
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I don't know if it's just the fact that my iPad is old which is certainly possible but for whatever reason it's not coming through with the calls.

1486
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,000
So that may be unfortunate. What can we do?

1487
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Going to chat. Tigerclaw says you gotta teach your kids to stay during the credits because they will miss out on the goodies.

1488
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I know but the problem was that they had to use the bathroom and so I'm glad that they at least survived through the movie.

1489
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:51,000
But you can't tell a four year old that sorry you can't go pee right now.

1490
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
We gotta wait to watch this funny bit of movie.

1491
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,000
And Bobby says kids wouldn't understand the goodies actually.

1492
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Let's do that. I'll just go see it by myself then. Again.

1493
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Any other last minute stories for us tonight?

1494
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Sadly Skype does not appear to be ringing through. This may be a bust tonight. It's one of those things I'm going to have to work on this week.

1495
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,000
It's alright. It can't be 100%.

1496
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Oh I wonder if I can use my phone. I'm going to try using my phone.

1497
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
There you go. The powers of your phone.

1498
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:30,000
There's apparently been a discovered game that's available through MAME now.

1499
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Sega Sonic Brothers. It's a puzzle game that kind of looks like columns or maybe even Puzzle Fighter a little bit.

1500
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:49,000
But it's like this. Yeah I can't really tell how it looks like.

1501
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Oh it looks like a little bit like maybe Puyo Puyo.

1502
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:57,000
But apparently it's some unreleased game that you can go check out if you want to play the other game.

1503
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I don't know where exactly they have this but I'm sure it's out there on the internet somewhere you can find it.

1504
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,000
They're doing a board game for Metal Gear Solid. That's pretty cool.

1505
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:17,000
The Metal Gear Solid by Emerson Matsuchi.

1506
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
And it's coming I guess from IDW Games.

1507
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:26,000
They're going to be demoing it at E3 2019.

1508
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
So hey you got something that's going to be at E3 since everybody else is skipping out on it.

1509
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:37,000
So check that out. I'm not sure that's going to be in the Konami booth.

1510
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:43,000
I would assume that's in some IDW Games booth but it looks neat.

1511
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I'm curious to see how you play it.

1512
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:51,000
But I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

1513
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I'll say this probably in GameStop someday.

1514
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
That's kind of a weird thing.

1515
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:59,000
They have since they carry a lot of this geek stuff now.

1516
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
There's a ton of fucking board games in that place.

1517
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
So I think I actually got the Skype thing to work.

1518
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:09,000
So if you don't mind I'm going to try to take a call.

1519
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1520
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Hey it's Brad from Pod Culture.

1521
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Hey it's working.

1522
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Hey I think it's working. I just have to make sure it's broadcasting to Twitch and they can hear him over there too.

1523
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
But I think it should be. What's on your mind Brad?

1524
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Oh just figured I'd call in on your first Twitch livestream there.

1525
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Well and yeah and the folks are confirming they hear it and I see the bars going up and down.

1526
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Well I can think of no better person to be one of our first callers here than one of our long time podcasting peers.

1527
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I know you guys sunsetted Pod Culture a little bit ago but I'm sure you'll come up with something new soon.

1528
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Oh there's already something in the works and stuff recorded for.

1529
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
That's how it works sometimes.

1530
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Well what's on your mind tonight? Anything in gaming that you want to talk about tonight?

1531
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Oh just figured I'd call and test the lines that you're having problems there.

1532
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Well I appreciate that.

1533
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Well we hear you. We hear you loud and clear. We're all good.

1534
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
So thank you for being the first kitty pig here on Twitch.

1535
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Which I can kind of show there. Brad is there live with us.

1536
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
He's captured in the phone.

1537
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
He's a man in a box. That's right. It's just like the Superman movies.

1538
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
It's like the Superman movies.

1539
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Oh my God. We totally need like a screen or something where we can have like the people just like right there on the desk.

1540
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:31,000
It's so much better than having to actually in the actual stream.

1541
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I just want them like on the desk talking you know.

1542
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Yeah like on old game shows or something.

1543
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,000
It's like Conan O'Brien and stuff with like the heads.

1544
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:45,000
If I'd been more prepared I'd have the lights set up better so you could see the studio.

1545
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:51,000
That's okay. You can you can barely see shit on my tiny little iPhone but there you go.

1546
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
It's fantastic.

1547
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:57,000
That's right. All right. There you go. All right. Brad take care. We're gonna try to get some other calls. Okay.

1548
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
All right. I'm glad it's working.

1549
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
All right. Take care buddy.

1550
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Peace.

1551
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:09,000
All right. That was our pal Brad who used to be with the show Pod Culture and I think we have another call coming right in.

1552
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:14,000
So what the hey we're going to get to this call too and see what is on this person's mind.

1553
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:20,000
And of course they hung up right as I answered it. So I have to keep plugging on plate.

1554
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
You know I have to keep doing this because of the ringtone.

1555
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I don't want the ringtone coming through while you're trying to talk about a story or something like that.

1556
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
So I have to do this.

1557
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Well it will work for now. It'll work for now.

1558
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
And I think the call is coming back in. We're going to try to take it this time.

1559
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,000
God damn it. Stop hanging up after you get through.

1560
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
All right.

1561
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I do like all the comments and chat about Brad being trapped in the box there.

1562
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Call Superman and all that stuff.

1563
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Tiger class says you can mute the ringtone. You can on desktop. Can you do it on mobile.

1564
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
If you can. That's news to me.

1565
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I thought that was a thing they that like you can't mute.

1566
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
We're learning about live right now.

1567
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:07,000
All right. Well the call's coming in one more time. I'm going to try to take this.

1568
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,000
So hopefully the person doesn't. They keep hanging up.

1569
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Maybe it's not connecting on the iPhone or something.

1570
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Well obviously it worked a second ago. It's true. It worked a second ago.

1571
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I don't know. All right. We'll see if anybody else gets through. I don't know.

1572
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:25,000
But it's Orange Laundry all one word on Skype and we'll try to take one or two more calls.

1573
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And then we'll we'll close up shop.

1574
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Well there is a new rhythm game called Rhythm Land that's coming to the Famicom and Mega Drive in Japan in 2019.

1575
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,000
And it's like Rhythm Heaven. It has four mini games.

1576
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Where you have to press a button in sync with music.

1577
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:50,000
And they have 20 songs and other surprises.

1578
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I like that it's on the Mega Drive.

1579
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Yeah. It's old school.

1580
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:01,000
It says apparently you can you can preorder that now on Amazon Japan for six thousand four hundred fifty eight yen.

1581
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,000
And it's going to be out February 15th.

1582
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
And they're also going to have a preorder up on Play Asia at some point.

1583
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I haven't been to in a while.

1584
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Probably going to regret going there.

1585
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Let's play Asia.

1586
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Oh yeah. Because they're like oh I want that and that and that.

1587
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Oh and then you start buying the whole house down that.

1588
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Yeah. It's a struggle.

1589
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
But it looks cool.

1590
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Like even on the cards are pretty awesome since they're going to be printing those and everything.

1591
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
They're running girl music baseball.

1592
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Melodian Shield Earth Crisis.

1593
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
It's like well game.

1594
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Let me answer this quick question from Jirama and chat kind of a technical question about our setup here.

1595
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Jirama wants to know is Skype on the computer you're at and connected to the mixer.

1596
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
So yes it's connected to the mixer.

1597
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
But here's the crazy part.

1598
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:57,000
So we can do the mixer into the computer here that is doing audio dedicated stuff.

1599
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
That works fine.

1600
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:04,000
That's how we were able to do the call with Bobby because we just did it on this computer here because we didn't need it to go out on Twitch for y'all.

1601
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:10,000
The problem is the audio from this computer when we try to hook it back in the mixing board it's coming through on crap quality.

1602
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
And I think it's because I either have some type of short.

1603
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
I don't think so though unless the short is in that little adapter.

1604
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:22,000
So I have to try getting a new one of those but I'm trying to get to try to get a RCA because I remember on the old mixing board you had like an RCA that went in.

1605
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
And that's like how we used to do it back in the day.

1606
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
So all right.

1607
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,000
So I guess we're going to close up Skype for now.

1608
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:35,000
We'll try we'll try harder to work on that next week and we won't imprison you in a box.

1609
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
I promise no promises.

1610
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,000
OK maybe no promises.

1611
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Maybe a small box.

1612
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Actually I would love to be able to take that on the iPad and then have you there.

1613
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
So all right.

1614
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Anyway I guess I guess that's it.

1615
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Are we are we.

1616
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Let's see.

1617
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I guess that's yeah that's unfortunately there's not a whole lot other news this week.

1618
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Worth mentioning I want to say.

1619
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:13,000
But I'm sure there'll be stuff next week that we get to check out.

1620
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I don't know.

1621
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Oh I was going to mention there is one thing I did read.

1622
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Apparently there do I think they opened up that beta for the Google streaming platform to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

1623
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:33,000
And if you do that between now and sometime in January that you can actually get Assassin's Creed Odyssey for free.

1624
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
They'll give you a copy of it.

1625
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
So that's something you're interested in checking out.

1626
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I mean you should probably check it out anyways because it sounds like a neat idea.

1627
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
But hey free game.

1628
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

1629
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
That's not bad.

1630
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Yeah for you.

1631
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Check that out.

1632
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I've been wanting to check that out too.

1633
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

1634
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
So yeah.

1635
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
And some folks are asking about the hardware.

1636
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
So I haven't really gotten into it yet because it's not final.

1637
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
But basically we're using we're using a Mac and a PC.

1638
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
It's a little bit of a buy a computer world here.

1639
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:08,000
So the Mac is dedicated to the video portion and everything you guys are seeing on Twitch.

1640
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
That's all handled over there.

1641
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
And it's going to be the more portable part.

1642
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
It's actually a Mac Mini.

1643
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
It's one of the new ones.

1644
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
So it's going to be the very portable part of our show.

1645
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,000
So when we're able to come to a convention near you which I hope will be a thing we can do.

1646
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Or cover more like local gigs.

1647
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
That'll kind of be our piece that moves around with it.

1648
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Now for when we're doing shows in house.

1649
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
We have kind of like a hybrid old computer with new stuff.

1650
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
And Rama has been very helpful in that whole process there.

1651
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:41,000
So that is going to be the part that for now is capturing audio.

1652
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
But I think that will move to the Mac long term.

1653
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Jamie and I have a plan on that.

1654
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:49,000
And then for this old computer it's going to be kind of the one thing that drops in the incidentals.

1655
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
So I can bring in more background music.

1656
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
More things like that.

1657
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,000
And I continue to send the signal out to the mixing board that way.

1658
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Plus I need a place to do my stories and to look at chat and all that stuff.

1659
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
So I've always kind of needed my own thing as well.

1660
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Just like how Loki has his laptop.

1661
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Because my laptop is probably older than this thing so it wouldn't work for something like that.

1662
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
So there you go.

1663
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I guess I can talk about one more story here.

1664
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Yeah.

1665
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
This was the whole.

1666
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I have a chat comment and then we'll close up.

1667
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
So there's this new Minecraft thing that's going on right now.

1668
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
This Paws and Claws pack.

1669
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So they're doing like a charitable thing.

1670
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
So they can't do 4K but they can do the charity.

1671
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Yeah they can do the charity.

1672
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:28,000
So it's going towards the World Wildlife Fund.

1673
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
And basically it's going to...

1674
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Any proceeds on the pack sold between now and December 11, 2021.

1675
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
So it's going to be going for quite a while.

1676
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,000
They're going to donate money towards that.

1677
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Or all the proceeds are going to be donated to that.

1678
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
And on top of that as an added incentive.

1679
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Microsoft's going to donate $100,000 once 10 million bamboo blocks have been placed in the game.

1680
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
So you get those blocks and you place them.

1681
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,000
And then once it ticks up to 10 million they're going to donate another $100,000.

1682
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
But I guess we have a long time for that.

1683
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Yeah.

1684
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
So alright.

1685
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
One other chat comment.

1686
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Tigerclaw wants to know our reaction to the Sonic the Hedgehog movie poster.

1687
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Which I forgot that was like all around the Twitters and all that this week was the reaction to the Sonic poster.

1688
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
It's in the theaters too.

1689
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Yeah there's the one in the dark that somebody lightened up and it was kind of like.

1690
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:27,000
It was probably like when you saw us on Twitch for the first time and what we really looked like.

1691
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:30,000
It was like you know it was kind of a very gross reaction.

1692
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
No I'm kidding.

1693
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
But Sonic the Hedgehog lightened up and that poster was kind of scary looking.

1694
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,000
And then there's that other weird poster with like his legs up in the air.

1695
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
That's the one that's in theaters.

1696
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Oh is it?

1697
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Yeah it's interesting.

1698
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:44,000
They had it in the main lobby in the theater they went to this weekend.

1699
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
And I mean I don't know.

1700
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
It's supposed to be a kids movie right?

1701
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Yeah but.

1702
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
It's for kids but adults will get it.

1703
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Like is that kind of where they're going with it?

1704
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I don't know.

1705
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I'd be curious to see what it looks like but.

1706
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I don't know.

1707
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I I'm interested to see how it goes.

1708
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I'll leave it.

1709
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
That's probably the nicest way I could put it.

1710
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
I'm interested to see.

1711
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
I like Jim Carrey.

1712
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I'll go see it because Jim Carrey is in it.

1713
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I mean.

1714
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
But.

1715
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Yeah.

1716
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Yeah.

1717
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
But I'll tell you this much.

1718
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
You know going back to Spider-Man again.

1719
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,000
So Spider-Man's actually into the Spider-Verse was done by the same guys that did the Lego movie.

1720
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
And.

1721
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Oh God was the other movie that they did was also really good.

1722
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I don't remember the other movie that they worked on as well but.

1723
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
All the movies that they've done have been fantastic.

1724
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Too bad they aren't making the Sonic movie because then that would be pretty awesome but.

1725
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
No.

1726
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I'm down for the Lego movie too.

1727
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
It comes out in February 14th.

1728
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
All right.

1729
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Well I think it's about time to get final thoughts and close up our very first Twitch episode.

1730
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Which was a little shorter.

1731
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Sometimes this show runs 3 hours.

1732
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Tonight it was probably what maybe like 2 hours 50 minutes.

1733
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Yeah well I mean it's you know.

1734
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
All the winner breaks are going to start next week.

1735
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
And we just had all the big game releases.

1736
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
So it is starting to slow down a little bit.

1737
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
But I feel like we still have some substantial stuff to talk about.

1738
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:07,000
And obviously we're thrilled that those of you guys came out to join us on Twitch tonight.

1739
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
And this is the new norm.

1740
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
So this is going to be.

1741
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Well I mean things will get the Skype stuff working and there will be other upgrades here and there.

1742
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
But the good news is it can only go uphill from here.

1743
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
So that's going to be what we're working on.

1744
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
So be prepared for some more streams throughout the week.

1745
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Just some random stuff.

1746
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
If you're not already following us here at VOG Network.

1747
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Please consider doing that.

1748
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Because we're going to be doing more like streams throughout the week.

1749
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Because we want to try to hit that affiliate status.

1750
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
So that you know we can get all the perks that come with that.

1751
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Partner might be a little harder.

1752
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
But because you have to stream a lot for that.

1753
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
But you know we'll see.

1754
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Who knows.

1755
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
We get enough shows that want to be a part of this.

1756
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Who knows.

1757
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Who knows what is possible.

1758
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:46,000
We'll see.

1759
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
So but thank you guys again for showing up.

1760
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I hope you enjoyed it.

1761
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I hope everything you wanted and more to watch the show being done.

1762
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
And for the podcast listeners I hope you guys really kind of felt that not a lot really changed.

1763
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
You're still getting the same audio that you're used to.

1764
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Except you don't get to see my reaction and my playing up to the camera.

1765
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
That's the one thing that you're missing.

1766
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,000
So which I guess I'm already seeing clips come through with some of that.

1767
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
So that'll be that'll be pretty cool to look at that later.

1768
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
So all right.

1769
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
It's time to get final thoughts.

1770
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Thank you guys as always for listening to the show.

1771
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
If you enjoyed what you heard leave us a five star review on iTunes Google Play on Twitch.

1772
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
You can't really review things on Twitch.

1773
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:20,000
But tell your friends.

1774
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
That's all we ever ask.

1775
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
We're not begging for your money.

1776
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
All we ask is that you tell a friend or two about the show.

1777
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1778
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,000
But we can only you know spread spread those get more voices here if they're being brought to us.

1779
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
So we really appreciate all of that.

1780
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,000
So I guess I'll let you start with an actual final thought tonight Loki.

1781
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:43,000
So I'm going to hopefully be streaming some more this week.

1782
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I'm maybe doing fifth mix.

1783
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I'm hoping they'd be doing set mania very soon since I have the whole set up.

1784
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Most the hardware portion of that I think is out of the way and hopefully I'm not going to have any hitches with that.

1785
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:01,000
So I'm hoping to get that set up sooner than later.

1786
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Really just the theme right now is holding me up.

1787
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,000
But then once I I picked out some songs I need to put steps to and stuff that I want to do.

1788
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:13,000
The problem is like I saw there's this skin that they have for pump it up called rave it out.

1789
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
That's really elaborate and I like it.

1790
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I can adapt that unfortunately to work for what I need to do but I'd like to do something similar to that just because they have it like where when you're selecting your song and actually plays like a video preview with the background video looks like and that's just really fucking cool.

1791
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
I just don't know how feasible that's going to be.

1792
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:45,000
And then also I need to make sure it's running smoothly because all of the ones I've seen like even the DDR ace the 2014 stuff that just it's it's not smooth enough for what I want.

1793
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I want it to be like buttery smooth and it should be on the hardware that I'm running.

1794
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:52,000
So we'll see.

1795
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,000
So yeah I'm hopefully going to do that and hopefully play some more games this week.

1796
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
All right.

1797
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:04,000
My final thought for tonight is I'm excited to exhale that we got through the first video show and it worked.

1798
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
And I'm just very psyched about all that.

1799
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:11,000
And I'm really I taught myself how to use stuff like light works and movie editing software that I never thought I'd use.

1800
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I taught myself how to use all that this week and that was it was awesome.

1801
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:19,000
And again I guess here at the end did you make the fancy vogue thing or is that by.

1802
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
No I think code man did that a while ago we actually lifted that.

1803
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
But the whole.

1804
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
See it's not on the podcast but the whole.

1805
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,000
You can't do that on television inspired thing which yes I do play.

1806
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
I sat down.

1807
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:40,000
We were at a restaurant with Alan and Jamie and I were all at a restaurant with that whole idea like to do that came up because it's the thing that Dragon Con TV has done as well.

1808
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
So we just started spitting out all these ideas.

1809
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Obviously I can't repeat them now because we're going to use them in the future.

1810
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:51,000
But I'm like oh I got so many ideas but I use light works to make that as well and some of the other little things that you see here.

1811
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
So I need to do stuff like that.

1812
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:58,000
And we'll also like I need to go into like cinema 40 and stuff because I need to make.

1813
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I need to make videos stuff for my semi skin.

1814
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Yeah.

1815
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
At least I'd like to do that.

1816
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Let's be honest I mean I don't want to overcomplicate things like I do with everything I do.

1817
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:17,000
But the nice thing is I mean I can't do with a three hour show I can't do the level of B roll that like Bobby is doing on his show.

1818
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I think I mean we can do some but we can look into you know this nice little thing makes it really easy to just drop in video.

1819
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Like as long as I kind of have it on here ready to go like it's really easy to drop in video and keep talking over it and all that stuff.

1820
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Yeah.

1821
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:35,000
So you know that's something we can look at doing in the future is not necessarily just going to be our ugly mugs on stream the entire time.

1822
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
But do we get other stuff.

1823
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Yeah we can do that.

1824
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Oh you don't take it offline.

1825
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
You know what else I did.

1826
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Yeah.

1827
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
In light works the classic game of the week thing.

1828
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Yeah.

1829
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:47,000
For the first time when you were watching on Twitch you got to see the game that she was talking about.

1830
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I did that online works.

1831
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:54,000
So of course learning credit to also I think then Jason used to put stuff like that and he did.

1832
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,000
You know this isn't necessarily our first foray into video.

1833
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:06,000
We were on Justin TV a long long time ago with the simulcast which talked about the top of the show VX Jason X to be or simply Jason if you will who is our continuing voiceover guy.

1834
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:13,000
He's done more for the show than you guys could possibly imagine especially when it comes to being able to download the podcast in the first place.

1835
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:18,000
But yeah Jason also for a short time was putting these shows on YouTube.

1836
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I mean it was just kind of like the picture with the audio but then like he'd go in and spice it up.

1837
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
He'd be put in some of the classic of the week over it.

1838
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:29,000
He when we did a list list he did a whole little thing where he actually showed it on there.

1839
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
So he tried to make it a little more exciting.

1840
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:37,000
But you know now that video is getting easier and easier and cheaper more importantly to self produce.

1841
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I think you know this is something that we can kind of keep doing on Twitch and you know have the audio here and all that.

1842
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
So pretty cool.

1843
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Anyway I guess that's it.

1844
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I think we're done right here.

1845
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
So we'll see you next time.

1846
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Thanks again for coming out tonight.

1847
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:56,000
You know and we did our very first show ever on my 365.

1848
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,000
We had 12 people show up and we had we had a few more tonight.

1849
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
So that was great.

1850
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
It wasn't hundreds and hundreds.

1851
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:07,000
But it feels really good especially we see a lot of old faces from the past and some new faces too.

1852
