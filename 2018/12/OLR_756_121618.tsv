0	30000	Orange Lounge Radio With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
30000	60000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 756 for this December the 19th of 2018. I am Rob Roberts. He is Techmaster Loki.
60000	68000	It's a big move over from Shoutcast where we've been for, and some people don't realize this, we've been on Shoutcast for 16 and a half years.
68000	69000	That's a long time.
69000	81000	A varying degrees of Shoutcast and now we are on Twitch, which is a big move. Well, it's not, I mean, as Jason kind of referenced in the intro there, it's not really like the first time that we're on Twitch because we did the Justin TV, the precursor thing.
81000	82000	Right.
82000	86000	We did like the simulcast, but it was really like, I don't even know if any clips are still out there on our old.
86000	97000	I don't remember. I just remember playing games on like the TV while we were doing the show. So we had something to actually display, but I don't remember. We didn't film anything, did we?
97000	100000	I sort of vaguely remember it.
100000	115000	It was on, it was on Justin TV. I mean, we were doing like a simulcast, but it was really like, it was like you would just have the static camera there and you weren't really getting like the actual mixing board audio that you're getting through this new setup that we have here.
115000	123000	It would just be like our hollow voices in the garage and you couldn't even hear the Skype callers or anything like that. But this whole transition has been a process.
123000	131000	But I really do think it's it's the right move for Orange L'Ange Radio, probably one, admittedly, we probably should have made about two years ago, maybe, maybe sooner back.
131000	139000	But I'm happy we're here and hopefully going to get some new faces here checking out the show and yeah, talking, talking about the news and everything.
139000	146000	So where do we begin? Well, shout out, of course, to Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers. Usually this is a three host show.
146000	154000	But a little while back, Dark Soccer had a conflict with her day job. So she actually works on Sunday nights right now. So unfortunately she can't be here. She should be back here full time in February.
154000	156000	Not that she's going to be on camera or anything.
156000	157000	Yeah, it is the show.
157000	159000	She'll be behind the camera.
159000	163000	It is the show where every gamer has a voice, not necessarily a face.
164000	169000	But, you know, we respect that. Like there's a lot of people that can be I think our community has always been very welcoming.
169000	174000	And every experience I've had on Twitch has been really cool. Like, you know, I have a personal channel over at Rob Roberts.
175000	181000	Cheap plug. But, you know, every experience I've had has been really cool. And I haven't had a lot of like, you know, weirdo people.
181000	186000	But I totally respect like she don't want to be on camera or any guests that we have here, because I was actually asked that question randomly.
186000	187000	Like, are you gonna make your guests be on camera?
187000	193000	No, I'm not going to make anyone do anything. If you want, we'll have Pikachu dance and to you as you talk.
193000	198000	And that will be that will be what it is. And yeah, we'll work with that.
198000	205000	So. All right. And of course, we are in chat as we usually are over at our Twitch TV channel.
205000	208000	You still can access everything over at live.voggenetwork.com.
208000	213000	Of course, we want you to still check out VOG Network and all the other great shows that make up the Voice Geese Network.
213000	219000	The live ones like Bobby, Anime Jam Session and the non live ones as well. Hooked on Bond, Electricista Hood, Gamers Gone.
219000	221000	Wow. The list goes on and on. Check it all out.
221000	226000	And and some folks giving some feedback on some of the voices right now over.
226000	231000	I guess I'm sounding a little low, but you're something a little high, but I'm looking at the recording and everything seems OK.
231000	235000	I think the positioning of the mic and now now I can show this to you.
235000	238000	You could see I've been tired about must be up on your face.
238000	242000	The mic has to be up in your face because when it's not like look, if I put it just a little bit away.
242000	246000	My audio like really drops. So it's really.
246000	249000	Yeah, the distance is very important, but we're working on that.
249000	257000	I know you can do things with gain and other stuff. It's a brand new mixing board, a brand new computer that's dedicated to the video end of things.
257000	262000	Whereas we were going to have an upgraded computer that works with some of the things so I can do stories and all that.
262000	270000	But yeah, lots, lots and lots of changes here at Orange Dawn Studio, but a lot staying the same, you know, for folks that aren't able to participate live on Sunday nights
270000	275000	and aren't able to come now see what fat, middle aged men we actually are doing this show.
275000	282000	I'm not as fat. That's true. I'm still very middle aged, but I'm not as fat as I was.
282000	285000	And I've been working on it. I've been closing all my ring. I've lost a few pounds.
285000	290000	Although I must say the last month has been a little bit on the eased side of things.
290000	295000	I haven't been as strict and I've been. The holidays, things are going to happen. What can you do?
295000	300000	They have the 12 days of snacking at work. So, you know, I have to have the 12 days of snacking.
300000	305000	So I have to have the 12 days of snacking. You know what I'm going to ask after last week's show, are you snacking on broccoli?
305000	309000	Are you mixing in the broccoli? No, it's a popcorn. It's all been popcorn this week.
309000	313000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com in our Twitch room.
313000	316000	It's going to take me a little while to get over some of these things I've been saying for years.
316000	321000	But VG realness says this is such an exciting moment. And I agree, it is an exciting moment.
321000	327000	And I want to give a shout out quickly to Bobby Black Wolf. You know, you guys all know who he is at this point.
327000	332000	But everything that you see on Twitch, I know on the podcast, you know, let me kind of describe what's going on.
332000	337000	But you actually can see now what we're going to be talking about and what we're talking about right now.
337000	342000	Kind of like I think some shows only ESPN do this. I mean, I don't really do the whole sports thing very often.
342000	348000	Drag Race doesn't do this. I couldn't tell you. But like, you know, the nightly the 24 hour news ticker.
348000	353000	And that's what we have at the bottom. We have that whole, like, you know, glorious headline down at the bottom.
353000	359000	But not only is it pulling in top headlines from a variety of different websites, but it'll actually say, like, here's my Twitter.
359000	366000	Here's my personal channel. And so that way we're not disturbing the podcast listeners every few seconds with,
366000	370000	thanks for the follow. Thanks. We do want to acknowledge new followers. That's all acknowledged down here.
370000	374000	So you still get and we'll give you a shout out at the end after we're done with the recording.
374000	379000	And, you know, because we we really appreciate the follows. We're trying to work our way to Twitch affiliate status.
379000	383000	You guys have been we we were 50 followers in before we even went live tonight.
383000	389000	So like that the hardest thing you have to do already done. So thank you guys very much for all your support of the show.
389000	393000	Like it means so much and has made this very, very exciting.
393000	399000	Quest Buster over in the Twitch chat room says we'll also see the awesome food brought in from time to time.
399000	405000	I already ate it. Sorry, it was subway. It was it was it was not great.
405000	409000	I was just it's because I had Pete. Well, I didn't really have pizza.
409000	415000	They had like a piece of pizza and like a breakfast sandwich, both both parts of meals that my kids didn't need.
415000	424000	So I have that. And so I was like, well, you know, I should probably just get like a subway sandwich so that it's somewhat low calorie.
424000	430000	So I did that and I hated it. But it's what I eat every day.
430000	435000	It's just it's not the same subway. It's like I have a particular subway that I go to like my work routine.
435000	440000	So there's one that it's on the way of the show here and they don't get it right.
440000	445000	It's just the people near my work. They know what I order every day. It's the same thing.
445000	450000	And it's just like they. Oh, yeah, you haven't usually. Yeah, sure. OK. And then these make it and it's great.
450000	455000	I love some of these cars. We get a few more of these chat comments and then I want to quickly reintroduce the show a little bit.
455000	460000	But I hope I see your name right. I'm sorry. Oh, Tejero asks, is it sunny there?
460000	463000	I'm sorry if I butchered your name. No, it's actually raining.
463000	466000	And now now my fear is, is the power going to go out during our first show?
466000	469000	Because that would know that would be a hoot. It's not windy. It's just raining.
469000	474000	OK, well, that's good. That makes me feel a little bit better. And K Arts one over in Twitch wants to know.
474000	481000	So now that we have video SimCity action news reenactment, when? Careful what you ask for over on.
481000	490000	Did you notice we did a little something something over on Twitch, a little little just a little something and a little little something that wasn't in the podcast, but just like a little extra little bumper.
490000	496000	I hope to do more things like that. Silly little pre-shows. And that part of that is inspired, inspired by a variety of things.
496000	503000	But probably primarily when I do Rocky or a picture show over at The Colonial, they do pre-shows to get the audience hyped up.
503000	510000	And they'll show things like they show the the rock band Snack Bar that's like we have all your fucking money and like it's really funny.
510000	515000	I think it's from Adult Swim or something. I don't know. They show it. It's hilarious. They'll show like a Tim Curry music video, gets everybody hyped up.
515000	519000	There's an infamous one of John Waters and he's saying, don't smoke inside the theater.
519000	524000	And he takes a big puff on a cigarette like, don't you wish you could be enjoying this right now, but don't be an asshole.
524000	528000	It's great. It's an infamous clip out there. But anyway. All right. Let's talk about video games. We're going to get into it.
528000	531000	I'm going to ask Loki to kick it off with this story about Discord.
531000	536000	But first, I do want to reintroduce the show since it is kind of like the first show over on Twitch.
536000	541000	And there might be some new people checking out for the first time either here or in the archives.
541000	548000	Hello, we are Orange Town Radio. Our first broadcast was June 23rd, 2002, and we decided to put this show together.
548000	555000	Myself, Dark Sakura and Loki joined us from day one because we all met playing a little video game called Dance Dance Revolution.
555000	561000	So music games are still near and dear to our hearts. We met playing Dance Dance Revolution and other music games.
561000	565000	Like I was always into Bust a Move or Groove, depending on which side of the ocean you're on.
565000	571000	Or Parappa the Rappa was a huge thing for me, too. You know, we got into all types of music games.
571000	578000	And, you know, then we kind of shifted into covering more general games because music games were kind of fading a little bit.
578000	583000	And then right when we make the move to covering all the games, Guitar Hero comes out.
583000	587000	And music games are all the rage again. But that's alright because we love all games.
587000	589000	We always have a fondness in our heart for music games.
589000	592000	It's okay because Activision killed it really quickly, too.
592000	597000	That's right. Actually, the thing went offline not that long ago. It's very sad.
597000	605000	But also, you know, the whole thing we envisioned is that when we used to play DDR, we used to go to the diner right across from the arcade.
605000	610000	And we used to just sit around, you know, eating unhealthy things like mozzarella sticks and so forth.
610000	614000	And we'd sit at the table and we would just talk about, like, did you hear what they're doing with that game?
614000	617000	Or what's going on with, you know, your Soulcalibur character?
617000	621000	And I fought your character in that one mode that everybody used to play as Soulcalibur at the arcade.
621000	623000	Was that, like, Conquest or something like that?
623000	626000	Yeah, something like that. And so, you know, we always just sit around and talk about that.
626000	632000	And we wanted to kind of, like, bring that to a virtual space where everybody, no matter where they are, can kind of join in at the diner table with us.
632000	638000	So, you might want to eat a little healthier, though, so get your broccoli sticks and join us.
638000	642000	And, yeah, while we talk along what's going on in gaming news.
642000	648000	But we are going to get into, for our long-time listeners, they're waiting for, let's do it, let's get into this week's news.
648000	649000	So what are we going to start off with tonight?
649000	659000	We'll talk about, since last week we talked a little bit about the Steam store and how they kind of decided to tweak their revenue split with publishers.
659000	664000	Especially publishers that sell over, like, 10 million copies of a game.
664000	670000	So they're going to give you a little bit more money, like 25%, if you happen to even get close to that.
670000	679000	Then, of course, to rebut that, Epic Games Society said that they're going to put out their own game store.
679000	689000	And they're going to give you 88% of the revenue, because that's better than the 30% that they're taking on the Steam store.
689000	698000	And then Discord's like, but we'll give you 90%, and 90% is better than 88%.
698000	704000	And so, of course, that's what they're doing now, because with yet another game launcher.
704000	710000	Because you remember, you know, Discord is now offering some games through their storefront, or they have a storefront, I think.
710000	711000	I've never actually explored it, but...
711000	712000	I have a little bit.
712000	716000	Discord, you know, and I've talked about this on a previous show, like, Discord is doing a lot of things right right now.
716000	723000	And I'm not on a payroll or anything, but it was incredibly smart that they gave this thing that, you know, people were paying for with TeamSpeak and Slack.
723000	727000	They were giving it away for free, and then they just kind of, you know, started to subtly slip in there.
727000	732000	Hey, we noticed what games you play, and we're just going to start showing you headlines for all these games you play.
732000	734000	Oh, and here's all your friends they're playing.
734000	738000	And for streamers, it's great, because if I'm streaming, people see that, right, in their Discord.
738000	740000	And I love that, as a streamer, right?
740000	744000	Except, sadly, since this is tied to the VoG network, nobody may know.
744000	745000	Well, I'll just have to...
745000	751000	I'll have to promote OLR other ways, such as through the VoG network Discord, available at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
751000	752000	Bing.
752000	755000	Anyway, but, you know, promote that way.
756000	763000	But then it was like, oh, hey, wouldn't you like us to scan your computer, find all your games, and have a game launcher all in one place?
763000	765000	It's like, oh, sure, why not, you know?
765000	768000	And now it's, oh, by the way, now we have a store, so you can add to that.
768000	770000	It's, like, very interesting how they built that.
770000	776000	But, yeah, and now if you subscribe to their thing, you get some free games, which is another, like, huge...
776000	779000	You know, obviously we know, like, Humble has the monthly bundle.
779000	783000	We have Discord is in on that.
783000	784000	Twitch gives away games.
784000	786000	Twitch, Epic Games Store is giving out games.
786000	790000	Yeah, PlayStation and Xbox have been doing it forever, so...
790000	792000	Subnautica is free on Epic Games Store.
792000	794000	Yeah, so, love it.
794000	799000	Anyway, yeah, so, is this gonna be a good thing?
799000	805000	I mean, how low can you go as far as how much of the revenue is gonna be taken out of this?
805000	811000	I think that's about as low as you can go without actually just saying, hey, you can put them on there for free.
812000	814000	We don't wanna make any money from it.
814000	816000	Are they still gonna be curating some of the content in there, though?
816000	823000	Because that would be my concern, is that are we just gonna get, like, you know, all sorts of questionable things like we've seen on Steam?
823000	824000	Well, yes.
824000	825000	Garbage games.
825000	834000	They are gonna be curating it, so they kind of described it as basically a boutique bookstore of game stores.
834000	841000	So they're not gonna necessarily open the floodgates to everything like Steam did.
841000	844000	But it's gonna be a little bit more curated, I guess.
844000	853000	PixelPaka is in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, says, people can sell on itch.io without giving away revenue, any revenue to Twitch itch.io.
853000	858000	However, it means the developer has to deal with the PayPal, et cetera, transaction fees.
858000	860000	Which, again, I just gave the old address.
860000	863000	But luckily, live.vognetwork.com forwards to the new Twitch.
863000	864000	Right.
864000	866000	Because I'm gonna say the old one a lot tonight, sorry.
866000	873000	And itch.io, it's a decent way to do that as well, but it's more, it's not so much, I don't know how they promote stuff on itch.io.
873000	878000	If it's actually, like, they don't really, I think, have a storefront where it shows you a bunch of stuff.
878000	882000	It's more of just, it's a place that you can put up your storefront.
882000	889000	Kind of think of it like a mall, a shopping mall that you can put your own kiosk up to sell your game.
889000	899000	It's not necessarily gonna be like, you know, Steam where they're, well, maybe Steam's a bad comparison because they're not necessarily doing anything to promote your game either.
899000	901000	Except burying it under crap.
901000	904000	I don't know. Sure, why not?
904000	912000	You know, competition is good because competition's how you get down from, you know, taking 70% of your revenue home to 90%.
912000	914000	So, why not?
915000	925000	I wanted to go to the email, our mailbag. I don't usually do it this early in the show, but we got a really good email from somebody whose viewpoint I really respect on this, so I want to get to it.
925000	929000	If you want to email our show, you can. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
929000	937000	I know in the last episode I threatened to take it away, but we got some good emails this week, and as long as you guys continue to use it, we'll still use it too.
937000	939000	We won't have to punish you this time.
939000	940000	What?
940000	941000	So we won't have to punish you this time.
941000	946000	Yeah, no punishment this week, which is a bummer because All Stars 4 Star...oh, another time.
946000	956000	For those that don't know, if you're new on Twitch, I always threaten if we do not get emails, I use that time that we dedicate to emails to give you a RuPaul's Drag Race recap of what's going on.
956000	958000	Which is great because I don't watch any of it, so...
958000	960000	My favorite television show.
960000	961000	I totally need to be recapped on all of it.
961000	963000	Three words. Brown cow stunning.
963000	965000	Alright, anyway, let's get to the emails.
965000	972000	Hello LR, I figured I'd pop a message over to the old outdated mailbag for old outdated people because why not?
972000	974000	And you can tell this is coming from YYR from that tone.
974000	982000	Regarding the Persona 5 character that was added to Smash, maybe Persona 5 isn't on Switch yet, but let's face it, it's 99% guaranteed to happen.
982000	986000	Persona 1 through 4 all got releases on dedicated portable gaming consoles.
986000	991000	Persona 3 portable on PSP and Persona 4 Golden on Vita both sold well.
991000	994000	Are they really not going to release 5 on Switch?
994000	997000	I don't gamble much, but even I'd bet on this happening.
997000	1002000	I think it's probably going to happen to, it's just a matter of when, but we'll see.
1002000	1009000	Alright, obviously I didn't skip to the email to read that part, but I want to acknowledge all of YR's perspectives, but let's get to this next part.
1009000	1015000	Regarding the Epic Games Store, and now the Discord Store, offering bigger shares to their developers.
1015000	1018000	Actually, I'm not upset about this at all.
1018000	1021000	It only goes to show that you get what you pay for.
1021000	1023000	Would I like to get more than 70% of the revenue?
1023000	1027000	Sure, but for that 18% or 20% difference, 1.
1027000	1034000	My games support integrated leaderboards, a critical feature in score attack games like mine, and I don't have to run any servers.
1034000	1042000	2. My games support Xbox One, 360, DualShock 4, Switch Pro, and Steam controllers, and all I had to do was implement one of those.
1042000	1046000	3. My games have achievements for those who enjoy chasing them.
1046000	1050000	4. My games support cloud saving, even for Windows to Mac and Mac.
1050000	1058000	5. My games can't be copied or pirated willy-nilly, because they can detect whether they're running through the Steam client, and can quit if they're not.
1058000	1067000	6. Steam support has gotten back to me very quickly when I've encountered any issues, and they've been very thorough when reviewing my builds.
1067000	1071000	If I released my games anywhere else, they'd have none of this or close.
1071000	1076000	The price difference is justified in my opinion. My customers get more and I get more.
1076000	1081000	Now, if Epic and Discord can offer comparable service in the future, that'd be awesome. I hope they do.
1081000	1087000	But if not, then dollars aren't everything. You know what is? The experience that I can deliver to my players.
1087000	1090000	And right now, on Steam, it's better.
1090000	1097000	What do you think about that perspective from YYR? Because I'll admit, when I first heard this story, I was like, oh, more money for indie developers. They're going to love that.
1097000	1107000	But as YYR is kind of outlining these things like leaderboards, online, controllers, a lot of things that make it easier, it kind of did make me go, oh, that's interesting.
1107000	1116000	Well, I know Epic's doing stuff for online. They have, I think, some APIs that they're putting out to help with cross-platform play and stuff.
1116000	1126000	I'm sure because these storefronts are a lot newer than Steam, that maybe some of that stuff is forthcoming, but we'll have to wait and see.
1126000	1137000	It's more of just at least there's options out there. And if anything, maybe it puts a little bit of pressure on Steam to consider maybe increasing the revenue share that developers get.
1137000	1145000	So that can be bad. But ultimately, it's going to be just up to you where you decide you're releasing your game with what's more important to you.
1145000	1151000	Do you want a few additional percentage points in your revenue or do you want all these other features?
1152000	1159000	VG Realness comments, I guess Steam has the right to essentially charge you for this service as they are providing you more than competitors.
1159000	1166000	Good point. But do you think that Steam will still kind of cave in to some of this pressure?
1166000	1173000	I mean, remember, we heard about some of the changes they were doing to their store, but this was before Epic made their move and now Discord's making their move.
1173000	1183000	Do you think Steam is going to feel some social pressures of sorts to drop that percentage down, which honestly could have a big impact on a company that isn't exactly releasing a lot of games?
1183000	1184000	No.
1184000	1185000	Their bread and butter is Steam right now.
1185000	1186000	I don't think they're actually going to have...
1186000	1194000	Mostly. HTC Vive, I know somebody will say it, but VR. But, you know, there are other things they get into, but let's be real, the bulk of it right now is Steam for them.
1194000	1204000	No. I don't think so. Because I think a lot of, right now, there isn't a lot of games leaving the storefront to go strictly to the Epic Game Store.
1204000	1210000	There's a couple indie games that are exclusive on the Epic Game Store right now, but it's not going to make or break them.
1210000	1213000	I think they're making so much money from it right now.
1214000	1223000	They haven't done crap for that platform at all, as far as fixing a lot of these problems with all these games just being on there.
1223000	1228000	Fake games or Bitcoin miners disguised as games and all of that.
1228000	1238000	And, of course, now with loot boxes and the gambling and stuff, now they've made Counter-Strike into a free-to-play game.
1238000	1247000	They're just making money from all sorts of avenues. I don't think they really care right now until it makes a significant impact, and then they'll make a change. But, no.
1247000	1254000	I'm so curious to see if there is going to be any type of counter-response, but, I mean, you lay something out, good stuff out there.
1254000	1263000	Not to spoil something that's coming up later, but it happens inevitably, but we know that, you know, because the Epic Store is affiliated with Unreal Engine and all of that,
1263000	1274000	I know YYR gives a lot of props to some of those things built in with Steam, but it seems like the relationship between Epic and Unreal is going to provide some of that as well.
1274000	1279000	Like, there's going to be perks to releasing on the Epic Store because of things in the Unreal Engine.
1279000	1283000	I mean, I guess you could take anything in the Unreal Engine and put it on Steam or what have you, right?
1283000	1284000	Yeah, you can.
1284000	1290000	Do you think Epic might wall some of that for things that are just their store, or are they going to try to sail through that on cost?
1290000	1300000	I don't think that they're going to do that right now. I mean, they're not walling off anything, because I think that, you know, they're trying to get people on that storefront.
1300000	1307000	I don't think they would just all of a sudden start breaking the engine or, like, walling things off to that one storefront.
1307000	1316000	But, I don't know what they necessarily offer there, but I gotta imagine that they've got somewhat comparable stuff.
1317000	1321000	I just don't know all the details, because I haven't published anything, as you may be aware.
1321000	1322000	Because you haven't finished anything!
1322000	1325000	Haven't finished, started anything.
1325000	1335000	Bobby Blackwolf reminds us in chat, Epic gets 5% of all revenue from an Unreal Engine game on Steam, because that's what you pay to use the Unreal Engine.
1335000	1338000	So they don't want to wall things off from Steam. Good call out.
1339000	1347000	Bobby also wants to point out, now I know I just said I wasn't going to name all the followers and all that, but it is worth noting, we're on night one here at Twitch.
1347000	1352000	Even though we created the channel a long time ago to save the name, this is our first official night of broadcasting on Twitch.
1352000	1356000	And, Loki, we just got our 69th follower.
1356000	1357000	Nice.
1357000	1363000	Nice. Thank you for that. Oh, even Smush. Smush isn't, I don't know if the mics are sensitive enough to pick him up. Probably not.
1363000	1365000	He's across, he's all the way.
1365000	1372000	I actually, I had to actually mess with the game so that when he starts screaming for food around 7 o'clock, it wouldn't pick him up on the stream.
1372000	1378000	I know you all really want to see and hear Mr. Smush, but, and that's my cat for those who don't know.
1378000	1381000	But, A, Mr. Smush is going to do whatever the hell he wants to do.
1381000	1389000	B, if I'm trying to make a point, I don't really want the cat screaming in the background, because you all are going to think we neglect him or something.
1389000	1392000	And that's totally not the case. I love him more than anything.
1392000	1394000	He's a cat. He'll whine whenever he wants.
1394000	1396000	Exactly. He's a cat. Every cat owner knows what I'm talking about.
1396000	1407000	Just like my cat. Like, every, like, I will literally drop treats down for her. She'll eat them. I'll walk across the room to refill her water. I'll put the water down.
1407000	1414000	I look at her and she's like, more treats? More treats? Like, I just gave you some goddamn treats.
1415000	1424000	In chat, I'm being asked, Pod Culture asked, what's in the box next to Rob? I don't know which box he's referring to.
1424000	1431000	This is a stand. So, I have a stand next to me. What might be the thing that Pod Culture's noticing, this is actually a stream deck.
1431000	1437000	So, this is a thing that I actually spent money on, but, you know, Elgato's not paying me to advertise it.
1437000	1444000	But I will say, I kind of like it a lot. It's very convenient and it actually controls the sidebar news stuff.
1444000	1451000	I can see exactly how many people are watching on Twitch right now as it updates. I can kill the mics with a button press, which I won't actually do.
1451000	1458000	It's been pretty neat. So, that's one of the things that is, you might see me poking out a little bit there is that thing there.
1458000	1466000	And that's the other scary thing about video is that now, like, now you're gonna see all the times when, like, Loki is doing a story and I just get up to go to the kitchen.
1467000	1471000	Or, I get up to do something else, it's like, oh, maybe I should-
1471000	1476000	So, anyways, this week, we have lots of stuff going on.
1476000	1487000	Alright, anyway. Let's move on. Oh, wait, no, didn't we have a little more on, like, what stores are doing? I thought there was one more little thing to this.
1487000	1488000	Then we'll move on to our gaming weeks.
1488000	1490000	Oh, what they're doing? I don't give a crap.
1490000	1496000	They're doing things and it's significant.
1496000	1503000	Alright, look. Oh, I thought we had another, oh well. I guess maybe we're, oh no, that's the story we're coming up with later.
1503000	1508000	Alright, so I'm just, I'm all mixed up, what can I do? Let's get to our gaming weeks.
1508000	1511000	Loki, how was your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1511000	1514000	Sadly, uneventful. I have not been playing DDR this week.
1514000	1520000	Only because I've been getting ready to put in the step mania component of my cabinet.
1520000	1529000	So I got all the parts for that, finally, so I'm going to be running a Ryzen 3 computer that's an APU.
1529000	1534000	And just some, you know, keeping it really compact.
1534000	1542000	It's literally going to be screwed to the inside of the monitor housing of where the monitor would be.
1542000	1544000	I have an HDTV in there right now.
1544000	1553000	So, getting all that, I got all the hardware, I got a lighting board, because originally they had lighting boards that you can buy.
1553000	1565000	They're like, I don't remember what they're called now, but they were based off of a pack drive, which is a device that's from Ultimark that's used to drive lights on an arcade cabinet.
1565000	1571000	And they use it for, like, you might be familiar with the iPack and stuff for like a main machine or something like that.
1571000	1574000	So this is their light controller thing.
1574000	1580000	It's more of like, I think on those cabinets, like lit up buttons and stuff, you can control this.
1580000	1589000	So I got that, but it's called a lit, it's lit or lit something, lit board, I don't remember who it is.
1589000	1597000	But some guys making, it's using Arduino and like a breakout board for the lights.
1597000	1602000	So it's very comparable to what the $200 board is, but only $50.
1602000	1607000	So I'm beta testing that, so we'll see how that works.
1607000	1613000	And then, of course, I already had a JPEG, actually I have two JPEGs, so hopefully one of those will work.
1613000	1620000	And then it's been just fighting with StepMania to try to get a theme that I can use.
1620000	1627000	It's like, I've been spending a lot of time making like, you know, logo and stuff for a fake mix that I'd put on there.
1627000	1634000	But I need, since I'm not, I haven't really dabbled in theming on StepMania,
1634000	1642000	aside from one time when I just kind of changed the color of a max theme or extreme theme to like make a max 3 or something.
1642000	1647000	And I did that for Roseville Golf Land at one time, but that was more of just like image editing,
1647000	1650000	and I didn't really change any of the Lua scripts or anything.
1650000	1658000	So now I'm trying to find something I can base off, but every theme that I've messed around with is broken in a different way.
1658000	1662000	Like some will be too laggy, some will just not support the features that I want.
1662000	1667000	It's just been trying to find one to build off of, and it's been frustrating.
1667000	1670000	So I've been just messing with that.
1670000	1674000	We need to get some b-roll for next week, because they're actually asking in the Twitch chat,
1674000	1676000	does Loki have photos of his hardware adventures?
1676000	1680000	But you do, you have your own stream, but you're playing DDR on your stream.
1680000	1683000	Our Twitch channels will crawl across the bottom at some point.
1683000	1689000	Yeah, yeah. So you can, in fact, this week I'll probably be playing again, because I do need to go back and do that again.
1689000	1693000	And I haven't actually put the hardware together, but I mean, that's going to take like a day to do that.
1693000	1699000	And then I just have to install Windows 10 on there, because I don't think Windows 7 recognizes a Ryzen 3 chip.
1699000	1707000	So yeah, I'll be doing that. This week I'll probably be playing Fifth Mix, because I'm going to get rid of Euro Mix 2, because it's driving me nuts.
1707000	1714000	And then, Pokemon Go. I've been playing a little bit of that. I've been meaning to play Pokemon Let's Go.
1714000	1722000	I've had like a Wartortle in my Pokeball Plus for like a week now.
1722000	1726000	Oh yeah, I think some poor thing's been imprisoned in my Pokeball for like three weeks.
1726000	1733000	Like the kids, they're like, I usually have them play with the Pokeball Plus in the car while we're taking them to school.
1733000	1736000	And then they're like, do you have something different in there now?
1736000	1739000	No, it's the same when they're like, oh, I don't even want to play with that anymore.
1739000	1741000	All that changes.
1741000	1747000	I want Pikachu back in there, because Pikachu makes noises. I'm like, but Pikachu's level 70, he doesn't need to go any higher.
1747000	1754000	Do they understand the different chirps and everything? I'm always like, what garbage bit noise chirp is that Pokemon?
1754000	1760000	Well, the Pikachu will make all sorts of noises, and they think that's great, but they don't like Wartortle.
1760000	1764000	And I don't necessarily either, but I'm trying to get a Blastress.
1764000	1766000	Life is hard.
1766000	1768000	Exactly, well, you know.
1768000	1775000	So, yeah, it's been that. I bought Katamari Damacy reroll.
1775000	1777000	I still need to.
1777000	1780000	But I have inflated, I have it on PC.
1780000	1782000	That's okay, they have your money. That's all they want.
1782000	1785000	I have it on PC. It's joined my backlog of everything.
1785000	1795000	And then, yeah, that's pretty much it. The only thing I played on PlayStation this week was the Harry Potter movies, because the kids wanted to watch it again.
1795000	1799000	I need to watch them, too. I'm going to come over and watch it with the kids.
1799000	1805000	Cheap plug, though. Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse. Fucking amazing. Go see it. Amazing movie.
1805000	1811000	It is literally the best Spider-Man movie to date. I mean, it's so good.
1811000	1820000	I believe you. Let's see. Before I get to my gaming week, somebody had asked in chat, Codeman had asked in chat, are we going to talk about the Kingdom Hearts 3 leak?
1820000	1826000	It wasn't on our show roll for tonight. Yeah, I saw it on Discord, actually. Again, over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
1826000	1837000	Somebody actually posted on the Orange Lounge Radio channel that there was a leak, I guess probably overnight or yesterday, where the retail version, there's a box print of an Xbox One is out there somewhere.
1837000	1847000	But what's interesting about it is that there is a follow-up from the director of the game or something on Twitter that basically says, and guys, feel free to correct me in chat if I'm wrong.
1847000	1857000	It's part of the beauty about having a live chat room, live fact-checking. But I believe in the statement, they basically said the epilogue and the bonus scene aren't on the disc.
1857000	1872000	They purposely left that out for a day one patch just so this wouldn't leak, which I actually think is really smart, in a way. So, they left the movies out for a day one patch, which, you know, big games always get day one patches.
1872000	1882000	They should put a terrible ending on it, like a really stupid ending, so that's what people ruin, is this fake ending. That'd be hilarious. A dog ending. UFO ending.
1882000	1886000	Why can't we get a UFO ending for Kingdom Hearts 3?
1886000	1889000	Well, maybe it'll happen. You never know.
1889000	1899000	It just comes down to the end and it's like Sora standing there with Mickey and stuff. He's like, hey guys, I got something to admit to you. I don't know what the fuck is going on in this entire story right now.
1899000	1904000	Like, I gotta be honest, we've been killing these things and I have no fucking clue why I'm here.
1904000	1917000	And Shane in chat, or Shad Leland, excuse me, brings up a point that was something I had thought about too, asking, is it smart? What if someone buys the game and they live in the boonies and have terrible or no internet? Then you don't get the full game.
1917000	1933000	I mean, that's certainly a perspective worth talking about, but, you know, high speed internet is getting to more and more places, but okay, if you live in remote Alaska or somewhere that maybe doesn't have the most reliable high speed internet or it's satellite or something that's very expensive,
1933000	1939000	and maybe you're a Kingdom Hearts fan, you know, you may not get to see the epilogue because it's not on the disc.
1939000	1948000	Unless maybe they offered it for download and you could go, I mean, I don't know, that seemed really silly, but I know like some companies have done that.
1948000	1955000	You can like download a patch that you install via like a USB driver. At least that was something we could do on 360. I don't think we really do those anymore though.
1955000	1960000	It's just kind of one of those, if you're not online, too bad. Maybe new game consoles aren't for you.
1960000	1965000	You know, you're going to miss out if you're not on the internet. It's just the way it is.
1965000	1970000	I guess, so you'll just have to read about it or something. It'll be unfortunate.
1970000	1974000	You'll have to watch it on YouTube. Oh wait, you don't have internet. Can't watch YouTube, I guess.
1974000	1983000	Don't be mean. Don't be mean. Also, breaking news from our Discord that missed our show roll for tonight because this broke after the show was finished,
1983000	1989000	but SSJ100Matt actually posted over in our Discord that Colin Kroll passed away.
1989000	2001000	And even though you might wonder what that name has to do with gaming, he was the co-founder of Vine, which, I mean, Vine has brought us so many great six-second clips of things.
2001000	2008000	Love Vine. And also the popular game show app HQ Trivia. And I think most people have tried that app.
2009000	2015000	I don't know. I played that app once or twice a long time ago, and then I was like, I'm too stupid for this, and it's a waste of time.
2015000	2021000	And it was like a lot of bugs and things like that, so I just kind of stopped. But I think some people still play it. I don't know.
2021000	2030000	So, did you ever play HQ? No. Anyway, I'm not saying the app is going away, but it is very shocking that this individual has died because he's only 34 years old,
2030000	2038000	and the headline says that apparently it's a drug overdose. So, yikes. Don't do drugs, kids. That's really sad.
2038000	2040000	You never hear about drug underdoses.
2040000	2047000	Stop it. Alright, anyway. Yeah, it's really kind of, yeah, yeah, Kaijuto in chat is a fan of HQ Trivia.
2047000	2053000	So, yeah, I mean, whatever you feel about Vine or HQ Trivia, those have still been, like, big things.
2053000	2060000	And I will give HQ Trivia this. You guys know I've stanned this for the longest time is on the Xbox 360.
2060000	2065000	They used to have one versus 100, and that was so much fun to play, like the live game show thing, right?
2065000	2071000	So, HQ was, like, kind of that? Like, it was different. But, you know, it was a little bit of that same feeling.
2071000	2077000	So, I'll give it that, even though it was kind of so buggy I stopped playing. But you guys know I miss that like crazy.
2078000	2088000	Maybe now that we have the Twitch outreach, maybe I can make a personal plea to the folks over at Microsoft to get interactive game shows back because I really miss those.
2088000	2096000	You better listen to me, Rob. You want your one versus 100? You know what you can do? You can play fucking Fortnite like everybody else.
2096000	2100000	There's your one versus 100. No.
2100000	2102000	You can play Fortnite and your PUBG.
2102000	2109000	I've already told you about my Fortnite experiences and how I'm just like, what do I do in this game? I'm gonna go hide in this house, open the door.
2109000	2113000	Oh, I just got a shot in the face, but somehow I got 65th place. I mean...
2114000	2118000	My son loves playing that game. He just will not stop talking about... Well, he plays as a creative mode.
2118000	2127000	So, there's Fortnite creative mode, which is like, hey, it's like Minecraft, except you build crap in Fortnite and stuff happens.
2127000	2129000	I don't know. I don't really know what you do in that game.
2129000	2130000	It's so...
2130000	2131000	I don't want to play it.
2131000	2138000	No, I mean, it's not that hard of a concept, Loki. I mean, you want to outlive everybody else and the little bubble gets smaller and smaller.
2138000	2140000	So, you're forced to interact with other people.
2140000	2141000	That's all of the games.
2141000	2145000	Well, yeah, that's the battle royale mechanic and Fortnite just kind of did it early on.
2145000	2149000	I would only say first, but they did it early on. They did it very well. So, it's worked out for them.
2149000	2152000	The cartoony thing has made it very appealing to kids for some reason.
2152000	2154000	It should be like battle rail, battle rail.
2154000	2155000	Yeah. Anyway.
2155000	2158000	Like you should be randomly thrown out there with a random weapon.
2159000	2166000	All right. Anyway, my gaming week. Before we got on all those breaking news tangents, which we tend to do tangents here at Orange Launch Radio.
2166000	2170000	But I was going to talk a little bit about my gaming week.
2170000	2176000	And honestly, since I've been so busy trying to get this, what you're looking at, set up, I haven't had a lot of time to play games.
2176000	2182000	But I did play some Super Smash Brothers online, as I'm sure a lot of people have been doing if you're a Switch owner right now.
2182000	2187000	I was streaming some of that, did some stuff with my buddy Delvin at VG Realness on stream.
2187000	2190000	And just having fun with that, playing with some viewers.
2190000	2194000	And I still need to work on unlocking some of those characters. I've been playing very slowly.
2194000	2198000	But I really do enjoy the like the quest mode, the spirit mode.
2198000	2202000	I kind of like it. I know some people think it's a pain in the ass just because it goes on and on and on.
2202000	2205000	But it does kind of give me like something to do.
2206000	2212000	It's something for me to do. Just if I'm not wanting to go to bed yet, I'm just kind of chilling.
2212000	2215000	And just like, oh, I'll play a couple of these matches and knock it out.
2215000	2216000	Have you unlocked all the characters yet?
2216000	2219000	No, no, I'm not quite there yet. But maybe about half.
2219000	2223000	So, still working on it. I don't know, it hasn't been a huge race for me to unlock them.
2223000	2229000	Save if there's going to be a party or a get together or something and people want to play whatever character they want.
2229000	2233000	But I've got a good chunk of them so far at this point. So, we'll see.
2233000	2237000	And then I've also been playing more World of Warcraft because they just dropped a patch in that game this week.
2237000	2239000	And I've been working on my little warlock in that.
2239000	2243000	And I'm up to item level 350, which probably doesn't mean something to a lot of people.
2243000	2249000	But to those of you that do play WoW, you know, I've been grinding to get better loot and all that stuff on my Warcraft.
2249000	2250000	So, there's that.
2250000	2252000	Little bit of the incidental stuff like Pokemon Go.
2252000	2255000	I've barely touched Ingress. I've just been so busy with everything else.
2255000	2261000	So, yeah, just, you know, trucking along a lot of the same games I've been playing.
2261000	2268000	I do really need to get to Katamari Damacy reroll, though. I might do a stream of that once this all settles down.
2268000	2272000	And we are comfortable that our video transition to Twitch has been successful.
2272000	2280000	I heard that, well, the port of that game has been kind of, well, rushed, I guess.
2280000	2287000	They, like, cut out the English language, like, in the cutscenes or something like that.
2287000	2290000	There's no English language in there.
2290000	2294000	You can patch it back in on PC. They have a way that, of course, people have made to fix that.
2294000	2297000	Of course. That's part of the reason why I'm sure people are buying it.
2297000	2299000	That's why I got it on PC for all the...
2299000	2302000	It's made in Unity, too, from what I hear.
2302000	2305000	So, I'm looking forward to the mods on that.
2305000	2306000	Yeah, so that'd be awesome.
2306000	2307000	All right.
2307000	2310000	Well, we're going to get right back into the news, but I do want to just remind you guys.
2310000	2317000	We are here live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
2317000	2326000	And if you miss a show for whatever reason, you can always download the podcast, which is available just about everywhere where podcasts are sold, including iTunes and Google Play.
2326000	2329000	All that good stuff. So, check out Orange On Radio.
2329000	2334000	Please consider leaving us a nice review while you're there. That stuff goes an awfully long way.
2334000	2338000	So, we will be back next week, and then I think in two weeks you said you might not be here.
2338000	2339000	Maybe.
2339000	2340000	So, we'll still...
2340000	2344000	We may or may not be here kind of in that break between Christmas and New Year's.
2344000	2350000	But then come 2019, we're really going to try to, you know, obviously we got enough set up on Twitch to bring you this tonight.
2350000	2362000	But we're really going to try to like keep, you know, I want to get a better shot that's going to include more and, you know, more of the studio and make it a little more studio-y in here and try to get all that going for next year.
2362000	2365000	That's a lot more studio-y in here than it was, right?
2365000	2368000	Yeah. So, it's the lighting, isn't it?
2368000	2369000	It's the lighting.
2369000	2371000	It's not like a dank cave anymore.
2371000	2381000	You know what's funny? The lights actually came with the green screen that I use, but I only really use the green screen because the lighting in the office, the office is so small it actually kind of works.
2381000	2385000	Like it's good enough for the green screen to work and for what I need on my personal Twitch.
2385000	2389000	But it came with these guys and now these guys are paying off.
2390000	2395000	Trust me, it was a really dark cavern man cave.
2395000	2400000	Although, you know, a gender discriminatory free cave and all that stuff.
2400000	2405000	It was just very dimly lit, like yellow lighting and probably candles too at some point.
2405000	2410000	So anyway, let's get into some more gaming news though.
2410000	2412000	I think we're ready to move on into this week's news.
2412000	2413000	So, Loki, why don't you start us off?
2413000	2420000	Yeah, so one of the big things that happened this week was that Blizzard had scaled back on Heroes of the Storm.
2420000	2430000	So they were actually, you know, taking some developers off of Heroes of the Storm and putting them onto other properties and projects right now.
2430000	2440000	So along with that though, they did announce that they're going to be canceling the esports stuff related to Heroes of the Storm for 2019 as well.
2441000	2448000	Unfortunately, they forgot to tell anybody that's involved in the esports with Heroes of the Storm.
2448000	2452000	They just kind of like, oh, hey, you guys are learning about it now as well.
2452000	2456000	So, you know, of course that didn't go over well.
2456000	2459000	If they had told them early, it probably would have leaked.
2459000	2468000	I mean, not that I'm defending that choice, but I can sort of maybe understand why they felt that was a risk they didn't want to take.
2468000	2478000	I don't know, but basically, you know, for example, one of the team's, I guess, Method, their general manager stated that,
2478000	2492000	we are troubled by the way the announcement was made, namely the impolite choice to use social media and to share such a message that effectively ended the careers of hundreds of players,
2492000	2498000	content creators, casters, production crews overnight and broke the hearts of countless fans.
2498000	2505000	As someone who is, and this is Wolf Schroeder, who is one of the casters basically,
2505000	2517000	as someone who has commented Heroes of the Storm since 2015, I mostly really feel for the 200 plus pro players who have lost jobs via a blog post today.
2517000	2523000	I always loved casting heroes, so it's tragic to see it suddenly, or go suddenly.
2523000	2526000	Thanks for all the kind messages today, friends.
2526000	2532000	So that sucks, especially for a lot of people that make this basically, you know, their livelihood.
2532000	2542000	Right, and I'm not defending this choice and how Blizzard did it, but I mean, what's to stop another league from still forming outside of Blizzard being,
2542000	2548000	I mean, is they just worry, the money's not going to be, you know, everything good takes money, is it just a concern that the money's not going to be there?
2548000	2556000	I mean, there's so much that's homegrown, especially in this day and age where any idiot can build a Twitch channel, you know, like,
2556000	2563000	I mean, and I say that, that they can go and, you know, maybe form something, I mean, but it wouldn't, the dollars wouldn't be there, I get it.
2563000	2568000	Yeah, I think it's that, but put all your eggs in one basket, though.
2568000	2575000	Well, that's a very interesting, like, reality of esports, I think, in a way.
2575000	2581000	And again, I don't want to sound like I'm being disrespectful, it's just one of those, because actually I really do enjoy Heroes of the Storm,
2581000	2590000	and other than Overwatch League, HGC is probably the one thing I have watched before, because I don't get into it enough where I really follow the teams closely,
2590000	2597000	I couldn't tell you who's on what team or whatever, but I just like to watch because I learn about the characters and how to play them better,
2597000	2604000	and so I kind of learn a lot of that watching that. Like, watching football is not going to make me better at football, you know what I mean?
2604000	2614000	Watching baseball is not going to make me better at it, but when I watch Heroes of the Storm being played live, sure, there's a lot that's not going to make me better at it,
2614000	2623000	but I learn things about team composition and skills that you take and why players do certain things that maybe I don't get from other sports.
2623000	2629000	So, I will say, two Heroes of the Storm's complement, and the HGC and all these people that have been working with it,
2629000	2636000	I don't consider myself hardcore with Heroes of the Storm, I casually play once in a while, but I enjoyed what I got out of watching these professional matches.
2636000	2644000	So I, too, am sad to see it kind of just end like that, that was Thanos snapping, actually, and that's what happened here.
2644000	2645000	Only half of it's gone.
2645000	2650000	Well, I mean, but the soul still burns, but you know what I mean, there's still going to be-
2650000	2652000	I think that's Soulcalibur.
2652000	2661000	I know. There's still going to be fans streaming it on their personal Twitch channels, like Heroes as a spectator sport is not necessarily dead,
2661000	2672000	but my whole point with this, bringing it back to esports, is that it's something kind of unique that we don't deal with with football and baseball and basketball on ESPN,
2672000	2676000	like those sports have been around forever and they're not really changing majorly.
2676000	2686000	Yeah, but it's not necessarily, though, so much the participation in that, but even, for example, there was one of the casters, Tetcher,
2686000	2699000	basically said that he's been making $4,000 a month since during the season, and he received a day rate from Blizzard that he relied upon to pay his rent and bills,
2699000	2707000	and it was his only source of income outside of his stream, and so unfortunately it's like almost losing your job,
2707000	2715000	so it's not necessarily that, yeah, they're not going to get the income from the actual event, the prize pool or whatever,
2715000	2726000	but they're also not getting the other income for keeping this whole tournament scene going, including all the commentating and running, filming, all that stuff.
2726000	2735000	But it's also like a scary reality for people that are involved in esports playing, is that one day this can happen,
2735000	2740000	you know, one day there's going to be a new game and people move on from the old game they were playing,
2740000	2748000	and so, I mean, I hope, it's kind of like, I've kind of joked about this and I don't want to say joke, because it's, you know what I mean, though,
2748000	2756000	like I'm serious about this, even though it sounds like I'm being an asshole, but I'm being serious is that what happens if you're a Twitch streamer
2756000	2762000	and that's how you make your living, or you're a YouTube, you're a YouTube person and that's how you make your living, right, because there's people that do that now,
2762000	2770000	and then YouTube makes a rule that like fucks you and your income gets cut by like two thirds in like a month or whatever,
2770000	2777000	like are you saving money for when the bubble breaks on any of that stuff, like that's the scary stuff.
2777000	2783000	Us, and I know you're probably looking at this going, the irony of you doing this while you're doing a podcast live on Twitch,
2783000	2787000	but the reality is we haven't made shit from this show in 16 years.
2787000	2788000	Nothing to lose.
2788000	2799000	No, I've lost a lot actually doing this show, but exactly, you know, it's fine, you know, I'm not going to miss it when it's gone,
2799000	2804000	that sounds terrible from a financial perspective, I'm not going to miss it when it's gone, but obviously I'll miss it terribly,
2804000	2812000	but you know what I mean, like, and again, people, if they want to make a living off YouTube and they have that talent,
2812000	2819000	they want to make a living off esports, that's their prerogative, but it is this weird reality of one day it could end.
2819000	2830000	Well right, and I have to also wonder too, like with this, that Blizzard's going to have new games that will be esports, I guess, compatible,
2830000	2838000	what's going to happen then when they're trying to get, you know, these people to come on, hey, come participate in our new esports game.
2838000	2849000	Yeah, completely forget that we fucked over all those people before, but hey, come join the new stuff, come on over, we won't fuck you over again, right away, promise.
2849000	2854000	I mean, I guess, you know, now that I'm thinking about it here, because we do that a lot, we just kind of brainstorm a lot,
2854000	2859000	now that I'm thinking about it, I guess there are a lot of like basketball and baseball players who might get an injury,
2859000	2869000	and then they can't play anymore. That does happen, you know, and it's like, well, I think there's insurance and stuff that happens in those scenarios,
2869000	2871000	but I don't know all the specifics.
2871000	2874000	Well then they're going to have to turn to esports, which some of them will.
2874000	2881000	Some of them have, I think, some of them do commentating and stuff, I don't know if there's a lot of players, but some of them do like commentating and all that stuff, so, anyway.
2881000	2883000	Bionic limbs, I say.
2884000	2893000	So anyway, YYR in chat says they doomed their future esports prospects outside of Overwatch, and I think that might be referring to the way this was all announced,
2893000	2908000	but even Overwatch is going to fade one day. I mean, there are very few, and I love Overwatch, but there are very few games that are very, very old that still are played competitively.
2908000	2910000	Smash Brothers Melee on the GameCube.
2910000	2911000	Counter-Strike.
2911000	2915000	I'll give you that Counter-Strike. There's a handful, but not a ton, you know?
2915000	2927000	It's, you know, and I'm sure Overwatch is probably worthy of being in that, you know, that grouping, but that is for the public to decide at the end of the day, right?
2927000	2929000	Right. I don't know.
2929000	2941000	Well, we'll see. I just, Activision hasn't had, or I should say Blizzard hasn't had really good luck with messaging this year, especially recently.
2941000	2950000	Doing a few more chat comments over at Twitch, SH2100Matt does verify there is insurance, he watches a little more of the sports ball stuff than I do,
2950000	2955000	but says there is no insurance if the league shuts down, which is kind of what happened in this scenario.
2955000	2963000	KArts1 says, as much as I love Heroes of the Storm, in the back of my mind, I always had a feeling that this would eventually happen, LOL.
2963000	2968000	Oh, I'm sorry. LOL. League of Legends. Sorry. League of Legends.
2968000	2970000	LOL. LOL.
2970000	2973000	Sorry, I was like, wow, that was really harsh to laugh at it. Sorry.
2973000	2982000	League of Legends and Dota have such a market share on the genre, and Heroes of the Storm never really took a large chunk of that.
2982000	2990000	It's interesting because I've played all those games, and personally, just as a player, I've always preferred Heroes of the Storm because it's a little bit more easy to learn, easy to get into,
2990000	2994000	but that's also why I think some people prefer Dota.
2994000	3001000	Easy to shuffle our developers off of so that we can make other games appropriate for Chinese markets instead of them being banned there?
3001000	3003000	Yes. Alright, anyway.
3004000	3015000	S2100matt says, all it takes is someone to put the money towards the League if Blizzard or Activision were allowed. Well, we'll see, but now they've also announced that the developers are kind of being shifted to other projects,
3015000	3024000	that they'll still have a crew working on Heroes of the Storm, but that Blizzard is working on a bunch of other stuff right now, and they need some of the key developers other places.
3024000	3036000	So you sort of get that sense that Heroes of the Storm, while it's still going to exist, it's still going to be happy to take your money, like it's not going to necessarily get gigantic content upgrades in the future.
3036000	3038000	Kind of like where Diablo 3 is at.
3038000	3047000	Aside from canceling, obviously they have to make the announcement for canceling the esports stuff, but why do they even have to announce that they're going to shuffle people around in their company?
3047000	3049000	Why is that something that needs to be like...
3049000	3053000	Because Blizzard wants to remind you there is more coming than just Diablo Immortal.
3053000	3064000	It didn't help! They didn't make it better. They made it worse. It didn't help. People are still thinking that, you know, well, they're fucking things over, and then they fuck things over even more.
3065000	3069000	Bad dog. Bad. Didn't do it right.
3069000	3076000	YY Orange Chat says, I did see a thread on Reset Era this week that basically was like, Blizzard was told to ship more games and spend less time on them.
3076000	3085000	And of course, you know, you have to take all that kind of anonymous forum post with a grain of salt, but I mean, this is where a lot of people have wondered, is Activision's influence.
3085000	3090000	Some of these changes too, Mike Morhaime kind of officially left not long ago either.
3090000	3095000	Like, are some of these changes starting to show their not-so-fantastic sides? I don't know.
3095000	3096000	We'll see.
3096000	3097000	We'll see.
3097000	3099000	All the mighty fall at some point.
3099000	3101000	It's depressing though. It really is.
3101000	3107000	Well, you know what? The Mortal Kombat franchise looks to still be going, and it's still going to be doing pretty well.
3107000	3113000	Mortal Kombat 11, I think a lot of people are looking forward to. There is going to be customizable variants in the game.
3113000	3117000	Esports-focused multiplayer mode, so there's something you can take up if you want.
3117000	3118000	We're all esports now.
3118000	3125000	We're all esports now. Well, but fighting games have always, they have EVO, you know, there's always kind of been like a place for them, and you know.
3125000	3126000	Yeah, fine.
3126000	3133000	I'm pretty sure, you know, I don't think Street Fighter V has been going so well, so I'm sure people are waiting for, I shouldn't say that.
3133000	3136000	Because then I'll get the Street Fighter V fan that's like, fuck you, you don't know what you're talking about.
3136000	3140000	But, you know, just, it's been a bumpy ride. I think we all agree with that.
3140000	3144000	But Mortal Kombat 11, you know, people are gearing up and getting excited about this.
3144000	3150000	They want to remind you that if you pre-order the game, Shao Kahn is going to be a bonus character that's playable.
3151000	3158000	Mortal Kombat 11 will have a new game engine, a new personalization system, which I'm assuming is create your own character.
3158000	3163000	So I'm sure that's going to go well, based on what we see in Soul Calibur and all that stuff, right?
3163000	3166000	I see no problems with Soul Calibur. What are you talking about?
3166000	3171000	Especially when you consider the personalization system is now in a game where people die horrifically.
3171000	3177000	Like, nothing's going to happen with this. Maybe personalization doesn't mean you actually create the old characters.
3177000	3181000	Just that, like, clothes, accessories, and stuff, you can kind of build on the existing ones.
3181000	3184000	Maybe that's what they're going for. That would make a lot more sense.
3184000	3185000	Yeah, okay.
3185000	3190000	New fatalities and a new gore-tech system. Oh, joy.
3190000	3192000	They should have a creative fatality.
3192000	3194000	What the fuck is gore-tech?
3194000	3196000	It's a made-up word.
3196000	3203000	They are saying the multiplayer is oriented towards esports and personalization systems daily news, updated rewards, and so forth.
3203000	3210000	The limited edition will have a steel case and six extra characters in the combat pack pass.
3210000	3215000	Excuse me. One of those characters, potentially Spawn?
3215000	3216000	Yeah.
3216000	3220000	Mortal Kombat has been getting some, you know, bigger name characters, licensed characters.
3220000	3226000	Well, we had Predator, we had Freddy and Jason, right? We've seen, you know, a few of them.
3226000	3232000	Spawn, although ironically, has been in Soul Calibur, right? The Xbox version of Soul Calibur 2.
3232000	3237000	Probably the one people didn't play as much because everyone wanted the GameCube one with Link, right?
3237000	3239000	But the Xbox one had Spawn.
3239000	3246000	However, a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything with Todd McFarlane, who of course is the man behind Spawn, asked,
3246000	3251000	would Spawn be available to be in the upcoming Mortal Kombat game?
3251000	3255000	McFarlane said, I believe he's on his way, dot dot dot.
3255000	3261000	So, did he let the cat out of the bag a little early? Is he just fucking with people? Who knows?
3261000	3265000	What do you think about Spawn as a potential character in 11?
3265000	3268000	I love Spawn. I'm fine with that.
3268000	3271000	You know, there's supposed to be a new Spawn movie, I thought.
3271000	3272000	Yes, I know.
3272000	3273000	That's the thing we were working on.
3273000	3278000	I know that they're doing that. I watched the original Spawn movie because at the time I was really into Spawn.
3278000	3285000	In fact, what's kind of funny, my dad was delivering to the...
3285000	3293000	At the time, he was delivering for FedEx to the same video distributor that I ended up working for at some point.
3293000	3297000	So at one point, he was just delivering to them and they would get screeners and whatnot.
3297000	3303000	But he got me the Spawn standee that went along with the movie.
3303000	3308000	I had a giant Spawn standee in my room.
3308000	3313000	Not to mention, I mean, just to give you an example of how much I love Spawn,
3313000	3318000	I had on my wall a mural of Spawn and the Violator.
3318000	3322000	Like, a giant fucking mural of that shit.
3322000	3329000	Which was great when we were selling the house, because they're like, wow, there's a giant fucking demon on that wall.
3329000	3334000	I don't get a creepy feeling from this house.
3334000	3341000	It was the cover of issue 16, if I remember correctly, which had the Spawn from there.
3341000	3347000	And then, I think it was issue 7 or something like that. It was a Violator from one of those.
3347000	3351000	But they basically drew it on the wall and they painted me a nice mural, because that's what I wanted.
3351000	3353000	And it was awesome.
3353000	3355000	Everybody else was creeped out by it, but it was so awesome.
3355000	3356000	It was cool.
3356000	3362000	So, if I really liked Mortal Kombat, yeah, I'd still be down for it, but I don't really care for Mortal Kombat.
3362000	3365000	But Spawn's awesome. I'll totally go see the movie.
3365000	3369000	You know who really likes Mortal Kombat? My husband, Alan.
3369000	3374000	Even though I'm like, eh, it's so gross now. I love the old ones. The cartoony ones are great.
3374000	3378000	I heard a rumor they're going to do the trilogy again, Remastered.
3378000	3382000	I thought I picked that up. I don't know if it was on Discord or where I picked that up.
3382000	3384000	Remastered again?
3384000	3389000	Well, I think fans did it already, so I don't know if that's crossing wires with the fan project.
3389000	3392000	I thought they did that already, like an Xbox 360.
3392000	3396000	Well, they did, but it was just the games ported.
3396000	3399000	Oh, you mean like actually recaptured everything?
3399000	3401000	Yes, yes.
3401000	3403000	Fine.
3403000	3409000	I was going to say, there was actually, someone was saying, I don't know if they wanted the petition or something,
3409000	3414000	but they wanted Doomguy in Mortal Kombat, which I could totally see that.
3414000	3416000	Sure, I'm for that. I'm for that.
3416000	3419000	Well, that goes right into what we're going to talk about next, doesn't it?
3419000	3424000	Yes, it does. So Doom just had an anniversary, a 25th anniversary actually.
3424000	3427000	The game was released December 10, 1993.
3427000	3435000	And to commemorate the anniversary as well, John Romero had a livestream that he did,
3435000	3441000	and during that livestream he announced a sigil, which is a Doom megawad.
3441000	3448000	And for those who may not remember, a wad of course was the container files that they used to store all the levels and data for the game.
3448000	3457000	So this giant megawad file that you can get, and it contains nine new single player and multiplayer levels.
3457000	3463000	And it's basically a giant mod from the original creator of the game.
3463000	3465000	So that's pretty awesome.
3465000	3474000	And then he basically said, I wanted the levels to feel like they belonged in the original game as if they were the true fifth episode.
3474000	3480000	There's more detail in the levels than episodes one through four, but not overly so.
3480000	3487000	I believe that the people playing sigil will recognize my design style,
3487000	3492000	but see new things I'm doing because this episode does not take place on a military base.
3492000	3497000	It takes place in hell, which is new to me within the Doom design space.
3497000	3504000	There's massive room in episode five, mission six, that contains the coolest room I've ever created in any map.
3504000	3509000	So sigil's going to be coming out in February, and it will be free to download.
3509000	3518000	And then he's also going to be doing some limited edition fan boxes as well, full of goodies like floppy disks, a soundtrack,
3518000	3524000	and apparently if you buy the deluxe edition, a pewter statue of his own head on a spike.
3526000	3529000	Because that's, that's awesome.
3529000	3537000	Would you, you know, Doom has had so many like fan wads over the years, it seems so weird that like,
3537000	3541000	it's just like you're kind of getting what fans have been doing for forever, but it's kind of cool.
3541000	3543000	But it's the original creator, that's awesome.
3543000	3546000	It is cool, it's nice to see him kind of like jump back in the waters and so forth,
3546000	3552000	but is this going to be like something we've just never seen before, or is it just, I want to check this out because...
3552000	3559000	It's cool, it's just like, I mean, I haven't played it yet, because I'm surprised I haven't played it yet.
3559000	3565000	I think I actually have it, but the Duke Nukem 3D that they did, the world domination or whatever one they had,
3565000	3572000	the last Duke Nukem 3D remaster or whatever they put out, they had the additional episode in there as well.
3572000	3577000	That's kind of the same type of thing, except I don't think that was the original creators that made that episode.
3577000	3580000	It was more of just, hey, we're throwing a new episode in there, yay.
3580000	3588000	So, yeah, it's cool. It's free. I'm not going to complain, you know.
3588000	3590000	I like free stuff.
3590000	3597000	And plus, you know, the fact that Doom has been supported for this long, I mean, it's ridiculous. 25 years.
3597000	3600000	And that, the new Doom was pretty good too.
3600000	3607000	Yeah, new Doom was awesome, but even the original Doom, they've got so many tweaks and stuff to it now,
3607000	3611000	and they even have a Battle Royale Doom thing as well.
3611000	3617000	And I believe it's one of the Xbox One compatible, because I had it on Xbox 360, and it's Xbox One backwards compatible.
3617000	3620000	Sadly, I don't think you can do any of this stuff. I wish you could.
3620000	3629000	I don't know. Not without modding, maybe, but a lot of those games still use the same WAD files.
3629000	3631000	It's just, you know, they rebuild the launcher.
3631000	3636000	All right. Well, let's move on to another game kind of crossover thing that's coming up.
3636000	3641000	Capcom and CD Projekt Red are teaming up for a Monster Hunter event.
3641000	3646000	So, in Monster Hunter World, in a free event that's supposed to launch in early 2019,
3646000	3650000	you are going to get to have Geralt in the game. Of course, Geralt from The Witcher,
3650000	3655000	which is, again, one of those games that, like, I really, really need to, like, sit down with the 70 hours and play that game,
3655000	3661000	because the little bits I have played were great, and it's just, you know, so many games, so little time, right?
3661000	3664000	It's the gamer's crisis that we've been dealing with forever.
3664000	3671000	But anyway, with this, the expansion is actually called Iceborne, and so there's gonna be freezing ice biomes
3671000	3675000	that'll be a little bit new to the game, and this is all part of more Monster Hunter World content.
3675000	3680000	More information in the spring, so I don't think it's gonna be, like, you're not gonna get this in the next few weeks or anything.
3680000	3684000	It's still a few months out, but that's pretty cool. There's also gonna be a new event quest,
3684000	3688000	which allows 16 people in groups of four each to team up towards a common goal.
3688000	3693000	That comes back on December 20th. Also, ooh, and I might have to check this out.
3693000	3699000	Oh, darn it. It's going on now, and I missed it. A free trial from December 11th through December 17th.
3699000	3701000	Just buy the game. It's, like, 20 bucks.
3701000	3703000	Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I'm thinking Witcher.
3703000	3705000	Oh, yeah, no, Monster Hunter World.
3706000	3708000	I have some friends that play it and seem to enjoy it, so...
3708000	3710000	I was gonna say The Witcher. Yeah, I've been...
3710000	3713000	Every time I see it go on sale, I'm like, ooh, maybe I should get it.
3713000	3717000	And I'm like, you know, when you buy that, you're never gonna play it because
3717000	3720000	you have all these other games you haven't played yet.
3721000	3722000	But, yeah.
3722000	3726000	Cia Tiberian Chat says, I'd rather have Geralt throw up in Monster Rancher.
3726000	3731000	Well, he had a cameo this year already in Soulcalibur VI, so they're putting him out.
3731000	3732000	The CD Projekt Red's kinda...
3732000	3734000	I'd just rather have Monster Rancher come back,
3734000	3737000	but then again, we don't use CDs anymore, so what the hell would that be?
3737000	3740000	He could be a character in Mortal Kombat 11, maybe?
3740000	3741000	I don't know.
3741000	3746000	Anyway, now, Monster Hunter has previously collaborated with Final Fantasy XIV,
3746000	3749000	and they are saying that that was a pretty well-received collaboration.
3749000	3753000	I can tell you from the Final Fantasy XIV perspective, it was a cool fight.
3753000	3755000	Like, they did, like, a boss fight, basically, but...
3755000	3760000	And then the way it ended, you had to, like, loot the boss similar to how you would in Monster Hunter.
3760000	3761000	Like, it was a little different.
3761000	3770000	Ooh, they should make Monster Rancher, but instead of using CDs to unlock the monsters, it would be, like, image files.
3771000	3772000	Okay.
3772000	3776000	So it's like, you know, hey, that picture of that giant dick I found on the internet,
3776000	3780000	that just unlocked some, like, really strong, like, monster. That's awesome.
3780000	3782000	No. No, no, no.
3782000	3783000	No?
3783000	3784000	All right. Well, maybe.
3784000	3789000	All right, let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.
3789000	3795000	Yes. So, because we were talking about fighting games, let's talk about Street Fighter V
3795000	3800000	and all the great choices that they're making. All those great damn choices.
3800000	3810000	So, somebody at Capcom had the fantastic idea, hey, you know where we haven't advertised yet?
3810000	3816000	On the players and everywhere else. So, that's what they're gonna be doing.
3816000	3817000	They have...
3817000	3818000	I remember this coming up a little bit last week.
3818000	3820000	Yes, but now that we get to see what it looks like.
3820000	3821000	Got it.
3821000	3826000	And it looks, like, fucking terrible. Like, it's everywhere. Like, it's ridiculously everywhere.
3826000	3827000	And apparently...
3827000	3834000	By the way, we're selling space on our studio wall. If you want to sponsor us, we'll put, you know, we'll put stickers and things over there.
3834000	3838000	A lot of this stuff is... Look at this. This is a poster for Final Fantasy XI. You know how old that is?
3838000	3840000	It's gonna come back. I mean it.
3840000	3841000	Kingdom Hearts.
3841000	3845000	Kingdom Hearts. The first Kingdom Hearts. Like, a bootleg scroll from the first Kingdom Hearts.
3846000	3850000	And look, all the way... I know it's washed out by the light a little bit because I can't get the lighting perfect in here.
3850000	3853000	Pop'n Music XI for the PlayStation 2.
3853000	3859000	Didn't we have, like, an Indigroove or something? Like, Indigroove 2 poster that was signed by Kyle Ward or something like that?
3859000	3863000	We might have that around here somewhere. We have a lot of stuff we didn't... We kind of ran out of wall space for.
3863000	3866000	Unfortunately, it's not on cam. Maybe I'll move things around.
3866000	3869000	Yeah, we have an actual Dance Dance Revolution machine marquee over here.
3869000	3873000	And our picture. Our happy 300th episode picture that was drawn.
3873000	3875000	Remember? We were 300 episodes in. Remember that?
3875000	3876000	Yeah.
3876000	3881000	But this Borderlands 2. Actually, Codeban saw that in chat. He's like, is that the poster I sent you?
3881000	3883000	Yes! It was signed by Randy Pitchford.
3883000	3884000	And it's actually signed?
3884000	3886000	It is. It's signed by many people from the team.
3886000	3893000	I still have, in my garage, framed up a true crime... Well, at the time it was true crime.
3893000	3897000	I don't know what city it's gonna be because this is E3. We're not announcing what city it is yet.
3897000	3899000	Spoiler. It was New York.
3899000	3904000	So, I have that poster signed by the entire cast as well, which...
3904000	3908000	It's got Tracy Lords that signed it. That's neat.
3908000	3913000	Anyways, since I was distracted by everything else that's in here...
3913000	3919000	So yeah, they have this whole advertisement mode that literally plasters this logo.
3919000	3923000	For example, they're doing the Capcom Pro Tour right now, which...
3923000	3929000	It's just plastered everywhere. Like, on the arms of these players, on this giant belt that they have...
3929000	3934000	It's fucking ugly. It's just stupid. You can opt out of it.
3934000	3943000	They want you, of course, to opt in on it because if you opt in on it, you get some additional fighter bucks, whatever the fuck they call it, to unlock shit in the game.
3943000	3947000	It's not worth it, but it's optional.
3947000	3951000	But, you know, I can't wait until the next thing that comes out, you know, like...
3951000	3958000	Old Spice or whatever the fuck they're gonna, you know, match up with this.
3958000	3963000	I can't think of what other terrible possible, like, sponsors they could have.
3963000	3965000	Totino's Pizza Rolls.
3965000	3967000	That's an awesome sponsor. I'm sorry.
3967000	3968000	Okay, fine.
3968000	3969000	I love food.
3969000	3974000	But I guess this isn't as bad as maybe Cup Noodle in Final Fantasy XV.
3974000	3977000	I mean, that was ridiculous, but that was over the top. This is just obnoxious.
3977000	3981000	It was. It was. The little, like, armor and stuff that uses that was always a little bit crazy.
3981000	3986000	It's just obnoxious. But you can turn it off. But it's terrible. So don't...
3986000	3994000	Just... It's better if you just turn it off because, I'm gonna tell you right now, if they find that this is effective, they're just gonna make it fucking worse.
3994000	3998000	So it's... Just... Just turn it off.
3998000	4002000	Alright. Let's move on for one more story here before our Classic Game of the Week.
4002000	4008000	And we're gonna talk a little bit about the Mega Man Legacy Collection, which is a classic game collection of sorts, right?
4008000	4009000	Yeah.
4009000	4011000	The Mega Man Legacy Collection has Mega Mans 1 through 6.
4011000	4016000	Now, what you may remember, this was already released a while ago on the PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
4016000	4020000	And then they came out with the version on Switch.
4020000	4025000	Well, for the most part, they were the same, except the Switch introduced a rewind feature.
4025000	4032000	So you could actually, you know, if you screw up in the game, which I do a lot, you could hit a rewind button and, like, instantly replay it, basically.
4032000	4037000	Kind of like, I do this a lot in Forza Horizon as well. Also has a rewind button and I use it a lot there.
4037000	4049000	So anyway, they ended up actually patching this feature in to the PC, the PlayStation 4, and Xbox One versions three years after the release.
4049000	4051000	At least they're still working on it.
4051000	4058000	Yeah, I know. That's kind of cool. So now you can rewind in those versions as well. So that's pretty cool. Sorry, 3DS owners. You're screwed.
4058000	4065000	But I guess they figure most of you may be upgraded to Switch by now. I don't know. But what can you do?
4065000	4072000	So there it is. The Mega Man Legacy Collection updated, which is a game that I've played maybe a little bit of on Switch.
4072000	4075000	I probably need to play some more of. But those classic Mega Mans.
4075000	4076000	Yeah.
4076000	4077000	Which one's your favorite?
4077000	4079000	Two, maybe?
4079000	4085000	I would say two is probably my favorite as well, even though I know there's so much love for three and that the bosses from two are in three.
4085000	4087000	It's just I just choose the one I'm always going to remember.
4087000	4092000	Yeah, I remember three as well. I don't know. It's been a long time since I played all this.
4092000	4097000	I did at one time, like, beat, I think, all of them. But I don't remember. It's been so long.
4097000	4102000	All right. Well, I think it's about time we get to the classic game of the week and figure out what's been picked out.
4102000	4107000	It's not Mega Man, unfortunately, but I think it's another good one. So what do you say we get to the classic game of the week?
4107000	4108000	Sounds good.
4108000	4114000	All right. And tonight we're playing with a new kind of magic. So this is all it's new, uncharted territory.
4114000	4120000	Well, as Arthur C. Clarke says, any technology suitably advanced enough is indistinguishable from magic.
4120000	4125000	But one thing is, of course, going to be consistent. That know it all, Dark Saga or Jamie Summers is still here with us.
4125000	4126000	Hi.
4126000	4127000	Hi, how are you?
4127000	4128000	I'm OK.
4128000	4129000	Good. Good to see you here.
4129000	4130000	A peddler enjoyed us all week.
4130000	4135000	Yeah, except unfortunately, just the magic isn't quite there yet for us to see you here.
4135000	4136000	Not if I can help it.
4136000	4139000	Twitch thing going on. I've got to get those wigs ready.
4139000	4143000	I know. I know you're doing this, but we're here talking about the classic game of the week.
4143000	4146000	Yeah, as we always do. That is still going to be consistent. Always.
4146000	4147000	Never.
4147000	4150000	Yup. Except when it's not, because once a month you do something different.
4150000	4151000	But we'll talk about it.
4151000	4154000	I already did the different. I know. But I did that live.
4154000	4157000	Different is fun. Anyway, let's get to it. It's the classic game of the week.
4157000	4160000	Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the classic game of the week tonight?
4160000	4162000	Nineteen X X.
4162000	4163000	The war against destiny.
4164000	4168000	I know. Sounds pretty dramatic for, you know, a fucking shooter game.
4168000	4172000	It is a vertical scrolling shooter by Capcom released in 1996.
4172000	4179000	It takes place before a fictional war in 19XX as a lone pilot.
4179000	4185000	Tries to defeat an entire army by himself trying to prevent another world war.
4185000	4190000	Which would escalate to a nuclear apocalypse.
4190000	4191000	Apocalypse.
4192000	4193000	Apocalypse.
4193000	4195000	Sounds like a prolapse.
4195000	4196000	Alpaca lips.
4196000	4197000	More like alpacas.
4197000	4200000	I don't know. Given the way the world is, it's more of a prolapse.
4200000	4201000	Anyway.
4201000	4202000	Anus or something. I don't know.
4202000	4203000	Wow.
4203000	4208000	Anyway, it is the fourth game in a series of World War II vertical shooters by Capcom.
4208000	4215000	The other games in the series were 1942, 1943, the Battle of Midway, 1941, Counterattack.
4215000	4219000	They were all on Capcom CPS1.
4219000	4221000	Released through 1984 through 1990.
4221000	4225000	This one is a CPS2 game so it had a different style from the previous games.
4225000	4230000	It also was followed by 1944 The Loopmaster in 2000.
4230000	4233000	Which may end up being a classic game in the future.
4233000	4235000	Womp womp in the future.
4235000	4237000	So you select one of three planes.
4237000	4242000	Each one has different ratings and speed, power, and their homing attack strength.
4242000	4244000	And so they fly through the levels.
4244000	4249000	The three primary weapons can be used by either picking up their respective items.
4249000	4255000	You have a fire that does Vulcan bullets, a straight firing laser, or multi-directional missiles.
4255000	4261000	By holding the button one, you can charge them up to shoot a special missile.
4261000	4263000	Sorry, my brain instantly went to gachamon.
4263000	4265000	I want to fire the bird missile!
4265000	4266000	Anyway.
4266000	4268000	Or that was more like G-Force.
4268000	4270000	I don't know. He always wanted to fire the bird missile.
4270000	4271000	I don't watch the animes.
4271000	4272000	So I don't know.
4272000	4273000	Girl, don't even lie.
4273000	4274000	Maybe once in a while.
4274000	4275000	You've watched some things.
4275000	4276000	Maybe a little Pokemon.
4276000	4277000	Yeah.
4277000	4278000	I listen to- I watch what-
4278000	4283000	I know a certain somebody in this room went to go see the Pokemon movie with the very first one.
4283000	4284000	So.
4284000	4285000	That is true.
4285000	4286000	Twice.
4286000	4288000	I was just saying, I saw it with Amanda.
4288000	4289000	Remember Amanda?
4289000	4290000	I remember.
4290000	4291000	She's adorable.
4291000	4293000	When you told the person with the small penis to shut up.
4293000	4294000	No.
4294000	4295000	That was not a Pokemon.
4295000	4296000	I would not say that at Pokemon.
4296000	4297000	That was a grudge.
4297000	4298000	Oh that's right.
4298000	4299000	That movie was great too.
4299000	4300000	Anyway.
4300000	4301000	Oh hi.
4301000	4302000	19XX.
4302000	4303000	Yeah.
4303000	4304000	XDX.
4304000	4305000	You also-
4305000	4306000	Not 20XDX.
4306000	4307000	Which is a great Mega Man club.
4307000	4308000	19XDX.
4308000	4312000	Well at any rate there you also get smart bombs that can clear out the whole page.
4312000	4313000	Whole page.
4313000	4316000	The whole screen with all the projectiles on the screen too.
4316000	4321000	You can also charge them up so each level of charge gets a different effect.
4321000	4325000	If you are shot- I was going to say shart.
4325000	4328000	If you are shot down while charging a bomb.
4328000	4329000	The bomb does not go off.
4329000	4330000	Which is sad.
4330000	4332000	It should just go off and clean everything while you reload.
4332000	4337000	So at the end of every level you get additional points for the number of bombs you still have
4337000	4342000	in a rank of 1-5 depending on the percentage of enemies destroyed.
4342000	4344000	And for the time it took you to take down a boss.
4344000	4348000	And a bonus for every medal collected which is multiplied by rank.
4348000	4352000	After beating the last level you also get a large bonus for the number of lives you
4352000	4354000	have remaining.
4354000	4358000	It has been ported to GameTap which I wasn't aware of.
4358000	4364000	But it was not released in the Capcom Classics collection as it is considered a modern game
4364000	4367000	according to Capcom.
4367000	4373000	It was commended for having some of the cleanest looking animation, multi-level backgrounds,
4373000	4378000	digitized explosions and various streams of patterned enemies place.
4378000	4380000	19xx among the cream of the crop.
4380000	4383000	That was from Next Generation magazine.
4383000	4387000	He also did find that the various methods of attack set it from different shooters and
4387000	4389000	gave it a 3 out of 5 stars.
4389000	4391000	That's kind of middling though.
4391000	4393000	But the words are nice.
4393000	4398000	So yeah, again to go through the whole series starting at the beginning we have 1942, 1943
4398000	4399000	The Battle of Midway.
4399000	4403000	Also called 1943 Kai which I'm sure you've heard of before.
4403000	4405000	I think you did at least one of these games before.
4405000	4406000	I'm sure I have.
4406000	4408000	I think I did 1942.
4408000	4412000	There was also 1941 Counterattack, 19xx The War Against Destiny.
4412000	4416000	1944 The Loopmaster and 1942 Joint Strike.
4416000	4418000	And there you go.
4418000	4419000	Alright.
4419000	4420000	The classic game of the week.
4420000	4421000	19xx.
4421000	4422000	19xtx.
4422000	4424000	There it is.
4424000	4426000	And 20xtx is not the sequel.
4426000	4427000	No.
4427000	4429000	This was the first of the series on CBS2.
4429000	4430000	Alright.
4430000	4433000	Well that's going to do it for our classic game of the week.
4433000	4438000	But Dark Sakura, any final words as we go back to our debut on Twitch?
4438000	4441000	Actually I was double checking one thing just to see what the other one is released on.
4441000	4448000	Actually 1942 Joint Strike was actually an Xbox Live Arcade and PSN copy so it never
4448000	4449000	had an arcade release.
4449000	4450000	Well there you go.
4450000	4452000	But The Loopmaster did.
4452000	4455000	And The Loopmaster was also CPS2.
4455000	4456000	Alright.
4456000	4458000	Enough about playing shooty pew pew games.
4458000	4459000	Although they are a good series.
4459000	4460000	Is there a great series?
4460000	4463000	Well some of them were kind of meh.
4463000	4468000	But they were all Capcom's foray into it and certainly maybe they were a little bit bitter
4468000	4469000	about World War II.
4469000	4470000	I don't know.
4470000	4475000	Any parting words as we go back to our debut on Twitch?
4475000	4479000	We have done a lot of tweaking behind the scenes getting this shit working.
4479000	4480000	We've been working real hard.
4480000	4483000	Ever since we saw that preview footage from Bobby Blackwell I was like,
4483000	4484000	Oh crap.
4484000	4486000	We are not ready.
4486000	4489000	You are not prepared.
4489000	4491000	But I think we're prepared now.
4491000	4492000	We're good.
4492000	4493000	Alright.
4493000	4495000	And my voice has finally decided to go off.
4495000	4496000	Fuck it.
4496000	4497000	So last words.
4497000	4498000	Words.
4500000	4501000	Alright.
4501000	4507000	We're back here live with our episode number 756 in progress tonight.
4507000	4511000	You know the date was wrong on the top this whole time until like somebody told me like
4511000	4514000	just maybe like 20 minutes ago before we went to the last game of the week.
4514000	4515000	So yeah.
4515000	4516000	Boy.
4516000	4519000	It's certainly.
4519000	4520000	You know it's the first night.
4520000	4522000	Things are going to go wrong on Twitch.
4522000	4523000	What can you do?
4523000	4524000	It's a huge change.
4524000	4525000	Again we did things one way.
4525000	4527000	16 and a half years.
4527000	4529000	So this is definitely a little bit different for us.
4529000	4531000	But we are going to get back into the show.
4531000	4538000	Thank you guys so much for you guys joining us along in our chat over at Twitch TV slash
4538000	4539000	vog network.
4539000	4546000	Of course is the channel where you can you know subscribe and follow along and watch
4546000	4552000	ourselves and Bobby Blackwell on Sunday nights in 2019 the kids over anime jam session are
4552000	4553000	also going to make their move.
4553000	4554000	Yeah.
4554000	4555000	It's exciting.
4555000	4556000	Yeah.
4556000	4557000	And who knows.
4557000	4561000	We're looking for more shows especially those with video.
4561000	4565000	You know the talk shows type of things would definitely be interested in working with some
4565000	4567000	more individuals in that capacity.
4567000	4571000	I do want to stress that the current vog network and all the shows we work with there.
4571000	4575000	We're not like getting rid of given those show shout outs and things like that.
4575000	4579000	Unfortunately we've lost a few shows over the last year you know just the shows of pod
4579000	4583000	faded for various reasons you know pod culture just finished up.
4583000	4586000	Critical Myth I know was taped in their last episode and they were on their way out.
4586000	4590000	I think Power Ranger Pride is said they're they're pretty much done but there's still
4590000	4594000	a lot of great shows there that are moving on and we hope to still work with them and
4594000	4598000	find ways to promote each other and keep promoting independent podcasting because that's what's
4598000	4599000	all about.
4599000	4601000	We got to support independent podcasters.
4601000	4603000	So and thanks you guys.
4603000	4606000	I love that it's flea and chat says you guys are doing great.
4606000	4607000	Yes.
4607000	4608000	Thank you.
4608000	4609000	We appreciate that.
4609000	4610000	We're trying we're trying our best.
4610000	4611000	All right.
4611000	4613000	But I'm I'm trying almost my best.
4613000	4614000	Yes.
4614000	4619000	I so since we haven't hit affiliate status yet you can you know view all the previous
4619000	4620000	stuff.
4620000	4623000	I do want to point out and there's a whole article over VOG Network that explains this.
4623000	4628000	If you want to watch the archives in the future once we really get things kind of locked down
4628000	4633000	here the way the way we envision them long term we are going to have that that you have
4633000	4638000	to be a subscriber for the twitch channel to be able to see all the old videos.
4638000	4642000	But the podcast none of that is going away.
4642000	4647000	So you know the free audio podcast we would never take that away or make you pay for that
4647000	4650000	all the sudden but only the video is going to be something where it's a subscription.
4650000	4653000	But so many of you I think have the prime accounts anyway and you get a free one every
4653000	4654000	month.
4654000	4658000	So I mean just toss that over to VOG Network and you'll be able to access the archives
4658000	4659000	again.
4659000	4660000	We are not an affiliate of twitch yet.
4660000	4665000	We just kind of think that's that's the design is we're hoping to get there pretty soon and
4665000	4668000	then we'll be able to open that up to you guys.
4668000	4671000	But if you guys want to make clips and things like that I don't remember if non affiliate
4672000	4673000	they can do the clips and the hot.
4673000	4677000	But if you feel like making clips of something of this show is funny or whatever we have
4677000	4679000	another broccoli farm moment this week or what have you.
4679000	4680000	Feel free to clip away.
4680000	4681000	You do that stuff all you want.
4681000	4683000	That's not that old already.
4683000	4684000	You haven't.
4684000	4686000	The joke isn't as funny as it was last.
4686000	4687000	No it isn't.
4687000	4689000	It's really it's kind of kind of come and gone.
4689000	4690000	It's sunset.
4690000	4692000	We'll see the broccoli farm.
4692000	4696000	Well I still want to hear how that goes over when you finally tell the kids where you're
4696000	4697000	really going.
4698000	4703000	Oh I'm sure they'll be really excited and then ask us every single day where we're going.
4703000	4707000	Yeah because my one son doesn't understand the concept of time very well.
4707000	4708000	All right.
4708000	4709000	All right.
4709000	4710000	Well let's get back into some news.
4710000	4714000	We have some rapid fire news some quick stories we want to get into here before we get to
4714000	4716000	like the mailbag and stuff.
4716000	4724000	So apparently the SNK 40th anniversary collection has gotten an update with additional 11 complete
4724000	4726000	games for free.
4726000	4734000	So they have split this up against three downloads but you get Beast Busters, Bermuda Triangle,
4734000	4744000	Chopper One, Fantasy, Much Mobile, Osmo Wars, Paddlemanium, SAR Search and Rescue, Suzuki
4744000	4748000	versus Commander, Time Soldiers and World Wars.
4748000	4750000	I need to pick up that collection.
4750000	4751000	Crystallis alone.
4751000	4753000	I love that game on NES.
4753000	4756000	I used to play a ton of Bermuda Triangle on the NES.
4756000	4757000	Yes.
4757000	4758000	Yeah.
4758000	4759000	So it's available for free.
4759000	4760000	So check it out.
4760000	4761000	Love that game.
4761000	4767000	And then of course Nintendo has stated that they're going to be discontinuing the SNES
4767000	4770000	and NES classics after this holiday.
4770000	4773000	So basically this is the last chance to get them.
4773000	4777000	And finally it's not hard to get these things.
4777000	4778000	No.
4778000	4779000	But you need to get them now.
4779000	4783000	You gotta get them now because if not you're gonna be stuck at the PlayStation Classic.
4783000	4785000	Which is being marked down by the way.
4785000	4786000	Already.
4786000	4787000	It's $75.
4787000	4788000	Where?
4788000	4789000	Target.
4789000	4790000	Right now.
4790000	4791000	Already.
4791000	4792000	Target.
4792000	4798000	In fact earlier you could get it for $75 on Amazon plus a $25 gift card to Amazon.
4798000	4800000	It's $50 bucks.
4800000	4801000	Uh oh.
4801000	4802000	Uh oh.
4802000	4803000	Alright.
4803000	4805000	And they're modded already completely.
4805000	4806000	You can put whatever game you want.
4806000	4810000	I hope Sony has learned a couple things.
4810000	4813000	And maybe we'll get something a little different next time.
4813000	4814000	We'll see what happens.
4814000	4815000	So.
4815000	4816000	They tried to half-ass it.
4816000	4817000	And unfortunately.
4817000	4818000	Yeah.
4818000	4820000	That's not gonna work out well for them.
4820000	4821000	Well.
4821000	4823000	But the NES and the Super Nintendo Classics.
4823000	4824000	They're pretty good.
4824000	4825000	You know.
4825000	4826000	Unfortunately.
4826000	4827000	You know.
4827000	4828000	You can't really.
4828000	4829000	Well.
4829000	4830000	If you mod them you can add new games to them.
4830000	4831000	But officially you can't add new games to them or anything.
4831000	4833000	You're kind of locked into those games.
4833000	4834000	But that's.
4834000	4835000	That's.
4835000	4836000	They're still.
4836000	4837000	They're good picks.
4837000	4838000	They're good picks.
4838000	4839000	Unofficially though.
4839000	4841000	You can put whatever the fuck you want on there.
4841000	4842000	I know.
4842000	4843000	So anyway.
4843000	4847000	A lot of that classic library for NES stuff is moved on to the Switch online.
4847000	4851000	That's kind of where they want you to go now because they ink pay that every year basically.
4851000	4855000	They did recently update the Switch online.
4855000	4857000	Nintendo Switch online library.
4857000	4859000	With some new games.
4860000	4863000	Including the Adventures of Lolo, Wario's Woods, and Ninja Gaiden.
4863000	4866000	Which I had talked about this week.
4866000	4869000	I actually had played Adventures of Lolo a little bit.
4869000	4871000	I forgot to mention that in my gaming week.
4871000	4872000	So there's those.
4872000	4874000	But they also added.
4874000	4876000	They've been kind of doing this every month.
4876000	4880000	They add bonus SP modes from other releases.
4880000	4882000	So there were some bonus SP modes.
4882000	4885000	There was Dr. Mario SP and Metroid SP.
4885000	4889000	So in Dr. Mario SP you basically start right near the end.
4889000	4894000	So you can see like a rare animation thing that you don't normally see unless you beat level 20.
4894000	4897000	So Dr. Mario SP kind of lets you go right to that.
4897000	4898000	Basically.
4898000	4899000	Or right before that.
4899000	4900000	You still have to do a little bit.
4900000	4901000	Metroid SP.
4901000	4902000	This one's interesting.
4902000	4905000	All they are, they're save states.
4905000	4907000	That are just basically preloaded.
4907000	4911000	So the Metroid one starts you off at Ridley.
4911000	4914000	So you have all the items and everything you need.
4914000	4918000	You start at Ridley and you can go in and just kick Ridley's ass.
4918000	4920000	Which is really not difficult.
4920000	4923000	I remember it being a lot harder as a kid.
4923000	4924000	But hint.
4924000	4928000	Just freeze all those fireballs then blast away with missiles.
4928000	4929000	That's really all you have to do.
4929000	4931000	And it's very very easy with the ice beam.
4931000	4933000	So you can fight Ridley there.
4933000	4939000	And I think they're probably doing that because of Ridley's appearance in Super Smash Brothers.
4939000	4941000	So they want to remind people.
4941000	4944000	Because a lot of people probably aren't going to be able to play their own way there.
4944000	4947000	So you can kind of check that out as a classic or whatever.
4947000	4950000	No word yet though what's coming out next year.
4950000	4954000	You know we've kind of known for the rest of this year.
4954000	4957000	What is going to be coming out.
4957000	4959000	But we don't know what's coming out in January.
4959000	4961000	So Nintendo still has to kind of announce that.
4961000	4963000	So we'll see what comes out next.
4963000	4964000	Alright anyway.
4964000	4972000	Moving on to a new Final Fantasy character coming to Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
4972000	4976000	Which I know some people are really addicted to on their cellular phones.
4976000	4979000	That was the game that Ariana Grande was actually in.
4979000	4980000	You remember that?
4980000	4982000	My favorite Final Fantasy character Ariana Grande.
4982000	4984000	Well you might have a new one.
4984000	4990000	Because Katy Perry is coming to Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
4990000	4991000	That's right.
4991000	4993000	Katy Perry will be in a commercial.
4993000	4997000	Which features one of her songs that I guess she's out there promoting.
4997000	4999000	And she'll also be a character in the game.
4999000	5002000	So the promo started earlier this week.
5002000	5006000	And good luck trying to get her as an unlocked character in the game there.
5006000	5010000	So you can check out the little commercial out there featuring her song.
5010000	5013000	Immortal Flame is out there on the YouTubes and all that stuff.
5013000	5015000	I'm sure she knows what Final Fantasy is.
5015000	5017000	To which they say in chat.
5018000	5021000	Oh my god. Wig. I feel that.
5021000	5022000	Let's see.
5031000	5032000	Now you're talking.
5032000	5033000	Now you're talking.
5033000	5034000	I can get on board with that.
5034000	5037000	That one I can get on board with as well.
5037000	5041000	Pixel Pacas reminds us this isn't the first time that Katy Perry's teamed up with video games.
5041000	5044000	Katy Perry was also in The Sims 3.
5044000	5047000	Remember when she sang all those songs in Simlish?
5047000	5048000	I remember that.
5048000	5049000	No.
5049000	5050000	I don't.
5050000	5051000	Cause you don't want to.
5051000	5053000	Cause I don't care.
5053000	5054000	Alright.
5054000	5056000	Let's move on and check out what's in stores this week.
5056000	5057000	Loki.
5057000	5060000	What's in stores is a bunch of cookie in my mouth.
5060000	5062000	Sorry bad timing.
5062000	5064000	We're gonna do it anyways.
5064000	5065000	Do you need help?
5065000	5066000	No I'm good.
5066000	5067000	Alright.
5067000	5068000	So is the cookie.
5068000	5069000	Yes.
5069000	5073000	So we have London Detective Mysteria on the Vita.
5073000	5074000	What's that?
5074000	5075000	A Vita?
5075000	5079000	Warhammer Vermintide 2 on Playstation 4.
5079000	5083000	Dragon Quest Builders 2 on Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4.
5083000	5084000	And would you believe it?
5084000	5086000	That's it for this year.
5086000	5087000	That's all folks.
5087000	5088000	No more games.
5088000	5093000	Well I mean you know it is the big busy time of year so it makes sense.
5093000	5098000	Well over in Japan there's still a few releases cause the holidays are a little different.
5098000	5101000	So the cycle of gaming releases changes a little bit.
5101000	5105000	But on the Playstation 4 Dragon Quest Builders 2 is out this week.
5105000	5110000	So I think I like the first Builders game so that might be interesting the sequel.
5110000	5112000	And I know the Switch is supposed to be getting that as well.
5112000	5114000	That's out on the Playstation 4 this week December 20th.
5114000	5117000	Kunio-kun a world classic collection is out this week.
5117000	5119000	Brave Neptunia.
5119000	5126000	Sakai Uchiyokatsumoko Seiyuu comes out in a regular and limited edition this week.
5126000	5131000	Onimusha Warlords on the Playstation 4 this week in a regular and a limited box.
5131000	5135000	Battle Princess Madeline is coming out this week as well.
5135000	5140000	And Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana in a Christmas gift package.
5140000	5143000	So I'm assuming that's another price reduction and just a repackaging of the game.
5143000	5145000	Do they have cookies in that package?
5145000	5146000	I don't think so.
5146000	5149000	I haven't heard about a Christmas cake being included with that or anything like that.
5149000	5155000	On the Switch this week I want to see that Dragon Quest Builders 2 is out on the Switch as well.
5155000	5159000	Also Kunio-kun which I mentioned is there as well as Onimusha Worlds.
5159000	5163000	Katamari Damacy Encore as they're calling it in Japan that is out this week.
5163000	5167000	So we actually got that one a little bit earlier than they did in Japan so that's kind of cool.
5167000	5171000	So that's what you have to look forward to in Japan this week.
5171000	5174000	Also a lot of price reductions kind of around the board.
5174000	5177000	Just things moving into the best collection and so forth in Japan.
5177000	5181000	Loki are you able to do the UK dates while we get the mailbag ready to go?
5181000	5184000	Yes sadly not much going on in the UK as well.
5184000	5186000	We've only got one game coming out over there.
5186000	5188000	Bridge Constructor Portal.
5188000	5192000	They're finally getting that on PC, Mac, Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
5192000	5197000	Oh and of course Android and iOS.
5197000	5198000	Alright.
5198000	5200000	So it's coming out over there now.
5200000	5202000	Alright well it'll pick up again in the new year though.
5202000	5205000	Because we have some like Kingdom Hearts is a huge release here.
5205000	5208000	Next year is going to be pretty busy so lots of stuff coming out.
5208000	5209000	Hold on brace yourselves.
5209000	5212000	Alright well let's move on we're going to get to the mailbag.
5212000	5214000	So if you want to email our show you can.
5214000	5218000	Participate at orangelaundrydo.com is the place to send your emails.
5218000	5223000	Earlier in the show I started an email from YYR because I wanted to get his perspective on the whole stores thing.
5223000	5224000	Yes.
5224000	5225000	I didn't finish it.
5225000	5226000	Oh my god.
5226000	5228000	I should probably do that shouldn't I?
5228000	5235000	So anyway YYR saying anyway I'll finish this email giving you my opinion on the possible cutting of the mailbag segment.
5235000	5238000	OLR is advertised on the show where every gamer has a voice.
5238000	5239000	Well some people use Twitter.
5239000	5241000	Some people use Facebook.
5241000	5242000	Some people use Instagram.
5242000	5243000	Some people use Discord.
5243000	5244000	Some people use Twitch.
5244000	5246000	No one uses Google Plus.
5246000	5248000	Some people well they can't after a certain.
5248000	5251000	I think after April you can't even if you wanted to.
5251000	5255000	Some of my Ingress pals still use Google Plus because Ingress was a Google thing.
5255000	5257000	So there's a community there but you're right.
5257000	5260000	Ain't nobody using Google Plus in a few more months.
5260000	5265000	Anyway some people use Skype and depending on where in the world you are the popularities of all these can vary widely.
5265000	5267000	But every gamer has email.
5267000	5268000	Every gamer.
5268000	5270000	And I'll leave it at that.
5270000	5274000	So like I said if you guys keep using it we'll keep it.
5274000	5279000	But they can only take so much of RuPaul's Drag Race talk when we have no emails.
5279000	5283000	I'm hoping again introducing this show to a new audience on Twitch and all that stuff.
5283000	5285000	I'm hoping that'll help grow things but we'll see.
5285000	5288000	Rock on OLR and best of luck on Twitch.
5288000	5291000	I hope we get a million listeners by next week.
5291000	5294000	Well I heard we were up to 74 followers on the network so that's pretty cool.
5294000	5297000	I'm going to have a lot of names to read at the end of the show.
5297000	5299000	So alright awesome.
5299000	5302000	Thank you very much otherwise for that email YYR.
5302000	5305000	Let's go to some other emails that we got.
5305000	5308000	Including let's see I think this one.
5308000	5310000	It's from Rhetortainment.
5310000	5315000	I'm looking at our chat too over at Twitch TV at VOG Network.
5315000	5319000	Yeah PixelPakas is talking about they closed Google Plus early because there was another data issue.
5319000	5322000	They bumped it up to April and I think he's found a story that says that.
5322000	5327000	Yeah it was supposed to be like over the summer and they bumped it up to April because yes there was yet another data issue.
5327000	5330000	But then they closed Facebook because of all their data issues.
5330000	5332000	Not yet.
5332000	5337000	Anyway Rhetortainment emails us saying dear Mr. Smoosh and the other broccoli heads.
5337000	5342000	Recently a business has opened in my area that has been discussed on OLR before.
5342000	5343000	Round one.
5343000	5349000	Yes we have a round one in the Salt Lake area and it's just as glorious as I've heard you people gas on about.
5350000	5356000	I haven't heard that. I haven't heard gas be used as an expression of a good time in a very long time.
5356000	5359000	This makes me wonder the following.
5359000	5365000	Are there any other businesses that you people adore that you perceive to be local treasures.
5365000	5370000	Or at the very least don't have much of a presence outside of California.
5370000	5371000	Know this up front.
5371000	5374000	There are in and out burger locations outside of California.
5374000	5377000	We have many of them in Utah and they're OK.
5377000	5379000	A bit overhyped but not that bad.
5379000	5383000	That was from Broccoli Entertainment as he's renamed himself this week.
5383000	5385000	So thank you for the email.
5385000	5391000	What do you think places here locally or in California that people are missing out on not having other places.
5391000	5393000	I got a couple answers.
5393000	5396000	So I think this is in a lot of big cities.
5396000	5399000	But Fry's Electronics.
5399000	5402000	Yeah I've had to go there three times this week because of all this shit.
5402000	5406000	So there's that because they don't have Radio Shack anymore.
5406000	5408000	Most know most of the stuff I was buying.
5408000	5413000	I get a radio once you go to Fry's or you're like I don't need Radio Shack anymore because they have way more so.
5413000	5417000	I know that Fry's is on the other side of town. That's the only my only complaint about it.
5417000	5421000	It's true. Yeah. Yeah. For me it's like kind of a trip over there for you.
5421000	5425000	It's a little shorter to get to the one. But yeah for me it's like I got to go.
5425000	5429000	I got to get on the freeway. So yeah there's all that. So that's one.
5429000	5434000	But I would say locally here in Sacramento where our show is based if you didn't know that.
5434000	5439000	There's a food chain that's here kind of locally and I think they're starting to spread to like some of the Bay Area.
5439000	5444000	But like it's so good that my friends in the Bay Area come here to eat there. It's Jack's Urban Eats.
5444000	5448000	It's like salads is that you know they usually made a face.
5448000	5451000	You don't like them. All right. They're good. Not that great.
5451000	5456000	My pals from San Jose will like come up to eat at Jack's because it's like this big deal.
5456000	5461000	But you know I think you know what I think is is hyped the squeeze squeeze burger.
5461000	5465000	I think that's over. Yeah that's over hyped. People love it. It's with that.
5465000	5470000	They put a gigantic piece of cheese on it so that it's not a gigantic piece of cheese.
5470000	5475000	I'll have you know. So what they do use me. Well hello. We got to get it correct. OK. Sorry.
5475000	5480000	So what they do is they put it's a cheese skirt. So they basically create a burger.
5480000	5483000	They put the burger down. It's on the grill and everything.
5483000	5489000	And then they take shredded cheddar cheese and they just literally dump way too much fucking cheese on it.
5489000	5497000	And then they put a lid on it and squeeze some water under so that steam melts the cheese and you get this giant fucking thing of cheese that's on there.
5497000	5505000	And then you eat your burger and the burgers is kind of it's all right. But the cheese is really good except the cheese is super greasy because cheddar cheese.
5505000	5516000	I ate there a couple of times when I was working in Sacramento for my company's innovation shop and I got over it after about two times.
5516000	5521000	I was just like yeah I'm not eating here ever again. It was all right.
5521000	5528000	Why why are says I don't understand how you can walk into an in and out and get super yummy feeling burger for under five bucks when nowhere else can do the same thing.
5528000	5536000	I like in and out but like people go crazy about it. I'm like I like them but they're always they're always so crowded.
5536000	5543000	You know what I mean. Like it's just like it's like this event thing and I'm like it's OK. It's it's good. It is a good burger and fries for a good price.
5543000	5552000	I don't like Burger King burgers are fine. Like I don't know I just I would go there like in and out is OK but it's not like here's the thing I need to go there.
5552000	5561000	My like friends from like Chicago and the East Coast because I guess they don't really have this out there but they think some of them think that the bigger deal out here is Jack in the box and they're everywhere.
5561000	5571000	So it's like it's like giant balls like McDonald's out here. They're everywhere right. But like because of like let's be real that company really caters to stoners.
5571000	5587000	So they have like they have all these munchy things on the menu right. Right. Like look they have a late night snack box that's like two jalapeno poppers some mozzarella sticks a small fries like you know what audience that's catered towards because they only sell it.
5587000	5603000	Well they did that in the commercials. It's like you know. Yeah. Like what was it tacos or whatever. Ninety nine cent tacos or something like that. Like how many should we get. Ninety nine. Yeah.
5603000	5612000	So yeah. So I think I like Jack in the Box just because I think I like the sourdough sandwiches they do there is not really a thing you see everywhere else. And yeah I just like OK.
5612000	5625000	Can't eat there anymore but you know you know what else. Somebody in chat earlier had said let's see because I want to get proper proper credit. W 0 4 says Pinkberry there.
5625000	5639000	They were everywhere now but I don't go there as much as I used to know. I like now is cheese is the one. Yes. I was just supposed to go there. Yeah. Yes. Men cheese with their dole whip yogurt land which had the Nintendo promotion it closed here.
5639000	5649000	So we can't go there anymore. Remember when they had the Nintendo promotion all the flavors were Nintendo and the spoons were Nintendo. Oh my kids love it but no. Yeah no it was a couple of years ago. So it was that.
5649000	5662000	So let's see a couple more comments in our chat. Bobby Blackwell says we actually had a local place called Stoner Burger here. They tie dye everything on the wall. The town basically ran them out of town because the imagery. Great food though.
5662000	5676000	I like round table. That's local. Oh yeah. Best pizza. But I'm biased because I work there. No it's it is. It's more expensive though. Like you can't get two pizzas for 10 bucks or whatever. It's a little pricier but it really is like half off delivery days or something.
5676000	5685000	I never go there. All those companies better be paying us for those free shout outs. But that was an email. Let's move on to which you know it pisses me off is my local round table they used to have.
5685000	5697000	See they have these like I guess royalty programs. So there's this one that's I remember it's called now but a lot of different places share it's done with your phone like a phone app or something like that.
5697000	5709000	So then I had all these points you know built up on it. They got rid of it and then they brought it back. I'm like you fucking assholes. I had like free twists on there so they can't go to that place anymore because they fuck up my order every time.
5710000	5720000	But that's just the employees that necessarily I'm not going to hold that against round table themselves because their pizza is fucking good but it's just the employees not always the sharpest.
5720000	5731000	You are a former employees. Yeah but fuck up orders like that. Do they have mountain mics everywhere because that's kind of like like that one day we're sick around table we'll have mountain mics.
5732000	5741000	Yeah mountain mics is pretty good too. I don't know if that's all over the place. I don't know. I don't know what's local what's not. I don't see mountain mics in Atlanta though so maybe they are like pizza.
5741000	5750000	That's good. But that's everywhere. That's on. But we don't have a lot of them here. No. And I'll tell you what the other thing we don't have. And then I swear to God we're moving on.
5750000	5758000	The other thing we don't really have in California which surprises people like here's the one that's going to really surprise you that like is a delicacy for me when I travel.
5758000	5773000	Dunkin Donuts. Now recently in SAC we got like two of them. Yeah there's one right by my house there. OK. Which couldn't be any further for me. Yeah. So like to me I still like it's it's I almost eat Dunkin more often when I travel the one I'm here.
5773000	5782000	I've had their doughnuts and I was just kind of like it's the coffee it's not about the doughnut. Oh OK. OK. Coffee because I didn't have the coffee but I had the doughnuts and I was like the doughnuts are OK.
5782000	5788000	I would rather that you were like something else because your doughnuts are kind of crap.
5789000	5796000	Yeah I know Raginator in chat says Dunkin Donuts are a dime a dozen here in Buffalo. Yeah. Most of the places I visit on the East Coast they're like everywhere. They're like Starbucks here.
5796000	5816000	You know every big doughnut place that's around here. Starbucks is also not Starbucks. Yeah Starbucks is fucking everywhere. What was the other one. Krispy Kreme I rather they would have been a Krispy Kreme one more and I swear to God we talk a lot about food for a gaming show but this one this is huge because if we're going to talk coffee I don't have a coffee drinker but here's the one you're missing out on in my opinion.
5816000	5825000	Dutch brothers the best those little there are those little stands and parking lots you have to drive. Oh yeah. They're starting to get more of them. Yeah. Yeah.
5825000	5835000	It is the best. Super sugary. Probably not good for you coffee but it is amazing. Like if you're a Starbucks fiend go try that when you're in California.
5836000	5848000	We're missing out on these fucking like I don't know what they call them but you know it's those like topless coffee places. It's like like the ones and I don't check bikini baristas.
5848000	5858000	Yeah. Bikini baristas we're going to see now on that shit. You put that in fucking laws against it here. Oh it's whatever.
5859000	5881000	It's whatever. I mean we need that because it's like fucking I I not I don't really care for it. You know the Dutch brothers shit that they have it's just it's just it's overrated and they fucking block. Try going into a parking lot that has the Dutch brothers it's fucking impossible to get around in there because it's just like lines.
5881000	5896000	I know the fucking as it's good and we went there. I've been there before. All right. But yeah no more free commercials. No more free commercials. You're all paying up with free stuff. All right. Moving on. Let's get to an email from pixel pockets who used to go by MXC in the chat but now on Twitch pixel progress.
5896000	5910000	Well it says hello. The new video format is fantastic. Sure it's changed but it's changed for the better. I wanted to send an email to say thank you folks for continuing to do all our year after year and for inspiring me in many ways.
5910000	5922000	Yours was the first podcast I ever listened to back in 2004 2005. Just remember just remember we were a lot younger than we looked a lot younger. I didn't have a beard. I was you know more of a skinny legend back then.
5922000	5944000	But it's a different time anyway and has remained in my weekly rotation years later way back when I first started listening in. I wanted to start my own podcast. It never happened until this year. My friend was looking to start a new podcast called the pixel X pixel that might be pixel cross pixel pixel cross pixel primarily about Japanese media games anime etc.
5944000	5957000	And we decided to do one together. It's only six episodes in so far but we're having fun. Good job working in your free promo but I support that. That's awesome. And keep having fun. Yeah because when it's not the most important it's no longer fun.
5957000	5968000	It's it's done for one of our anniversaries. I emailed to share being thankful for Rob as being an openly gay gamer which I did not have gay people in my life to look up to.
5968000	5979000	It's a bit funny to look back on this point with tons of LGBTQ folks in my life now but I'll always be thankful for or during a tough time of my life. Thank you. That means more than you can know it really does.
5979000	5991000	Or is my favorite part of Sunday evening. I'll keep listening and now watching as long as you folks keep going. Well we'll see how long it takes for them to kick us off twitch. But I think we're in a good spot.
5991000	6008000	Thank you so much pixel podcast is very sweet email. And people are being very nice tonight because Bobby Black was asking first tears on twitch. Not yet. Not yet. Getting close though Frodo swaggin sends us this email and I think this is another very nice one.
6008000	6018000	Hey well our Frodo swagins here. Just wanted to write in and say congrats on the move to twitch. I'm really excited to see your show get bigger. There are way too many people missing out on this wonderful show.
6018000	6028000	You mentioned possibly taking emails away in last week's episode. Just make sure to have another way for us to write in and say hi if you do. That's one of the great things about this show is being able to write in and participate.
6028000	6039000	I've I've taken my claws back a little bit from where I was last week. You guys keep using it. We'll keep reading them. Also I've heard a lot of episodes on here where people talk about what games help them get through hard times.
6040000	6052000	Rocket League is mine. That's for sure. But I realized that Orange Andrea was something I'm going to look back on and say that it played a big part of my life. I love knowing that once a week your show is always going to be there not forever obviously.
6052000	6063000	But you have been at this for years and it means a lot to me. It means a lot to many of us. I'm certain that's ironic that. Yeah I swear I didn't like order these emails or only reading the good ones I swear.
6063000	6076000	I really look forward to hearing the podcast every week. So thank all of you for all that you do to keep this show going. I've said it before but I'll say it again. I've heard lots of podcasts but OLR is my home. You three are awesome people heart.
6076000	6087000	Can't wait to see the first twitch stream. Thank you so much Frodo that these nice comments that is that is the fuel that keeps it burning for a long time. So thank you guys so much.
6087000	6101000	So there you go. No questions in those emails though just some very nice compliments a podcast plug that I'll have to check that out too. Yeah maybe I'll learn a thing or two about my pronunciation because I need to work on that for Japanese release dates.
6101000	6108000	Are you guys good at pronouncing things special pockets because I'm excited to learn. So any anyhow.
6108000	6119000	Justin is in our chat room that says can we stop acknowledging that OLR may someday end. It's making me think about my own mortality and I don't like it.
6119000	6131000	I had the honest honest to God. There was a point where I think we made a joke in an early episode. There's a song in the game pop and music which I know some of you know which I think I know across from the car freeze.
6131000	6143000	But there's a song called 7 7 7. And it was said in an earlier episode. Oh well if OLR only keeps going until like 2019 you'll get to play 7 7 7 on episode 7 7 7.
6143000	6156000	And I was like give me a break. We're not going to be here in 2019. But now I'm look I'm reevaluating only if you know I'm a part of your way. Some of my earlier words are coming back to haunt me a little bit.
6156000	6170000	And now you know maybe this whole twitch move and hopefully discovering some new people out there in twitch land. Maybe that's going to be the push we need to really move towards episode 1000 which again I always thought was like no fucking weekly show gets to a thousand.
6170000	6181000	Maybe if you do like three a week or something or multiples a week you might get to a thousand. No weekly show gets to a thousand. But I'm sitting here going you know we might get to a thousand Loki.
6182000	6193000	Or we ended at nine ninety nine and you never get that satisfaction of watching the odometer in nine ninety nine point one ninety nine point two. That's a good idea too. I like that.
6193000	6203000	All right. Anyhow there you go. That's it for the mailbag tonight. I think it's time for us to get into some more news. But remember you can always email us participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
6203000	6215000	I should I should put that on the see ideas for next week. I should put the email address up there that maybe more people will use it off to do that. The right email address and we'll put the right email address with the right date. Yes I will do that. Meanwhile how about new games.
6216000	6239000	All right. So there's this game called high tail which is being developed by a studio called high pixel and high pixel it will high pixel studio just to say high pixel is actually a team that runs this large Minecraft map.
6239000	6254000	One of the world's biggest Minecraft servers and they've teamed up with right games to build this game called high tail and high tail as you may imagine since you know a lot of this is based around Minecraft is a Minecraft like game.
6255000	6270000	So they had an announcement trailer looks very similar to Minecraft. Same kind of art style. It's going to be a voxel based game but there is also you know like kind of you know it's a little bit more geometrically pleasing.
6270000	6283000	Just all blocky. What's kind of unique about it though they did have an adventure mode that's going to have a full narrative with dungeons and boss fights and the single player campaign as well.
6283000	6299000	And of course they're also going to have the creative mode as well. And you'll be able to design your own levels and whatnot with some like really elaborate set of tools they were shown like you can even like stream videos and stuff into the game which is kind of cool.
6301000	6318000	So it's supposed to be set to release in 2019 on PC. So I guess we'll have to see what happens there. But it looks interesting. I'm interested in it because I dig Minecraft but I thought you know with Minecraft there's not a lot of structure as far as the story goes.
6318000	6333000	So like kind of doing the survival mode stuff can kind of get boring if you're playing by yourself. And even with like mods sometimes it's just kind of I don't know it's hard to stay interested in it I guess. But this is pretty cool. So I'm willing to check it out when it comes out.
6333000	6344000	Yeah. You know as far as this Hypixel goes you know I've kind of been itching for something kind of like new in the Minecraft universe for a little bit like I really want that super 4K texture pack to come out.
6344000	6359000	I know haha 4K graphics in Minecraft but I mean like the water effects and everything else look really really good with all that. So I would like that to kind of you know give the game a kick in the pants and it just kind of feels like I don't know Minecraft's been around several years now.
6359000	6364000	You know like it's ready to let's look at where's Minecraft 2 or what's next for Minecraft.
6364000	6366000	Well this almost seems like it could be like a Minecraft 2.
6366000	6378000	Exactly. That's what this kind of feels like is that all right if Microsoft isn't kind of jumping on it maybe we got another company. And I know Minecraft clones are a dime a dozen but you know you got some pretty big names behind this including huge Minecraft fans.
6378000	6391000	And you know obviously Riot Games which really I don't think they're known for anything really besides League of Legends. I mean they're not they may have other stuff they're not really known for anything outside of League of Legends. I'm sure they're itching to get outside of that box. So yeah this could be very interesting to see where it goes.
6391000	6396000	Yeah I'm curious to see as well so stay tuned. Keep an eye on it.
6396000	6408000	It's Flee says in chat have they said anything about the 4k lately. No they announced it like two weeks ago and they never really dated it like you kept thinking it was getting close but then it like never actually happened.
6408000	6425000	Yyr in chat says 4k is the shiz. Yeah I can't wait too much. I mean I don't even need the 4k graphics. I mean my computer monitor I guess will handle it but certainly not on my Xbox One which I still have a crappy TV for but whatever right.
6425000	6443000	So yeah I I'm trying to see real quick if they've mentioned anything better not in a while like if you look for the news and stuff like it's been quite some times they've really talked about when it's coming out like I see the last mention of it was kind of talking about a delay and that was like months ago.
6444000	6453000	Yeah my favorite comment though on this. What happened to the Minecraft SuperDuper graphics pack. It got super duper delayed.
6455000	6465000	It sure did. Yeah. So here's the comments official comment. They said Minecraft developer here. The graphics team is still hard to work on this. It ended up being a ton more work than initially anticipated.
6465000	6480000	The graphics part of our engine is quite honestly simply not built for this. And when we tried to put all the new features piece by piece things went bad performance even on the Xbox One X was between bad and inconsistent during all of the internal play sessions we had.
6481000	6492000	It will come but we don't have a release date yet. The gameplay team has been hard at work on update aquatic and the rest of the engine team has been working on the switch release just to give you an idea how fucking old this is.
6493000	6510000	Now the switchboard is out and going. I don't know. So they're still working on it. But makes me wonder though because like they have like high res texture packs since like you know Sonic ether is unbelievable shaders and shit like that.
6510000	6522000	It's on the Java version and it looks just like that. Why can't they do another console version. I don't know. Interesting. Seems like it'd be easier but maybe not.
6523000	6533000	Well some people are playing in four K. Some people are playing in VR VR is something that's growing of course as well. I know I'm still playing a little bit Tetris effect here and there.
6534000	6542000	Although I keep forgetting to check the weekend challenges. I just realized shoot yesterday came and went and I never went in and looked at the weekend challenge for Tetris effect. So bummer.
6543000	6548000	Well I keep forgetting to play the game altogether. You should get on that because it's seriously probably one of my favorite games that released this year. Totally.
6548000	6562000	So anyway but as far as VR goes there's an ongoing dispute that was going on between ZeniMax and Facebook. Facebook of course owns Oculus and ZeniMax and Facebook finally settled this whole thing.
6563000	6572000	Which is interesting that there's a settlement because I thought there was a judgment already of five hundred million dollars. There was a judge that found that ZeniMax claims held merit and awarded a five hundred million judgment.
6572000	6582000	It was halved on appeal. So I don't know if there's like an appeal to the appeal or what happens next. But yeah like for whatever reason they sat down in a room and they worked it out.
6583000	6589000	Of course we don't know. We don't know how much money they ended up getting out of the whole thing because of course terms of the settlement were not disclosed which is pretty customary.
6589000	6597000	So CEO and chairman of ZeniMax Robert Altman said we are pleased that a settlement has been reached and are fully satisfied by the outcome.
6598000	6608000	While we dislike litigation we will always vigorously defend against any infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties.
6608000	6619000	And Facebook said we're pleased to put this behind us and continue building the future of VR. So I guess at least they don't have to worry about litigation holding things back.
6620000	6630000	But of course we'll never know the good stuff so to speak. So all right. Well let's move on and we will get to the Skype line soon and I'll tell you a little bit more about that when we get there.
6631000	6633000	We have a few more stories before we get there. So Loki what's up next.
6633000	6647000	So as I alluded to earlier when we're talking about you know what these different platforms offer as far as developmental tools Epic has announced that they are offering services to help cross platform gaming.
6648000	6660000	So what they did is they are allowing launching their suite of cross platform services which is going to be available for PC Mac iOS Android PlayStation Xbox and Switch.
6660000	6674000	And it's basically going to allow developers to use the same tools that they had for you know Fortnite that's going to be free for developers and will be open to all engines all platforms and all stores.
6675000	6684000	They can be mixed the match says developers see fit and it allow them to basically aid in the cross platform play.
6685000	6696000	So services including like cross platform log in IDing friends voice chat parties matchmaking data storage achievements etc.
6696000	6705000	And that's pretty awesome that they offer that and they are not you know it's not something that's necessarily going to be locked down to their store.
6706000	6718000	It's just like hey use this you know maker games better. So cool. I'm glad that's out there a little bit goodwill that they're putting out there.
6719000	6727000	Yeah. And this was kind of the thing I was alluding to at the top of the show we talked about what could their marketplace kind of give on others.
6728000	6738000	Although I think we kind of arrived at well since unreal is still making money off of steam games. It's not something they're going to really lock away but it definitely pushes this narrative that we saw you know Sony kind of resisting for a little bit.
6738000	6749000	It's definitely kind of wondering so cross play is the future get on maybe the whole cross play thing though with you know being able to like log in and something that maybe you need an unreal account or an epic account to do that.
6750000	6758000	Wouldn't that be interesting. But I mean that's free. So it's not horrible but it's you know signing up for that newsletter so we can tell you about those sales.
6758000	6768000	You can uncheck that. I guess it's interesting why we are in chat says sounds like it sounds like at least a sprinkling of the steam features that I mentioned earlier.
6769000	6783000	But see the thing though is that is something that you can also still use on steam because they're not locking it down to their stores. They're basically saying it's going to be available for you know all engines so you can use in unity any platform any storefront.
6784000	6803000	So it's going to be kind of its own separate API type stuff. Neat. All right. Well let's move on and talk about Carmen San Diego coming to Netflix. Now you know if twitch muting wasn't a thing I would play that Rockefeller song right now but maybe Loki can give us a rendition.
6803000	6818000	No. No I do. I tried everybody. I tried. All right. Anyway but I don't know who's looking forward to this. It looks like could be interesting. The Carmen San Diego series on Netflix is coming out January 19th 2019.
6819000	6829000	So now there's some new images that are out there. Entertainment Weekly has a whole preview of the 20 episode series. So it's like an animated kids thing like half hour little bits and pieces.
6830000	6846000	It will be divided into two parts. Carmen's enigmatic past that led to the criminal career and the present day heists that take place around the world. Gina Rodriguez will be voicing Carmen San Diego and also will star in a live action film in 2019.
6847000	6862000	So that's kind of that's pretty cool. I like to get the Carmen San Diego Cinematic Universe. Can we get like you know maybe all the other PBS edutainment like Cinematic Universe. You know we'll get like Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street reading Rainbow Square one television math net.
6862000	6877000	It's all together. Yeah just one giant like a fighter game. Absolutely. Yeah absolutely. So yeah they released some screenshots and so forth. It kind of looks like this particular Web site is talking about it looks like an old flash animation which makes me think of like strong bad and things like that.
6878000	6887000	I don't know. I think it looks a little better than that. But yeah it could be it could be interesting to see those old games wrong Brad needs his own Netflix show. Yeah.
6888000	6900000	See it to bury in chat says it's a shame that Rita Moreno isn't going to continue being The Voice. She's still on another Netflix show. She's in that once upon a time reboot which I think has another season still coming and it's it's great.
6900000	6910000	I mean it has nothing to do with games but it's great. And if you're like oh but it's the 70s show reboot it's it's it's completely different. Like yes same character ideas they totally made it different.
6910000	6921000	So that's where you can see Rita Moreno if you if you want to at least there's that. So Bobby Black Wolf and Chad says Carmen San Diego math net square one. They're all here.
6921000	6933000	Hey there's some really crazy ass rumors about DLC characters upcoming that they might all be from other series and stuff. So who knows. Who knows math. Yeah.
6934000	6943000	Oh sorry. See debris correct me it's one day at a time. Not once upon a time. I guess I'm thinking of the and the ABC series with all the Disney characters one day at a time.
6944000	6958000	Dar Tetsuya over in the twitch chat suggesting Oregon Trail the movie. I'm kind of surprised. I mean I'm sure they've done like westerns and more historically tilted pieces but I'm surprised they haven't done like the game the movie.
6958000	6969000	You know what I mean. The Oregon Trail. Just make it a game show. How would that work. I don't know. The Oregon Trail game show. Yeah but you have to do like physical challenges to like not die.
6969000	6983000	And then you make do we for the river do it. Well I'm seeing debris points out Carmen San Diego and Oregon Trail both have card games now so you can you can make those life altering decisions in the card game.
6983000	6994000	So there's that is that not not good enough for you. We should just mix the two decks together then we have where in the Oregon Trail is Carmen San Diego. Yeah I like that. That is good.
6994000	7008000	We'll leave it at that with the catch up to her but we're going to die of dysentery. We don't let you move on and do a couple more stories and we're going to try to open up the Skype line. I say try because this part we haven't been able to test so well.
7008000	7018000	So I'm a little worried it might not work. So we're going to try our best. If we aren't able to get Skype calls though I think we have some unused stories we get into a few more things we probably just talk about to buy us a little more time here tonight.
7019000	7033000	But for now Loki with a few more stories for us. So apparently Charles Martin a voice of many things including one iconic character Super Mario.
7033000	7048000	He has made a world record for the most times voicing a single character. So and when we reached for comment Charles Martin a said woohoo.
7048000	7068000	So basically he's voiced Mario 100 times in 100 different performances. So a hundred times. Are there that many Mario games or like things that feature Mario. I guess maybe. Yeah. Did he do commercials for the cereal and that stuff. Maybe I guess it seems like a lot.
7069000	7082000	Kids won't eat that cereal. It's still sitting there. I'll eat it. Bring it over. Is it expired. I don't think I would eat it if it's stale. It's they eat some of the marshmallows and like these aren't as good as Lucky Charms. We're not eating this crap anymore.
7082000	7094000	I'm like but you had me buy that for you. What the hell. We want more fruit loops. Why we are in chat suggests I was going to say how is it only a hundred times. I don't know.
7095000	7111000	Well unfortunately there Mario shown up in more than 100 games but he's only been voice acted since what the end 64 era. Yeah. Yeah. And that was kind of barely at that. So although Mario never really talks in full sentences. It's always like you know.
7111000	7117000	Well yeah. Well it's just what that's what it is. Don't give me that look.
7120000	7121000	All right.
7123000	7130000	Fine. Lastly he did. He did voices for Skyrim 2 which I'm on a meant Charles Martin who didn't do a voice for Skyrim.
7132000	7137000	I didn't hear Mario and Scott. Well maybe I haven't played the switch version so maybe he was in Skyrim.
7138000	7150000	He's been in other games though. He was in a bit trip runner 3 Mario. I'm sorry. No Mario. Sorry runner 2. Yeah. And he's like even in the intro he's like this is Charles Martin and you're playing runner 2 or something like that.
7150000	7163000	So he's he's shown up in other stuff. He doesn't just do Mario. OK. Yeah. All right. But I'm. Hey I think. Was he like an official representative of Nintendo or something. I thought he was. He should be by now. I think he was the early day.
7163000	7171000	That's how he was found. Anyway let's move on and talk about lastly tonight our last official story tonight anyway that you'll see over on the lovely sidebar over there.
7172000	7183000	The ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum if you're on this side of the pond. Many people notice that ZX Spectrum is getting a new game 30 years after it's been finished. That's right.
7183000	7194000	It's a new game called Quadron a new developer a developer Andy Beal who goes by Cosmium online finished the game Quadron back in 1998.
7194000	7210000	But the publisher that he was working with Palace Software kind of just left it behind. So there was no label and no future. So he ended up doing other stuff like he did theme park on the Sega Mega Drive the conversion there Sega Saturn racer called high octane.
7210000	7231000	But I'm assuming some type of copyright or hold must have expired now that it's been 30 years. So this game Quadron which is kind of like robot on 2084 is now being released UK publication retro gamer reached out Andy Beal dug out the title and did a little tweaking little engineering.
7231000	7243000	And now you can check it out. You can buy it if you want on itch.io for five bucks which apparently I didn't realize this itch.io has like a pretty big library of ZX Spectrum games.
7243000	7255000	So that's kind of neat. So yeah classic computing you know I'm going to end the first twitch show officially anyway with a with a ZX Spectrum or a retro story that's for sure.
7255000	7267000	So anyway I'm going to chat over at live.lognetwork.com which is now linked to our twitch chat. See it Tabiri says Mega Man ZX Spectrum Quadrant.
7267000	7277000	Why not. Why not do it that way. Let's do it. All right. I think it's time that we open up the Skype line. We're going to try this and it may or may not actually work.
7277000	7285000	It may be a little bit flaw filled but we're going to try it and we're going to take your calls on our Skype line so you can go ahead.
7285000	7293000	And those of you that are actually watching on twitch. Yes I am kind of rigging this up as we go. And that's how it's going to have to work this week.
7293000	7305000	So they're coming up on the desktop not on my iPad. I don't know iPad or I want them on my iPad not the desktop. So let me quit on the desktop and see if that makes them roll over to the iPad.
7305000	7314000	That's what I need. So yeah we're figuring this out live. So while I attempt to take a phone call Loki maybe you have a last minute story or a few that you want to get into.
7314000	7328000	Yeah we could talk about there was an Infinity Blade that was added to Fortnite because you know Epic made a game called Infinity Blade and apparently the Infinity Blade was too overpowered and ended up coming up in some tournaments and stuff like that and screwed with the balance of the game.
7328000	7339000	So they have vaulted the Infinity Blade because it was too epic for the game and they're going to reevaluate and re balance it.
7339000	7357000	I actually saw some gameplay of people playing with it and basically allowed you to destroy any sort of structure with like one hit. It was kind of ridiculous but basically the way it ended up is anybody that was able to get the Infinity Blade pretty much ended up winning the game.
7357000	7371000	So that definitely needed to go. So that's the thing. I mentioned Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse so because that of course just came out in theaters.
7371000	7394000	But Sony wants you to preorder that digital copy when that's going to be coming out on the PlayStation storefront as well. So you can preorder that and if you do preorder that you also get a nice into the Spider-Verse skin the Miles Morales Spider-Man skin for your character in the Spider-Man game.
7394000	7403000	So definitely check that out. Which by the way I'd like to mention if you haven't seen the movie yet there is a post credits scene that apparently is really awesome.
7403000	7412000	I did not stay for it because my kids would not want to stay that long past the credits but apparently is really awesome and involves Spider-Man 2099.
7412000	7422000	But I wanted to see that but I didn't get to. I'll just have to wait for the digital version of the movie to come out before I actually get to see that unfortunately.
7422000	7428000	Questbuster over in the Twitch chat agrees the post credits scene was really good.
7428000	7438000	Oh man. I guess I'll just have to see the movie again. Which I do want to see it again. Just it's going to be a while. Can't see the kids again.
7439000	7442000	Still want popcorn in me.
7442000	7448000	Alright the Skype is still open. I see missed calls but I don't see current calls coming in. Like they're not ringing through.
7448000	7454000	But you can see that people have tried to call but unfortunately it's not ringing through over to ye olde iPads.
7454000	7455000	Apparently Skype sucks.
7455000	7463000	I don't know if it's just the fact that my iPad is old which is certainly possible but for whatever reason it's not coming through with the calls.
7463000	7467000	So that may be unfortunate. What can we do?
7467000	7475000	Going to chat. Tigerclaw says you gotta teach your kids to stay during the credits because they will miss out on the goodies.
7475000	7484000	I know but the problem was that they had to use the bathroom and so I'm glad that they at least survived through the movie.
7484000	7491000	But you can't tell a four year old that sorry you can't go pee right now.
7491000	7494000	We gotta wait to watch this funny bit of movie.
7494000	7498000	And Bobby says kids wouldn't understand the goodies actually.
7498000	7503000	Let's do that. I'll just go see it by myself then. Again.
7503000	7507000	Any other last minute stories for us tonight?
7507000	7514000	Sadly Skype does not appear to be ringing through. This may be a bust tonight. It's one of those things I'm going to have to work on this week.
7514000	7517000	It's alright. It can't be 100%.
7518000	7521000	Oh I wonder if I can use my phone. I'm going to try using my phone.
7521000	7524000	There you go. The powers of your phone.
7524000	7530000	There's apparently been a discovered game that's available through MAME now.
7530000	7541000	Sega Sonic Brothers. It's a puzzle game that kind of looks like columns or maybe even Puzzle Fighter a little bit.
7541000	7549000	But it's like this. Yeah I can't really tell how it looks like.
7549000	7552000	Oh it looks like a little bit like maybe Puyo Puyo.
7552000	7557000	But apparently it's some unreleased game that you can go check out if you want to play the other game.
7557000	7563000	I don't know where exactly they have this but I'm sure it's out there on the internet somewhere you can find it.
7564000	7568000	They're doing a board game for Metal Gear Solid. That's pretty cool.
7568000	7577000	The Metal Gear Solid by Emerson Matsuchi.
7577000	7581000	And it's coming I guess from IDW Games.
7581000	7586000	They're going to be demoing it at E3 2019.
7586000	7591000	So hey you got something that's going to be at E3 since everybody else is skipping out on it.
7591000	7597000	So check that out. I'm not sure that's going to be in the Konami booth.
7597000	7603000	I would assume that's in some IDW Games booth but it looks neat.
7603000	7606000	I'm curious to see how you play it.
7606000	7611000	But I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
7611000	7613000	I'll say this probably in GameStop someday.
7613000	7614000	That's kind of a weird thing.
7614000	7619000	They have since they carry a lot of this geek stuff now.
7619000	7622000	There's a ton of fucking board games in that place.
7622000	7624000	So I think I actually got the Skype thing to work.
7624000	7629000	So if you don't mind I'm going to try to take a call.
7629000	7631000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7631000	7633000	Hey it's Brad from Pod Culture.
7633000	7634000	Hey it's working.
7634000	7638000	Hey I think it's working. I just have to make sure it's broadcasting to Twitch and they can hear him over there too.
7638000	7640000	But I think it should be. What's on your mind Brad?
7641000	7646000	Oh just figured I'd call in on your first Twitch livestream there.
7646000	7650000	Well and yeah and the folks are confirming they hear it and I see the bars going up and down.
7650000	7658000	Well I can think of no better person to be one of our first callers here than one of our long time podcasting peers.
7658000	7662000	I know you guys sunsetted Pod Culture a little bit ago but I'm sure you'll come up with something new soon.
7662000	7666000	Oh there's already something in the works and stuff recorded for.
7666000	7668000	That's how it works sometimes.
7668000	7671000	Well what's on your mind tonight? Anything in gaming that you want to talk about tonight?
7671000	7676000	Oh just figured I'd call and test the lines that you're having problems there.
7676000	7678000	Well I appreciate that.
7678000	7681000	Well we hear you. We hear you loud and clear. We're all good.
7681000	7684000	So thank you for being the first kitty pig here on Twitch.
7684000	7690000	Which I can kind of show there. Brad is there live with us.
7692000	7694000	He's captured in the phone.
7694000	7697000	He's a man in a box. That's right. It's just like the Superman movies.
7698000	7700000	It's like the Superman movies.
7700000	7707000	Oh my God. We totally need like a screen or something where we can have like the people just like right there on the desk.
7707000	7711000	It's so much better than having to actually in the actual stream.
7711000	7714000	I just want them like on the desk talking you know.
7714000	7716000	Yeah like on old game shows or something.
7716000	7720000	It's like Conan O'Brien and stuff with like the heads.
7720000	7725000	If I'd been more prepared I'd have the lights set up better so you could see the studio.
7725000	7731000	That's okay. You can you can barely see shit on my tiny little iPhone but there you go.
7731000	7733000	It's fantastic.
7733000	7737000	That's right. All right. There you go. All right. Brad take care. We're gonna try to get some other calls. Okay.
7737000	7739000	All right. I'm glad it's working.
7739000	7741000	All right. Take care buddy.
7741000	7742000	Peace.
7742000	7749000	All right. That was our pal Brad who used to be with the show Pod Culture and I think we have another call coming right in.
7749000	7754000	So what the hey we're going to get to this call too and see what is on this person's mind.
7754000	7760000	And of course they hung up right as I answered it. So I have to keep plugging on plate.
7760000	7763000	You know I have to keep doing this because of the ringtone.
7763000	7768000	I don't want the ringtone coming through while you're trying to talk about a story or something like that.
7768000	7770000	So I have to do this.
7770000	7773000	Well it will work for now. It'll work for now.
7773000	7776000	And I think the call is coming back in. We're going to try to take it this time.
7777000	7780000	God damn it. Stop hanging up after you get through.
7780000	7782000	All right.
7782000	7786000	I do like all the comments and chat about Brad being trapped in the box there.
7786000	7789000	Call Superman and all that stuff.
7789000	7793000	Tiger class says you can mute the ringtone. You can on desktop. Can you do it on mobile.
7793000	7795000	If you can. That's news to me.
7795000	7800000	I thought that was a thing they that like you can't mute.
7800000	7803000	We're learning about live right now.
7804000	7807000	All right. Well the call's coming in one more time. I'm going to try to take this.
7807000	7810000	So hopefully the person doesn't. They keep hanging up.
7810000	7813000	Maybe it's not connecting on the iPhone or something.
7813000	7816000	Well obviously it worked a second ago. It's true. It worked a second ago.
7816000	7819000	I don't know. All right. We'll see if anybody else gets through. I don't know.
7819000	7825000	But it's Orange Laundry all one word on Skype and we'll try to take one or two more calls.
7825000	7828000	And then we'll we'll close up shop.
7828000	7838000	Well there is a new rhythm game called Rhythm Land that's coming to the Famicom and Mega Drive in Japan in 2019.
7838000	7842000	And it's like Rhythm Heaven. It has four mini games.
7842000	7845000	Where you have to press a button in sync with music.
7845000	7850000	And they have 20 songs and other surprises.
7850000	7852000	I like that it's on the Mega Drive.
7852000	7854000	Yeah. It's old school.
7854000	7861000	It says apparently you can you can preorder that now on Amazon Japan for six thousand four hundred fifty eight yen.
7861000	7865000	And it's going to be out February 15th.
7865000	7868000	And they're also going to have a preorder up on Play Asia at some point.
7868000	7870000	I haven't been to in a while.
7870000	7873000	Probably going to regret going there.
7873000	7874000	Let's play Asia.
7874000	7877000	Oh yeah. Because they're like oh I want that and that and that.
7877000	7879000	Oh and then you start buying the whole house down that.
7879000	7881000	Yeah. It's a struggle.
7881000	7883000	But it looks cool.
7883000	7889000	Like even on the cards are pretty awesome since they're going to be printing those and everything.
7889000	7891000	They're running girl music baseball.
7891000	7895000	Melodian Shield Earth Crisis.
7895000	7896000	It's like well game.
7896000	7900000	Let me answer this quick question from Jirama and chat kind of a technical question about our setup here.
7900000	7905000	Jirama wants to know is Skype on the computer you're at and connected to the mixer.
7905000	7907000	So yes it's connected to the mixer.
7907000	7908000	But here's the crazy part.
7908000	7917000	So we can do the mixer into the computer here that is doing audio dedicated stuff.
7917000	7918000	That works fine.
7918000	7924000	That's how we were able to do the call with Bobby because we just did it on this computer here because we didn't need it to go out on Twitch for y'all.
7924000	7930000	The problem is the audio from this computer when we try to hook it back in the mixing board it's coming through on crap quality.
7930000	7932000	And I think it's because I either have some type of short.
7932000	7935000	I don't think so though unless the short is in that little adapter.
7935000	7942000	So I have to try getting a new one of those but I'm trying to get to try to get a RCA because I remember on the old mixing board you had like an RCA that went in.
7942000	7944000	And that's like how we used to do it back in the day.
7944000	7947000	So all right.
7947000	7950000	So I guess we're going to close up Skype for now.
7950000	7955000	We'll try we'll try harder to work on that next week and we won't imprison you in a box.
7955000	7957000	I promise no promises.
7957000	7958000	OK maybe no promises.
7958000	7959000	Maybe a small box.
7959000	7964000	Actually I would love to be able to take that on the iPad and then have you there.
7964000	7966000	So all right.
7966000	7970000	Anyway I guess I guess that's it.
7970000	7975000	Are we are we.
7975000	7977000	Let's see.
7977000	7984000	I guess that's yeah that's unfortunately there's not a whole lot other news this week.
7984000	7986000	Worth mentioning I want to say.
7986000	7993000	But I'm sure there'll be stuff next week that we get to check out.
7994000	7995000	I don't know.
7995000	7998000	Oh I was going to mention there is one thing I did read.
7998000	8006000	Apparently there do I think they opened up that beta for the Google streaming platform to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
8006000	8013000	And if you do that between now and sometime in January that you can actually get Assassin's Creed Odyssey for free.
8013000	8015000	They'll give you a copy of it.
8015000	8017000	So that's something you're interested in checking out.
8017000	8019000	I mean you should probably check it out anyways because it sounds like a neat idea.
8019000	8021000	But hey free game.
8021000	8022000	Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
8022000	8023000	That's not bad.
8023000	8024000	Yeah for you.
8024000	8025000	Check that out.
8025000	8026000	I've been wanting to check that out too.
8026000	8027000	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
8027000	8029000	So yeah.
8029000	8031000	And some folks are asking about the hardware.
8031000	8035000	So I haven't really gotten into it yet because it's not final.
8035000	8039000	But basically we're using we're using a Mac and a PC.
8039000	8043000	It's a little bit of a buy a computer world here.
8043000	8048000	So the Mac is dedicated to the video portion and everything you guys are seeing on Twitch.
8048000	8050000	That's all handled over there.
8050000	8053000	And it's going to be the more portable part.
8053000	8054000	It's actually a Mac Mini.
8054000	8055000	It's one of the new ones.
8055000	8057000	So it's going to be the very portable part of our show.
8057000	8061000	So when we're able to come to a convention near you which I hope will be a thing we can do.
8061000	8063000	Or cover more like local gigs.
8063000	8066000	That'll kind of be our piece that moves around with it.
8066000	8068000	Now for when we're doing shows in house.
8068000	8072000	We have kind of like a hybrid old computer with new stuff.
8072000	8075000	And Rama has been very helpful in that whole process there.
8075000	8081000	So that is going to be the part that for now is capturing audio.
8081000	8083000	But I think that will move to the Mac long term.
8083000	8084000	Jamie and I have a plan on that.
8084000	8089000	And then for this old computer it's going to be kind of the one thing that drops in the incidentals.
8089000	8091000	So I can bring in more background music.
8091000	8092000	More things like that.
8092000	8095000	And I continue to send the signal out to the mixing board that way.
8095000	8099000	Plus I need a place to do my stories and to look at chat and all that stuff.
8099000	8101000	So I've always kind of needed my own thing as well.
8101000	8103000	Just like how Loki has his laptop.
8103000	8107000	Because my laptop is probably older than this thing so it wouldn't work for something like that.
8107000	8109000	So there you go.
8109000	8111000	I guess I can talk about one more story here.
8111000	8112000	Yeah.
8112000	8113000	This was the whole.
8113000	8115000	I have a chat comment and then we'll close up.
8115000	8118000	So there's this new Minecraft thing that's going on right now.
8118000	8120000	This Paws and Claws pack.
8120000	8122000	So they're doing like a charitable thing.
8122000	8124000	So they can't do 4K but they can do the charity.
8124000	8125000	Yeah they can do the charity.
8125000	8128000	So it's going towards the World Wildlife Fund.
8129000	8131000	And basically it's going to...
8131000	8137000	Any proceeds on the pack sold between now and December 11, 2021.
8137000	8139000	So it's going to be going for quite a while.
8139000	8142000	They're going to donate money towards that.
8142000	8145000	Or all the proceeds are going to be donated to that.
8145000	8147000	And on top of that as an added incentive.
8147000	8154000	Microsoft's going to donate $100,000 once 10 million bamboo blocks have been placed in the game.
8154000	8156000	So you get those blocks and you place them.
8156000	8161000	And then once it ticks up to 10 million they're going to donate another $100,000.
8161000	8163000	But I guess we have a long time for that.
8163000	8164000	Yeah.
8164000	8165000	So alright.
8165000	8167000	One other chat comment.
8167000	8171000	Tigerclaw wants to know our reaction to the Sonic the Hedgehog movie poster.
8171000	8177000	Which I forgot that was like all around the Twitters and all that this week was the reaction to the Sonic poster.
8177000	8179000	It's in the theaters too.
8179000	8183000	Yeah there's the one in the dark that somebody lightened up and it was kind of like.
8183000	8187000	It was probably like when you saw us on Twitch for the first time and what we really looked like.
8187000	8190000	It was like you know it was kind of a very gross reaction.
8190000	8191000	No I'm kidding.
8191000	8195000	But Sonic the Hedgehog lightened up and that poster was kind of scary looking.
8195000	8198000	And then there's that other weird poster with like his legs up in the air.
8198000	8199000	That's the one that's in theaters.
8199000	8200000	Oh is it?
8200000	8201000	Yeah it's interesting.
8201000	8204000	They had it in the main lobby in the theater they went to this weekend.
8204000	8206000	And I mean I don't know.
8206000	8208000	It's supposed to be a kids movie right?
8208000	8211000	Yeah but.
8211000	8213000	It's for kids but adults will get it.
8213000	8214000	Like is that kind of where they're going with it?
8214000	8215000	I don't know.
8215000	8220000	I'd be curious to see what it looks like but.
8220000	8221000	I don't know.
8221000	8224000	I I'm interested to see how it goes.
8224000	8225000	I'll leave it.
8225000	8226000	That's probably the nicest way I could put it.
8226000	8227000	I'm interested to see.
8227000	8228000	I like Jim Carrey.
8228000	8230000	I'll go see it because Jim Carrey is in it.
8230000	8232000	I mean.
8232000	8234000	But.
8234000	8236000	Yeah.
8236000	8237000	Yeah.
8237000	8238000	But I'll tell you this much.
8238000	8240000	You know going back to Spider-Man again.
8240000	8245000	So Spider-Man's actually into the Spider-Verse was done by the same guys that did the Lego movie.
8245000	8246000	And.
8246000	8249000	Oh God was the other movie that they did was also really good.
8249000	8252000	I don't remember the other movie that they worked on as well but.
8252000	8255000	All the movies that they've done have been fantastic.
8255000	8259000	Too bad they aren't making the Sonic movie because then that would be pretty awesome but.
8259000	8260000	No.
8260000	8262000	I'm down for the Lego movie too.
8262000	8264000	It comes out in February 14th.
8264000	8265000	All right.
8265000	8269000	Well I think it's about time to get final thoughts and close up our very first Twitch episode.
8269000	8270000	Which was a little shorter.
8270000	8272000	Sometimes this show runs 3 hours.
8272000	8275000	Tonight it was probably what maybe like 2 hours 50 minutes.
8275000	8276000	Yeah well I mean it's you know.
8276000	8278000	All the winner breaks are going to start next week.
8278000	8280000	And we just had all the big game releases.
8280000	8281000	So it is starting to slow down a little bit.
8281000	8283000	But I feel like we still have some substantial stuff to talk about.
8283000	8287000	And obviously we're thrilled that those of you guys came out to join us on Twitch tonight.
8287000	8288000	And this is the new norm.
8288000	8290000	So this is going to be.
8290000	8294000	Well I mean things will get the Skype stuff working and there will be other upgrades here and there.
8294000	8297000	But the good news is it can only go uphill from here.
8297000	8299000	So that's going to be what we're working on.
8299000	8302000	So be prepared for some more streams throughout the week.
8302000	8303000	Just some random stuff.
8303000	8305000	If you're not already following us here at VOG Network.
8305000	8307000	Please consider doing that.
8307000	8311000	Because we're going to be doing more like streams throughout the week.
8311000	8313000	Because we want to try to hit that affiliate status.
8313000	8316000	So that you know we can get all the perks that come with that.
8316000	8317000	Partner might be a little harder.
8317000	8319000	But because you have to stream a lot for that.
8319000	8320000	But you know we'll see.
8320000	8321000	Who knows.
8321000	8323000	We get enough shows that want to be a part of this.
8323000	8324000	Who knows.
8324000	8325000	Who knows what is possible.
8325000	8326000	We'll see.
8326000	8327000	So but thank you guys again for showing up.
8327000	8328000	I hope you enjoyed it.
8328000	8332000	I hope everything you wanted and more to watch the show being done.
8332000	8336000	And for the podcast listeners I hope you guys really kind of felt that not a lot really changed.
8336000	8338000	You're still getting the same audio that you're used to.
8338000	8341000	Except you don't get to see my reaction and my playing up to the camera.
8341000	8342000	That's the one thing that you're missing.
8342000	8347000	So which I guess I'm already seeing clips come through with some of that.
8347000	8349000	So that'll be that'll be pretty cool to look at that later.
8349000	8351000	So all right.
8351000	8352000	It's time to get final thoughts.
8352000	8354000	Thank you guys as always for listening to the show.
8354000	8358000	If you enjoyed what you heard leave us a five star review on iTunes Google Play on Twitch.
8358000	8359000	You can't really review things on Twitch.
8359000	8360000	But tell your friends.
8360000	8361000	That's all we ever ask.
8361000	8363000	We're not begging for your money.
8363000	8365000	All we ask is that you tell a friend or two about the show.
8365000	8368000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8368000	8373000	But we can only you know spread spread those get more voices here if they're being brought to us.
8373000	8375000	So we really appreciate all of that.
8375000	8379000	So I guess I'll let you start with an actual final thought tonight Loki.
8379000	8383000	So I'm going to hopefully be streaming some more this week.
8383000	8386000	I'm maybe doing fifth mix.
8386000	8391000	I'm hoping they'd be doing set mania very soon since I have the whole set up.
8391000	8397000	Most the hardware portion of that I think is out of the way and hopefully I'm not going to have any hitches with that.
8397000	8401000	So I'm hoping to get that set up sooner than later.
8401000	8404000	Really just the theme right now is holding me up.
8404000	8409000	But then once I I picked out some songs I need to put steps to and stuff that I want to do.
8409000	8413000	The problem is like I saw there's this skin that they have for pump it up called rave it out.
8413000	8416000	That's really elaborate and I like it.
8416000	8431000	I can adapt that unfortunately to work for what I need to do but I'd like to do something similar to that just because they have it like where when you're selecting your song and actually plays like a video preview with the background video looks like and that's just really fucking cool.
8431000	8433000	I just don't know how feasible that's going to be.
8433000	8445000	And then also I need to make sure it's running smoothly because all of the ones I've seen like even the DDR ace the 2014 stuff that just it's it's not smooth enough for what I want.
8445000	8449000	I want it to be like buttery smooth and it should be on the hardware that I'm running.
8449000	8452000	So we'll see.
8452000	8455000	So yeah I'm hopefully going to do that and hopefully play some more games this week.
8455000	8457000	All right.
8457000	8464000	My final thought for tonight is I'm excited to exhale that we got through the first video show and it worked.
8464000	8466000	And I'm just very psyched about all that.
8466000	8471000	And I'm really I taught myself how to use stuff like light works and movie editing software that I never thought I'd use.
8471000	8474000	I taught myself how to use all that this week and that was it was awesome.
8474000	8479000	And again I guess here at the end did you make the fancy vogue thing or is that by.
8479000	8482000	No I think code man did that a while ago we actually lifted that.
8483000	8484000	But the whole.
8484000	8486000	See it's not on the podcast but the whole.
8486000	8489000	You can't do that on television inspired thing which yes I do play.
8489000	8490000	I sat down.
8490000	8500000	We were at a restaurant with Alan and Jamie and I were all at a restaurant with that whole idea like to do that came up because it's the thing that Dragon Con TV has done as well.
8500000	8502000	So we just started spitting out all these ideas.
8502000	8505000	Obviously I can't repeat them now because we're going to use them in the future.
8505000	8511000	But I'm like oh I got so many ideas but I use light works to make that as well and some of the other little things that you see here.
8511000	8513000	So I need to do stuff like that.
8513000	8518000	And we'll also like I need to go into like cinema 40 and stuff because I need to make.
8518000	8521000	I need to make videos stuff for my semi skin.
8521000	8523000	Yeah.
8523000	8525000	At least I'd like to do that.
8525000	8530000	Let's be honest I mean I don't want to overcomplicate things like I do with everything I do.
8530000	8537000	But the nice thing is I mean I can't do with a three hour show I can't do the level of B roll that like Bobby is doing on his show.
8537000	8543000	I think I mean we can do some but we can look into you know this nice little thing makes it really easy to just drop in video.
8543000	8548000	Like as long as I kind of have it on here ready to go like it's really easy to drop in video and keep talking over it and all that stuff.
8548000	8549000	Yeah.
8549000	8555000	So you know that's something we can look at doing in the future is not necessarily just going to be our ugly mugs on stream the entire time.
8555000	8556000	But do we get other stuff.
8556000	8557000	Yeah we can do that.
8557000	8558000	Oh you don't take it offline.
8558000	8559000	You know what else I did.
8559000	8560000	Yeah.
8560000	8561000	In light works the classic game of the week thing.
8561000	8562000	Yeah.
8562000	8567000	For the first time when you were watching on Twitch you got to see the game that she was talking about.
8567000	8568000	I did that online works.
8568000	8574000	So of course learning credit to also I think then Jason used to put stuff like that and he did.
8574000	8577000	You know this isn't necessarily our first foray into video.
8577000	8586000	We were on Justin TV a long long time ago with the simulcast which talked about the top of the show VX Jason X to be or simply Jason if you will who is our continuing voiceover guy.
8587000	8593000	He's done more for the show than you guys could possibly imagine especially when it comes to being able to download the podcast in the first place.
8593000	8598000	But yeah Jason also for a short time was putting these shows on YouTube.
8598000	8603000	I mean it was just kind of like the picture with the audio but then like he'd go in and spice it up.
8603000	8605000	He'd be put in some of the classic of the week over it.
8605000	8609000	He when we did a list list he did a whole little thing where he actually showed it on there.
8609000	8611000	So he tried to make it a little more exciting.
8611000	8617000	But you know now that video is getting easier and easier and cheaper more importantly to self produce.
8617000	8625000	I think you know this is something that we can kind of keep doing on Twitch and you know have the audio here and all that.
8625000	8626000	So pretty cool.
8626000	8628000	Anyway I guess that's it.
8628000	8630000	I think we're done right here.
8630000	8631000	So we'll see you next time.
8631000	8632000	Thanks again for coming out tonight.
8632000	8636000	You know and we did our very first show ever on my 365.
8636000	8639000	We had 12 people show up and we had we had a few more tonight.
8639000	8641000	So that was great.
8641000	8643000	It wasn't hundreds and hundreds.
8643000	8647000	But it feels really good especially we see a lot of old faces from the past and some new faces too.
8647000	8648000	Hope you enjoyed the show.
8648000	8649000	Thanks for being here.
