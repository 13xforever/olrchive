0	17320	This week, Rockstar draws on its years of experience with GTA Online and brings the
17320	18680	experience to the Wild West.
18680	21760	Gather your posse and get rootin', lootin' and shootin' without threat of the giant death
21760	22760	ray.
22760	23760	That's just one story on the home stretch of the year.
23760	26520	Join us for the rest of the night's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where
26520	29520	every gamer has their voice.
29520	33720	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
33720	34720	Welcome back.
34720	36840	It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36840	43640	Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 754 for this December the 2nd of 2018.
43640	47760	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and
47760	52000	gaming culture, the gamer's lifestyle, all that good stuff, with my co-hosts.
52000	53000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
53000	54000	Hello.
54000	55000	Hi, Loki, how are you?
55000	56000	I'm fine.
56000	57000	Yeah, me too.
57000	58000	I'm fine too.
58000	59000	Did you have a good week?
59000	60000	Yeah.
60000	65320	Looking forward to any of the big retail releases coming up, like Smash is big, I know you have
65320	70800	a Switch now, are you gonna pick up Smash, or maybe Katamari re-roll?
70800	71800	Maybe.
71800	73800	Sega Genesis Collection's gonna be pretty cool for retro fans.
73800	74800	Maybe.
74800	75800	I don't know.
75800	76800	I have to...
76800	79800	I'm spending money on kids, so you know.
79800	80800	I just...
80800	81800	Well, that's how it goes sometimes.
81800	85360	They don't know, but I've already purchased four more Switch games for myself.
85360	86360	Oh!
86360	87360	What'd you...
87360	88360	Well, of course you'd say.
88720	89720	Of course.
89720	90720	What'd you get them?
90720	91720	So...
91720	92720	Where did Santa get them?
92720	103800	Yeah, so Santa got them, well, my youngest son, the Lego Incredibles, and Lego DC Villains,
103800	104800	which is pretty cool.
104800	108640	And then for my older son, and they made Switch between stuff too.
108640	111080	And you play those Lego games as much as they do.
111080	112520	Not on the Switch so much.
112520	116200	Actually, they've been playing more on the Switch, but anyways.
116240	120640	So Hello Neighbor and Bendy and the Ink Machine.
120640	121640	Oh, okay.
121640	123680	Hello Neighbor is that scary game, isn't it?
123680	129560	Yes, speaking of scary games, so my oldest son's now has been playing Ultimate Custom
129560	134520	Night, which is the Five Nights at Freddy's build your own Five Nights at Freddy's game
134520	135520	type thing.
135520	136520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
136520	137520	So he's been playing that.
137520	138520	Well, that's fun.
138520	139520	Apparently in super easy mode.
139520	140520	Okay.
140520	141520	With no robots.
141520	145440	What's the point if you're playing with no robots in there?
145680	148360	It's like, cause I can beat it, like, okay.
148360	150400	It's safe.
150400	152040	Not very scary when it's done that way.
152040	153040	All right.
153040	154040	That's fine.
154040	155040	I respect that.
155040	158040	But my youngest son wants to play Hello Neighbor.
158040	162040	I think he won't like Bendy, but like I figured they've just, they're going to fight over
162040	163040	it.
163040	164040	They're going to fight over everything anyway.
164040	166040	It's going to be absolutely miserable because we only have one Switch and they're like,
166040	167040	I don't want to play this game.
167040	170040	I already have a headache thinking about it.
170040	171120	All right.
171120	173400	Not here tonight, Dark Sakura or JB Summers.
173400	176880	She's still on a work conflict for a little while, but she will join us later in the show
176880	180400	and she will be here in studio next week.
180400	182520	So let's jump right into some gaming news.
182520	185680	Well, let me do say if you are listening live, of course, over the voice geeks network of
185680	190120	vognetwork.com because that's where we tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific,
190120	192580	nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Block will show.
192580	197240	You can always join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com where Dungeon Buster does
197240	198880	say nice picks.
198880	201000	Bendy's on my game wishlist on Steam.
201000	202000	The demo was fun.
202720	206760	For kids and adults alike as a lot of great video games often are.
206760	207760	Yeah.
207760	211520	And they, the other one I wanted to get was the Lego Harry Potter collection because they've
211520	213040	just started watching Harry Potter.
213040	214040	Oh, okay.
214040	216040	So we were up to the, we just finished the third movie.
216040	217040	Okay.
217040	218040	So they're about as far as I am.
218040	220720	So, but they're like super into it now.
220720	225400	And so they would want to play that, but they didn't have that at GameStop.
225400	226400	So you know.
226400	227400	All right.
227400	228400	Fair enough.
228400	230640	Anyhow, Dark Sakura will be back with us next week, at least for a week.
230640	233040	She's still going to be on and off in the show through February.
233040	234880	Sadly, there's just nothing we can do about work.
234880	238480	Work is most important, but Loki and I still holding down the fort here with all you guys
238480	242660	in our live chat room soon to be over on Twitch TV in a couple of weeks.
242660	246320	So if you aren't following VOG Network, all one word over at Twitch, that's going to be
246320	248240	the new home for our live nights.
248240	251880	Again, podcast stuff, uh, still going to pretty much work how it always has.
251880	255840	It's just, instead of this whole shoutcast, Winamp, what's the link to the stream?
255840	258880	I think most people are very familiar with, oh, let me just pull out my phone and go to
258880	259880	that Twitch channel.
260120	261560	That's actually going to be a little easier, I think for most people.
261560	266000	So more details on that, uh, as we get closer and closer to the go live date, which is right
266000	268400	now targeted as December 16th.
268400	273640	Um, but it may go one way or the other, depending on how some of these computer issues work
273640	274640	out.
274640	275640	We shall see.
275640	279940	Uh, anyhow, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic because we got video game news going
279940	280940	on.
280940	283920	So let's talk about, even though you would think it's starting to slow down because the
283920	286120	holidays and maybe to an extent that's true.
286120	290160	And I say the holidays, cause really this, this whole period between Thanksgiving and
290160	295800	and Christmas and, and new years is the holidays because to be fair, Hanukkah started tonight.
295800	298360	So happy Hanukkah to all those that observe it for sure.
298360	300440	Um, but we're in that period called the holidays.
300440	305740	So usually not a lot of big gaming, uh, happening now, but we are still shy.
305740	307640	A few big gaming releases, right?
307640	312160	By the time I think about this, by the time you guys, you know, hear this, or by the time
312160	316040	we're doing our next episode, let's say the next episode we do super smash brothers old
316040	317120	ultimate will be a thing.
317120	321820	It will be out in the world as will Katamari and, and, uh, the Genesis collections of these
321820	325660	other games, you know, that are kind of at the tail end of the year here, uh, and hopefully
325660	329940	going to end up under some, you know, menorahs and some Christmas trees, uh, for, uh, folks
329940	330940	that sell.
330940	331940	Yeah.
331940	332940	And that's why I didn't get them smashed.
332940	334160	Cause we'll probably just get smashed anyways.
334160	335160	Yeah.
335160	340660	And besides like I was, I was at, like I said, I was at GameStop and only because I agreed
340660	343820	to go get ice cream for the family because they were watching the movie.
343820	344820	And so I just went over there.
344820	347140	I was like, well, I need to get some Christmas shopping done anyway.
347140	349140	I love the, had to justify why you were at GameStop.
349140	350140	It's fine.
350140	351140	It's fine.
351140	352140	I was just trying to explain why it's ridiculous.
352140	355620	Cause it games out there like, well, you know, we're not even going to have enough copies
355620	356820	of smash.
356820	358540	You know, people aren't going to be able to get one.
358540	364140	I'm like, or you could just buy it digitally and they're just an infinite amount of copies.
364140	365140	Yeah.
365140	368020	GameStop may need to change some of their, uh, yeah.
368020	370860	You know, I was at, not to derail a bit here because we do have a big thing we want to
370860	374500	get into, but I was at target just randomly, um, looking at stuff.
374500	377100	You know, we, we, we needed like paper towels or something.
377100	379060	So of course it turned into like a hundred dollar shopping trip.
379060	382680	Well, part of it is because I added one more mini machine to my collection.
382680	385700	So I now have a Galaga machine in my collection.
385700	388820	These are the mini little mini ones that are like 35 bucks to my arcade.
388820	390940	Uh, so I have that some of it from that collection.
390940	393760	I have Walmart's kind of $20 equivalent.
393760	395620	There are things you should get the $300 ones.
395620	397340	The ones that are like yay high or whatever.
397340	403220	Well, I told Santa AKA the guy I'm married to that, uh, I wanted that cause they have
403220	404500	like an $80 one.
404500	407540	That's a little bigger that has like bad dudes and stuff.
407540	412140	$300 might be a bit much when he's unemployed by now, but 80 eighties in the right range.
412140	413740	So I said I wanted that one.
413740	414740	That's a little bigger.
414740	415980	It's going to have to go like on the side or something.
415980	419740	If we get that one or, you know, you can just plug that in and I know and have all the games
419740	420860	that has bad dudes on it.
420860	421860	It doesn't.
421860	422860	I know.
422860	423860	I know.
423860	426460	Anyway, he's pointing at the, uh, the good old, uh, tabletop main machine that used to
426460	427860	be at his work many years ago.
427860	431700	If you're listening to show about three years ago or so, maybe God, maybe longer about 14.
431700	432700	Oh geez.
432700	433700	Okay.
433700	437100	So about four years ago, uh, that was, uh, when he brought that over here, it still has
437100	439540	the name of his company on the marquee, which is funny.
439540	440540	Yes.
440540	441540	All right.
441540	442540	Anyway, I promise gave me news.
442540	445580	So we still have a lot going on, especially around one recent release.
445580	446580	Right?
446580	447580	Low key.
447580	448580	A lot of news surrounding.
448580	449580	Yeah.
449580	450580	76.
450580	453360	I've watched my fair share of reviews on this.
453360	457900	I haven't picked it up because I just, I'm not re I wasn't too keen on it to begin with
457900	460780	because it was, you know, online with other people and stuff like that.
460780	466060	Maybe that's not such a big deal now, but it's just, it seems like it's a mess.
466060	470740	And so what kind of started things off, you know, people were kind of getting pissed off
470740	475020	the games just buggy and broken as shit and that there's just nothing that's really being
475020	476340	done to fix any of it.
476340	481500	So finally they came out, they made this big post on Reddit, uh, talking about like, we're
481500	486540	going to do some better communication in the future and here's what the fall of 76 team's
486540	487540	working on.
487540	491900	Um, so some of the improvements they're going to make a priority in the December 4th patch
491900	494180	is they're increasing the stash sizes.
494180	497820	So it's going to go up from 400 to 600 pounds.
497820	501460	And for those who don't play the game, the stash is basically you're kind of walking
501460	506420	chest that moves with you to any locations that you take over.
506420	514000	So you can, um, basically just be able to put more loot in there, um, improving loot
514000	519520	drops for tough bosses because apparently the drops haven't been very good or they may
519520	523160	not spawn very well, uh, enough things.
523160	525760	So they're going to improve that as well.
525760	532640	Um, they're saying that apparently people who have suffered glitches that caused them
532640	537620	to be remained or trapped inside their power armor will be able to come out of their power
537620	540640	armor because apparently that's a thing.
540640	545560	Um, and also they're saying that they're going to cut down on the excessive backtracking
545560	546560	in the game.
546560	552360	Um, cause apparently there was an issue where is forcing players that were over encumbered
552360	558240	to spawn back at vault 76 so you have to walk way back to where, Oh yikes, where your place
558240	559240	was.
559240	563200	And then, um, December 11th, they're adding push to talk on PC because why the hell that
563200	564200	wasn't there?
564200	565200	I don't know.
565200	566200	Oh boy.
566200	568760	This apparently being their first online game that they ever done and yet for some reason
568760	572640	they also had help from all these other teams including a team that has this massive game
572640	576280	called, you know, the elder scrolls online that you would think that they would have
576280	580160	like, so you'd be like, ah, you know, you probably should put that in there.
580160	581160	I know.
581160	583280	I was going to say it's, it's actually not the first online game they've ever done.
583280	587120	Cause technically Bethesda proper it is cause Bethesda online is another.
587120	588120	Okay.
588120	589120	All right.
589120	590120	Fair.
590120	591120	And all right, fine.
591120	592120	You got me out of technicality.
592120	593120	You're fine.
593120	595880	Cause I was even just thinking, uh, throughout all this news I was like, boy, like I, I,
595880	598120	you know, I'm not really a big fallout person.
598160	599960	I've never gotten into that series as much.
599960	600960	I've tried them.
600960	603920	I've played a little fallout three, a little fallout four, but I just, I don't get into
603920	607360	that series as much as maybe an elder scrolls game, uh, is something that I would get into
607360	608360	a little more.
608360	611740	And I was just thinking, I was like, gosh, I mean, if this was an elder scrolls online
611740	612740	game, I'd be really here too.
612740	613740	And I was like, wait a minute.
613740	615480	There was an elder scrolls online game.
615480	619200	I just didn't really get into that one either, but I don't remember that being, I mean, I
619200	621800	just might be seeing it through like rose tinted glasses or whatever.
621800	626160	I don't remember that game being that messy, but then again, I seem to remember when they
626160	628720	first brought out Tam, cause I didn't want to pay the monthly fee.
628720	630920	So I didn't get on it until it was Tamriel unlimited or whatever.
630920	631920	Yeah.
631920	634960	And when that first came out, like I think what was happening is like, things weren't
634960	639280	loading on my PlayStation four and I was like, why don't I see any of the things I'm supposed
639280	640280	to be doing?
640280	641480	And I think it was like those types of bugs.
641480	646560	So it's like, I just kind of broke it, not enough, like elder scrolls, Skyrim for me.
646560	651120	So I didn't want to play it, but I love, I would love a multiplayer Skyrim.
651120	655400	It's just, I'm not sure if they're going to be the ones to make that.
655400	660320	I think I'm ready for Bethesda to move on to elder scrolls six and see, see what happens
660320	661320	next.
661320	662320	So we'll see.
662320	663320	Okay.
663320	666120	So like one of the, like, but everything that's happening here does not make me feel great.
666120	671560	No, no, no, seriously, you know, prior to them, um, you know, releasing this statement
671560	676240	on Reddit, I mean, there was like people discovering, you know, stuff that's recycled from older
676240	677240	games.
677240	680480	Like, I mean, this is something they've been doing, like, you know, Skyrim, there's references
680480	686360	to like fallout three and this one there's references to follow for like checking to
686360	689920	make sure the fallout four disc is in the drive or some weird shit.
689920	690920	I don't know.
690920	691920	There's like a lot of recycled.
691920	697560	Well, I actually don't think that's as big of a crime as you might think because it's
697560	699760	common for games to get built on engine.
699760	700760	Right?
700760	703480	I mean, like, come on, if you were to play like a Madden game, you're going to see some
703480	709440	of the ghost stuff from fallout four, I think are being actually repurposed in this game
709440	710440	as well.
710440	714800	It's just, it looks like fallout four, um, except crap.
714800	719600	So, and then on top of that, there was some other stuff with camps where they're basically
719600	723400	allowing you to bulldoze the area so you can remove like rubble and stuff that's nearby
723400	725960	so that you can build a camp better.
725960	730480	And then also a way to relocate your camp to another server if there is somebody in
730480	734600	your camp space, because apparently like when you go offline, your camp is gone or whatever
734600	735920	it gets deleted.
735920	739080	If someone builds there, I don't know how it works, but it's stupid.
739240	744440	Um, so anyways, so they did all that and you know, the game was a buggy mess and people
744440	748240	were not very happy about that at the beginning, but at least there seemed to be like saying,
748240	752200	okay, well we're going to do something about that maybe.
752200	755660	Maybe they should have waited a few more months before releasing it, but unfortunately this
755660	762320	is Bethesda's now like, it's like the running gag in the industry is, you know, Oh, Bethesda's
762320	763760	games are never done when they release.
763760	764760	They're always buggy.
764760	768880	Like I, it just kind of blows my mind that anybody would preorder a Bethesda game at
768880	769880	this point.
769880	775320	But see that that's the point like buggy, yes, like Skyrim, buggy as fuck, still buggy
775320	776320	as fuck.
776320	778680	And, but there's an intriguing storyline.
778680	780200	The gameplay is good.
780200	781200	That's what you have.
781200	785040	Fallout 76 didn't have the great storyline, didn't have the intriguing gameplay.
785040	788160	And so now people are like, okay, well now these bugs are deal breaker.
788160	789160	I guess.
789160	790160	Okay.
790160	793080	I guess I can see that a little bit because red dead redemption is also buggy edition
793080	797760	too, but like it seems to be forgivable because a, the bugs are hilarious.
797760	801600	Like when the women, women gets hit by the horse that I saw in some video or like I was,
801600	803760	it was like one of my friends shared on Facebook today.
803760	806200	They were, they were walking through a mountainous area of train.
806200	808940	All of a sudden this horse just comes tumbling down the hill in the mountain.
808940	812120	So it was like kind of funny, but it isn't like game ruining.
812120	813120	But I get what you're saying.
813120	817960	Like, you know, red dead also has tons and tons and tons of story and all this other
817960	818960	stuff.
818960	819960	It's detailed.
819960	820960	Skyrim's the same way.
820960	826320	Fallout 76 because the whole MO story really, I mean, because it's, to be fair, it's not
826320	827320	really supposed to be.
827320	828320	It's supposed to be online.
828320	830640	You're, you and your friends build the world.
830640	836000	It's like MMOs have stories, but unfortunately to some of those stories are getting really
836000	837000	ugly.
837000	841620	I don't know if you read about that Twitch stream where, um, some guys, I think one guy
841620	845120	said off handed to some other player, like, Oh, your outfit's really cute.
845120	850160	And then they got basically called anti-gay slurs and hunted down by a squad that was basically
850160	851160	trying to kill him because they were gay.
851160	852160	Yeah.
852160	853160	And it was really disgusting.
853160	855920	And to Bethesda's credit, they, they banned that crap.
855920	858920	And they said, I don't want, we don't want this toxic shit in our game, which good for
858920	859920	them.
859920	864960	But you know, it's, it's G when you, when you throw all these people in a no man's wasteland,
864960	869000	it's almost as if the worst part of humanity comes out of people when they can hide behind
869000	870000	their monitor.
870000	871000	It's, it's kind of sad.
871000	876020	But then there's, of course, you know, the Bethesda fans who, you know, really did like
876020	881960	fallout 76 or fallout and they decided, Hey, I'm going to order that collector's edition
881960	884360	cause I got to have that power armor helmet and stuff like that.
884360	891020	And it comes with this really nice, you know, canvas bag and it's $200.
891020	892020	And so what happened?
892020	897200	Well, they got their, their $200 power armor edition and that canvas bag is not canvas.
897200	903640	It is a nylon cheap ass bag that they built and which it's, it's more of like, it's kind
903640	904640	of like this.
904640	909040	It's like if the game were really good, that might be overlooked, but it's not.
909040	913600	So now you're nitpicking every little thing that's wrong with it because it's like, well,
913600	916900	what the fuck you guys now, now I'm pissed at everything.
916900	918100	I actually disagree.
918100	919560	I think this is shitty.
919560	923640	Even if the game was good, I think it's a real shit move.
923640	925040	So basically go ahead.
925040	928960	They, they complained that there were, it started off as a post on Reddit and they complained,
928960	933200	you know, saying, Hey, what the hell, you know, why is this bag not an actual canvas
933200	934200	bag?
934200	939680	And they, um, commented, they contacted customer support to where there was an email response
939680	944120	saying that, you know, thank you for contacting Bethesda support.
944120	948840	My name is Nicholas and I'd be happy to help you do the unavailability of materials.
948840	952900	We had to switch to nylon carrying case and fallout 76 power armor edition.
952900	956960	We hope this doesn't prevent anyone from enjoying what we feel is the best collector's edition.
956960	963160	And then before that though, they said that, um, uh, what was it that they had no intention
963160	969400	of up, you know, fixing it, that there was, it was a prototype that was shown in those
969400	972840	pictures and that they weren't unable to make it.
972840	974280	But you got to get to the second story.
974280	975280	You got it.
975280	976280	We're getting there.
976280	977280	We're getting there.
977280	978280	We're getting there.
978280	979280	Okay.
979280	980280	This is the worst.
980280	981280	I know it's coming.
981280	982280	You all know what's coming.
982280	983280	And I'm sitting here going, Oh my God, I'm about to pop off.
983280	984280	Hold on.
984280	985280	Hold on.
985280	986280	There's still more.
986280	987280	So it's still on their site.
987280	989680	The collector's edition is still advertising a canvas bag.
989680	990680	Okay.
990680	991680	It was still advertising canvas bag.
991680	992680	I'm good.
992680	993680	Great.
993680	994680	That's not good.
994680	997480	But then, then it gets even better because everyone's already pissed at this.
997480	998480	Oh.
998560	1001440	Oh, we understand that you may not be happy with the bag.
1001440	1006880	Oh, let me just get the exact, the exact phrase invaded because it was just, we understand
1006880	1010440	and respect that there's a disappointment with the bag and the power arm edition.
1010440	1011440	We are sorry.
1011440	1015720	Please contact Bethesda support with your proof of your collector's edition purchase.
1015720	1022640	They will assist you in granting your account 500 Adams, 500 as being 500 points of their
1022640	1026720	fake Bethesda money that you buy follow crap with, which by the way is not enough to actually
1026720	1033160	get an in game nylon or maybe a nylon bag, but not a canvas bag.
1033160	1034160	Okay.
1034160	1037360	But then it gets even better.
1037360	1045560	The best part was that apparently canvas bags do exist because why?
1045560	1051360	Because they've been giving them out to influencers at press events.
1051360	1056640	They're not necessarily the same canvas bags, but their canvas and their fallout 76 bags
1056640	1060240	and the type of bags that if they were the ones included in the bundle, we wouldn't have
1060240	1061240	any of these issues.
1061240	1062240	No.
1062240	1063240	Yeah.
1063240	1064240	Okay.
1064240	1065240	Y'all.
1065240	1070480	I try very hard in the show to not get caught up in like angry mob mentality that happens
1070480	1072160	online and Twitter and stuff.
1072160	1073880	I always try to be very fair.
1073880	1078920	I try to look at all perspectives about like, you know, and, and, and, you know, maybe there's
1078920	1081440	a reason why this decision was made and all that stuff.
1081440	1088480	But like when I read this about the fact that they were handing out canvas bags that existed,
1088480	1094560	that were made, that the cost was known, how much it made made cost to make those bags
1094560	1096960	to influencers.
1096960	1103600	Like I can't, I can't, I got nothing like rake them over the fucking coals, Twitter.
1103600	1105960	It's it's like, they deserve it.
1105960	1107640	That is shitty.
1107640	1109600	That is just straight up shitty.
1109600	1113960	There's no other word for it than what they did with, with subbing out the canvas of the
1113960	1117440	nylon, because they didn't know the cost and they're continuing to do it online.
1117440	1120700	And then they go and they give it to their influencers so that people are making these
1120700	1125720	YouTubes and these Twitch, like, Oh, cause you know, these unboxing videos are sweet
1125720	1127160	and then they show this whole thing.
1127160	1130320	And I'm sorry, there is a huge difference between a canvas bag and a nylon bag.
1130320	1133920	Like we're not talking about like fucking like polyester and cotton.
1133920	1137400	Like this is, there's a huge difference between those two types of bags.
1137400	1144080	So the fact that like Bethesda is trying to say they, they did poor planning on this,
1144080	1149460	then you did poor planning on this, like this and everything else, suck it up, buttercup.
1149460	1151280	You did, did poor planning on this.
1151280	1158960	Then I mean, I honestly think, and I don't agree with this, but I honestly think a better
1158960	1164240	option would have been to make the canvas bag smaller, but at least it would have been
1164240	1166560	like matching their advertising and all this stuff.
1166560	1171180	And again, what you gave the influencers should have been the product.
1171180	1178560	So we have this very interesting case now of in the year 2018 is Bethesda practicing
1178560	1180660	in false advertising.
1180660	1184860	And I think the fact that they're still showing it on the website, despite all this, I think
1184860	1187840	even by old school measures would show, yes, they are.
1187840	1190620	They're falsely advertising right now and they know damn well they can't produce those
1190620	1192000	canvas bags.
1192000	1198760	But now we live in this really interesting YouTube, Twitch, social media influencer age
1198760	1205140	where it's like, did they practice in false advertising by giving their influencers a
1205140	1208600	different product than what they gave the people?
1208600	1212600	Well, it's even better about the influencer thing too, is they had this at multiple events.
1212600	1218280	So some of these influencers may have actually received multiple canvas bags and the, I know
1218280	1223340	one of these that were handed out was actually during this three hour long like press event
1223340	1230040	to get early foot or not early gameplay, I guess, of Fallout 76.
1230040	1232280	But it's just, it's bad.
1232280	1233400	It's just bad.
1233400	1238480	Like especially now with the whole drama behind it and everything, it's just, yeah, people
1238480	1241800	are going to nitpick the stuff you do now even more so, whereas they may be a little
1241800	1247960	bit more forgiving because you fucked up every aspect of this, every possible aspect that
1247960	1251940	you had to do, it was just all fucked up.
1251940	1253400	Like the game is all fucked up.
1253400	1254880	It doesn't play right.
1254880	1257680	And then the collector's editions paid $200 for it.
1257680	1263040	You can't tell, you couldn't afford to make a bag for $200.
1263040	1266080	I mean the game, 60 bucks, okay, whatever.
1266080	1267120	There's a markup on that.
1267120	1273840	But like, you can't tell me that the cloth map and like the plastic helmet costs $200
1273840	1274840	to make.
1274840	1276560	No, it didn't.
1276560	1281440	So you can definitely afford to, you know, and campus, what fucking shortage of canvas
1281440	1282440	are we talking about?
1282440	1287440	Or honestly, like why did you advertise it if you weren't going to be able to make it?
1287440	1289480	Like why did you plan that poorly?
1289480	1291040	That's what it kind of comes down to for me.
1291040	1295040	You shouldn't have sold it that way and taken pre-orders and all this, if that's not what
1295040	1296040	you...
1296040	1300600	When you're planning it out, you know how many collector's editions you're making.
1300600	1302760	You know how much it fucking costs to make them.
1302760	1303760	I got it.
1303760	1304760	I got it.
1304760	1305760	I got it.
1305960	1308320	Before we got into this topic, you just said this.
1308320	1313000	When you went into GameStop, they told you to pre-order Super Smash Brothers, because
1313000	1314000	why?
1314000	1317320	They would know how many to make, or you might not get one if you don't pre-order because
1317320	1318320	they only make so many.
1318320	1319320	Yes.
1319320	1323640	So they're fucking taking pre-order money from people and they know how many of these
1323640	1326280	they're selling and they still can't deliver.
1326280	1329280	It just, it blows my mind.
1329280	1331800	Is Bethesda going to get a pass on this because it's the holidays?
1331800	1332800	I sure hope not.
1332840	1339800	I know, I'm hearing rumbles of law offices are looking into possible, you know, but yeah,
1339800	1343040	that kind of stuff happens over, honestly, things that probably shouldn't be either.
1343040	1344040	I know.
1344040	1345040	I'll believe it when I see a court filing.
1345040	1349680	I just deposited my $10 check from Sony or like from the Sony class action lawsuit today,
1349680	1350680	so we're all good.
1350680	1351680	Congrats.
1351680	1358000	But it's just like, Bethesda needs to answer things and sorry if I'm going to spoil a story
1358000	1361780	that I think you have coming up later in the show, but earlier next year, they're going
1361780	1365500	to be going on a press junket for their newest elder scrolls game, right?
1365500	1368060	Because blades is going to come out next year now, right?
1368060	1370300	So they're going to be going on a press junket for that.
1370300	1376420	And I really hope like they get asked some questions about this and you know, if they're
1376420	1379420	doing any, I mean, I know blades is kind of like a free to play thing and all this, but
1379420	1380420	who knows?
1380420	1382740	They'll probably try to have a way to make money off of it anyway, which is fine.
1382740	1384300	That's what free to play games do.
1384300	1387380	And if they're going to do collector's decisions and stuff, like I really hope Bethesda gets
1387380	1389260	asked these questions.
1389260	1391140	Like how are you not going to fuck up?
1391140	1396300	Like you did fallout four or false, excuse me, fallout 76, which is copy pasted fallout
1396300	1397300	for it online.
1397300	1398300	No, I'm, I'm, I'm being mean.
1398300	1400020	I'm being mean, but no, you're not.
1400020	1401020	It's pretty accurate.
1401020	1402020	Okay, fine.
1402020	1404620	But, uh, I said fallout four is good.
1404620	1405620	I just will.
1405620	1410020	Fallout four has the story that was able to save the weirdo bugs, right?
1410020	1411020	That's the difference.
1411020	1412020	Yes.
1412020	1413020	Okay.
1413780	1421020	I just, uh, just, I, I just, why, why would anybody pre-order a Bethesda game again?
1421020	1427300	Why even as much as I can sit here and say, I can't wait for elder scroll six and I can't
1427300	1432700	like Bethesda is going to have to prove to me why, well, I mean, to be honest, I don't,
1432700	1436140	I rarely pre-order games anymore anyway.
1436140	1439380	Like I might, I might pre-order things on Amazon.
1439380	1443500	Like I have my smash old, I'm like the one person that's still using Amazon and doesn't
1443500	1446620	have a problem with all the shitty things they've been doing, but that's a whole nother
1446620	1447620	Oprah.
1447620	1452820	Um, so I pre-ordered smash brothers ultimate on Amazon because they promised to get it
1452820	1455440	here at my house the day of, I don't have to take an extra to the store or whatever
1455440	1456440	that whole thing.
1456440	1457500	So I'll, I'll do that.
1457500	1460220	But like the nice thing about Amazon pre-order is like, I don't have to put five down up
1460220	1461700	front and cancel whenever I want.
1461700	1462700	Right.
1462700	1463700	Yeah.
1463700	1466540	So like, honestly, like I can think of very, very few games.
1466540	1470460	I have actually like paid money to pre-order in a long time.
1470460	1476260	I would think honestly, one of the last ones I did was final fantasy 14 heaven's word because
1476260	1480860	it came with a dragon statue and I wanted it, but you know what, Loki, you know what
1480860	1481860	I got?
1481860	1486940	I got a dragon statue and it was, it was not made out of paper mache or some dumb shit.
1486940	1491100	It was an actual legit, pretty impressive little statue in a big box.
1491100	1494340	So I've never been disappointed with the collector's editions I've gotten so far.
1494340	1495340	Yeah.
1495340	1498460	There's nothing that's been like, Oh, I was hoping this would be better.
1498460	1500220	No, it's been fine.
1500220	1501420	All right.
1501420	1505700	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com where you guys are really lighten up chat.
1505700	1506700	I love it.
1506700	1507700	Uh, interesting.
1507700	1508700	Why?
1508700	1510260	Why are the very interesting perspective on this?
1510260	1515900	And I hadn't given this thought, obviously the China tariffs are to blame canvas bag
1515900	1517620	prices have skyrocketed.
1517620	1521780	Bethesda didn't know this would happen at the time the canvas bags were planned disaster.
1521780	1522780	Huh?
1522780	1523780	Huh?
1523780	1526860	Well then why are you telling me this?
1526860	1527860	Why?
1527860	1528860	Why?
1528860	1529860	Isn't Bethesda trying to milk that excuse?
1529860	1531060	They could have changed that.
1531060	1533960	When did the tariffs go into place?
1533960	1536100	They could have a few months ago.
1536100	1539380	So I could have said, you know, Hey, we're going to have to change.
1539380	1540380	Let's say, well, let's put it this way.
1540380	1543740	Loki between E3 and now those Chinese tariffs went into place.
1543740	1544740	Okay.
1544740	1548540	So they could have said, Hey, you know, due to this, we're going to be unavailable to
1548540	1553700	offer this in our collector's edition where you have the opportunity to, to cancel that
1553700	1557780	if you'd like, or, or, Hey, we're just going to drop the bag out of the collector's edition.
1557780	1561160	You just going to get the helmet instead, maybe we'll reduce the price like 10 bucks
1561160	1562160	or something.
1562160	1563160	Totally.
1563160	1564160	You're right.
1564160	1565160	You're right.
1565160	1566160	That's that would have been the right way to do it.
1566160	1567900	I agree with you there that they would have seen that coming a long way.
1567900	1568900	Why?
1568900	1569900	Why are just want to clarify?
1569900	1570900	It was a joke.
1570900	1574220	I don't like honestly though, like there, there could be some legitimacy to that angle
1574220	1577820	is that like, if you want to talk about how did they not know what it would cost beforehand
1577820	1578820	and why does it cost more now?
1578820	1579820	Like honestly, why?
1579820	1580820	Why our joke or not?
1580820	1584540	Like, like, like that could be the reason, but Loki's right.
1584540	1586540	They should have disclosed it at that time.
1586540	1593500	But then again, price or not, they did manufacture canvas bags for other things.
1593500	1594500	That's true too.
1594500	1595500	That's true too.
1595500	1596500	Okay.
1596500	1597500	Uh, let's see.
1597500	1599820	Dungeon buster says, dude, if something, if someone promised you something you ordered
1599820	1602260	and you got something else, that's not right.
1602260	1603260	Full stop.
1603260	1607060	And that's, that's, it is kind of, especially if they're not telling people upfront that
1607060	1611900	they're changing something and they're just like, well, we'll get away with it guys.
1611900	1614900	You don't chat says, I don't preorder many games, but I think people know if the game
1614900	1617360	does have issues, Bethesda will fix them.
1617360	1619620	It's not like it's some indie dev from out of the blue.
1619620	1620620	I don't know.
1620620	1624540	We'll fix them because some of these bugs that are in fallout 76 are bugs that have
1624540	1626860	been there since like fallout four.
1626860	1629340	It's been there even prior to fallout four.
1629340	1632260	So it's stuff that they're not fixing them.
1632260	1636540	And a lot of times the stuff, the way this gets fixed is because the community creates
1636540	1638620	a patch and fixes the stuff.
1638620	1642040	This is also why the indie dev devs, a lot of them tend to use like the early access
1642040	1645700	outlet because it allows them to say, I ain't done with this yet.
1645700	1647120	We're still working some things out.
1647120	1650760	You know that by this coming out on early access and then, you know, they can work out
1650760	1654700	some bugs and do the full release and you know, all that, that stuff like stardew valley,
1654700	1655700	I think went that route.
1655700	1656700	Right.
1656700	1657700	When stardew valley early access for quite a while.
1657700	1658700	Um, I think so.
1658700	1659700	Yeah.
1659700	1660700	So, you know, that happens sometimes.
1660700	1665260	Um, let's see, uh, tiger claw on chat says if it were me, I wouldn't be upset at the
1665260	1668780	quality of the bag since the main item, which is the game is all I care about.
1668780	1671500	And that helmet thingy, it's something you put on display.
1671500	1677420	I get it, but it's still like, I don't know, like I still thought the bag was pretty cool
1677420	1680080	and I don't have a lot of canvas bags that I can think of.
1680080	1684100	I do have little nylon bags I've gotten at various trade events.
1684100	1685100	I don't get a lot of canvas bags.
1685100	1689140	I've gotten a duffel bag that I had with grand theft auto four that I used to carry my game
1689140	1690140	system around in.
1690400	1694260	Final fantasy 14 fan fest gave me a pretty sweet backpack, I gotta say.
1694260	1696860	But uh, yeah, again, that's all, you know, nice stuff.
1696860	1697860	I don't know.
1697860	1698860	I mean, sure.
1698860	1700620	The helmet might've been like the centerpiece of that whole thing.
1700620	1704540	Just like the, the pit boy that you wear on your wrist if you're not going to make it.
1704540	1705540	I mean, I don't know.
1705540	1711320	I just think the thing is the fact that they gave it to influencers still, that's like
1711320	1716320	to me, like the rest of it, I might've been able to find an angle to forgive them.
1716320	1720280	But the fact that they knowingly still gave the influencers the wrong type of one.
1720280	1724140	And we all know influencers, part of what they do is like basically advertising for,
1724140	1726400	you know, these companies and so forth like that.
1726400	1728040	That's the part where I'm like, I got nothing.
1728040	1731280	I got nothing to depend, defend Bethesda with at this point.
1731280	1736280	Like after they went and did that, I can't, I can't, I don't even think it helped.
1736280	1738960	I mean, honestly, I mean, you got the word out that the game sucked.
1738960	1741080	I mean, I don't know.
1741080	1742080	All right.
1742080	1743080	Anyhow.
1743520	1746880	So, um, Loki, did you even pick up fall at 76?
1746880	1747880	Like no.
1747880	1748920	Yeah, I never did.
1748920	1753040	And I honestly, my coworkers are trying to get me to pick it up and I'm like, no.
1753040	1754040	Yeah.
1754040	1758400	Would you maybe when it goes on sale, cause inevitably it's gotten down the 1999 recently.
1758400	1759400	Has it really?
1759400	1760400	Yes.
1760400	1761400	I know black Friday.
1761400	1762400	It was down 30% already.
1762400	1766600	It was down pretty low, um, recently, but like, I just don't know.
1766600	1769200	It would have to be really cheap.
1769200	1772320	I just don't get into the fallout games and it has nothing to do with it.
1772320	1773800	Honestly, it has nothing to do with any of this.
1773800	1777400	I just, I just think it's shitty and it makes me worry for the future.
1777400	1780880	Like if Bethesda gets away with this, they'll have free license to do it again.
1780880	1785040	And they're planning on using the same engine for elder scrolls six and the star field,
1785040	1786040	right?
1786040	1787040	Or what?
1787040	1788040	Is that the name of it?
1788040	1790920	And I'm, I, I would be interested in Bethesda game in space.
1790920	1791920	I love space.
1791920	1796400	EA and Bioware used to make a game about space that I really, really enjoyed and Bethesda
1796400	1797840	does pretty good stories too.
1797840	1803200	So like I'm down, but if this is what I have to look forward to, then like, fuck it.
1803200	1810120	One of the end game bosses in fallout 76 uses the same animations as the dragons in Skyrim.
1810120	1811880	Exact same animation.
1811880	1812880	Oh boy.
1812880	1813880	All right.
1813880	1816420	Uh, anyhow, let's, let's move on.
1816420	1820280	Let's get into some of the games we have been playing this week cause I'm sure there's been
1820280	1821280	a few things here and there.
1821280	1822720	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1822720	1824200	It was all Pokemon.
1824200	1831480	So I played, um, Pokemon go a bit and then I also played Pokemon let's go and I finished
1831480	1839040	all of the gyms and now I'm just trying to level up some ice electric and, um, water
1839040	1843620	Pokemon cause I think that's what they recommended that you have for the final four.
1843620	1847580	And then, um, yeah, that's, that's pretty much what I've been doing cause it's like
1847580	1851480	Pikachu right now is like level 65 and so it just like destroys everything.
1851480	1855160	Like I go through all of the gyms with just Pikachu and take them all out.
1855160	1856160	Oh wow.
1856160	1857720	Um, so I don't know.
1857720	1862420	I could probably just take the final four with Pikachu too, but you know, I just haven't
1862420	1863420	tried yet.
1863420	1865760	Uh, at least for the one that's susceptible to electric for sure.
1865760	1867640	I don't know about all of them though.
1867640	1872360	Cause um, I think, I think they, they correct me if I'm wrong chat, but I think the final
1872360	1875960	four elite four or whatever use Pokemon they're in level fifties ranges.
1875960	1879520	You'd probably get through it with Pikachu honestly, but um, you might want to bump it
1879520	1881240	a few more levels or just get like one other.
1881240	1882240	I've got some rare candies.
1882240	1884240	I'll just shove them all in the Pikachu.
1884240	1885700	That might honestly work.
1885700	1890240	So Pikachu the level like 80 and yeah, just destroy everything.
1890240	1892320	Act Efton chat says my EV is level 99.
1892320	1894120	I haven't gotten to the elite four.
1894120	1900240	So yeah, if you get it that far then yeah, like see, um, I had an EV and then I, I evolved
1900240	1905940	it into a Jolteon because unfortunately this EVs of the EV that you get in my game is not
1905940	1906940	the same.
1906940	1911340	I get the same abilities as the other EV version.
1911340	1917420	So I can't really make an op EV that way, but, um, I don't know.
1917420	1918820	So I'll just mess with that right now.
1918820	1920820	I don't even remember what the hell I have in my Pokeball right now.
1920820	1922260	Like I was trying to remember what it was earlier.
1922260	1929180	It's either, um, I think it's a Vipirion or it's, um, Archileno or whatever.
1929180	1930180	I don't remember.
1930180	1936540	Um, but yeah, so I just have to do that stuff and I don't know.
1936540	1940020	Play the end game thing cause I know there's some end game stuff and you know, new areas
1940020	1941020	you can go to.
1941020	1947740	And then I think at some point you fight red too at some point and then Mewtwo as well.
1947740	1948740	All right.
1948740	1952740	Um, anything else besides let's go and DDR fourth plus.
1952740	1953740	Oh yeah.
1953740	1954740	I saw some of your streaming.
1954740	1955740	Yeah.
1955740	1956740	The conga feeling for me.
1956740	1957740	Yes I did.
1957740	1963020	And uh, I am not very, I don't like a lot of like the fourth mixed steps that they put
1963020	1964020	in there.
1964020	1965020	Like they did brand new steps.
1965020	1969540	It's been a while since I played fourth plus cause I think when I was playing fourth mix,
1969540	1972260	like primarily it was singles.
1972260	1974100	I wasn't really playing doubles back then.
1974100	1978260	I think I did a little bit doubles, but I didn't really play a lot of that stuff.
1978260	1981380	Um, it was mostly on fifth mixes so that I was just doing doubles.
1981380	1984580	It was harder in the arcades too cause you'd be under more pressure to like share your
1984580	1985860	game with somebody else.
1985860	1989820	Like if they wanted to spend it all and let you pick the songs like, you know, so it was,
1989820	1992440	it was a little bit, you know, different.
1993160	1996440	But like, I don't like some of the steps that they have, like some of them, like I tried
1996440	2001080	playing Xanadu, like I played both sets of steps and they just, I fucking hate them.
2001080	2003400	Like I don't like what they did.
2003400	2004800	They changed the steps to Xanadu.
2004800	2005800	Right.
2005800	2007160	But you can play the original ones too.
2007160	2008160	Okay.
2008160	2009160	Okay.
2009160	2010960	So they have like a, they're like edit sets, but it's just all jacked up.
2010960	2013520	So I'm not really digging fourth plus too much.
2013520	2018040	I may end up putting something else on there, but I can always put it on again whenever
2018040	2019040	you decide to come over.
2019040	2021680	Cause I mean I can sweep swap them like pretty fast.
2021680	2022680	All right.
2022680	2023680	Yeah.
2023680	2026600	I may end up moving to, I think I might move to Euro mix too because that's a mix I have
2026600	2027600	not played yet.
2027600	2028600	Oh, there you go.
2028600	2029600	Something new.
2029600	2034140	And so it's basically max two with like some different songs on there and it's got Cotton
2034140	2035140	Eye Joe.
2035140	2036140	Yeah.
2036140	2037140	Heck yeah.
2037140	2041220	So, you know, maybe quintessential nineties dance hit, you know, there's, there's people
2041220	2045080	alive and maybe listening to our show, I have no idea what some of these songs are who never
2045080	2049740	had the pleasure of going to a high school dance and hearing, where did you come from?
2049740	2050740	Where did you go?
2050740	2051740	Where did you come from?
2051740	2052740	Cotton Eye Joe.
2052740	2054980	Or I can put like the old Euro mix.
2054980	2063420	I think I have Euro mix one on there too, which is, it's got a Caribbean queen and video
2063420	2064740	killed the radio star.
2064740	2069700	I don't know some of those, but that's like third mix stuff.
2069700	2070700	So I don't know.
2070700	2073700	Or Disney rave, you know, we'll see.
2073700	2077860	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com YYR says you'll spend an hour with it and then
2077860	2078860	you'll be done.
2078860	2079860	Yes, pretty much.
2079980	2080980	Yeah.
2080980	2081980	But that's okay.
2081980	2082980	Yeah.
2082980	2083980	Have fun with it.
2083980	2085140	But I've been working on set mania stuff too.
2085140	2089180	So I actually started working on a theme that I was going to accustomed being for the cabinet.
2089180	2090180	Oh, fun.
2090180	2093060	But I'm, I'm, I'm stuck on what I'm going to call it.
2093060	2094740	So that's, that's the problems.
2094740	2096220	It's like a fake DDR version.
2096220	2100820	So Loki's DDR hell, no, that's dumb, but yeah, the kids have to be around it.
2100820	2105220	So I've got it like started and I kind of like, I just can't think of a good name for
2105220	2106220	it.
2106220	2107580	So anyway, you can think of a cool name.
2107580	2108580	I'm down with that.
2108580	2109580	But like, there you go.
2109580	2113380	I'm working on the figuring out how to do theming and stuff.
2113380	2117700	Yell it out in our chat or visit a Loki on Twitter at lokiolr.
2117700	2118700	So, all right.
2118700	2119700	Awesome.
2119700	2120700	Um, my gaming week.
2120700	2122700	Um, I didn't really buy any new games this week.
2122700	2125380	Well, except for runner three, which I played after last week's OLR.
2125380	2128540	I did a live stream and I did some runner three after the show last week and, and that
2128540	2129540	was fun.
2129540	2130540	I don't know why they took the name bit trip out of it.
2130540	2135380	I'm not sure what that was about, but, um, maybe because it's not as bit, it does look
2135380	2138540	a lot different now, but, uh, it kind of did in version two as well.
2138580	2139940	But it doesn't really matter.
2139940	2142540	Semantics aside, uh, the game is, is cute and fun.
2142540	2146820	And if you enjoyed Bit.Trip Runner 2, a lot of that same type of stuff is there in three.
2146820	2147820	Love the music in the game.
2147820	2151460	And it's fun to kind of be bouncing along and jumping to the music.
2151460	2153980	Obviously it's like head bang on the wall hard.
2153980	2157900	Like I got to the, the boss of the first area and I just had to like end my stream before
2157900	2159740	I beat it because it was just getting too late.
2159740	2164180	And I was like, guys, I really wanted to like end with beating this boss, but I'm not fucking
2164180	2165300	making progress on it.
2165300	2167180	So sadly, we're just going to call it here.
2167220	2170420	So that's a little bit embarrassing, but, um, there's just some stuff where it's like,
2170420	2173300	dang, you have to really like work on it and do it over and over and over again.
2173300	2177500	But you know, sometimes with those very difficult games, as a lot of 8-bit Nintendo games used
2177500	2181140	to be, you start to feel that progression and it feels very rewarding and very good,
2181140	2182540	uh, when you kind of keep at it.
2182540	2185420	So that was, um, Runner 3.
2185420	2188860	And other than that, I've been playing, um, a lot of the similar things that I've been
2188860	2194140	playing, uh, include pickup, um, uh, what was it called?
2194140	2198020	It was, um, old school musical.
2198020	2199260	I didn't know.
2199260	2201780	I've watched you guys play it and I never picked that up myself.
2201780	2202780	That's probably on the list.
2202780	2204460	I should have got that during the last steam sale.
2204460	2205460	Dang it.
2205460	2206460	But maybe I'll get it.
2206460	2208060	Cause there'll be another one like at New Year's, right?
2208060	2209060	Yeah.
2209060	2211540	So maybe I'll pick it up then if it even goes on sale, not everything does.
2211540	2212660	So I might pick it up then.
2212660	2214300	Or maybe I'll just, you know, who knows?
2214300	2215300	We'll buy it, buy it before then.
2215300	2216300	Oh, do they?
2216300	2217300	Oh, maybe I'll buy it there.
2217300	2218300	Yeah.
2218300	2219300	That'd be a lot of fun.
2219300	2220300	Yeah.
2220300	2223420	I got it on both because I bought it on the switch and my kids are like, give me that.
2223420	2226380	I want to play whatever the hell game I'm playing.
2226380	2227380	I want, I want, I want.
2227380	2228380	I want Mario Kart.
2228380	2230300	I'm like, crap, how am I going to play this game now?
2230300	2231300	Okay.
2231300	2232300	I guess I'll buy it on steam too.
2232300	2233300	All right.
2233300	2234300	Yeah.
2234300	2236340	Bobby Blackwell says, just pay full price for it so the developer gets the full price.
2236340	2237340	Fine.
2237340	2241180	I, and honestly the Nintendo games go on sale a lot less frequently anyway.
2241180	2244900	And I like the idea of having it portable and that, that sounds, it seems like a good
2244900	2245900	switch game.
2245900	2246900	So I think we found a good happy medium.
2246900	2247900	All right, Bobby.
2247900	2248900	All right.
2248900	2250380	Uh, uh, let's see.
2250380	2254780	And um, other games I have been playing this week, uh, continuing on in Final Fantasy 14,
2254780	2259060	trying to like cap out my tomes, work on my gear in that game, world of Warcraft.
2259060	2264220	Although I kind of have hit a wall where if I don't team up with Delvin or other people
2264220	2268700	to do like mythics and other stuff, like there's not really a lot of ways to advance my gear
2268700	2270560	besides trying to get Azerite.
2270560	2272840	So one thing that I've been working on is PVP.
2272840	2274860	I'm actually having fun PVPing.
2274860	2277500	And for some reason, I don't know if they're considered underpowered or something, but
2277500	2278500	I play a warlock.
2278620	2283680	I play an affliction warlock and in PVP, like I hardly ever see other warlocks.
2283680	2287140	Like people will get excited when I'm there cause they'll be like, yay, lock candy, which
2287140	2290580	is, you know, I think it's a spell they have to let everybody get a little hellstone.
2290580	2295780	Um, and so I don't know, but, but I feel like I do all right when it comes to damage because
2295780	2299560	you could just dot everybody up and you get, and you do have this one spell that's seed
2299560	2300740	of corruption.
2300740	2303660	And so you fire it on somebody that's like in the middle of the pack.
2303660	2308300	And then when it explodes, they spread this thing called corruption to every other player
2308300	2309380	around them.
2309380	2313140	And that's probably how I'm able to climb up the DPS charts, uh, in some of those big
2313140	2314140	battlegrounds so easy.
2314140	2317180	But anyway, I won't bore you with all the wow talk cause I know not everybody plays,
2317180	2321000	but that's something I've been getting into a little more is playing the PVP, uh, in world
2321000	2322000	of Warcraft.
2322000	2326060	And I've gotten enough marks of honor where I bought the very first season set, the blueberry
2326060	2327220	face on the warlock.
2327220	2331980	I just bought that one last night and I bought one of the sets during, um, cataclysm cause
2331980	2333400	I thought it looked cool.
2333400	2339180	So I'm PVPing enough to buy some of the, uh, uh, Barbie dress up transmog sets.
2339180	2340320	And so that's a lot of fun.
2340320	2341320	Dang it.
2341320	2343120	So that's kind of giving me something to do in the game right now.
2343120	2346920	Um, otherwise on consoles been continuing to play Tetris effects cause I played the
2346920	2348280	weekend event event.
2348280	2351000	I beat the journey mode thing.
2351000	2352000	That's right.
2352000	2353000	I'm mixing them up.
2353000	2354000	Yeah.
2354000	2355000	Journey is the mode with all the stages, right?
2355000	2356000	Yeah.
2356000	2357840	Um, and I will say Bobby did get something right on his last show.
2357840	2360560	That stage with the hot air balloons is like one of the best songs in the game.
2360560	2364240	You know what my actual, actually my absolute favorite was, was the board right after that
2364240	2365720	was the mermaids.
2365720	2367040	I haven't played enough of the game yet.
2367040	2368040	Oh yeah.
2368040	2373080	Oh, um, you know, I don't think I'm really spoiling anything, but, um, there's a, in
2373080	2377000	the very last set, well, the very, and you can see this on the map again, it's not a
2377000	2378000	spoiler.
2378000	2381600	The very last stage is one giant stage called metamorphosis.
2381600	2384560	So before that you have like a track of five skins that you do.
2384560	2388280	And I think the second one is the hot air balloons that has a really cool little song
2388280	2391960	behind it that's very similar to the trailer song.
2391960	2395920	And then the one after that is the mermaid cove and it's like purple, this really beautiful
2395920	2396920	color.
2396920	2398080	And the song is really good too.
2398080	2400000	Like I just, I really enjoyed that one.
2400000	2402440	And in VR again, Oh, it's so good in VR.
2402440	2403440	I love playing that game in VR.
2403440	2405640	It's just such a like in the zone type of game.
2405640	2406640	I love it.
2406640	2409960	Um, so yeah, that's pretty, actually it's, have you played rez in VR?
2409960	2410960	Yeah, I did.
2410960	2411960	We talked about last week.
2411960	2412960	Oh, that's right.
2412960	2413960	Yeah.
2413960	2416280	So well actually I'm not, I'm not unhappy you brought that up because even though I
2416280	2419800	didn't play it again this week, remember last week we got into this thing where I said,
2419800	2424600	I noticed that rez area X is like its own thing developed in unity and it's in the synesthesia
2424600	2425600	engine.
2425600	2426600	Yeah.
2426600	2427600	And unreal.
2427600	2428600	Yeah.
2428600	2429600	Guess what?
2429600	2430600	Since I beat Tetris effect, I actually watched the credits.
2430600	2431600	Guess what?
2431600	2436620	Y'all synesthesia engine Tetris effect and rez area X are built on the same engine.
2436620	2439180	And I tweeted about that on my Twitter.
2439180	2444560	Go look at who liked my tweet because I wrote something like, wow, Tetris effect and rez
2444560	2447520	area X are indeed on the same engine.
2447520	2448520	What's next?
2448520	2449520	Question, question, question.
2449520	2451920	Um, enhance like the tweet.
2451920	2457340	Some other employee over there liked the tweet and Mizuguchi liked the tweet.
2457340	2459760	And I was like, okay, wow.
2459760	2464040	That's like a little, a little kiss and a, that's a little pat on the ass from the developers.
2464040	2467320	Like good for you snowflake figuring that one out.
2467320	2471360	So I was, but I was thrilled and I honestly, yeah, I meant it.
2471360	2472360	Bring it on.
2472360	2473360	What is it?
2473360	2474360	New rez game.
2474360	2480660	Just rez triple X, do it in the synesthesia engine, do a child of Eden remake in the engine,
2480660	2485360	do a new, let Mizuguchi do whatever the fuck he wants TBH cause I will be there and, and
2485360	2487760	uh, I'm sure the synesthesia engine will be great for it.
2487760	2490360	So, uh, or whatever they want to do in the future.
2490360	2495160	Like on, and I said this when I first reviewed Tetris effect, like we all have our fanboy
2495160	2501000	things in video games and video games that that man makes Mizuguchi like are always,
2501000	2505240	I'm going to like, he made 99 nights and I still defended that more than most people
2505240	2506240	did.
2506240	2507240	Okay.
2507240	2510080	Cause it, look, it was flawed, but it was still decent for what it was.
2510080	2511080	Okay.
2511080	2515680	So anyway, uh, I played a little bit of that and um, yeah, I guess that's really, that's
2515680	2519240	all that's like jumping out other than like canoeing, switch games, Pokemon, let's go
2519240	2525080	a little bit mobile games still plucking along on ingress, although ingress isn't as exciting
2525080	2526400	now that double AP is over.
2526400	2530860	I wish it was always double AP, but I guess, I guess one thing, you know, quickly I will
2530860	2535640	say about the mobile games, um, that I play ingress does seem to be wanting to implement
2535640	2538580	more limited time events, kind of like what Pokemon does.
2538580	2544060	Cause obviously we had this three day long community thing, although really that bonus
2544060	2547500	window was when all the shinies were boosted and all that good stuff, which I caught like
2547500	2551220	seriously like 12 shinies in that three hour period.
2551220	2556540	But it was unfortunately, yeah, I didn't need anything, but it was nice to get another Bulbasaur
2556540	2560100	because I had only gotten one because it was the Bulbasaur weekend was the same day as
2560100	2561100	Bobby's wedding.
2561100	2562340	So obviously that was more important.
2562340	2564060	So I'm really glad I got a second chance.
2564060	2568320	I'm just trying to get all my dratini's now so I can actually get, I have a shiny dratini
2568320	2572060	that left it or shiny dragon air that was leftover from.
2572060	2575740	But anyway, we talk enough about what we want to go ingress on the other hand, um, it seems
2575740	2579100	to be wanting to look at doing more of those limited time events, especially because you
2579100	2582360	know, they're trying to push the prime scanner as their new version of the game and all this.
2582360	2586220	So they're doing some event coming up where like for five days, beginning on December
2586220	2591620	26, don't quote me on this because everything they have to do based on UTC as well, um,
2591620	2598340	you're going to get double AP for smashing resonators and placing resonators, but not
2598340	2602320	like hacking and it's, it's interesting to kind of, kind of doing like a weird thing
2602320	2604340	with the AP and that's their version of experience.
2604340	2606460	So it's, it'll be interesting.
2606460	2610700	So, but yeah, uh, otherwise that's, that's been, that's been plenty of gaming for me.
2610700	2613860	So, uh, all right, let's get to some housekeeping.
2613980	2619420	Um, over at, uh, uh, sorry, I'm checking in with the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2619420	2623000	VidPower confirms that Old School Musical only had a 10% discount in the Steam Autumn
2623000	2624000	sale anyway.
2624000	2625180	Hey, 10% is 10%.
2625180	2627060	I mean, and that game is still newer.
2627060	2631420	Like in, uh, what Bobby says is, you know, the devs are entitled to, to a big chunk of
2631420	2632420	the money and that's fair.
2632420	2635880	Uh, and Bobby Blackwell says, senpai notice Rob.
2635880	2638480	That's seriously how I felt, just so we know.
2638480	2642160	And Act Def says Mizuguchi likes a lot of tweets, especially when they mentioned something
2642160	2643160	good about their games.
2643160	2648440	Oh, I'm sure Mizuguchi like has that tweet deck and has a thing for Tetris Effect.
2648440	2650240	So he sees all the tweets on it.
2650240	2653400	Not that I think he sits there all day, but you know, he probably scrolls through it once
2653400	2654400	in a while.
2654400	2655400	He probably likes a bunch of tweets.
2655400	2659880	You know, I bet when you're a game developer, seeing good things about your game feels really
2659880	2660880	good.
2660880	2663040	You know, I would, I would bet that that is a thing.
2663040	2667680	And so, uh, you know, he, I, I, and I love it that he, he stopped to check it out.
2667680	2668680	Yeah, exactly.
2668680	2672560	Like going back to Fallout 76, I mean, I'm sure that it feels bad for like the developers
2672600	2677200	that, you know, I'm sure there are a game many, probably so frustrated, like we wanted
2677200	2682600	to fix this shit, but I know that's a very fair perspective and something we can't say
2682600	2683600	enough.
2683600	2687880	I'm sure there are plenty of Bethesda employees who worked very hard on that game, who are
2687880	2689800	just straight up embarrassed right now.
2689800	2696000	So like, don't pick on people that work at Bethesda and less their boardroom management,
2696000	2698160	financial CEO type of people.
2698160	2699980	Those are the people you take issue with.
2700020	2705740	Do not take issue with the QA people, the, the programmers, the, the people that designed
2705740	2706900	the textures and all that stuff.
2706900	2710580	They were just, they were making the game under the constraints that they were given
2710580	2711580	from up above.
2711580	2715940	So do not, do not, let me see you doing that on Twitter, but I'm, I'm, I know the listeners
2715940	2717740	of this show are smart enough to know that.
2717740	2722800	Um, let's see, uh, going to chat for a couple more comments, uh, dark tits to be in chat
2722800	2724340	says rez triple X.
2724340	2728760	Well, it does support trans vibrators, but that's true that rez is the game that brought
2728760	2730720	us that wonderful, wonderful, um, accessory.
2730720	2734640	All right, so quick housekeeping before we get to gaming news tonight, let me bring up
2734640	2737360	one thing because it was brought up on Bobby show, so I think it's important to just bring
2737360	2738360	up here too.
2738360	2743160	So y'all know that we're going to be making a transition to Twitch for the live presentation.
2743160	2746760	So right now, if you want to listen to the show live, you're either using the plugin
2746760	2750880	over at live.vognetwork.com or you're using something like TuneIn or basically you're
2750880	2753280	using something that is shoutcast embedded.
2753280	2757420	You're using something to connect to an MP3 streaming platform called shoutcast, which
2757420	2761580	goes all the way back to old school Winamp, which is why we joke about this computer that
2761580	2762580	still uses windows.
2762580	2767660	Um, I almost said 95 and it might as well use windows 95, but windows XP, uh, because
2767660	2770760	that's, you know, when, when, when this Winamp and shoutcast thing was all made.
2770760	2773640	So anyway, part of the reason we're making the switch to Twitch is that for our live
2773640	2776640	presentation, uh, it's now going to be delivered on Twitch.
2776640	2780820	And so you don't have to think like, what's the link to get to OLR stream or what app
2780820	2781820	do I have to download?
2781820	2784780	Cause you know, I think most of y'all have Twitch in your pockets, on your phones, all
2784780	2787340	that stuff and on your gaming consoles and on your computer.
2787340	2790380	So this would be very easy for you to just go to twitch.tv slash vognetwork and check
2790380	2791380	it out.
2791380	2794140	So since we are moving to Twitch, obviously video is a big thing on Twitch.
2794140	2796340	So we will be streaming video additionally with that.
2796340	2800420	Um, as far as the podcast goes, and again, I want to emphasize it's Orange Launch Radio
2800420	2805420	and always has been, and that's going to be the way it is for the way foreseeable future.
2805420	2809300	Um, so the podcast will be the exact same thing, pretty much you're hearing now, but
2809300	2812620	maybe, maybe it was actually, I'm looking at, uh, we got a brand new mixing board, so
2812620	2815740	maybe a little bit of audio polish and maybe a little bit of polish here and there, but
2815740	2818780	for all practical purposes, it'll be the same show that you're used to and still free.
2818780	2819780	And I want to stress that.
2819780	2824620	Um, but, and there's a, but here, um, uh, something somewhat new.
2824620	2828500	I say it's new, even though we used to do stuff on Justin TV a long time ago.
2828500	2832660	So, and you can go to our old Twitch channel and see some highlights from what that looked
2832660	2833660	like.
2833660	2836780	And it's, it'll look better now cause it'll be HD and we're not in the same studio, but
2836780	2838300	it'll, you know, you get the idea.
2838980	2843220	But something, uh, that people are, uh, you know, looking forward to, I suppose is video,
2843220	2846820	even though we don't plan to play up to the video, it's, I don't know how exciting it'll
2846820	2847820	be, but all right.
2847820	2852880	Um, but some people were wondering like, will I be able to just go listen to OLR on Twitch
2852880	2854300	video archives?
2854300	2859020	Um, and we are still a podcast and we want to push people to the podcast feed.
2859020	2862980	So that is kind of still the preferred place to listen to this show in the archive.
2862980	2867260	However, I understand that a people want to do, uh, go along with the show live, which
2867260	2868540	I think is great.
2868540	2874520	And also with that people, um, uh, might want to go check out what it looks like live and,
2874520	2875520	and all of that.
2875520	2876520	Uh, and that's fine.
2876520	2881480	Um, but we did make a decision at VOG network that we will be putting the video on demand
2881480	2886340	only on demand, not the live, the video on demand will be, uh, available to subscribers
2886340	2888140	of the Twitch VOG network only.
2888140	2894500	Um, so, uh, again, we see that as something new that is being put behind a paywall and
2894500	2898460	not anything old that we're like taking away to put behind a payroll.
2898460	2902500	I want to really stress that because I know how y'all can handle some of these news when
2902500	2904380	game companies do it sometimes and all that.
2904380	2905860	So again, it's, it's something new.
2905860	2909540	And if you want to be here live, you'll get to see all of it for whatever.
2909540	2914020	Um, but if you do want to do the video on demand, um, because again, podcasting is kind
2914020	2915940	of the game we're in and we want to really push people there.
2915940	2919260	But if you really, really want to see the video, um, you can use your, um, Amazon prime.
2919260	2924140	If you have that, your prime subscription over on the VOG network, um, or, or so on.
2924140	2928560	Um, but not right away because again, we're going to have to get to that point first.
2928560	2931500	We have to kind of hit the affiliate status on Twitch and all that good stuff.
2931500	2933220	So for a little while, it'll still be open and free.
2933220	2937140	So you kind of get an idea what that looks like, but please know that the plan is in
2937140	2939940	early 2019, uh, we are going to kind of make that change.
2939940	2943220	So if y'all have any questions about it or you want to, you want to yell, get mad, although
2943220	2946420	I don't, I don't know why people would get mad, but you never know, uh, now's a good
2946420	2947420	time to do that.
2947420	2950180	Cause I just want to be upfront with that.
2950180	2953460	And uh, yeah, I hope some of you guys will, you know, enjoy it though.
2953460	2957540	I remember one more thing I was going to complain about on my gaming week and it says has to
2957540	2960860	do with both Pokemon Let's Go and Pokemon Go.
2960860	2963980	It's the Pokemon, the brand new Pokemon Meltan.
2963980	2964980	Oh yeah.
2964980	2970140	So Meltan, the way you get him in Pokemon Go, or you have to get him in Pokemon Go is
2970140	2975940	you, when you transfer Pokemon from Pokemon Go into Pokemon Let's Go through the Go park,
2975940	2981460	you get a mystery box that appears in Pokemon Go and you open the mystery box and acts like
2981460	2984940	a lure for 30 minutes and you're supposed to spawn a bunch of Meltan.
2984940	2987780	You catch them and that's how you're supposed to do it.
2987780	2992900	And you're supposed to get 400 Meltan to evolve into whatever the fuck the thing's called.
2992900	2996540	Um, Melmetal, Melmetal, yes.
2996540	3000860	And Melmetal, well, Meltan's also, you mean you can earn candy by walking, but you have
3000860	3006340	to walk 20 kilometers per candy for that, which is fucking stupid.
3006340	3014220	So it was, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when I popped the mystery box and 30 minutes
3014220	3021140	go by and there's four, four fucking spawns of Meltan.
3021140	3022300	Four.
3022300	3025180	Mind you, you can use that once a week.
3025180	3026260	Yikes.
3026260	3031100	So it would take, assuming that was always four and assuming that I was, do you get more
3031100	3032100	if you walk?
3032100	3033880	Cause that's the way regular lures work.
3033880	3035940	More will pop if you walk while the lure is going.
3035940	3036940	I was walking.
3036940	3037940	Okay.
3037940	3040180	So it's so four.
3040180	3041980	Are you using pin apps?
3041980	3044300	But yes, of course.
3044300	3045300	God damn.
3045300	3046300	Just making sure.
3046300	3047300	Just making sure.
3047300	3048300	Yeah.
3048300	3049300	Every time.
3049300	3054260	So it would take like probably at least a year to get Melmetal.
3054260	3057380	Deft of saying you get 10 mil, 10 guaranteed.
3057380	3062020	So well, it's not a guarantee cause I got four and I had that, that fucking app open
3062020	3063020	the entire time.
3063020	3064380	So there was not fucking guarantee.
3064380	3068780	In fact, I complained about it on Twitch or not Twitch, Twitter, because for the first
3068780	3071380	like eight minutes, nothing was spawning.
3071380	3075820	Like it was all of the event Pokemon that were around, but nothing was spawning.
3075820	3077260	And so I'm like, what the fuck?
3077260	3079380	I wonder if the event screwed it up somehow.
3079380	3080700	I don't know.
3080700	3083100	Well, you know how we can fix that?
3083100	3087420	It's called your program, the fucking game, so it doesn't fucking do that.
3087420	3088420	All right.
3088420	3090540	Let me get some of these comments and we'll get into the gaming news for the week.
3090540	3095440	So in the, uh, comments over at live.vognetwork.com, a lot of positive.
3095440	3096440	That's fair.
3096440	3097440	I understand.
3097440	3098440	I'm cool with that.
3098440	3099440	Thanks you guys.
3099440	3100440	I really appreciate that.
3100440	3103020	Uh, bonds double six and chat says just redownload Winamp for the memories.
3103020	3105060	Winamp did put out a new version and I'm all for the memories.
3105060	3110220	Um, but it does remind me to say, um, that when we do move to Twitch, the audio will
3110220	3111500	no longer be available.
3111500	3116660	So if you are using TuneIn or you know, the, the plugin at VOG, well, the plugin at VOG
3116660	3120780	network will simply change to a Twitch window, but you know, the way you're listening live
3120780	3124940	now, again, only for our live listeners, uh, for podcasts, it would be the same, but for
3124940	3127000	live listeners, um, it will change.
3127000	3129980	You will not have a audio only feed anymore.
3129980	3135340	Um, I believe Twitch offers a audio only component in the app where you just listen.
3135340	3141480	Um, but yes, uh, it will be a little bit of a change, but also, um, again, the, the, the
3141480	3147720	radio feed, the shoutcast feed is the most expensive piece of running VOG right now.
3147720	3148720	So hope you guys will understand.
3148720	3149720	Oh.
3149720	3151320	And he says, you know, Bobby mentioned new chat room.
3151320	3152320	Oh yes.
3152320	3153320	New chat room too.
3153320	3156380	We will be moving over to the Twitch chat room, which I mean, kind of makes sense, right?
3156380	3160480	And that's just a decision because it ain't like, let's be realistic.
3160480	3164480	You guys, if we said, Oh, don't use that chat, head on over to this chat.
3164480	3165480	People aren't going to do it.
3165480	3168800	So if we want to get new people in our family, we want people to be engaging and all that
3168800	3169800	good stuff.
3169800	3174520	Uh, we have to, you know, um, open up that chat over there, but you know what, this also
3174520	3180560	opens the door to, you know, if maybe we want to do more extra things, we're going to be
3180560	3181560	able to really do that.
3181560	3183060	So, um, it's really exciting.
3183060	3187440	And I, as far as I know, the plan is it will be a shared space with Bobby Black Wolf, uh,
3187440	3190280	anime jam session, hopefully some of our other shows too.
3190280	3191880	I'm really hoping we'll give it a try.
3191880	3193680	We'll see again, we don't want to force them to do anything.
3193680	3197640	We'll still be a network for promoting and, and lifting each other up.
3197640	3201620	But um, you know, we'll have, we'll have a platform should they choose to use it.
3201620	3204360	But as a podcast producer, they're free to do whatever they want to do.
3204360	3207880	Um, you know, maybe draw some more stuff and grow our network.
3207880	3211100	So I think in the year 2018, it's going to be an awesome thing, but I'll stop talking
3211100	3214080	about it and let y'all experience it in a couple of weeks when we get to experience
3214080	3215080	it too.
3215080	3217840	Let's get into some gaming news for now instead.
3217840	3218840	Loki.
3218840	3219840	Yes.
3219840	3225300	So let's talk about Nintendo finally getting rid of their shitty Nintendo creators program.
3225300	3230020	So for those who may or not remember, the creators program was basically their way of
3230020	3234660	doing YouTube content, um, or monetizing YouTube content.
3234660	3239300	So basically you weren't allowed to put YouTube content out there unless you're part of a
3239300	3243800	Nintendo, um, the Nintendo creators program, in which case they got a significant portion
3243800	3248500	of the ad revenue from that and then they wouldn't strike your video for that.
3248500	3256480	So now as of March 20th, 2019, they will be ceasing operations on that front.
3256480	3260560	So we're ending the Nintendo creators program to make it easier for content creators to
3260560	3264500	make and monetize videos that contain Nintendo game content.
3264500	3269860	We will no longer ask creators to submit their videos to the NCP and the creators can continue
3269860	3274980	showing their passion for Nintendo by the following Nintendo or by following Nintendo
3274980	3277260	guidelines.
3277260	3279580	And, um, let's see what those guidelines are.
3279580	3285420	I think it's just basically from what I gathered, it was, um, you know, you got to make sure
3285420	3289700	that you're not just posting, you know, direct video of the games, you know, you're doing
3289700	3295120	some commentary, um, you know, they want to make sure that, you know, that your input's
3295120	3296120	in there.
3296120	3300620	So for example, you know, they want to post gameplay videos, screenshots using Nintendo
3300620	3301740	system features.
3301740	3306700	You can use the capture button on Nintendo switch with additional input or commentary.
3306700	3311860	Um, you're only permitted to use Nintendo game content that has been officially released
3311860	3317460	from or from promotional materials official released by Nintendo as such as, um, product
3317460	3318680	trailers or Nintendo direct.
3318680	3325340	So none of you streaming smash brothers before it's out cause you pirated a copy of the internet.
3325340	3326340	Not allowed.
3326340	3327340	I mean, that's self-explanatory.
3327340	3333780	Um, they of course reserve the right to remove any content that they feel is unlawful, impringing
3333780	3334780	or inappropriate.
3334780	3341860	Um, so no like peach fuck Daisy type of things on YouTube.
3341860	3350100	Well, actually, to be fair under parody law, you could, I mean, you might be breaking some
3350100	3355080	YouTube things, so you gotta be careful, but under parody law, I would say you still have
3355080	3360880	quite a bit of leeway room, but you can't really like use direct feeds of Nintendo stuff
3360880	3364160	and all, you know, you'd have to be a little more creative with how you do parody, I guess
3364160	3365160	in that regard.
3365160	3366160	Right.
3366160	3367160	I don't know.
3367160	3368160	I'm not a lawyer.
3368160	3369160	Don't take my advice.
3369160	3370360	Maybe just don't do that idea.
3370360	3376200	So they basically, there's some things that there's like a QA on, on their little guidelines
3376200	3377200	or whatever.
3377200	3378640	So some of this is kind of a little interesting.
3378640	3383840	So for example, you know, they, the, one of the questions number three, what do you mean
3383840	3387520	by appropriate video and image sharing websites?
3387520	3391880	And the answer is we generally accept most commonly used video and image sharing platforms
3391880	3395120	such as, but not limited to YouTube, Twitch and Instagram.
3395120	3399600	However, we reserve the right to remove any content that we believe is unlawful, infringing
3399600	3401900	or inappropriate or not with these guidelines.
3401900	3407080	And then number four, what exactly are the monetization methods separately specified
3407080	3409800	by Nintendo as referred in the guidelines.
3409800	3415080	So they're talking about monetization through Facebook, Nico Nico, open rec TV, Twitch,
3415080	3416760	Twitter, and YouTube.
3416760	3422140	Could it be that the reason that like mixer isn't on there is they don't have a way to
3422140	3425360	monetize stuff yet.
3425360	3426540	Their partners do.
3426540	3427540	Your partners do.
3427540	3428540	Yeah.
3428540	3432280	Uh, of course they have an asterisk, they're subject to be updated.
3432280	3437560	So I just think again, and I mentioned this on Bobby show and this topic came up on the
3437560	3439480	call that we do at the end of the show.
3439480	3444160	But um, I think with a mixer, I think it's just that mixer does a lot of Microsoft stuff.
3444160	3448400	There's a lot of PC stuff, not exactly known for its heavy Nintendo presence.
3448400	3451460	And although you may not have heard of some of these streaming sites that were brought
3451460	3455200	up here, um, like Nico Nico, like that one's here in Japan.
3455200	3456200	Yeah.
3456200	3458280	I mean, I maybe some of you have, but some of these sites that Loki's naming, they're
3458280	3459280	big in other countries.
3459280	3461660	They're just not the method of choice here.
3461660	3465640	But did you, did you say things like daily motion and yeah, so there are other cause
3465640	3467900	like PlayStation four will let you stream to daily motion.
3467940	3473100	So there are other sites that are being not called out here, but I would assume it's a
3473100	3476060	similar kind of rule on these sites.
3476060	3477060	So I would assume.
3477060	3480900	So I think they're just listing sites cause they're talking about, yeah, I don't know.
3480900	3484900	Um, so yeah, I mean, I guess, sorry, I'm laughing.
3484900	3488220	Zach Defton chat says, this is the best news from Nintendo in the whole year.
3488220	3489220	Yeah.
3489220	3490220	Even more than it is.
3490220	3491220	But it is good.
3491220	3494100	I think the whole program that they have was absolute shit.
3494100	3496220	So it is a step in the right direction, misinformed.
3496220	3498940	I'm going to say it was, it was just, it just wasn't a good idea.
3498940	3499940	Yeah.
3499940	3501300	And I think finally I think it caught up with them.
3501300	3504460	You know, um, I think there are certain big channels who made a decision to just stop
3504460	3506220	covering Nintendo.
3506220	3510780	And I think somebody finally had a discussion of where finally everybody made a meeting
3510780	3515060	that was planned to one week where they brought in some numbers and said, you know what guys,
3515060	3520940	this program is just not effective because we're not getting looked at by these people.
3520940	3522900	And what are we really gaining from this?
3522900	3523900	We're not.
3523900	3526420	We're not getting social media feedback on our creators program.
3526420	3528500	We're not getting new people that apply.
3528500	3530100	People are just doing it on Twitch anyway.
3530100	3534180	So, so I think finally they just sat down and said, why don't we just adopt a policy
3534180	3535560	similar to Sony and Microsoft?
3535560	3538460	Some people are worried about certain wording that's in there.
3538460	3542620	Like for example, you're only permitted to use Nintendo game content that has been officially
3542620	3543620	released.
3543620	3548100	So like for example, they were saying officially, does that mean ROM hacks and fan games?
3548100	3553880	Not officially, honestly, if you want to take it at face value, no.
3553880	3557640	Or I mean, if you want to take it at face value, that stuff is not acceptable.
3557640	3561320	However, is Nintendo going to blackball that stuff?
3561320	3564960	Probably I would think Nintendo is going to turn a blind eye to it, especially when it
3564960	3566820	comes to things like AGDQ.
3566820	3570760	We all know that Nintendo would be the biggest dick bags in the world to smack down a charity
3570760	3573580	event that they just happen to be playing ROM hacks.
3573580	3576640	And I think Nintendo is well aware enough of that as well.
3576640	3582720	That wording is specifically for what is happening right now with Smash and how that, and to
3582720	3588400	be fair, I think when it comes to the hack, like the homegrown Smash that they did, that
3588400	3591160	stuff, Nintendo probably don't want that stuff out there either.
3591160	3594480	Well, I think also like they're talking about like maybe like if somehow someone were to
3594480	3598040	leak footage from a game that hasn't been released or something like that, like if something
3598040	3602200	were to leak out of Nintendo, then they'd be able to smack it down.
3602200	3605800	It's maybe, but I don't know.
3605800	3609000	Then, then you have to kind of question what ends up being fair use for the purposes of
3609000	3611840	news and commentary and you just get into all that stuff.
3611840	3615280	But unfortunately, if you still continue to use YouTube, you're going to notice there's
3615280	3620320	a very good reason why VOG Network went to Twitch and not YouTube Live because I'll just
3620320	3623680	say it because I'm not one to hold back tonight because YouTube Live, and I've said this over
3623680	3628480	and over again on the show, YouTube has demonstrated that they do not side with their creators
3628480	3630080	ever in these issues.
3630080	3635720	So whereas Twitch seems to make decisions that, you know, they're not always what you
3635720	3640360	want to hear, but I feel like for the most part, they've been a lot more sensible in
3640360	3643720	the types of decisions they make and so forth over on Twitch.
3643720	3644720	And that's a big part.
3644720	3648740	Obviously, I solely did not make the decision, but those were the type of factors I weighed
3648740	3651120	when I cast my vote, we'll put it that way.
3651120	3658500	So anyway, my point is with that, if you know, if there's like a leak and that's like newsworthy,
3658500	3662340	one could argue that's a bit of like news and fair use, but I think Nintendo is trying
3662340	3665880	to prevent the straight up piracy leaks, that type of stuff.
3665880	3666880	They don't want that.
3666880	3670800	They're not streaming four hours of Smash Brothers or worse yet, a more, well, I guess
3670800	3675160	Smash Brothers is story based, but I was going to say, let's say in a couple of years time,
3675160	3680040	they do a new Zelda because Nintendo would be redonkulous to not give us a new Zelda
3680040	3681920	after Breath of the Wild was fucking amazing, right?
3681920	3683400	There's going to be a new Zelda someday.
3683400	3684460	We all know.
3684460	3688800	So what they'd want, what they don't want is somebody streaming the entirety of Zelda
3688800	3693240	and the story spoilers and all that stuff three weeks before the game is out.
3693240	3695560	That's that's what that is there for.
3695560	3696560	And I get it.
3696560	3698440	Like they want to keep that stuff under wraps.
3698440	3703120	I think, I think you can, I think you can give Nintendo that for all the Nintendo is
3703120	3706800	clueless when it comes to online shit that they've they're given over the years.
3706800	3709240	This new policy is good enough.
3709240	3713380	And again, I really think if you go look at Sony and Microsoft's policies, you're not
3713380	3715880	going to find that big a difference.
3715880	3718420	Sony and Microsoft don't want that stuff out there either.
3718420	3720740	So I really don't think you're going to find big differences in that.
3720740	3722880	So I'm glad they're on this route.
3722880	3723880	Yeah.
3723880	3728240	So anyhow, um, tiger class has four hours of smash brothers.
3728240	3730000	What if you were broadcasting a tournament?
3730000	3733680	Well, you're not going to be doing a tournament of a game that has not yet been released yet.
3733680	3738040	Cause that's a whole nother reason unless here's the funny thing.
3738040	3740920	If you're a Nintendo and it's your official tournament, well, you can do whatever you
3740920	3744520	want because remember at E3, they did do a super smash brothers, ultimate tournament.
3744520	3746480	Am I, am I not right?
3746480	3747720	Didn't they do a tournament?
3747720	3748720	I don't remember.
3748720	3749720	I think they did.
3750440	3755200	And when Nintendo's doing tree house and all that stuff at E3, they can stream all the
3755200	3757040	Nintendo stuff they want.
3757040	3764900	Um, but you know, a lot of that stuff again, like at an event like E3, you know, that media
3764900	3771760	is put out there for other people to put out on their channels and, you know, put out in
3771760	3772880	the open and so forth.
3772880	3775800	They just don't want unreleased stuff out there.
3775800	3780080	But E3 demo footage, I don't think is going to really be a problem either.
3780080	3786240	So, um, let's see, uh, Bobby Blackwell says they aired that on TBS last night.
3786240	3791440	The E league took that E3 tournament and turned it into a few episodes that aired on TBS last
3791440	3792440	week.
3792440	3793440	Huh?
3793440	3796360	Just, just in time for the release of the game.
3796360	3797360	Funny that.
3797360	3798360	Yeah.
3798360	3800480	Might wonder why it took a couple months of delay.
3800480	3802920	Did, did it really take that long to edit?
3803920	3806600	There's a little bit of both those things coming into play.
3806600	3807600	Who knows?
3807600	3808600	All right.
3808600	3809600	Yeah.
3809600	3811280	Tiger class says, so by the time ultimate comes out, we can expect tons of coverage
3811280	3813120	for that in the fighting game community.
3813120	3818880	And honestly, tiger claw, I think smash brothers could be the catalyst for why Nintendo finally
3818880	3823400	sat down to re review this decision because maybe they realized there were some big names
3823400	3827840	and fighting and all that stuff that we're not gonna look at it because of Nintendo's
3827840	3828840	rules.
3828840	3829840	And I mean, who knows?
3829840	3831800	I could, you know, I don't have all the facts in front of me.
3831800	3835000	Unfortunately, Nintendo knows why Nintendo made that decision, but I think somebody pointed
3835000	3839320	out to them, they were off base and thinking they could control the entire internet with
3839320	3842620	all that content and they got set on the right path.
3842620	3844520	So there you go.
3844520	3845520	Anyhow.
3845520	3851700	Um, maybe not so much on the right path, uh, as it comes to light this week, uh, the PlayStation
3851700	3852700	classic.
3852700	3853700	Yeah.
3853700	3855360	That's coming out real soon too.
3855360	3860520	And uh, turns out, uh, some of the games on the PlayStation classic, not actually going
3860520	3863680	to be exactly the same as you remember them in America.
3863680	3867520	That's because they're adopting a different standard for the PlayStation classic called
3867520	3872000	pal, which if you're in Europe, well, that will be the game that you remember.
3872000	3877140	But essentially the difference is that a game in pal would run at 50 Hertz.
3877140	3883800	So a game that runs at 30 frames a second in America runs at 25 frames a second in Europe,
3883800	3884800	essentially.
3884800	3887800	I mean, because you know, 60 Hertz is that more like standard here.
3887800	3890180	It's like, so if you kind of do your fraction, okay, anyway.
3890180	3895580	So, so essentially it cuts down the frame rates a little bit.
3895580	3897580	Will most people notice?
3897580	3898580	Yes.
3898580	3899580	Oh, you think so?
3899580	3900580	Okay.
3900580	3901580	You will.
3901580	3905660	But if you're like a big Tekken fighting game person and Tekken is one of the games, Tekken
3905660	3910240	three, where the pal version is used, uh, those frames can absolutely make or break
3910240	3912740	when it comes to when you block, when you do your moves.
3912740	3918060	Cause the games they're running at 50 frames per second says 60, uh, that's a locked 50.
3918060	3919660	Well, it's not even locked.
3919660	3920660	It's you know.
3920660	3921660	Yeah.
3921660	3926900	Uh, Sony did confirm that news in a PlayStation, a blog post about the PlayStation classic.
3926900	3933260	Uh, and uh, yeah, so for some reason, uh, the Europe versions are going to be the worldwide
3933260	3934260	versions.
3934260	3935300	Uh, it's not just Tekken.
3935300	3936300	It's going to be as well.
3936300	3939940	Resident Evil Director's Cut, Tom Clancy, Rainbow Six, Oddworld, Abe's Odyssey, Jumping
3939940	3944820	Flash, Grand Theft Auto, Destruction Derby, Cool Borders 2, Battle Arena, Tushin Den.
3944820	3949740	So yeah, you go, you go watch the Digital Foundry's video, they kind of do a nice breakdown
3949740	3954700	of all the things that are not so great about, um, the PlayStation classic being, uh, there's
3954700	3959260	sound emulation issues, there's slowdowns and games that weren't in the actual versions
3959260	3960260	of the game.
3960260	3966060	Um, just even the emulation like method that they use is not fantastic.
3966060	3972420	It just, it works better on the PSP even, which if you think about it, like, I don't
3973020	3976700	know, man, you could like buy an old PSP and with the video out cables and get a better
3976700	3982940	experience than you would with, with the PlayStation classic, which is pathetic.
3982940	3983940	I don't know.
3983940	3984940	I think you can do better.
3984940	3985940	Yeah.
3985940	3990700	You know, with retro arch, they have other, um, they were showing there's one, I don't
3990700	3994500	remember what, um, core it was, but there was a different PlayStation core that you
3994500	4000500	could do that was, it actually fixes all the texture distortions issues that the PlayStation
4000500	4001500	had.
4001580	4002580	Oh my God.
4002580	4008740	They should like, um, are four on that hole that now that was how it looked.
4008740	4010300	That would be fantastic.
4010300	4016380	And I'd be totally on board with getting it, but no, not, not the way this is.
4016380	4021180	Well, uh, also one other thing is that in the blog post, uh, the PlayStation classic
4021180	4022780	will not be upgradable.
4022780	4025740	They're saying the PS classic is preloaded with 20 of the best games from the original
4025740	4029500	PlayStation is not possible to purchase additional games for PlayStation classic.
4029500	4030820	I don't know where that rumor came from.
4031140	4034740	I thought they made it pretty clear before that it's not like they're not connecting
4034740	4038060	it online or anything, but whatever it just sounds like a challenge to me.
4038060	4039060	Yeah.
4039060	4040060	Right.
4040060	4044500	I mean, who, you wouldn't really want to upgrade it, but I mean, you could like, I'm sure it'll
4044500	4045500	be hacked.
4045500	4049820	I can't wait for the, you know, that portion of it and who knows, you know, being that
4049820	4054460	it could be hacked and being that it's running an open source emulator anyways, I would think
4054460	4059780	that perhaps we could just load something on there that maybe emulates it better.
4059780	4060780	I don't know.
4060780	4061780	All right.
4061780	4065500	Uh, anyway, uh, Bobby Blackwell's in our chat saying the official reason is because the
4065500	4069180	Europe versions have seven languages where the North American versions only have English
4069180	4070940	and maybe French for Canada.
4070940	4074780	And they wanted to make only one PlayStation classic for both North America and Europe.
4074780	4083340	I mean, I, I guess yay to more countries having access to this because of language needs,
4083340	4089700	but it just doesn't seem like the greatest followup news story when this, I think most
4089700	4093700	people, here's the thing, I think most people were already feeling lukewarm on this.
4093700	4095900	And so this is just another kick in the shin.
4095900	4097460	You know what I mean?
4097460	4098460	Yeah.
4098460	4101060	So yeah, just minimal viable product.
4101060	4102060	Yeah, exactly.
4102060	4105580	So, all right, well, we'll see how it goes for him.
4105580	4106580	Anyhow, moving on.
4106580	4109540	I have a feeling this will be PlayStation's only classic console though.
4109540	4111240	We'll see moving on to Loki.
4111240	4116120	So I'm surprised I didn't play this this week, but a red dead online, they did like a surprise
4116120	4119680	announcement that, Hey, we're going to be doing testing for red dead online.
4119680	4122020	So you go ahead and check it out.
4122020	4123360	It's going to be available out there.
4123360	4130360	So people got a chance to actually check out what the online micro track and transactions
4130360	4131360	are going to look like.
4131360	4136240	So you much like Grand Theft Auto online, you know, they have different currency.
4136240	4138960	You can buy, you know, shark cards.
4138960	4143360	So in Grand Theft Auto online, that is in the form of gold bars.
4143600	4147200	Right now you cannot purchase gold bars for real world cash.
4147200	4149840	That is going to be probably coming.
4149840	4154400	So right now you earn nuggets and I believe for every 100 nuggets you get, you get a gold
4154400	4155400	bar.
4155400	4160600	And for some of the customization in the game, it costs you money to do that.
4160600	4164800	For example, they said with the, if you want to change all of the metal pieces on your
4164800	4169300	starting rifle, it's going to cost you 30 gold bars, which takes about 200 plus hours
4169300	4170960	to earn.
4170960	4174400	The only other way is to purchase, you know, gold.
4174400	4179920	And then they said, of course, future, your first horse, I guess you can ensure it without
4179920	4180920	gold.
4180920	4182960	So that means that it will respawn.
4182960	4190440	Otherwise, if you buy a horse later on, you would need five gold bars to ensure it.
4190440	4198040	And then also people are finding that the in-game prices for items that you can purchase
4198040	4202480	are much higher in the online version versus the actual game.
4202480	4207160	Whereas the rewards aren't necessarily as high because of course they're trying to drive
4207160	4212100	you to buying, you know, that online currency.
4212100	4218320	See for me, I'm not, I'm kind of worried that I don't think the draw like with Grand Theft
4218320	4223320	Auto five online is going to be the same as this game.
4223320	4226960	I don't think that Red Dead Online is going to have that same draw because you're kind
4226960	4230400	of limited in scope of what you can do with the game.
4230400	4235000	Whereas Grand Theft Auto, I mean, you have like stunt races and shit with like cars transforming
4235000	4240120	and all sorts of like crazy tracks and stuff in the sky and different game modes that are
4240120	4243840	ridiculous like with spy cars and all that.
4243840	4248860	I just think you're going to be kind of limited what you can do game mode wise.
4248860	4253520	And so I may be harder for them to make that money back that they think they're going to
4253520	4254520	make with this.
4254520	4255520	But I guess we'll have to wait and see.
4255720	4259680	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Red Dead Online is just Barbie horse adventures with mustaches
4259680	4260880	and guns.
4260880	4262640	Bobby knows how to sell video games.
4262640	4265840	Like I'm kind of interested all of a sudden.
4265840	4272100	No, I mean the online mode I bet would be pretty cool, but yeah, I don't know.
4272100	4275760	Maybe it just sounds like it's very, very limited, but it's like all these games kind
4275760	4277800	of like have forced online modes these days, right?
4277800	4281380	I remember Mass Effect 3 got so much shit for having an online mode when it was such
4281380	4282480	a narrative game.
4282480	4286480	But like honestly, I still defend Mass Effect 3's online mode.
4286480	4289000	I thought it made that game that much better.
4289000	4292040	Like for all the shit it got for its ending and all that other stuff, like honestly, the
4292040	4293560	online mode was fucking solid.
4293560	4295400	Like I really loved how they implemented it.
4295400	4300540	And I kind of wish like, yes, I know we got another online mode in Andromeda, which really
4300540	4301840	it wasn't bad.
4301840	4305680	I didn't like it as much as 3's, but it was competent.
4305680	4310000	So I'd like to see another Mass Effect that's that if I can't get a narrative game soon.
4310000	4313480	Like here's an example of how fucked up the economy is online right now.
4313480	4320080	So they said in the game you can steal, you know, loot stagecoaches and stuff like that.
4320080	4329100	You can sell a gold wedding ring for $1.15, but a can of beans costs $1.50 to buy.
4329100	4333520	That's more than they cost at Winco.
4333520	4334520	That's a supermarket here.
4334520	4337560	I don't know if that's a nationwide thing, but all right anyway.
4337560	4341700	So it's just like, it's, it sounds like they're going to need, but you know what though?
4341700	4344400	To be fair, it is a beta.
4344400	4346880	All this stuff can be rebalanced.
4346880	4351960	That being said, in Red Dead Online, or not Red Dead Online, in Grand Theft Auto Online,
4351960	4355220	the prices of cars have been going up and up and up and up and up.
4355220	4362600	So yeah, Red and Rockstar did make a lot of money off of Grand Theft Auto Online, so you
4362600	4363600	know.
4363640	4369120	All right, well, let's talk about some rumors.
4369120	4371880	Everybody's favorite thing to get into in this slow news period time of year.
4371880	4375660	Although no, to be real, I mean the game awards are coming up this next week, so I always
4375660	4379460	forget how quick and fast they come and they go, right?
4379460	4382840	Like I feel like we just heard the nominees for these a couple weeks ago, and now it's
4382840	4385160	like bam, the awards are here.
4385160	4389000	Which the nominees are not legitimate because Tetris Effect only got one nomination in a
4389000	4392600	minor category, and that is criminal, I'm sorry.
4392600	4399400	But all that joking aside, we know that we're going to get some big game reveals at the
4399400	4400400	game awards.
4400400	4401400	Yes.
4401400	4403780	Especially with no PSX this time of year, right?
4403780	4406480	So there's really, it's kind of open season in December for announcers.
4406480	4410600	The one I paid attention to was the Russo Brothers are going to be there.
4410600	4412680	Oh yeah, they're, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4412680	4413680	The Avengers, right?
4413680	4414680	Yes.
4414680	4415680	So I'm hoping that Avengers game.
4415680	4419240	Yeah, it would either be the trailer for the fourth movie, but not sure that's the right
4419240	4420240	place for that.
4420240	4422240	I think the trailer for the Avengers game would be hot.
4422880	4423880	I'll take both.
4423880	4424880	Yeah.
4424880	4429440	I would, I would say if you're going to bet money, go on, they're not going to do, they're
4429440	4431680	not going to debut a trailer at a game show.
4431680	4434040	They're going to debut the game trailer.
4434040	4435040	Yes.
4435040	4436040	Yeah.
4436040	4439860	So anyway, uh, but one of the other big rumors is, uh, something circulating about Mortal
4439860	4441960	Combat 11.
4441960	4445740	Now grain of salt, y'all it's from 4chan.
4445740	4450960	So I completely understand if you want to tell me this is just like the Grinch leak
4451000	4452320	or whatever.
4452320	4458480	However, there are some indications based on things like track record, the thoroughness,
4458480	4462760	some other things in the responses and some things that have collaborated that give it
4462760	4464040	a few more legs.
4464040	4468420	And also, I mean, are they going to make a Mortal Combat 11?
4468420	4469420	You know what?
4469420	4472620	It's, it's a pretty safe bet that yes, they are going to make a Mortal Combat 11.
4472620	4475720	When did Mortal Combat 10 or Mortal Combat X, if you will, when did that happen?
4475720	4476720	That was what?
4476720	4477720	Back in 2014, 2015?
4477720	4478720	A little while ago.
4478720	4480900	It was a few years ago.
4480900	4484100	So I mean, granted, there was Injustice 2, so it's not like Netherrealm's been sitting
4484100	4488160	on their butt, but they've been probably pretty busy, you know, working on a Mortal
4488160	4489600	Combat 11.
4489600	4494380	So I won't get into too many more of the rumors, but one thing that I did find interesting,
4494380	4498000	they are talking about some character things, but I think, I think it's A, way too early
4498000	4499000	to talk about that.
4499000	4501380	B, who knows what's going to turn up as fucking DLC anyway.
4501380	4504940	You say a character's not going to be in the game, it'll probably just be DLC later on.
4504940	4509920	But anyway, um, apparently there will be an adventure mode that will have gameplay similar
4509920	4512760	to Mortal Combat Shaolin Monks from 2005.
4512760	4513760	That's kind of interesting.
4513760	4514760	Sort of like Shaolin Monks.
4514760	4515760	Yeah, why not?
4515760	4516760	Why not?
4516760	4518680	So anyway, we'll see what happens.
4518680	4521640	We'll find out by this time next week when the Game Awards actually happen.
4521640	4528040	Now, something that seems a lot more probable when it comes to rumors is because Koei Tecmo
4528040	4533580	has a new game that they are teasing on a site and they're teasing the unveil as December
4533580	4534580	6th.
4534580	4536380	Well, guess what's on December 6th, you guys?
4536380	4537380	The Game Awards.
4537380	4542660	So, Koei Tecmo is almost certainly unveiling something for the PlayStation 4 and Switch
4542660	4547660	with the tagline on the website in Japanese that says, The Faded Battle Begins.
4547660	4550460	So Dynasty Warriors prequel?
4550460	4551460	I don't know.
4551460	4552460	It could be anything.
4552460	4561360	And I know that this is no surprise to anybody, but apparently, um, well, Conan O'Brien did
4561360	4567960	a trip in Japan recently and he went to Kojima Productions and they have footage that they're
4567960	4571160	going to show, but they're not allowed to show it yet.
4571160	4574880	So until after the Game Awards, oh, God, I'm going to do another Death Stranding tease
4574880	4575880	the Game Awards.
4575880	4579680	I think it's going to be another Death Stranding something or other.
4579680	4580680	Here's the thing.
4580680	4581680	I know.
4581680	4582680	You all know where I'm at with this.
4582680	4583680	You all know where I'm at with this.
4583680	4589840	Like if all I'm going to say is this game or get out, maybe it's game play.
4589840	4590840	Great.
4590840	4592640	Well, they showed gameplay last time.
4592640	4598800	It's still like running around.
4598800	4601520	So game or just don't bother.
4601520	4603780	Don't please don't show up.
4603780	4606420	I'm sure people are going to see it and love it and eat it up anyway.
4606420	4610460	And because it is Kojima, I have to cut this some slack because Kojima doesn't really make
4610460	4611460	bad games.
4611460	4613800	I mean, he doesn't.
4613800	4616920	Like and he makes games that unfortunately didn't get finished, but I still would have
4616920	4620360	loved to play such as Silent Hills.
4620360	4627840	Anyway, Tigerclaw theorizes is that I bet this new gameplay footage will show another
4627840	4631240	major celebrity that's in Death Stranding.
4631240	4633960	Perhaps another cameo might be good.
4633960	4635320	We'll see.
4635320	4638880	Anyhow, let's move on with a couple more stories and then we'll get to the classic game of
4638880	4639880	the week.
4639880	4640880	Loki.
4640880	4648780	So apparently a full copy of Super Smash Brothers Ultimate has leaked out two weeks early.
4648780	4657420	And this was caught online by it's been spreading around against YouTube and Reddit and 4chan.
4657420	4664680	Basically the hacker who went by the name of J.J. was showing off like some gameplay
4664680	4669740	and was basically, you know, they had asked to confirm that it was legit and stuff and
4669740	4675700	basically showing, you know, different specific stages and stuff, whatnot.
4675700	4679940	Apparently he believes a leak came out online and thinks that it came from a journalist's
4679940	4685260	early code or a wholesaler that broke street date.
4685260	4689780	Probably from another country because I know that's a ship and that early anywhere for
4689780	4695900	this specific reason of breaking street.
4695900	4701700	But apparently, you know, this has been cast smack down by Nintendo already.
4701700	4707780	And so be curious to see, though, what's going to be coming out regarding this, you
4707780	4710380	know, for any more details will leak out.
4710380	4714220	But really a couple of days away.
4714220	4715220	So, you know.
4715220	4718240	Yeah, I know you're a couple of days away from being able to play the game yourself.
4718240	4722180	It sounds like the thing the thing that would probably be the biggest surprise would be
4722180	4725940	any more characters, because sometimes in Smash Brothers, like even with this last one
4725940	4730180	on Wii U and 3DS, we didn't know about Duck Hunt being in there until the game actually
4730180	4731180	like came out.
4731180	4734700	And there was there's a few things like that that they kept secret until the game is out.
4734700	4740340	Well, I will say now so the characters, they have because the leaks don't show any new
4740340	4741340	characters.
4741340	4742340	So that's that.
4742340	4748180	And plus, they found out they could sell new characters through DLC or give them away as
4748180	4749920	incentives like Piranha Plant.
4749920	4751340	And that would be a great way to do it.
4751340	4752860	So I kind of think that.
4752860	4757460	And it's also like you can't sit here and be like, gosh, Nintendo is really holding
4757460	4762180	back on characters when they are giving you every single it's not like they cut somebody
4762180	4763900	to make room and sell it later.
4763900	4767700	Now, they're giving you everybody from every single game and a few more.
4767700	4771180	So you really can't say Nintendo's holding back.
4771180	4773420	OK, so it is what it is.
4773420	4774420	No secret characters.
4774420	4776380	But I think there's some things related to story mode.
4776380	4779380	I won't get into that here, obviously for obvious reasons.
4779380	4784020	And then the music, the music list is out there, the full music list.
4784020	4787840	And all I'll say about that is it's it's goddamn impressive.
4787840	4790740	And it's going to make you wish that like there was just a mode where you could just
4790740	4795620	turn your little switch into a jukebox and like plug it in your car stereo and drive
4795620	4796620	down the highway.
4796620	4797620	That's what the aux cables for.
4797620	4798620	Yeah, maybe.
4798620	4799620	Maybe people will do that.
4799620	4800620	I don't know.
4800620	4804300	And I'm sure you I don't know graphically what it looks like, but they would be silly
4804300	4807800	if they didn't just put a mode in there where you just kind of like have your little switch
4807800	4812140	sitting there with the thing in the back that holds it up and and just have it playing some
4812140	4815460	music, you know, at your at your next party.
4815460	4816940	So there you go.
4816940	4819580	Act Defton chat says the leak apparently originated in Mexico.
4819580	4820580	Yes, I'd heard that too.
4820580	4824080	Sounds like a retailer there may have put it out on the shelf.
4824080	4830100	You know, just not everybody follows the rules and it's not always somebody maliciously trying
4830100	4831100	to do it.
4831100	4837360	It's just it may have gone to a bond pop indie store in a country where, you know, I'm sure
4837360	4843560	most North American, European, the big regions probably all get the rules enforced, you know,
4843560	4844560	very heavily.
4844560	4848000	But you start to go to places that maybe don't deal with as many companies on that kind of
4848000	4852240	stuff and NDA and street days that it was inevitable what was going to happen.
4852240	4855040	And once it's out there, y'all, it's out there.
4855040	4856040	Y'all know that.
4856040	4857040	Yeah.
4857040	4858040	So there it is.
4858040	4859480	Smash Brothers is leaking out.
4859480	4860520	So be careful of leaks.
4860520	4864600	But again, you're not going to I really I think the story stuff will be some people
4864600	4870120	things that people want to avoid, but I'm going to admit, I looked at it and I didn't
4870120	4873240	see anything that made me go, oh, my God.
4873240	4876600	But I didn't like really read through it with a fine tooth comb either.
4876600	4879260	Like, I'm just excited to play the game soon.
4879260	4883360	And honestly, like, I hate that when I phrase it that way, it makes it sound like I don't
4883360	4884360	care about the game or something.
4884360	4885360	I really do.
4885360	4888960	But like the minute they announced every single character will be here and you have this and
4888960	4889960	this and this and this.
4889960	4891400	I'm like, this game is going to be a great value.
4891400	4893200	Like, they don't even need to announce anything else.
4893200	4894200	It's going to be fine.
4894200	4895200	Yeah.
4895200	4898000	So I these spoilers are more of a whatever to me.
4898000	4899000	All right.
4899000	4902360	Anyhow, one other story here, and this is about a classic as we start to get into the
4902360	4903360	classic game of the week.
4903360	4908680	But Al Lowe, which is a name you may be familiar with as the creator of the Leisure Suit Larry
4908680	4911520	Games, and he did some of the other classic Sierra titles, too.
4911520	4915980	He's going to be selling some of his source code for classic Sierra games on eBay.
4915980	4919120	He did an interview with Metal Jesus Rocks on YouTube.
4919120	4922080	Never heard of the guy, but all right, go ahead.
4922080	4926160	And he said in the interview, Al Lowe said, I'm 72 years old and none of my kids want
4926160	4927360	this junk.
4927360	4928360	Does anybody?
4928360	4933040	Isn't that funny how like a lot of times kids like don't want to do the thing that their
4933040	4934040	parents are into?
4934040	4935960	Like this happens a lot with celebrities.
4935960	4939720	Some do like, you know, like Paris Jackson, daughter of Michael Jackson, I think wants
4939720	4940720	to be an entertainer.
4940720	4941720	She's kind of going down that path.
4941720	4946720	But you get a lot of like kids of famous movie stars and stuff that are like, I am perfectly
4946720	4952640	content being an accountant or being a office manager or be, you know, they, they don't
4952640	4954840	necessarily need that life.
4954840	4959000	So I could totally see where Al Lowe's kids are maybe like, that's cool that dad made
4959000	4963480	this video game that I don't want to make porn games, dad.
4963480	4967120	I won't do it.
4967120	4971320	So anyhow, listen son, you're going to make those porn games.
4971320	4976480	I didn't raise you to be anything like this.
4976520	4979200	Well now, Loki, you weren't there in that household, so we don't know.
4979200	4983440	But anyway, all that jokes aside, you can check them out on eBay.
4983440	4987200	They're all being sold under the same name, Al underscore Lowe.
4987200	4991600	What is currently being sold there, the source code for Leisure Suit Larry one and Leisure
4991600	4996180	Suit Larry two, which I think either one is going to set you at least $8,000.
4996180	5000200	To be clear, you are not buying the intellectual property rights to the game.
5000200	5003180	Somebody else has that right now because new Leisure Suit Larry games are coming out.
5003180	5006660	You are not buying the rights to compile this and mass produce it.
5006660	5008420	You don't have those sorts of rights.
5008420	5011180	You are getting the source code.
5011180	5012860	That's what you're getting.
5012860	5016140	And you know, but it could be a really cool little way to get some insight, especially
5016140	5017660	if you're like into that stuff.
5017660	5022940	I really, you know, I know there's some gaming museums and gaming preservation societies.
5022940	5026620	I hope some of them have the coin to throw in for this because I bet it would be really
5026620	5029020	fascinating if we could get that.
5029020	5033140	Word is, and Bobby was getting into this on his show, is that right now, as of right now,
5033140	5037460	it could change by the end, but as of right now, the highest bidder is the company that
5037460	5039660	owns the rights currently.
5039660	5041580	That's an interesting little twist, isn't it?
5041580	5047940	So since they own the rights, they would be able to take said source code and re-put out
5047940	5051500	the game and maybe put it, I don't fucking know, on mobile or whatever they want to do
5051500	5053220	with it, which is probably what would happen.
5053220	5054220	Who knows?
5054220	5055220	Don't quote me.
5055220	5058420	But it would be interesting to see if that's how it turns out.
5058420	5062700	I would love it though, if one of these like retro preservation societies, but it is a
5062740	5067940	lot of money and, you know, those societies run on donations, a lot of labor of love there.
5067940	5069380	Not a lot of people making money off that.
5069380	5077660	So they just may not be able to afford it unless a very kind donor steps out to do that.
5077660	5080260	So anyway, if you want to check that out, there's a whole little thing on YouTube and
5080260	5081300	you can check more.
5081300	5082300	It's all over the Internet right now.
5082300	5085420	And again, the current bids over at Al underscore low.
5085420	5091940	So as of the recording of the show Sunday night at about 730 Pacific time, $8,400 for
5091940	5096060	the source code to Leisure Suit Larry 2, excuse me, $8401.
5096060	5101100	Source code to Leisure Suit Larry 1, $9,201.
5101100	5104860	There's some other collectibles he's selling as well, including, I don't know how this
5104860	5109540	BAPA bet is going through for $10,000 because it's extremely rare.
5109540	5112660	That's going for more than the source code, go figure, but he's selling some other little
5112660	5113660	things here and there too.
5113660	5115660	So interesting.
5115660	5119260	So yeah, hopefully again, somebody will be able to come up with a coin to buy that source
5119260	5120860	code and preserve it.
5121780	5124580	All right, but for now, let's talk about, let's talk about other games that might need
5124580	5125580	some preserving.
5125580	5128620	And so we go to the classic game of the week.
5128620	5136260	And so we take a step through the portal of radio magic to a simpler time and simpler
5136260	5137260	games.
5137260	5138260	It's the classic game of the week.
5138260	5140660	And joining us on the Skypline tonight is Dark Sakura.
5140660	5141660	Oh, hi.
5141660	5144980	Hi, how are you doing?
5144980	5145980	I'm okay.
5145980	5146980	Good.
5146980	5149260	It's good to have you here.
5149260	5150260	What's that?
5150660	5151660	Been busy.
5151660	5154740	You've been putting stuff together for the show behind the scenes.
5154740	5155740	It has been busy.
5155740	5160940	We did, we went on a little friend date yesterday and we did some stuff for the big studio changeover
5160940	5163860	or makeover, whatever you want to call it, and the Twitch stuff.
5163860	5166120	And then we went out to food and that was good.
5166120	5167120	And there were so many leftovers.
5167120	5169780	I believe you're eating them now, right?
5169780	5170780	I am.
5170780	5173780	I finally all by myself finished off the wonton soup.
5173780	5174780	Congrats.
5174780	5175780	Good job.
5175780	5176780	Good job.
5176780	5177780	All right.
5178300	5182140	I want our listeners to step into the gaming vault like you do every week and curl up with
5182140	5187340	some nice hot soup in this winter weather and play, I guess, a scary game this week,
5187340	5188340	Dark Sakura.
5188340	5190180	What is the classic game of the week?
5190180	5194300	The classic game of the week is a game called Sweet Home.
5194300	5200260	And I don't think a lot of people might have heard about it because while it's a neat game,
5200260	5204060	it's based off of a kind of obscure movie.
5204060	5212740	Sweet Home was a ghost movie that came out in Japan that was about a team of filmmakers
5212740	5218100	who wanted to run a documentary about an artist who had lived there and he died, but it turned
5218100	5222940	out that the house was, of course, haunted in true Japanese ghost story fashion.
5222940	5231340	So the game is based on the movie, but the game director, who is a Fujiwara Tokuro, he
5231340	5236140	got complete permission to tour the film sets to inspire him for the game, and then
5236140	5239820	the film director said he could take liberties with the script.
5239820	5247500	So it actually was an expansion of the story in a little bit.
5247500	5250860	The game came out in December 1989 only in Japan.
5250860	5255820	It actually had some really good reception, and it was even called Better Than the Film,
5255820	5259220	which how often does that happen for a video game tie-in?
5259220	5260220	Like never.
5260220	5263980	I always say, we never get video games that are better than the movie.
5263980	5266180	I'm trying to think if there's others.
5266180	5267180	It's very rare.
5267180	5268180	It's very rare.
5268180	5269180	Very rare.
5269180	5270180	Yeah.
5270180	5274500	But at any rate, the game never did come out in the West just because it really did have
5274500	5281420	some pretty, at the time, gruesome imagery, and of course also RPGs weren't very popular
5281420	5285140	outside of Japan in the late 80s.
5285140	5292820	But the game itself, it's very significant because of what it led to as well.
5292820	5298740	Fujiwara Tokuro also had worked on Ghosts and Goblins in the arcade, so he already had
5298740	5304140	that little bit of a finger into the pool of scary.
5304140	5310820	So the big thing about this game is that it really did, and I'll get to the games that
5310820	5315620	get really inspired later on because that's a big part of it, but lots of different things
5315620	5320740	came in in the game, including the use of quick time events, inventory management, ghost
5320740	5324580	story, and the Metroidvania-style exploration gameplay.
5324580	5329420	On top of that, it also had like story switching, or more like character switching.
5329420	5336220	So basically, in the game, you are in this intricate mansion, and you have five playable
5336220	5340340	characters, and they were all characters in the movie, but each character has the unique
5340380	5345620	item that is necessary to finish the game, including a camera, a lighter, a medical kit,
5345620	5347580	a lock pit, and a vacuum cleaner.
5347580	5353700	Okay, the vacuum cleaner actually belongs to a painting restoration person, like to
5353700	5356300	vacuum up glass, you know, like a little vacuum cleaner.
5356300	5361420	But, I mean, in the nutshell, the game is where these people are, like I said, are going
5361420	5367140	in to explore a house that was left abandoned so they could see the last works of this great
5367140	5370060	artist who died, and of course, ghosts.
5370460	5375220	But getting back into it, you've also got, you know, different puzzles to solve, inventory
5375220	5380340	management, survival horror, one of the early survival horror games, and you have to backtrack
5380340	5385660	to other locations to solve puzzles with items you acquire later in this giant mansion.
5385660	5386660	Hint, hint.
5387020	5393020	And the mansion eventually grows, like you know how when you go through Metroid, you
5393020	5394900	get a different area, that's how the mansion works.
5395900	5398420	You have random enemies, and you either fight or run away.
5398940	5405220	You can also pray, but you get different types of enemies, like zombies and ghosts and dolls.
5405220	5409620	And the only way that you can restore your health is by getting conics in the mansion.
5409620	5415500	The story does have some cinematic cut scenes, you know, for an NES game at the time, and
5415500	5420220	you can pick up notes like secret messages and diary entries that tell you more of the story.
5421020	5425860	Now, with the game, you have different traps that you have to settle itself really quickly
5425860	5428100	or else you die, or the character dies.
5428100	5432500	And then when a character dies, they remain dead permanently in the game, like permanent death.
5432500	5433500	There's no bringing them back.
5433500	5434500	Yikes.
5434500	5440500	But the items that have their power is left to be used by somebody else.
5440500	5445980	So like for example, if the nurse Akiko dies, then the team will find pill bottles that
5445980	5449460	can be used to heal ailments, so different things like that.
5449460	5454540	And depending on how many characters are alive after you defeat the final boss, you get different
5454540	5458940	endings depending on, you know, it's up to five endings depending on how many people you live.
5459940	5472340	But so basically, the movie itself, 30 years prior to the game, so like in 1959, this artist
5472340	5480740	named Maemiya Ichiro, I'm sorry, I cannot pronounce his name tonight, had different
5480740	5485340	frescoes that were in his mansion before he disappeared or died.
5485340	5489420	And so the present day, these five documentary filmmakers are going in to recover the paintings
5489420	5494220	in his mansion, but they find that this ghost of an unknown woman wants to kill them.
5494220	5498820	Turns out the ghost was his wife and their two year old fell into the incinerator and
5498820	5505580	died there and had to be fed like the corpses of other children to be happy and bringing
5505580	5509700	him playmates by killing other children and that she killed herself and all this stuff.
5509740	5512540	This is a wonderful holiday selection, Dark Sakura.
5513780	5514500	Of course it is.
5515340	5517980	So now here is the reason why the game is important.
5518500	5525220	Like I said, it was directed by Fujiwara Tokuro, and he had worked on Ghosts and Goblins on
5525220	5528580	Commando, Violet Commando, Mega Man 2 and Strider.
5529420	5541380	Um, now there's more that goes to this is that, um, the ideas that came into this game
5541380	5546820	eventually made it into another game called Biohazard.
5547940	5549340	Where do we know Biohazard from?
5549580	5552180	Uh, Resident Evil 7 is called Biohazard.
5553460	5556660	Well, the first Resident Evil was called Biohazard in Japan.
5556900	5558260	I know, I was just setting you up.
5558900	5567260	Yeah, anyway, um, it was, the first Biohazard was supposed to be a remake of Sweet Home.
5567980	5574180	Um, it was directed by, uh, Mikami Shinji with Fujiwara acting as the producer.
5574540	5579820	And he thought that, you know, there were so many things he wanted to do in Sweet Home
5580260	5585940	that there would be the, um, you know, the ability to do this now on the PlayStation.
5586700	5591300	And of course also came out on Saturn, but Capcom no longer had the rights to Sweet Home.
5591620	5594860	So they created a new universe and that's where Biohazard came from.
5595380	5603940	And so in all of the Biohazard games, it has, um, like elements that were introduced in Sweet Home.
5604460	5610220	So like, for example, um, the first Resident Evil is supposed to be, um, first person battle
5610220	5613100	perspective, but then that got changed because of how the game had to go.
5613420	5619020	But it had like, you know, the mansion with the layout, getting the story through notes, multiple endings,
5619020	5625260	depending on who survives, you know, the imagery, the door loading sequences, puzzles, backtracking,
5625260	5631260	all of this, you know, having to use a lockpick and a lighter, you know, and then in the later games,
5631260	5636620	Resident Evil 0, um, let you switch between characters and draw up items for the other characters,
5637700	5639380	which you could do in Sweet Home.
5639780	5645500	Um, the quick time events, you know, showed up in Resident Evil 4 and after Resident Evil 7 even has
5645500	5650580	some story elements, including the film crew going to an abandoned house with a paranormal female
5650580	5651500	presence in the house.
5651740	5654220	So, you know, tragic stories.
5654220	5660340	And it also, um, apparently plays homage to Sweet Home and a side story told through a VHS tape.
5660740	5666380	So it, it was really, you know, that just kept going on and on and on.
5666980	5673380	And so it's just funny to see how even today, those elements are still going on in the current
5673380	5674700	Resident Evil franchise.
5677340	5678260	And so there you go.
5678540	5679660	The game is Sweet Home.
5679780	5684140	Sweet Home for the Famicom, because it wasn't really released here officially in the US anyway,
5684140	5687860	but fan, fan translations are available because this is the internet.
5687900	5688700	They are out there.
5688940	5691380	Um, and I gotta say, yeah, like,
5691380	5695460	I don't know, maybe, maybe we should like do a take turn stream of this game.
5695460	5700780	Yeah, that might be fun because like, yeah, I mean, so much depth to this game, which was on the NES.
5700780	5705460	I mean, you're talking about a lot of concepts like, uh, endings based on who lives and who dies.
5705460	5708180	Like that was Until Dawn was very famous for that very recently.
5708460	5711820	Um, you know, a lot of these other games like the quick time events and things.
5712140	5716180	And, um, yeah, when I'm, when I'm kind of watching, cause I, I was not very familiar with this game
5716180	5719820	until I knew you were going to pick it and I kind of, kind of looked up some stuff on it and, uh, it
5719820	5723380	looks like, especially like in the overhead and when they're kind of walking around, it looks a lot
5723380	5728460	like to me, and this is another obscure pick, but Ultima 4 Quest of the Avatar is kind of like what it looks like.
5728460	5728860	Yeah.
5729060	5729540	Yeah.
5729900	5733980	But then it's got like all this, yeah, this whole different element to it.
5733980	5734140	Yeah.
5734140	5737380	The way the menus work and the perspective and everything really looks like Ultima 4 to me.
5737820	5739940	But yeah, kind of neat.
5740220	5745700	But it was, you know, and the funny thing is, is that now that I think about it, you remember I said
5745780	5748620	that when I was younger, I had a Japanese friend who had a Famicom.
5748740	5749140	Yeah.
5750780	5751940	I think my friend owns this game.
5752380	5753100	Nice.
5753500	5754540	Well, you should, uh,
5754940	5756660	never played it, but I remember the box.
5756900	5757420	Yeah.
5757860	5758460	That's awesome.
5758460	5761740	Well, there it is again, your game of the week, sweet home on the Famicom.
5761740	5763860	Good choice, Jamie, educating the listeners tonight.
5764060	5769100	Although I don't know, I might've done it in October, but, uh, she does it her way here on OLR.
5770620	5771420	I do what I want.
5772100	5772580	That's right.
5772660	5774700	By the way, I will be on the show next week.
5774740	5775460	Hooray.
5775500	5779220	I was going to say Dark Soccer's favorite Christmas movie, Krampus.
5781340	5782620	No, it's Gremlins.
5782660	5783100	Thank you.
5783500	5784020	Oh, sorry.
5784020	5787900	I was, I, at least you can go with Die Hard, which I think is now like the cliche answer.
5787900	5789980	Everybody says Die Hard's a favorite Christmas movie.
5790100	5790740	That's a cliche.
5790820	5792860	You know, I'm not, this may be blasphemy.
5792860	5794500	I'm not really the biggest fan of Die Hard.
5795020	5795700	Oh my.
5796020	5796620	All right.
5796660	5799980	Well, I'm sure, I'm sure you'll get some hate mail in our discord.
5801620	5802260	That's all right.
5802780	5806420	Uh, you know what, if you just, I will say that to my dying day, be mad about it.
5807060	5810300	Die mad about it while playing sweet home on the Famicom.
5810540	5811100	All right, there it is.
5811100	5814660	We got to get back to the studio for this week, but we'll see you in studio next week.
5814940	5817660	Uh, Dark Sakura, any final parting thoughts for our listeners?
5819060	5820140	Next week is Hanukkah.
5820340	5821140	You know what that means?
5822340	5823700	Latkes.
5829620	5832380	Oh boy, cooking with a Dark Sakura on the show next week.
5832380	5833380	I look forward to it though.
5833380	5833940	That's always fun.
5833940	5835060	She she's done that before.
5835060	5836780	I asked those of you that are newer to Orange Launch Radio.
5836780	5840220	She has, she has cooked latkes, this Hanukkah celebration live on the show before.
5840220	5841820	So I look forward to that, honestly.
5841860	5844100	So applesauce to all that good stuff.
5844100	5845980	So looking forward to that next week.
5845980	5848140	And again, those of you, I think I said this earlier in the show, but those of you
5848140	5851780	that are celebrating Hanukkah with the first night tonight, um, uh, hope you're
5851780	5854380	having a happy celebration and all that good stuff.
5854780	5857820	Um, yeah, I'll be excited to have Dark Sakura here, here next week.
5857820	5862140	It's a bummer she won't be here the first week that we make the Twitch move, but it is what it is.
5862340	5866180	So I have to figure out how video magic is going to work.
5866180	5869820	Cause I don't, I, well, the short answer is I don't think it's going to.
5870220	5871940	But I'll have to do something a little different.
5872860	5878820	You could just put like, you know how like they have, uh, well you set up your overlays
5878820	5883580	and everything, so you could just have, you know, have the video and then put
5883580	5885580	like a different sticker over her.
5886220	5890940	No, I, I think, well, I think she's going to be more open to doing some video stuff
5890940	5893340	with, uh, that we have, we put a picture of Dr.
5893340	5893980	Claw.
5894740	5896500	I actually love that idea.
5896500	5898460	I really do think Jamie should be like Dr.
5898460	5902660	Claw or something where she's like, you know, partially hidden, except like them nails or something.
5902860	5906740	Or I think we were joking in the car the other night about wigs that she had.
5906740	5910820	Cause she was saying she was going to be Sia and just have like a giant wig that she wears.
5911020	5913220	And then I was like, Ooh, you get to expand your wig collection though.
5913220	5914460	She's like, Ooh, I like this idea.
5914460	5915100	So who knows?
5915300	5917060	We might have Jamie in drag every week.
5917100	5917500	Who knows?
5917780	5922340	But, uh, all seriousness, I think the easy answer, which I'm sure a lot of you, I'm not even looking at
5922340	5922940	chat at the moment.
5923220	5928660	The easy answer is it'll probably be the audio still, but maybe with footage of said game running behind the
5928660	5930460	audio would make an awful lot of sense.
5930460	5930780	Wouldn't it?
5930780	5931220	Low key.
5931300	5931660	Yeah.
5931900	5934460	So I think, I think that'll probably be the direction it goes in.
5934820	5935300	All right.
5935340	5938980	Uh, if, if I can pull it all off, we'll see the deadline is fast approaching.
5941140	5944260	To register participation for this week's episode of orange challenge radio at
5944260	5947380	vognetwork.com use the pass phrase drum.
5947580	5947820	All right.
5947820	5952220	Meanwhile, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other things going on in the industry this week.
5952340	5952580	Yeah.
5952580	5961900	So it's a little bit of a tease, but, um, apparently finally the PVP, uh, trainer battles are going to be coming to Pokemon
5961900	5962300	go.
5962500	5969380	So they've been teasing some stuff, um, through Twitter, uh, talking about how there's different classes of Pokemon.
5969380	5970740	You'll build a battle and stuff.
5970820	5975300	Um, just not exactly knowing when that's going to happen yet.
5975380	5977420	Maybe after this event, who knows?
5977420	5980300	Um, but soon because they are teasing it.
5980300	5981660	So we'll have to wait and see.
5982180	5990900	Um, then of course, you know, as referenced earlier, elder scrolls blade has been delayed to early 2019.
5991140	5994460	And so they announced this via Twitter, Bethesda did.
5994540	5998140	Um, so we'll have to wait and see what happens to that.
5998140	6002820	Maybe it just needs some more time to polish those canvas bags in the game.
6003580	6004260	Womp womp.
6004380	6004700	Yeah.
6004780	6006860	So that's it.
6007060	6007620	That's it.
6008260	6010220	Sorry for ruining that story a little bit earlier.
6010260	6010620	My bad.
6010620	6011700	Oh, no, that's all right.
6011820	6013780	Are you looking forward to the trainer battles and Pokemon go?
6014340	6020740	No, I think people need to lower their expectations because people are like, Oh, finally we'll get to battle.
6020740	6022220	Like we do in the game boy games.
6022260	6022780	Nope.
6023140	6023620	Nope.
6023660	6024260	No, you won't.
6024420	6025460	I'm going to tell you right now.
6025780	6030860	Don't assume the gym battles, but it's just another person instead.
6030900	6031140	Yeah.
6031220	6033100	It's ding, ding, ding, ding.
6033140	6034820	That is exactly how it's going to be.
6034980	6038820	So it's going to be broken somehow who can tap, who can dodge.
6038820	6040540	Maybe the dodging will actually be important.
6040540	6047940	Like that'll be a thing that is like actually important now, but honestly like, do not, do not suddenly think it's going to become the game boy that the, you know why?
6047940	6056260	Because the game they want you to buy to do those types of battles is Pokemon gen eight, which is all but confirmed for next holiday, assuming it's done.
6056540	6061340	So yeah, get just these pie in the sky ideas about what PVP is going to be.
6061380	6061620	Nope.
6061660	6065300	It's it'll be, let's, let's go melt and that's right.
6065460	6068740	Y Y R in chat says it's rock, paper, scissors, and you're going to like it.
6068860	6069340	Yup.
6070260	6070660	All right.
6071580	6077740	Moving on talking about, uh, uh, some other stories like PlayStation plus and free games for December.
6078020	6085460	Uh, the PlayStation plus free games for December are going to include Soma and on rush on the PlayStation four and sounds good.
6085580	6085820	Yeah.
6085820	6092340	Stera den and Stein's gate on the PlayStation three and the Vita has crossover with iconic class.
6092460	6093580	That's a cross by things.
6093580	6101780	You also get that on PS four and then the indie runaway hit papers, please, which if you've never played, that is really worth a look.
6101820	6104580	Uh, papers pleases is a pretty cool little game.
6104860	6105500	I like that.
6105660	6106860	I need to do a stream of that sometime.
6106860	6108500	I need to go back and visit some indie classics.
6108860	6115660	Uh, anyhow, uh, as far as Xbox live and the games with gold go on Xbox one, you can look forward to cube.
6115660	6122380	Two from December 1st to the 31st and a game called never alone from December 16th, January 15th.
6122620	6133420	That was that game that, um, you played like, um, um, a little girl and she's like, um, got this spirit animal with her and stuff that she kind of walks around with.
6133420	6135100	And I'm sorry, I don't remember all the details of this game.
6135300	6137620	It's a very artistic kind of adventure game.
6137620	6138860	It's, it was, it was pretty good.
6138860	6139940	What little bits I saw of it.
6139940	6141420	So I think that'll be another one.
6141420	6142780	It's kind of similar to papers, please.
6142780	6146020	One of those smaller games that you'll have a chance to look at all over again.
6146060	6150220	Um, thanks to this and on the Xbox three 60.
6151020	6154180	And remember these games are compatible backwards compatible with Xbox one.
6154420	6160180	The second half of a month goes, uh, mercenaries playground of destruction from December 16th to the 31st.
6160340	6164500	But the first half of the month, dragon age two, it's a pretty big one there.
6164500	6166180	So yeah, that'll be pretty cool.
6166220	6167180	I like mercenaries.
6167220	6167540	Yeah.
6167780	6175780	Y Y R commenting about never alone in our chat room at live.vognetware.com says the game is based on an Alaskan native tribe and never alone that is.
6175780	6180820	Yeah, I thought, I thought it was native culture based, but I wasn't a hundred percent sure.
6180820	6184620	So I don't want to say that, but thank you for confirming what I was kind of thinking in the back of my head.
6185220	6189180	Uh, talking about rockstar and, uh, them walking away from a trademark.
6189460	6195940	Uh, they had trademarked the term agent for a game some time ago, but they walked away from that trademark.
6196020	6198460	Uh, that trademark is now going to be irrelevant.
6198540	6203660	It was this game that was expected to come out on PlayStation three, like an exclusive or something a long time ago.
6203660	6207020	You would have still thought that they might've held onto the assets or try to make something out of it.
6207380	6213580	Like even, even blizzard salvaged Titan and made overwatch out of it, which, you know, ended up being a huge hit.
6213620	6216900	Well, they're made too much money on grand theft auto.
6216940	6217740	I guess so.
6217980	6218180	Yeah.
6218420	6218860	All right.
6218860	6223460	Anyhow, uh, yeah, it was supposed to be, Oh, I guess it actually was announced at E3 2009.
6223500	6229740	It was going to be a PlayStation three exclusive, but didn't really, uh, end up going anywhere past that bummer.
6230260	6233500	So that's it for that rockstar trademark.
6233500	6236540	So if you want to make a game called agent, you might have the opportunity.
6237220	6241620	All right, let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out in stores this week, starting with the U S Loki.
6241660	6243460	Well, we've got quite a few things coming out this week.
6243460	6253220	So let's start off with Gwent, the Witcher card game on PlayStation four and Xbox one just cause four on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6253700	6259460	Monster boy in the curse kingdom on the PC switch PlayStation four, Xbox one.

6283260	6291060	We have subnautica on PlayStation four and Xbox one throne breaker, the Witcher tales, two Witcher games in one week.
6291300	6299300	How fancy on PlayStation four and Xbox one, the last remnant remastered on PlayStation four.
6300140	6305700	Katamari Damacy reroll on PC and the switch.
6305980	6311140	I'm totally getting that on PC because of mods and mods, mods, mods.
6311980	6316300	Uh, path of exile and PlayStation four pub G forgot.
6316300	6317220	That was the thing that was happening.
6317220	6317440	Yeah.
6317440	6325220	Pub G on PlayStation four, um, super smash brothers ultimate on switch.
6325260	6337660	You don't say, and then also is ultimate, but not until the week after, but I'm going to tell you anyways, because I'm looking forward to earth defense force five PlayStation, which you'll just be reading every, I'll just read it again next week.
6337660	6338020	That's fine.
6338020	6338420	That's fine.
6338420	6338820	That's fine.
6339300	6339780	That's it.
6340780	6341220	All right.
6341460	6348100	Uh, let's talk about what's happening in Japan, uh, over on the PlayStation four Capcom is putting out a Capcom belt action collection.
6348100	6351980	I think that is their version of the, uh, what do they call it here?
6352020	6355820	Uh, it's all there, like side scrolling fighting games, all in one collection.
6355860	6356980	What the hell did they call it here?
6357220	6362180	The fighting or fighting game collection or something, although it's not, but it's not collection.
6362220	6362460	Yeah.
6362460	6365140	Beat them up or something like that, but they're getting their version of that this week.
6365140	6369020	It's the one that has, um, Oh God, like I think it was it final fight.
6369060	6377180	Isn't that captain commando, captain commando, those, all those stuff you already downloaded on Mame a long time ago, but now you do the round.
6377340	6377940	Oh, here we go.
6377940	6378180	Yeah.
6378180	6378900	Final fight.
6378900	6381180	Knights of the round, king of dragons, battle circuit.
6381180	6381940	It's all that stuff.
6382380	6386220	So, uh, which that collection is already out in dinosaurs.
6387060	6388140	I don't know if that one's there.
6388220	6388540	Yeah.
6388660	6388940	All right.
6389140	6392380	Uh, also coming out, just cause four gets this Japanese release this week.
6392740	6395620	Mantis burn rising fighting ex layer.
6395660	6398940	And, uh, that is it on the sixth.
6399300	6409060	But of course they also, if we go over to the Nintendo switch, they are also getting their version of super smash brothers ultimate on the seventh, same day that we are.
6409300	6415420	Um, so, uh, also coming out in Japan though, Sid Meier civilization six, which I still have to pick up on the switch.
6415620	6418460	I heard somebody, I think target or somebody is having a sale on that coming up.
6418780	6431420	So, which I think Bobby is okay when it's not an indie developer that I'm okay to seize, especially if I bought the game before, you know, if I'm buying the six for the second time, I think I'm allowed to take advantage of a discount.
6431420	6433300	I think I will be, uh, have to look into that.
6433300	6444220	But anyway, in Japan, it's coming out for the first time on December the sixth and that same Capcom collection is coming out in, uh, the switch on the switch, uh, for, uh, this week as well, December the sixth.
6444460	6448180	Uh, also lastly, but not leastly, a cute little game on the switch.
6448220	6454500	Don't let smash brothers take your eyes off of a game called little friends, dogs, and cats.
6454860	6455220	That's right.
6455220	6459060	Little friends, dogs, and cats is also coming out on the switch this week.
6459060	6460060	You know what this game is?
6460740	6463980	It's just fucking Nintendogs except Nintendo didn't make it.
6465220	6471380	A company called Imagineer made it, but like looking at the screenshots and all this stuff, it's Nintendo.
6471420	6476140	Well, you're not fucking the Nintendogs, but yes, it is a Nintendogs and Nintendcats basically.
6476300	6481780	Which kind of begs the question, Nintendo did kind of let that one go, didn't they?
6481780	6484060	They didn't, they didn't bring that back for switch, did they?
6484780	6487340	Somebody thought this would be a good idea to put out, at least in Japan.
6487380	6493500	Probably my guess would be because it's mostly touch screen controls and that would be difficult to do.
6493540	6494140	Yeah.
6494180	6502500	I mean, they do have like the touch screen stuff sort of like, because this console is a home console, not just a portable console, then they're like, yeah, no.
6503060	6503620	You're right.
6503660	6506340	And Nintendo probably doesn't want to do anything like that first party.
6506340	6510340	There are some games, like what, Vaas, that you can only play with the touch screen.
6510340	6511700	You can't even like play it docked.
6511980	6514860	So there are some games that lock out certain types of modes.
6514860	6518020	Like remember when Blaster Master Zero first came out, you couldn't use the pro controller.
6518380	6522340	You can now, they fixed that mighty quick, but you couldn't like the first week or so.
6522620	6529140	So, you know, there's, there's still some weird oddity stuff, but I don't think Nintendo themselves, you're right, because that game was very highly touch controlled.
6529340	6531900	They're probably just not interested in revisiting it on the switch.
6531980	6533620	And they're letting third party companies do it.
6533620	6538060	Well, at least right now, it's maybe, it might be something that comes out later on, but yeah.
6538380	6544420	Oh, and ActDeft corrects me in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying Vaas now allows for TV play.
6544420	6546260	So they changed that at some point.
6546260	6546940	Thank you for the update.
6546940	6548100	I actually was not aware of that.
6548100	6548620	Very cool.
6548860	6559340	I might have to check that out now because I play a lot of, I know a lot of you guys are like, I play everything in switch portable mode, but like, no, I play most of my stuff docked.
6559660	6567300	Like once in a while, like, especially if I'm on a flight or something, I use the, the portable mode, but I kind of prefer a docked mode whenever possible.
6567380	6568980	So, all right.
6569020	6571420	Well, how about the UK Loki with Dark Soccer not being here?
6571740	6583580	Uh, we have Just Cause 4 coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Override Mech City Brawl on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Gear Club Unlimited 2 on the Switch,
6583940	6595260	The Council Complete Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Hellblade Sensua's Sacrifice on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
6595980	6606140	Persona 3 and 5, The Endless Night Collection, Persona 3, Dancing in the Moonlight, and Persona 5, Dancing in the Starlight, all on PlayStation 4.
6609260	6611740	Why do you have Gear Club Unlimited listed twice?
6612060	6616540	Whatever, they're releasing it twice in the same day, so that's the thing.
6617100	6626940	Then, of course, I know you're going to be, um, super excited about this, but of course they have the Fallout 76 merchandise, which is releasing as well.
6627100	6635340	And the PlayStation Classic is coming out, which I think is also coming out over here in North America as well next week, but it's not technically a game release.
6635740	6643980	Uh, Jagged Alliance Rage on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the Switch,
6644460	6652460	Hello Neighbor Hide and Seek on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch, Subnautica on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
6652460	6659980	and finally, we have the GameCube accessory for the Switch, and that is coming out, I'm assuming, as well, over here.
6660620	6666060	But, hey, I don't normally list accessories, but game does, apparently.
6666060	6667020	Alright, fair enough.
6667020	6671660	Alright, um, this is the part of the show where we would open up the mailbag!
6671660	6680300	If we had any emails. Of course, we didn't get any this week, but you can always send in more emails to participate at orangelandrater.com,
6680300	6685900	and Loki, since we didn't get any emails this week, uh, let's talk about RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 4.
6685900	6687900	Okay, I have no idea.
6687900	6692380	Oh, you don't know? Okay, so, here's the thing. Kind of a controversial move for All-Stars.
6692380	6697420	They're bringing two queens back from All-Stars 1, but here's the thing, Loki.
6697420	6703820	All-Stars 1 was a flop, because what they did, they were only budgeted for six episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race.
6703820	6707500	Like, I don't know who budgets the six. Like, this isn't the UK. Our seasons are much longer.
6707500	6711260	It's like they're, like, budgeting for canvas bags, and then they make nylon bags.
6711260	6717500	Exactly. That's what, that's, that's perfect. RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 1 was a nylon bag.
6717500	6723260	RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 2 was a canvas bag. So the big, the big, uh, controversy was that they,
6723260	6729340	they paired up queens. So it was that they had, had to have charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent,
6729340	6732940	and synergy, because they were working in teams.
6732940	6736780	Synergy? What is this? Fucking, uh, Pacific Rim or something?
6736780	6740300	There's, there's a joke there with the acronym, Loki. Just think about it for a minute. Anyway.
6740700	6744060	So, uh, anyway, so they were playing in teams, and so it caused, like, all sorts of, like,
6744060	6748540	weird shit to happen. So one of the teams, Latrilla, which is Latrice Royale. You heard
6748540	6753340	of Latrice Royale? She's great. And, uh, get those nuts out of my face. That's Latrice Royale.
6753340	6757260	And Manila Luzon, who, if you ever, if you, you know, if you're gonna watch any lip sync
6757260	6761820	from RuPaul's Drag Race, watch MacArthur Park, because, uh, Manila Luzon does a great job.
6761820	6765340	They are coming back. So even though they were in All-Stars 1, they're also gonna be in All-Stars 4,
6765340	6770060	but now it runs by the new rules, which is where the queens kind of eliminate each other.
6770060	6776860	They get to pick from the bottom three, whoever wins the lip sync for your legacy, legacy, legacy.
6776860	6781820	So anyway, Loki, uh, going into RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars 4, I am super rooting for Monique
6781820	6787500	Hart. She's one of my absolute faves. That was from season 10. Okay. That's like a Monique
6787500	6793340	Hart thing. Uh, she was in season 10 and she was brilliant, even if she committed the cardinal sin
6793340	6797740	in my eyes of not knowing the lyrics to a Carly Rae Jepsen song when she had a lip sync for her
6797740	6801020	life. So I'm hoping she gets her redemption this time. Now she got a little more coin.
6801020	6804380	She'll be able to make some more outfits and yeah, that's, that's why I'm rooting for in this,
6804380	6808780	but I think a lot of people probably rooting for like Latrice. She's an insanely popular queen.
6808780	6814380	Honestly, there really aren't like any bad queens in this. And I'm, I'm very much not a person to
6814380	6819100	talk down about drag queens. Uh, so even people like Valentina, Farrah Moan, I want to see them
6819100	6824460	do well. So, all right, there you go. Yes. Thank you in chat. Act F says reading is fundamental,
6824460	6832220	people also writing. So send your email next week to participate at orange lounge, radio.com,
6832220	6836380	unless you want Rob Roberts to run down the RuPaul's holiday special, because that is going
6836380	6842380	to be a thing in the next week as well. We get super smash brothers. And a RuPaul's drag race
6842380	6847660	holiday special in the same day, like December 7th is too much to handle. I'm just saying,
6847660	6853580	all right, let's get into some more gaming news Loki. And so this is kind of just an
6853580	6860460	evanability, I guess, basically. So with all these loot box controversies going on, and of course,
6860460	6867100	we have overseas, you know, where the Belgium government has cracked down on loot boxes,
6867100	6873820	and this whole report that came out of the UK, I believe, talking about gambling and
6874860	6879180	young children getting into gambling, thanks to you, you know, the loot boxes being kind of
6880140	6887500	very similar. So now, that all leads to this, where the Federal Trade Commission has said that
6887500	6895100	they're going to be investigating loot boxes, regarding, you know, how they affect, you know,
6895100	6901420	children and gambling, and whether this is something that should be regulated like gambling.
6901420	6911100	So according to, I guess, they had Senator Maggie Hassan, who apparently spoke out about
6911100	6918860	loot boxes, and I guess the FTC chairman, Joseph Simmons, they addressed, you know,
6918860	6923740	I guess everybody to basically let them know, hey, this is something we're gonna be looking into,
6923740	6927260	because, you know, like those reports that came out of the Great Britain's Gambling Commission,
6927900	6932780	they said, you know, given that the seriousness of the issue, I think it's time for the FTC to
6932780	6937180	investigate these mechanisms to ensure that children are being adequately protected to,
6937180	6941980	and to educate parents about potential addiction or other negative impacts of these games.
6942700	6946780	And then they said, would you commit, you know, Hassan said, would you commit to undertaking this
6946780	6951820	project and keeping this committee informed about it? And they said, yes. And they didn't really go
6951820	6954540	into any additional details on what they're gonna do, but it is something that they're gonna be
6954540	6960300	looking at. And I can imagine not so good for the gaming industry because, you know, they've
6960300	6965180	been kind of getting away with a lot. And of course, you know, the ESA came out against this
6965180	6971500	saying, you know, hey, they're not gambling and this is not, you know, this, whatever, but you
6971500	6978140	know what, it's, it's either- Now would be a good time to just let the loot box thing go, y'all.
6979180	6982540	Now would be a good time. Well, the problem is like, they just, you know-
6983180	6987020	Unless you're a free to play mobile game, I kind of, I kind of think when the game is free to play,
6987020	6990940	then all bets are on. That's a pun. All bets are on, yeah.
6990940	6995820	But like, look at like Fallout 76 again, you know, you have a $60 game that's broken as shit,
6995820	6999020	and then they're still trying to sell microtransactions on top of all this stuff.
6999660	7005260	That's not necessarily a loot box, but with the whole thing, and one of the thoughts I heard
7005260	7011100	online was that the way that they designed their leveling system with the card, basically you
7011100	7015980	unlock like a card pack in like bubblegum, it's almost like, you know, trading cards,
7015980	7024700	and each of the special cards add different perks to your abilities based on which ones you use at
7024700	7029900	a time, but they're all randomized and sometimes you get duplicates. And they said that the way
7029900	7036220	that that's designed is almost like they were going to monetize that system as a loot box,
7036220	7041500	but then decided not to at the, you know, in the end. But it's something that if like,
7041500	7046860	say for example, Fallout 76 just did very, very, very poorly and just kept, you know,
7046860	7052060	sales not working out, maybe the game goes free to play, and then that could be something that
7052060	7057340	they monetize on top of it. Interesting perspective from one of our listeners
7057340	7061180	in chat, because this is a show where every gamer has a voice over at live.vognetwork.com.
7061180	7064220	Kaijuto said, I'm going to have to get that out. You know how hard that's going to be to get that
7064220	7067900	out of my vocabulary? When I keep saying live.vognetwork.com, I'm going to have to say,
7067900	7073100	yeah, Twitch TV over to it. Anyway, that's going to be the hardest part about the transition is
7073900	7077260	Twitch chat room. I know it's going to be different. All right. Anyway,
7077260	7082300	but for now it's still a big sign that says, say Twitch, not live. I'm going to need that
7082300	7087420	like big reminder. Don't fuck up, Rob. Anyway, Kaijuto says dump the loot boxes. It's not
7087420	7092620	gambling. It's just a con job. Gambling would be spending money to win money. I believe getting
7092620	7099020	prizes for money is like the carnival. That's not gambling, but it is some call that like the
7099020	7103660	ticket spitters at like Chuck E Cheese or whatever you want, Dave and Busters. Some people call that
7103660	7109020	gambling for kids. Well, it's basically, it's not that it's actual gambling, but the, I mean,
7109020	7116060	sometimes it can be so like in, in the, when you're talking about like, you know, um, skins
7116060	7120940	in like counter strike go, for example, when you could be able to turn those around and sell them
7120940	7126460	for real money, you know, that is actually kind of gambling because you you're getting something
7126460	7131100	that's worth something that you can sell for something, um, and actually make real money
7131100	7135740	off of. Whereas like a lot of the loot boxes, that's kind of how they've skirted around it
7135740	7143100	before is because it's not technically gambling, but you know, the chance of getting things like
7143100	7148940	that in the, the draw to like, Oh, maybe I'll get something, you know, good this time. Or they kind
7148940	7153740	of tease you with, Oh, you got a rare item or something like that. It still gives you the same,
7154860	7160860	your body goes through the same kind of chemical, um, changes that you would with like gambling,
7160860	7166140	where you still feel that like impulse to keep doing it, keep playing it. And so it's not that
7166140	7170940	you necessarily get a reward. I don't know anything about that says the guy who spent
7170940	7177900	an undetermined amount of money in Vegas. I broke even, okay. I, I won like $120 the first night.
7177900	7183340	I'm not even kidding. I won. And then I, I broke even it's just, it's like, you know, um,
7184300	7187260	it's just a lot of things. There's a lot of things that could be for chance, you know,
7187260	7193660	like these skin packs and stuff and, and they can say all they want about how, Oh, it's not gambling.
7193660	7196700	It's not gambling. It's not gambling, but there's people that are like, you know,
7196700	7202540	I've spent thousands of dollars on this because I can't stop doing this. Or, you know, I have
7202540	7207420	a problem with gambling and I play games to get away from gambling. And then this is,
7207500	7212220	you know, trying to bring me back into it. I feel the same urge that I had when I was gambling
7212780	7217180	that I do now with these loot boxes, there are people that have said that this is what they do
7217180	7222140	as an escape is they play games and now it's coming back. I would love to invite like a
7222140	7227500	psychologist or psychiatrist or, or some therapist, somebody who kind of knows maybe a little more
7227500	7232780	about these types of issues, like the gambling addiction issues, who, who is savvy enough to
7232780	7236860	know what gaming loot boxes are and things to really kind of get into that side of the issue.
7236860	7240460	I bet that'd be fascinating to really kind of, cause like all that stuff you're talking about,
7240460	7245500	I totally whole thing is a scam. It's a scam. If it was not a scam, it would just be,
7245500	7249740	you pay X amount of money for X item. And that's it. The whole reason that there's
7249740	7253180	chance is because there's a chance that you're not going to get what you want.
7253180	7257500	And they know what chance that is because they set the up and they know what the odds are,
7257500	7260380	but they're not telling me they just need to be transparent with the odds. And that's how
7260380	7265500	we're going to get through this whole thing. Or just get rid of him. All right. All right.
7265500	7272060	Anyhow, uh, moving on to, uh, a new TV series that is kind of based on gaming. And this is
7272060	7277100	very interesting because the TV series that has been optioned by legendary, which, you know,
7277100	7281260	they make some pretty big movies or legendary pictures. You see that logo. They've been a lot
7281260	7286860	of good stuff. Um, there for television, not a movie, but television has opted a limited
7286860	7292940	series based on console wars. This was a book that talked about Sega and Nintendo in the 90s,
7292940	7297100	which a lot of y'all lived, right? A lot of y'all have feelings on this.
7297100	7303660	Well, I used to know, uh, I was, uh, colleagues, I guess, with, um, a guy who he works for an
7303660	7309340	independent, um, distributor. Now he used to do like a bunch of these, um, smaller games, like,
7309340	7315900	um, one of the games he was distributing in the U S and like Mexico area was, um, the farming
7315900	7321340	simulator games and that kind of stuff. But he originally worked for Sega and he worked during
7321340	7330620	their launch for, I think it was the Genesis or it was the Genesis or the dream casters.
7330620	7335020	Some, some, I think it was the Genesis and he was telling us stories about like how they were
7336300	7339660	just marketing plans and stuff like that. And some of those stories are really interesting,
7339660	7344460	just like how, you know, by the seat of their pants type of stuff they were doing. So
7344460	7346380	I would be very interested in seeing something like that.
7346380	7353980	Now, some of the names behind this effort, uh, this is point gray pictures. They make a show on
7353980	7358220	AMC called preacher. It's kind of a big show. You probably heard of that one. Uh, and some of the
7358220	7363100	names at point gray, Evan Goldberg, James Weaver, Seth Rogan, believe it or not one of the names
7363100	7367260	there. So, uh, not to say that like Seth Rogan is going to star in this or anything, cause I don't
7367260	7371660	even know if it would be like more documentary style or if it's going to be like fiction,
7371660	7375580	you know, that kind of portrays, you know, cause we've seen that before. We've seen fictional
7375580	7381020	accounts of big historical kind of things like, you know, in a, in a movie such as like my
7381020	7385580	favorite historically accurate film, Abraham Lincoln, vampire hunter, right. Which is based
7385580	7389980	on a book. Maybe not so much that, but like, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. When we were looking
7389980	7395580	to watch stuff, they had one, it was about like, um, it was Michael Keaton in that, like, um,
7395580	7400620	the McDonald, like the origin, like McDonald's or something like that. I forget what that was
7400620	7405580	called. There's some new movie coming out where, uh, uh, uh, Batman guy, why can't, oh my God,
7405580	7410380	Christian Bale, right? Yeah. Who, who, who plays Batman? Like give me about my son,
7410380	7414460	but it's more like, you know, he's got that voice. So Christian Bale is playing Dick Cheney in some
7414460	7419260	movie. It's kind of like that, like that kind of thing. Yeah. Right. So anyway, so we don't know,
7419260	7422140	we don't know if it's fiction or documentary or where the hell we're going, they're going with
7422140	7426940	it, but we'll see. Uh, also the producers behind the movie annihilation, which I don't think was
7426940	7430540	a huge hit at the box office, but people that saw it, I thought enjoyed it. So I don't know,
7430540	7434380	but anyway, uh, some of the producers there on this as well. So it'll be interesting to see what
7434380	7438380	comes to this, you know, um, a lot of television and, you know, this is a topic that's probably
7438380	7445900	much bigger than OLR. Um, a lot of, um, uh, television is getting more cinematic, you know,
7445900	7451740	and I think a lot of this was really, um, kind of summed up when, remember the Twin Peaks limited
7451740	7455900	series from last year, which I was a huge fan of. That's no secret, right? Cause I love, uh,
7455900	7460460	Twin Peaks. I loved it back in the day and I was so happy at the new one, but that, that series
7460460	7465740	ended up on like a French best film list and it ended up somewhere else as a best film list too.
7465740	7470860	And people were like, but it's not a movie, it's a TV show. But at the same time, it was actually
7470860	7479020	one giant script that was simply cut into episodes to be aired on TV. So those lines between what is
7479020	7484540	film, what is television are getting more and more blurred as I think this streaming culture
7484620	7490620	is causing more and more cinematic television to be produced. It's really fascinating. Yeah. Yeah.
7490620	7494780	So anyway, that, that is really a discussion for another show, but it's just, you know,
7494780	7498060	I think it kind of just plays into all that. Cause I think that kind of shows you that this,
7498060	7501980	this is probably something that's going to be built for one of the streaming platforms for sure.
7501980	7509180	So we'll see anyhow. Um, moving on Loki. All right. So one game that did start off like
7509180	7515260	fallout 76, but is now much better. No man's sky has yet another update that they, um,
7515980	7522220	released relatively, uh, recently, I think it was actually not too long ago. They had, um,
7522940	7530300	kind of like a community update. So with it, um, they had these new looks like,
7532060	7537660	are these, uh, communication stations where you can send messages, I think across,
7537660	7541660	I don't know if it's across like the galaxy or whatever, but they had like,
7541660	7546460	you can actually do audio messages as well. I think hopefully these communication modules
7546460	7554380	aren't going to be, um, all trash. Fuck you asshole. Whoever gets this. Um,
7555500	7560060	but they, of course, you know, new updates, different plant life that they added in the game.
7560060	7566460	Um, yeah, but I like all these new updates. I really need to go back and play this. I've
7566460	7571420	actually, I was looking at almost getting on PC again. And I want to go back into it for the
7571420	7575580	third time. Cause you know, I was Bobby black Wolf and I, when we were getting more into streaming,
7575580	7579500	we're kind of going back and forth on the no man's sky remake. And we were like, what happens if I
7579500	7582620	build a base on this world and you build a base here and we're kind of like figuring all that out.
7582620	7586460	And now it's like, even since then. So that kind of died off. Cause we just kind of, I don't know,
7586460	7589980	all too many other games came out cause it was that time of year. And now it's like, shit,
7589980	7594460	they're giving us more reasons to go back and look again. But I love it. I love it. This is what
7594540	7599980	a game should be. It was the visions. That's what it was. So they have this event, a community event.
7599980	7608060	They went along with that as well. And so basically you're allowing, um, people to like share
7608700	7612620	messages across the galaxy and stuff. Oh cool. So we can, we can have like a VOG community.
7613420	7617100	Maybe. I don't know exactly how it works. If you, if it's like the, you can like leave behind,
7617100	7622140	like say like you go to someone's planet and then leave a message or if it actually you can kind of
7622140	7626060	already do that. If I'm not mistaken, you could make like a, well, you could put a message at
7626060	7629820	your base. So you'd like build a base and have a message there. And I thought you could leave like
7629820	7636140	a sign that had a message. I mean, my memory's a little sketchy. Maybe. Yeah. So interesting.
7636140	7642780	I'd be into that. That'd be cool. All right. Uh, anyhow, um, games that are also getting updates,
7642780	7647980	but not for much longer. Splatoon 2, shout out to Flaco Jones. Cause I know he loves Splatoon
7647980	7653900	2 and does a lot of streams. Uh, sadly though, Splatoon 2 is looking at its last content update,
7653900	7657580	but I mean, it's been like a year and a half since Splatoon 2 came out and they've been doing
7657580	7663900	regular updates. So it had to end sometime. So anyway, version 4.3.0, uh, is coming out on
7663900	7668540	December 5th and, uh, it's not like the biggest update in the world, but they are going to be
7668540	7673820	doing, uh, a new bomb defense up DX, which is, I guess, a replacement for the bomb defense up
7673820	7677820	and cold blooded abilities. Um, so yeah, there's just, you know, they're going to have some new
7677820	7682780	gear abilities and a few new weapons as well, but don't look at for any like gigantic stuff.
7682780	7686380	Um, but there is something called main power up as well, which will allow you to enhance
7686380	7691580	the performance of your main weapon. It will vary considerably from weapon to weapon. Um,
7691580	7695100	there'll also be, uh, just, you know, some different looking weapons and stuff that you
7695100	7699900	can kind of check out in the trailer if you want. Uh, now, even though December 5th is the last
7699900	7707580	major update, Nintendo has said that SplatFests and balance updates will continue until July
7707580	7711900	next year. So if there's any, you know, major issues, they will still continue to fix those,
7711900	7717740	do the balance tweaking and all that stuff. And, um, again, SplatFests will live on through July.
7717740	7721420	Hmm. Just in time for them to announce a Splatoon 3 at E3.
7721420	7725020	Please don't. Don't make it. Don't. No, seriously. Don't make a third game of that.
7725980	7729180	And not like other sequels for games that we need.
7729180	7733100	I don't know. I don't know if I agree with you. I'm okay with that. If they, if they decide
7733100	7738540	they're going to do a Splatoon 3 and they make it a new thing, I don't, it might be just, I don't
7738540	7744220	see how they would have developed one that fast, but you know, if they have a Splatoon 3, that's a
7744220	7751180	new rich experience that offers some new stuff and new modes and things I'd be for it. I re I
7751180	7756060	remember a day and age Loki when like every other year you'd get some new game in a franchise or
7756060	7761180	shit. If you're Assassin's Creed, you get it every year. So if, you know, if Madden, a sports game
7761180	7766220	can do a new fucking thing every year, Splatoon, I think could even go further and give some
7766220	7769980	remarkable, not just roster updates, but remarkable content things and do that.
7769980	7775020	I would be all for Splatoon 3 if it's worth it. You know, again, I, I just, I don't want,
7775020	7778620	I don't want them just to make a Splatoon 3 for the sake of having something new to sell,
7778620	7782860	but if they make it its own little thing, I'd be all for that. An Act Defton chat,
7782860	7789020	who's also a big fan of Splatoon says Splatoon 3, yes, please. Bobby Blackwell says,
7789020	7795740	I would be for it, but they did not name Splatoon 2, Spla 2n, you know, that spelling,
7796300	7798380	and therefore they no longer get the right to make sequels.
7800540	7806620	Fine. I, you know, and I would be okay if maybe like the Splatoon team did a new concept. I bet
7806620	7809980	a lot of Splatoon fans would be totally okay with that. What would you say about that, Loki?
7809980	7814780	Like a different type of competitive game. That's just that creative team.
7815580	7816460	I'm fine with that.
7816460	7821020	Yeah. Cause they, they took a, a, a kill, kill, die, die shooter and made it about paint.
7821020	7825740	They made it a family fun friend game. I, I, I, I'd give them that chance on, you know, other
7825740	7831660	types of competitive genres. Why not? Maybe like a hero, hero battle or something. Who knows?
7831660	7837900	Anyway. All right. Uh, vidpower in chat suggests for a new title, three splat, three furious. All
7837900	7842620	right. You guys calm down. All right. Few more stories for you guys. Then we're going to open
7842620	7846300	up the Skype line at orange lounge radio. All one word, but first Loki.
7846300	7854380	So there was a developer that was, um, goes by the name thin matrix and they've been working on
7854380	7861260	a game called the coolinox for the last three years or so, uh, almost three years. And what's
7861260	7868780	kind of unique about them is that they were live blogging the whole process, um, each week,
7868780	7878140	you know, since February 19, 2016 and now November or as of earlier this, um, last month,
7878140	7886380	the game has been released. So now, uh, you can pick up a coolinox. It's a like a life simulation
7886380	7891420	game to basically create your own like biomes and you have different animals and stuff that
7891420	7896380	kind of exist in there and you kind of have to manage everything to make sure that, you know,
7896380	7902140	the world is, um, you're cultivating and, um, shaping the world as you like. So it's kind of
7902140	7906940	cool. Um, the different things in there, but I was watching some of the live blogs that he did, um,
7907820	7912060	talking about like some of the gameplay tweaks and different bugs that they ran into,
7912060	7916140	which is kind of fun, even, especially just right before release, just adding new features
7916140	7923020	and, um, it's very like, even just the videos were very relaxing. The game itself is like a
7923020	7928300	very relaxing game. It's only like 10 bucks too. So is, does reading that stuff, uh, um, kind of
7928300	7931580	help motivate you a little bit when you kind of see the trials and tribulations that our
7931580	7937260	developers go through? Um, I've only watched like a video or so of that. I'm, I am like,
7937260	7944060	I want to be motivated to do stuff. Um, I even was looking at, but it's hard. Well, no, it is,
7944060	7951020	it, it's just like trying to like, there was another, um, like I w I read another,
7951020	7954060	like, I don't know if it was, I didn't really read it. I watched it. It was like a,
7955180	7960380	I don't remember which developer was, it was some developer of an indie game that I'd recognized.
7960380	7967580	And he was talking about how like six, it's like six games you should program to get into the
7967580	7973580	whole game dev cycle thing. So they basically said like, you do Tetris and then you do, um,
7973660	7979900	it was like asteroids, Arkanoid. Um, I know the last one was super Mario brothers.
7980700	7984940	And then, um, I'm trying to remember the other couple of games that they had in there as well,
7984940	7988620	but it's basically, you know, cause each one teaches you something different. Plus finishing
7988620	7996540	stuff is a good idea, but I don't know. Just do it. Just, just go remake a game.
7997660	8001020	Yeah. And Bobby black Wolf and chat says, I remember telling Loki this. He said,
8001020	8005900	fuck that. I don't have time for that. Bobby just wants to rub it in a little bit
8005900	8008060	that you should have listened to him. And I don't, that's a kind of the,
8008940	8012780	that's the joke. That's kind of like after I saw that and started thinking about it for a little
8012780	8016860	bit, I'm like, I don't have time. I don't have time for one game, let alone like six games.
8017660	8022300	Uh, speaking of indie game development, I just want to shout out again, why YR and his game
8022300	8026780	falling plus, which I was dumb and I left out of my gaming week. Although to be fair, we spent an
8026780	8030860	awful lot of time pimping falling plus last week, but I do want to pivot one more time and say,
8030860	8035180	it is released on steam. And I hope some of you guys will spend the two bucks, which I think
8035180	8039500	might still be a dollar 50. I don't know how much for longer. Uh, but go spend the two bucks and
8039500	8044540	check it out because, uh, yeah, I actually, I did a live stream of playing falling plus and, um,
8044540	8047740	I kind of got the game, like the game, like clicked for me, you know what it was? I had
8047740	8051020	to watch somebody else play it. So when I watched Bobby play it, I was like, Oh,
8051020	8054700	I get it. Like, cause when I originally played it on Xbox 360, I don't think I knew what the
8054700	8057900	hell I was doing, but this time, like watching Bobby play it, I was like, Oh, okay. I kind of
8057900	8062860	understand a little more. So now I played it. And for at least a few minutes, Loki,
8062860	8067500	I had the world record in the single-player mode because Bobby said it. And then I was like, well,
8067500	8071340	we can't have this. So I did a live stream that was basically me beating Bobby's record.
8071340	8075420	And that's why I called it. And it took me a little bit, but I finally got around to doing it.
8075420	8079580	Um, and then here's what happens. So the minute I get that score, like, I think I stopped the
8079580	8084220	stream and like two minutes later, I see my little steam pop up orange. Right. Is playing falling
8084220	8089660	plus. And I'm like, I know what he's doing. I fucking know what that guy's doing. And sure
8089660	8094860	enough, like a couple hours later, orange, right. Just like fucking annihilated us out of the water
8094860	8100380	with his ice score, but you earned it. Props to you slow clap. But anyway, no, all that joking
8100380	8105100	aside. Um, one thing that I've kind of started doing and falling plus that actually like helped
8105100	8109980	me a lot is I've tried to switch from using the controller. I actually find when I use the
8109980	8115340	keyboard, I can do those trick shots a lot better. My timing is more precise because the
8115340	8125100	Xbox 360 controller is, you know, crap. I don't want to say it's crap, but it's not MLG falling
8125100	8130700	plus material. It's competent to get you through the game and enjoy the game and be happy with what
8130700	8135820	you spent on it. But the keyboard is how I'm going to get MLG pro that's that is how I will
8135820	8141900	destroy orange, right. Hopefully at some point and take my rightful place back on the top of
8141900	8146780	the board was going to be hard. So, cause now I'm having to like reteach my muscle memory because,
8146780	8151340	you know, like the, the kicking is one button, the jumping is another and the throwing is another.
8151340	8155260	And it's like, Oh, well, I stopped there from which one was the throwing button. And you know,
8155260	8160380	I'm having to reteach my muscle memory, but it's fun. Like I'm, I'm into it. Like,
8160380	8163260	I hate to be that guy, but I'm going to close on this thought.
8165020	8172460	Y Y R cause I know you're listening like seriously switch port, please. Like I really hate to be that
8172460	8178060	son of a bitch, but like I would play this game portable mode, like so fast. Like this was,
8178060	8182620	this is like the perfect type of like lay in bed and play for like 10 minutes for you to sleep
8182620	8188300	type of thing. So we need, we need like a Y Y arcade on switch. That's Oh my God. Oh my God.
8188860	8196860	Just made it up. Y Y arcade that has like snake three 60 and, and, and pixels shits,
8196860	8200540	although they'll have to rename it, but you know, uh, and all this, all these little games
8200540	8205340	and falling on switch. I'm brilliant. And I'm probably getting hate mail from all
8205340	8210460	we are right now for putting that out there in the universe. Make your own thing.
8211020	8217820	All right. All right. And Y Y R does say in chat that, uh, his offer does remain
8217820	8222380	open from last episode. So if you listened to last week, can't hint, uh, you'll know,
8222380	8227180	uh, what I'm talking about. All right. Y Y R says, if the numbers are good enough,
8227180	8232780	I will totally go to switch at a boy, at a boy, make a, make a bank for it by making a pay,
8232780	8237420	put the coin where the mouth is at a boy. All right. Sell some copies, buy, buy copies for
8237420	8244380	your friends this holiday season. All right. One more story for you guys, uh, talking about
8244380	8248780	not so indie game development, but a smaller game, but a long running game.
8249580	8255420	And y'all know, this is one of my favorite franchises, uh, clue or Cluedo as it's called
8255420	8260940	overseas. But here is a big board game named clue that they turned into a movie with Tim Curry
8260940	8264860	in the eighties. You might've heard of it. So anyhow, a clue, the classic board game from
8264860	8269580	Hasbro is coming to the Nintendo switch. So Hasbro will bring games to the switch,
8269580	8273740	but to be fair, I think it's coming out on like mobile phones and all that as well.
8273740	8278540	Uh, so it's called clue or Cluedo, depending on where you live, the classic mystery game,
8278540	8283100	uh, which actually is already out of mobile devices and steam. And it will soon be getting
8283100	8287820	a release on Nintendo console, the switch. Uh, there's a little announcement trailer with all
8287820	8291900	the news and it, it, it kind of looked like the board game. Like it didn't look like they really
8291900	8295500	changed it. Like if you've ever played the super Nintendo version of clue,
8295500	8299900	which was the same as the Genesis version of clue, and I kind of love that adaptation,
8299900	8304940	but they kind of changed the board game a lot for that. Um, so I think they, they, they kind of keep
8304940	8308540	this a little more pure to the board game, but it's kind of neat because they have like the
8308540	8313420	characters in different looks that you can kind of play as. And so they found some ways to kind of
8313420	8317660	like nickel and dime you I'm sure, but also, you know, just make the game more customizable. So I
8317660	8321660	think it's kind of cute. So I just thought it was cool that they are making clue cause I love clue.
8322060	8326140	It's a fun board game. So it's cool that it's coming out for the switch. So kaiju doing chat
8326140	8331740	says I have clue on my phone. It's dope. They also have clue, cool themes, but it's expensive.
8331740	8335820	It's like 30 something bucks to get all the stuff in the game. Well, unfortunately kaiju
8335820	8339340	don't ain't nothing for free, but I wonder if you buy it on switch, would you just get all
8339340	8345020	that stuff unlocked? I bet you would. Cause I doubt it's free to play on switch. So I don't know.
8345020	8349100	We'll see. Make it free to play on switch. Yeah. All right. Uh, orange lounge radio,
8349100	8354940	all one word on Skype. The Skype line is open and you can go ahead and give us a call. Orange
8354940	8359500	launch radio, all one word on Skype. Um, as far as I know, even with the switch in the future,
8359500	8364140	we're going to be holding onto Skype for a little while, uh, because now I won't be running on, uh,
8364140	8369740	windows XP anymore, but we'll see. Anyway, uh, the phones are lighting up. Let's get to some calls.
8369740	8373980	Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on everyone. It's Ron. Hey,
8373980	8378540	Rama. How you doing? Uh, pretty good. Pretty good. We're also getting ready for the twitch
8378540	8383820	transition too. I know you guys am a jam session or going through a similar, um, transition. So
8383820	8389340	I'm excited. I'm excited to see how you guys implement it. Well, we've talked about, you know,
8389340	8394460	throwing the camera between the different hosts each week or figure out a way to do a remote
8394460	8399500	access or have like icon, like icons in a different host and it lights up. Well,
8399500	8403500	we're going to figure something out. Yeah. You guys got it. Still got a little time. If nothing
8403580	8407580	else, have a static image in your voices and they'll still be people to turn up.
8407580	8415340	Well, yeah, that's speaking up. I already got the work going. So pretty much our Twitch page is up.
8415340	8424060	I have like the little icon icon. They're saying we are going to go on live. Um, I believe January
8424060	8429900	15th. Yeah. That sounds about right. Based on some other timeframes I haven't been as public about,
8429900	8435500	but I guess I could say now, um, the radio feed is, is targeted for closure in January next year.
8435500	8440780	So, so Rama is trying to get in there before there is no radio feed anymore. Yes, yes, yes.
8443660	8447820	But yeah, I mean, I'm really excited to see the new show or, you know, hear it most of all,
8447820	8454780	but you know, we have a couple other people I know who do a Twitch show similar to us.
8454780	8459100	I've been watching them just kind of taking notes and so forth. It's honestly not a bad idea.
8459660	8463900	That's great. I mean, I, I, I'm not trying to, you know,
8463900	8467020	blow smoke up your ass, but I kind of learned from one of the best out there.
8468140	8474540	Stop. Flattery will get you everywhere. So what's on your mind? I know you didn't just call in to
8474540	8480300	kiss my ass. Although if you did like great, but, uh, what's on your mind tonight? I want to talk
8480300	8488380	about fallout 76. Oh boy. First off, did you buy it? No. Okay. Okay. So I just want that to be
8488380	8492380	clear up front. All right. What's your thoughts on fall out 76? I mean, if I really wanted the
8492380	8496860	game, I would have, I would have got a subscription to elder scrolls online, just saying. All right.
8497740	8503900	But, um, I posted this in the chat, so it probably got caught up in the scroll, but when I got up
8503900	8510540	today, I got a message from a friend of mine and he sent me a picture. Now in this picture is a
8510620	8520540	fully customizable, fully skinned fallout 76 Xbox one X along with a skin to controller and swag for
8520540	8526780	one of the, uh, Bethesda influencers. So I sat here and I started doing some thinking. Now I used
8526780	8532700	to sell shirts for a living, so I could tell you the initial cost, how, you know, printing a shirt
8532700	8546380	and resell it for now a nylon bag will run you about $12 wholesale eight, a nylon bag will run
8546380	8557100	you about, I mean a canvas bag running about $16 sale $9 give or take. Now will you buy in bulk?
8557660	8565340	It gets cheaper. So let's say for the sake of the argument, 1000 pre-orders for 76 collections
8565340	8576540	edition for this instead of costing Bethesda $9 a bag that will probably cost them. I say maybe
8576540	8585260	$7 a bag, $7,000 right now, all of this is coming out of their, uh, marketing budget for the game.
8585980	8590460	Let's say it's about 10 grand. I'm just throwing numbers out there. It could be way more than that,
8590460	8596780	but all they're doing for the influencers that's taken out from the budget. Now the brand new fancy
8596780	8601900	canvas bags that they're giving out, I could tell you that's probably gonna run you about $20. I
8601900	8609340	mean, I get that. Now the fact that they're handing out to these influencers fully skinned
8609340	8617420	Xbox One X consoles and probably PlayStation 4 pro consoles as well. You're going to be very
8617420	8622620	minimal discount from the manufacturer on these consoles and then skinny it on top.
8622620	8631180	So you're looking at maybe $400 for the pro and $500 for the X and that's with all the
8631180	8636620	skinning and all of that. That's very typical. I mean, for the influencers to get like a special
8636620	8641420	console and things like that to show off, you know, that's a common trend. That's a trend that
8641420	8646380	goes way back. Somebody you and I both know that may or may not be listening to this show right
8646380	8649820	now has received something like that from a company in the past and I'll let them out
8649820	8656220	themselves if they want, but, um, yeah. So, uh, that's not like an uncommon type of thing to,
8656220	8661820	you know, again, it's just, it's like how Loki, you worked in video distribution. You got free
8661820	8667340	movies all the time. Yep. And I bet you got stuff on top of that too. Like, you know, uh,
8667340	8672460	gift cards or, you know, other things to incentivize your sales. Right TVs, TV, you got
8672460	8677980	a TV. That's right. You fucking got a TV once I remember that I've gotten. Yeah. HGTV have gotten,
8677980	8683820	but yeah, that was, yeah. I mean, they just did that. So it's like that because you know what,
8683820	8689260	I mean, sure that stuff costs money, but it's all about, because in this case, Loki was pushing
8689260	8693980	sales, you know, and if he, you know, surely remembers this TV, he's going to remember this
8693980	8697660	movie in the studio and probably be a little more incentive. That was a little bit different. It
8697660	8701340	wasn't necessarily like we're doing this. So you, I mean, I guess it is like sell stuff,
8701340	8705740	but it was more of like, if you sell this, we just, and they have money. It's basically that
8705740	8709820	the company has money that they can use. They could either pay you just money, right. Or they
8709820	8714540	could buy something to incentivize you. It's, it's all part of their budget, their marketing budget.
8715180	8720540	Um, but, uh, anyway, my point is, is that maybe Loki was, and in the way influencers are selling
8720540	8726380	too, you know, whether we like them or not, the reality is many YouTubers have quite a following
8726380	8733420	with millions of subscribers and $400 to get your product exposed to millions of people is honestly,
8733420	8737500	it's a drop in the fucking bucket. It really is like, it doesn't, like, it doesn't matter what
8737500	8741820	they spent on those consoles because like commercials to advertise on Comedy Central
8741820	8746220	to probably less people than some of these YouTube channels are going to cost way more money.
8746220	8750380	So my point is with this, my point is with this, I ain't mad about these special consoles,
8750380	8756540	these other things that influencers get. What I'm mad about is that this canvas bag that they got
8756540	8761580	was kind of that impression of, Oh, this is what you're getting with the professional edition. And
8761580	8766460	so people do these unboxing videos of look at all this stuff I got with a professional edition.
8766460	8771500	And it has that subtext of, I got this canvas bag and you will too, because they're advertising the
8771500	8775900	canvas bag, whether they said that explicitly or not, like that's the impression you get.
8775900	8781900	Whereas with the special PS4s and Xbox 360, a reasonable person knows I'm not getting a fucking
8781900	8789180	console, but I was promised a canvas bag. I get that. But the thing is that I'm just
8789180	8793420	saying this budget, they took care of all the influencers. When they look at the rest of the
8793420	8799180	amount of budget, they're like, Oh, fuck, we can't afford the canvas bags. So we'll have to drop down
8799180	8804780	a dollar and give them the nylon bag. I'm just saying they were probably right about financially
8804780	8810780	affording it. They just probably didn't budget the marketing budget high enough for that. So
8810780	8816540	the influencers and the VIPs hit the walk away with the cool swag while everyone who pre-ordered
8816540	8821500	just get the short end of the stick. Well, Rama, we're going to bust our butts and work
8821500	8826620	a little harder and maybe we'll be in that influencers club. We used to be.
8827180	8832860	But the industry changed and in some ways we changed too early. In some ways we're changing
8832860	8836860	too late, but it doesn't matter. It's not about me and free shit. I really don't care. I've been
8836860	8842460	doing this show for shit for 17 years. No, I shouldn't say for shit because the reward I get
8842460	8848140	from it is you guys that fucking show up that send emails. I kid you not. I got, this isn't a
8848140	8852780	joke. Okay. Or something I'm bringing up for like the sake of hyperbole or something like that.
8853740	8858300	I got a message and I'm being slow because I'm actually bringing it up on Twitter right now.
8858300	8862060	I got a message on Twitter this week. I'm not going to out the person that said it,
8862060	8865820	but I got a message, direct message. So you won't be able to see it online. Hey,
8865820	8869660	I just want to let you know that you inspired me years ago on Horde house and on orange lounge
8869660	8876380	radio. Hope you're having an awesome day. That that's why I do this. I don't keep your goddamn
8876380	8882300	brand and PlayStation four. That is worth 10 times more. Exactly. One time with anime next
8882300	8886620	on a Sunday, I'm taking pictures. Somebody recognized me from the podcast and we took
8886620	8892460	a picture together and I posted on my page. That is the reason why I go out and invest so much
8892460	8899180	money and doing the show and telling me this is how this is how we do it. I just feel, you know,
8899180	8904780	I understand you got to take care of, you know, I get that, but don't forget about the rest of
8904780	8911340	the squad that love and support your games. That's all I care about. I mean, come on,
8911340	8916460	because you're looking from somebody who occasionally plays a few games from somebody
8916460	8922060	who may pick up a collector's edition of a game once or twice a year. And I mean, honestly,
8922060	8927900	I have never been the biggest Bethesda fan. I mean, hell, if I want to sit there and play
8927900	8934540	glitch games, I'll just say, you know, I'll invest that money. But the way, the way they
8934540	8939340	handle that and the way they handling these, I'm just like, you know, I just have no desire
8939340	8945740	to purchase another Bethesda game. If it's done by an outside studio and they publish it,
8945740	8951900	I'm okay with that. That I will do. I'll buy used, but if it's there in house, no,
8952540	8956060	I'm just going to step back to like, I'm good. I'm good.
8957340	8963100	Um, you know, I just, Bethesda, I really think is, uh, I don't think they're going to be able to
8963100	8967260	live this one down quite so easy. I bet in the next week, we're going to see some type of better
8967260	8972220	response from Bethesda. We'll see. I, I don't know if that's going to be that they're just going to
8972220	8980220	provide canvas bags or that they're going to make up with maybe a game giveaway of some sort. I
8980220	8982860	don't know. I don't know what Bethesda does to make it right, but they're going to have to do
8982860	8987580	something. This is this 500 Adams or whatever. This isn't going to cut it. And to be fair,
8988140	8991580	this is where, okay. Remember I told you when I started this whole thing, I said,
8991580	8997340	Rob will try to cut the big company, some slack in the interest of fairness, wherever he can. Right.
8997340	9001340	Even though I think this canvas bag stuff is bullshit, but here's what I will give you
9001340	9005580	this whole 500 Adams and that whole thing, that whole, like what the customer service cost of
9005580	9012220	nothing. Well, here's the thing. That is probably what that outsourced customer service employee
9012220	9018780	is empowered to do for somebody. And so, because I bet Bethesda has not come up with an official,
9019340	9023660	what the fuck are we going to do about this type of situation? So, so what they did in
9023660	9028380	that interim time was these customer service reps are empowered to give away five bucks.
9028380	9032700	So they gave away the 500 Adams that's through their official Twitter account.
9032700	9038460	That was their response. I, I would even say that that could be all they are empowered to
9038460	9043020	do until the executives in the boardroom do something better. So maybe I wouldn't
9043020	9048780	say don't take it because it's garbage and I'm not paying $5 is a shit. It gives you,
9048780	9054700	I swear to God. And I made the joke before it gives you a door and some succulent plants or
9054700	9061820	a beehive hairdo. Anyhow. All right. Uh, I should probably wrap up and try to take more calls,
9061820	9065580	but Rama always enjoy to hear from you. Okay. Right back at you. Yeah. Take care, buddy.
9067580	9072220	Orange on radio, all one word on Skype. Uh, some folks are talking about kind of like rewards and
9072220	9075420	things like that. A lot of very nice things being said about that message. I got, um,
9075420	9080380	I guess that YYR says that's the sort of message I love to see as a developer as well.
9080380	9084220	That's a, that's a great point is that even like if there's an indie game you love,
9084860	9091420	like leave a nice review, leave, send an email saying like, I, I love you and I hate you because
9091420	9097020	I spent all night playing your game and not sleeping. That type of stuff is going to go
9097020	9102380	a very long way. I bet you anything. I love it. All right. Let's get to another call
9102380	9106220	here on the Skype line. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
9107020	9111100	Hey, uh, this is raging eater. Hey raging here. What's on your mind tonight?
9111820	9118460	Uh, no, a whole lot. Um, since I just want to get in, since this is going to be last to show on,
9118460	9126380	uh, vlog network, you know, before you transition to, uh, no twitch and real quick,
9126380	9131740	I just have to, I have to correct a few things. Hey, we think the day is December 16th,
9131740	9136620	so you actually have one more week. Uh, and that may not be the final day. If I run into technical,
9136620	9140860	that's, this is why the whole time I've been like, do not fucking hold me to a date. I am trying
9140860	9146460	because what I really want rage nater is to be on twitch in 2019. But if I can go, if I can pull
9146460	9150780	the trigger a few couple of weeks early to work out the kinks and we have some real messy shows
9150780	9155340	over the holidays, people will forgive us in the Christmas spirit. So that's the, that's the idea.
9155340	9158300	But the other thing, the other thing is that vog network, and I want to be very clear on this
9158300	9162140	vog network is not going away. I don't think you, but the way you kind of worded that is
9162140	9167020	we'll be very clear vog network, still a thing, still working together to promote any podcasts
9167020	9172300	and each other. Just, it's just a different delivery mechanism. It's just, instead of,
9172300	9176140	uh, coming to you by UPS, it's coming to you by FedEx. That's all.
9176700	9183740	All right. Point, point taken. Uh, but anyway, um, since it's that time of year, we're all,
9183740	9189820	you know, you know, all the, the major holidays are coming up regardless of what religion you
9189820	9198940	follow, assuming that you follow religion. Um, I would post a timely, uh, uh, topic, although
9199180	9205340	it may be a little bit difficult to talk about since this is a live internet and show and a
9205340	9211340	recorded podcast. You're a girl. You don't know necessarily know who's listening. Uh,
9211340	9220460	but that being said, now, no, when it comes to gaming and, uh, geek related stuff, so on and
9220460	9226540	so forth, uh, you know, like have you taken advantage of, you know, you know, of any big
9226540	9233020	sales like cyber Monday, uh, black Friday, or are you planning on taking advantage of
9233020	9241260	some before Christmas? And I, uh, would you like to drop not so solo hands is, you know, two others,
9241260	9246540	you know, what you want for Christmas or, well, I know you can't necessarily say what you're going
9246540	9252460	to give out cause who knows going to know who's listening, but right. Um, so I've gotten really
9252460	9256620	super into collecting these little mini arcade cabinets lately. And I think I'm going to do a
9256620	9260140	video for Twitch at some point where I actually show like my look because my collection is getting
9260140	9265660	kind of impressive, right? Loki is getting pretty big there. So, um, I love more of those, but it's
9265660	9271900	going to be hard to find out what I need and what I already have because chances are if I need it,
9271900	9277260	I'm probably tracing it down right now. I will say the new, the new ones in the Walmart collection
9277260	9283420	are the actual fix at Felix machine. And, uh, cause they, they miniaturize that in that cool.
9283420	9287500	Jamie has it and I was playing it at her house on Friday. So it's, it's a cute little,
9287500	9292460	the only thing it's missing is that Ralph doesn't go, I'm going to wreck it. Like that's gone,
9292460	9296460	unfortunately. Cause they, you know, it runs on crappy hardware, but otherwise it's pretty
9296460	9300620	faithful. And then, uh, Ms. Pac-Man. So I'm trying to track those down right now. And I think I need
9300620	9305580	a Pac-Man version of the target line, but like how many times do I have to buy fucking Pac-Man?
9305580	9311420	I already have it in the Walmart lines. Anyway. Anyway. Uh, I also, I strongly hinted to the
9311420	9316700	hubs that I want to get that. And I mentioned this earlier in the show, the $80 one with bad dudes on
9316700	9322380	it and a bunch of the data East stuff. I'm looking at that. And I was looking at Atari flashback nine
9322380	9326860	gold, you know, they're there on, they do those flashbacks every year and I've never bought one.
9326860	9330940	I bought the Intellivision one, but I never bought the Atari one. So I kinda sorta want that,
9330940	9336300	I think. So, um, yeah, that's some of the stuff on my holiday list as far as like the, um,
9337580	9343100	this, the sales and stuff, I have to admit, I didn't super take advantage of black Friday
9343100	9348380	or cyber Monday, especially when it came to games. Um, I pretty much already own everything
9348380	9354940	or I'm waiting on it like smash brothers, uh, for this season. But, um, the only thing I bought on
9354940	9361260	black Friday was to benefit OLR. I bought a webcam half off. That's one of those fancy,
9361260	9365260	you know, Logitech, the newer ones that'll do the higher end video. Well, even though we're only
9365260	9372700	going to do seven 20, but you know, HD, it'll be HD. Oh, cool. Yeah. Uh, anyhow. And they thank
9372700	9376380	you, tiger claw. I have seen that link and that's probably how I'm going to end up getting the fix
9376380	9381100	at Felix. I was hoping it would be in stock at a local store. We joke about this Walmart in the
9381100	9385100	middle of nowhere because there's this back road. Have you ever drew? I don't want to say it on air.
9385100	9388540	I know what you're talking about. Okay. You've been to that Walmart. It's like, there's nothing
9388540	9391180	around it. It's like in the middle of nowhere. It's like, why did they build a fucking Walmart
9391180	9394780	here? Because eventually they'll build stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Sacramento is kind of growing that
9394780	9397980	direction. Eventually they'll build stuff around it. But anyway, uh, I was surprised they didn't
9397980	9400940	have any in stock. Loki, let me let you answer the question real quick. And then I'm going to
9400940	9405980	turn the tables on raging or make him answer it. So did you do anything with the sales or what's
9405980	9412940	on your holiday list for, for games? Oh, for me to buy for myself. Well, just what would you hope
9412940	9418940	maybe like the wife or the kids are looking at getting you today? She's like, what do you want
9418940	9426540	for Christmas? So let's sit. So a little backstory here. So my wife now follows me on Twitter.
9426540	9431740	So I have literally no place to bitch about anything. Oh, did she, did she read some of
9431740	9436300	your past stuff? Oh no, I took, I took care of deleting all that stuff a long time ago.
9436300	9441260	She's not going to go back that far. Anyway. So, um, so I have literally no place to vent
9441260	9446540	anymore about stuff. So I'm going to vent here because that's what I did. So she knows she'll
9446540	9450940	never listen to this. Yes, exactly. So here's what I'm going to vent about. So like, speaking of,
9450940	9456140	yes. So she asked me, you know, what, what do you want me to get you for Christmas? Which I don't
9456140	9460780	like that because I feel that we've been married for how long and she's known me for how long and
9460780	9466860	she doesn't know what I like or she can't think of like, can't be creative in her own mind without,
9466860	9471740	you know, coming up with something that she could think that I might like. She doesn't want to do
9471740	9475660	that. She wants me to tell her, okay, get this thing. Okay. Well I'm basically telling her to
9475660	9480140	go to the store and pick something up for me that I could do myself. And it's most likely if it's
9480140	9484700	anything like my birthday was, it's us going to the store, me picking it up and her going, see,
9484700	9489820	here you go. You can't get anything else. So no, I'm not doing that, but here's what happened. Like
9489820	9495420	I was going to get her an air fryer cause she wanted an air fryer and stuff like that. So I
9495420	9501740	ordered an air fryer from Amazon and because she opens my boxes when they get home from, from stuff,
9501740	9508780	I told her, I'm like, I'm getting stuff sent in the mail from Amazon. I don't want you opening
9508780	9513420	it up because at least it was like this when this new mixing board showed up, they just put a
9513420	9517740	mailing label on the fucking mixing board box. Well, I specifically had them, like it was going
9517740	9521740	to like, Amazon does the thing. Like if it was going to come in a box that basically is like
9521740	9525100	that with just the mailing label on it, they have the option. Do you want to put this in a
9525100	9530300	plain box so that they can't see what's inside? So I said, yes, put it in the plain box or whatever.
9530300	9537260	So I told her, I'm like, I don't want, I don't want her opening up the box because I'm ordering
9537260	9542140	stuff also gifts for the kids too. So yeah, I don't want that stuff opening. So what does she
9542140	9547740	do when I say, I tell her like, I don't want you opening this box up. She goes, Oh, what's coming
9547740	9552300	in the box. Is it a gift for me? I'm like, yes, actually it is a gift for you. Is it an air fryer?
9552300	9558460	Is it a Roomba? I bet it's an air fryer. I'm like, you fucking ruined like the whole art of
9558460	9565500	me giving you a gift and be nice about it. Like it's just, it's, it seriously pisses me off. It
9565500	9570620	upsets me like, because I'm trying to be nice. I'm trying to like, like think about doing something
9570620	9575500	nice and all I get in return is just like, let me just take that thunder away from you. Let me
9575500	9580700	just take all of the effort out of it. Happy Hanukkah. It's just, it's fucking annoying.
9580700	9585020	So yes, she asked me what I wanted for Christmas today and I'm like, I don't fucking know. I haven't
9585020	9588060	been thinking about me. I've been thinking about what the hell to get everybody else.
9588860	9593180	So I don't know. I fucking don't know what the hell I would want for Christmas. Cause I,
9593180	9597340	how about it was suggested in chat that you offer up use of the 4k TV.
9597340	9604300	I can seriously count the amount of hours that I played on the 4k TV since we've gotten it.
9604940	9607660	And I'm not going to be holding up all fingers. It's like three fingers.
9607660	9612220	Why don't you ask for another TV? We have a TV in the bedroom. It's 10 ADP.
9612220	9617660	She can fucking watch. All right. Look, whatever. Look, I appreciate low-key psychiatry session,
9617660	9622460	but I got to get rage leader. I got to turn this question on you like raising her. What about you?
9622460	9627500	Are you, uh, what are you, what are you looking for for the holidays? Are you browsing the sales?
9627500	9630620	Are you buying stuff for special somebody's what's happening?
9630620	9638140	Yeah. Uh, excuse me, clearing my soul. Um, I'm in a weird position. Um, my family has kind of
9638140	9644780	gotten away from selling and bringing the holidays. Uh, you know, because. Reasons, uh,
9644780	9650060	they wouldn't probably be too long to get into and probably not great for radio. Uh,
9650060	9656620	but so my family and I are not doing anything per se. Uh, so my options are really, you know,
9656620	9664380	either a, do something for myself or I've been, or, you know, uh, do something for Lily.
9664380	9670460	You know, I kind of opted to do something for Lily. Um, and you know, unfortunately I
9670460	9676380	couldn't really take care, uh, take advantage of the sales, uh, because of really shitty timing.
9676380	9683500	Is the girl you've talked about before? Yeah. Okay. Um, no lungs. No, I did, you know, sit,
9683500	9691340	you know, give her some stuff, you know, fairly early because, you know, things happen, you know,
9691340	9697100	and basically, you know, like early Christmas presents, uh, cheer her up. Like I gifted her
9697100	9702940	like limbo. Surprise, surprise. I paid you pay full price for it. I know shocker, right?
9702940	9707260	Me, painful price for a game. Oh, wow. You must be really crazy about this person.
9708060	9711900	Yeah, well, well, you know, here, here's the thing, you know,
9712860	9719740	you know, I was going to wait for a sale, but, uh, you know, again, things happen, uh,
9719740	9726140	too long to get into. Uh, but I can't forget, give a gift early, just, you know, cheer her up.
9726220	9729340	Um, but why not love? He did. Yeah.
9731420	9739820	Uh, then of course, you know, you know, I also gave her like, um, the Dracula trilogy,
9739820	9747100	uh, since that was on Seattle, I gave her to her. Plus I got Draco to trilogy for myself as well.
9747980	9758780	Um, then, uh, uh, then technically it's not, you know, geek related, but I also helped her out by
9758780	9764060	giving, you know, pointing $50 towards her, uh, her rent. Cause you know, you know, again,
9764060	9772780	things happen. And then, um, then there was, you know, one other gift I've given her a plus one
9772780	9781500	that I'm going to be giving her, you know, early, probably with the next week or two that, uh,
9781500	9789100	it would be highly inappropriate for me to talk about on stream. Um, but you can probably take
9789100	9799260	your guesses to what general area, you know, moving on games, games, games. Yeah. Yeah. But,
9799980	9806860	but yeah, at least I, the gifts I did give her a geek related. So, uh, but no,
9806860	9810380	I'm not really expecting anything for, uh, for Christmas. Like you said,
9811420	9816860	you know, family doesn't do anything for Christmas and, uh, you know, Lily's dying
9816860	9822460	really in a position to, you know, give out gifts. Uh, she's barely able to give out Christmas cards.
9822460	9830940	So, um, so no, maybe you'll get a, maybe you'll get a poem or a coupon book for chores
9830940	9835820	around the house or, you know, one of those things that, that, you know, you don't, you can't,
9835820	9839740	you put that, that Loki's kids will get for Loki because you can't really put a cost on them.
9840860	9847100	Yeah. Well, no, I, I, I know it sounds weird, but I kind of considering, uh, the opportunity
9847340	9853740	to chat with her on a regular basis. No, my gift because no, I, I just enjoy, you know,
9853740	9858860	talking about, uh, talking to her on a regular basis, even about the mundane stuff.
9859900	9864780	What is up with tonight being like therapy night? All right. Look, I asked about the games.
9865660	9871660	Yeah. Yeah. Well anyway, I take it up way too much time, uh, uh, doing your show. I'm sure
9871660	9876620	all the people want to, uh, call in, not just me and Ron. So, uh, you might be surprised,
9876620	9881660	but yeah, I appreciate the phone call nevertheless. And Hey, have a happy holiday.
9881660	9886540	Okay. All right. You too. Take care. All right. Take care. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. All right.
9886540	9890380	Let's see if anybody else wants to call orange launch radio, all one word on Skype, or, uh,
9890380	9893740	I guess if you still want to do the old fashioned way, one eight seven seven game, O L R. If you
9893740	9897020	want to give us a call, I haven't checked in to see if there's any last minute stories. I don't
9897020	9900540	know. I think we covered all the big stuff. I was looking there. I still haven't found anything.
9900540	9904140	Yeah. There's not, not a lot of other big stuff going on that I can think of, but I will,
9904140	9907260	I will try to leave that open for just a couple more seconds. If anybody wants to get through
9907260	9912700	again over orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. Um, you know, I was thinking about the
9912700	9917900	Christmas gift question. There is still one game I never picked up that I guess I should
9917900	9923100	kind of wait and see if maybe husband or somebody will, will, uh, get it, but I never did pick up
9923100	9928220	soul caliber six. So that, that's a game. That's a game that I guess I should, you know, hold out
9928220	9934300	for. Cause, uh, uh, that I don't know why I skipped it. I just, it was just the wrong time
9934300	9941580	to ask me for $60. So, um, as, as, uh, some of you, uh, in chat, I think I mentioned this on the show,
9941580	9946220	Alan's between jobs right now and we're fine. Like financially, we're not like devastated cause I,
9946220	9950780	I make fine money where I'm at to keep us along. But, uh, I would really love for, you know, that,
9950780	9956540	that to all be sorted out and then I can start to drop more and more money frivolously on games.
9957340	9961500	I think that's kind of what it comes down to. Like something like smash brothers is like, okay,
9961500	9965660	I know I'm going to play this game. I have to have this game, but like soul caliber six,
9965660	9970620	can I sit on that for a little bit? Even stuff like the Sega Genesis collection and the Katamari
9970620	9974860	stuff. I'm like, do I have to have that day one? Maybe I can hold off a little bit just while some
9974860	9979580	other things work itself out. So we'll see. Oh, Rama says soul caliber six was on sale for 35.
9979580	9984780	Damn it. I missed it. Oh, well I'm sure steam always does a sale at the end of the year and
9984780	9988700	it is on PC. So maybe they'll, maybe they'll have it that price again or something like that. Who
9988700	9994220	knows? You never know. Anyway, the Skype line is not lighting up anymore. So I think we are about
9994220	9999180	at the end of the show. They're down. It's down the $48. Oh, that's not bad at all on Amazon.
9999180	10003340	Okay. That's not bad at all. Maybe I'll just end up picking that up. We'll see. Um, but anyway,
10003340	10007900	uh, let's, uh, let's close up shop. We're going to, uh, end it for the week. We'll be back next
10007900	10011740	week. Uh, dark soccer will be here in the house. That'd be nice to hear from her. So send some
10011740	10015660	emails, uh, give her something to read, participate at orange lounge radio.com.
10015660	10019020	Uh, let's go around and get some final thoughts. Well, actually, before we do that, I'll, I'll say
10019020	10022380	as I always do, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange lounge radio, uh, please tell a
10022380	10025900	friend about the show. Help spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
10025900	10029740	but you know, the voices have to be here. So, um, help bring some new friends into the show.
10029740	10032700	Uh, this whole transition we're going to be going through is a great time to do that. I think,
10032700	10037500	I think more people will find a Twitch channel easier probably than they do how to listen on
10037500	10041100	shoutcast or tune in or whatever you're using today, which no shade to tune in.
10041100	10045100	They've done a great job for us for many years and I'm sad I can't pimp them anymore in a few
10045100	10051740	weeks. Um, but anyway, uh, let's, uh, if you enjoyed this too, you can also leave a review,
10051740	10055340	a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Google play podcast, wherever you found the show,
10055340	10059660	that stuff goes a long, long way. Support indie broadcasting no matter what. Even if you hated
10059660	10063980	this whole show, but made it to the end anyway, uh, just support it, support a show you do like,
10063980	10068300	dang it. Uh, cause there's many, any broadcasters out there who appreciate your support. Just like
10068300	10071820	we were talking about earlier, a little note, a little review, a little nice words goes a long
10071820	10075580	way. You guys. Okay. Now let's get final thoughts. Um, Loki, your final thought.
10075580	10079340	My final thought is I'm probably have to load a new version of DDR onto the cabinet.
10080060	10084300	Cause I'm kind of getting tired of fourth plus already. I got tired of that really fast.
10085100	10087740	I don't know. Like I played through all the songs like, and it's like, okay,
10087740	10092380	now I've played through them. I don't know, but it will be better once I get the step
10092380	10097020	mania machine going. Um, I'm still working, like I said, working on the theme for that
10097580	10104460	actually have Photoshop open so that, you know, working on it. Um, and then, um, then
10104460	10108460	everything will be in there. Then I want this, you know, I'll have so many songs to play,
10109580	10113500	but then I'll have to make steps for songs that, you know, are missing steps.
10113500	10118220	I still need to come over and do a, a stream with you. So that'll be fun. Make that happen
10118220	10123660	before Christmas. Um, so I guess, I guess that's it. Um, my final thoughts tonight. Um,
10123660	10128700	my final thought is, uh, I'm going to try to play at least one new video game this week,
10128700	10132060	uh, besides smash brothers. Cause I'll be playing that on Friday for sure. So try to play
10132060	10135580	one new game every week, at least for the rest of the year. And I am looking at,
10135580	10140140	I really, really want to get into doing more like video on demand stuff for Twitch. Um,
10140140	10144220	so that's something I'm trying to look at doing to just, you know, all, all, all this,
10144300	10147740	all these projects, not enough hours. And then they get sucked into MMOs,
10147740	10153420	but Oh well, that's what happens. So anyway, I'd like to stream more games. Um, other than DDR,
10153420	10159420	just, I don't have a really good place to do that. I have to probably clean the garage and then,
10159420	10162460	well, maybe you'll get something worked out just in time for summer to hit. Yeah.
10163020	10168380	Hey, I was streaming games. It's only 120 degrees inside the garage down and we had no air. Yeah.
10168700	10173740	Yeah. All right. Uh, anyway, that's it. We're done here. Uh, we're out for the night. Thank
10173740	10178060	you guys so much, uh, for listening to our show tonight and supporting us. We'll see you in seven
