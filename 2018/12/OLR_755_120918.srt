00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week we bid a fond farewell to our telephone operator, Pete Shelley. Nese Palares and Det, but I believe he found his.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Stay tuned for more stories, happy, sad, hilarious, and facepalmy, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with our 755th episode for this December the 9th of 2018.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For the last time tonight, before you panic, of course I'm talking about the last time on Shoutcast, allegedly, assuming all of the tech tests and all that stuff go well.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Next week, live, we will be over on Twitch, and I'll reiterate, we've been talking about that for a few weeks now, but I'll reiterate that in a minute.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In the meantime, joining us for this special episode of Orange Lounge Radio, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sup bitches.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Welcome back, nice to have you here without the use of radio magic.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Happy Hanukkah.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's what I was going to say.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Instead tonight we have Hanukkah magic bringing DarkSakura to the studio, but Hanukkah magic is the real deal.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
She's here live.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I sure am.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's great to have you.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm trying to get back in the chat.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And you know what is very special about Jamie being here is that, and you know tonight is a special night because Jamie actually got in the kitchen and cooked for the show tonight.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, before y'all send your hate mail, I would never make those types of jokes anymore, however.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I did it on purpose.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She did it on purpose because of the holiday.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
As the token Jew, I have to, you know, we have a, Loki here is our Jew adjacent.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We needed latkes.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I have my candles on fire right now.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yep.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So we have.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And they're on full blast.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Tonight's the last night.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Tonight is the last night.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So it's every candle.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I have two Hanukiah with all nine candles on it because you have your Shamash and your eight candles.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The, the, the one that lights the others.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Eighteen candles.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I hope the house doesn't burn down.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You get to blow them out when they graduate high school.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now you get to follow miss crackers recipe.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sis degree.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Very.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Um, I actually just bought straights kosher latke mix and did it from a box.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And dark soccer of course is reading from our live chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice geeks network.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Twitch TV slash vog network and a vog network.com and a, you can actually follow us live over at live dot vog network.com.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And again, we're trying to make everything with the change as seamless as possible.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Uh, if you go to live dot vog network.com next week, what you're going to see is instead of the regular chat room, you're just going to see the Twitch with us there and all that stuff.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, um, hopefully for those of you that go to live dot vog network.com out of habit and the fact that I'll probably still say it on the show because I've been saying it for years.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Um, that will still work as a portal to where we are taping live.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And if you're listening on the podcast feed, then great.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can keep doing that.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Uh, everything will still be as it is on the podcast feed as we've been saying for weeks and weeks.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Um, so I don't want to dwell on it too much tonight because again, we're still waiting on the final things to arrive from a technical perspective.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And then we're going to kind of remodel this room in some ways to get it broadcast ready.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And uh, yeah, we're aiming for next Sunday being the first show.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That way it gives us kind of like gives us two or three weeks and then in 2019 we're going to go full steam ahead with the promo and about really trying to get out there about like,

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey, did you know that these old assholes who've been doing this show since their mid twenties are still going and they're going now on Twitch.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Won't that be fun?

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yep.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right, well say hello to that old asshole.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's tech master Loki.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's here every week.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hello.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How are you doing Loki?

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm fine.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's funny because you were talking about that you were doing your own Twitch stream playing DDR this week and you're doing a stream on Thursday night.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Right?

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Were you still doing Euro mix or are you back on max now?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm on Euro mix too.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm still playing that.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And so you've been doing some DDR on your Twitch stream and then as you were like, you were like, why isn't anybody here?

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Where did everybody go?

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And Oh yeah, the game awards were tonight.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Right?

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, sometimes there aren't, isn't anyone there.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, and it wasn't exactly the most, um, a smooth going stream.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I had a ton of drops for some reason, which I never have that issue weird.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Um, and then also the kids came out and said that the cat had gotten into our bedroom somehow.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And so I had to go fish her out of that in the middle of the stream.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And then it took me four reboots that finally get your mix to, to boot up.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So it was like really being a pain in the ass.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's okay.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's as I mentioned on the stream several times, you're a mix too.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's just like, it's confusing.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It is such like this weird, ugly stepchild of the DDR series.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Not to say it's bad, but it's like max too was pretty streamlined.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You know, you had your options menu where you put in your speed mods and difficulties and stuff like that.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And it's all makes sense.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You're a mix too.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When you select the song, you select the difficulty after you select the song, all of your mods,

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
including speed mods have to be done with foot panel, um, combos like you would in like fourth mix.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh God. All right.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's fucking weird.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All right.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It makes no sense whatsoever.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And then like on top of that, you can't do speed mods or any other mods in nonstop.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So at least I haven't figured out a way to do that.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And nonstop is integrated into the neural, um, song selection.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So when you first start off, it says nonstop and you can select that and it goes in the nonstop mode.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And for anybody that hasn't played DDR in a long time, that whole last two minutes of you ranting probably didn't make any sense either.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It was based off of max two.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Just leave it how max two was put different songs in there.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Done.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't have to do anything else.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They said they like, let's fuck it all up.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com for some comments.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A dark Tetsuya says, so next Sunday is like the soft launch slash beta test slash working out the kinks.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Fallout 76 launch.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It is.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It is absolutely that it is.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It is.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It is a well it's vog early access starts next week.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You have to understand we're going the AAA route.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So we're launching this.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's feature complete.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Absolutely.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's what next week bugs that are in there are complete, which is funny because next week is OLR 756.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So it's kind of works.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Kinda sorta.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Anyway, also in our chat, see a Tiberian chat says in insert Blanche, Devereaux, the change memes here.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's a very, that's a very apropro comparison is that OLR is going through menopause.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Would that be correct?

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Dark soccer.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
OLR is going through menopause.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I would say we're actually getting ready to graduate high school.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I would, I would say with this move to twitch, we're going to go hang out with the cool like going to college.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, we're going to hang out.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's like Jerry blank.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You know, I'm back in school from strangers, the candy.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, I never watched.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, how about how about Sally O'Malley from Saturday Night Live?

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm 50, 50 years old.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know what?

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We're going to be going to college and learning how to hang out in coffee shops.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Right.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We're going to hang out with the cool kids like Ninja and have a cool have CBV vapes.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yep.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm cool like Ninja and sneak a Boone's Strawberry Hill from our older friends.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We're not playing enough Fortnite to be cool.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So, you know, Sonic Fox.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I got he's gay, black, furry.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I got one of those three things going for me.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So, you know, we were cool with them.

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It is become gay and furry.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Stop it.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
All right.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Going to our chat at live dog network dot com.

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Act Def says Ninja doesn't hang out with girls, though.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, you know, married, though.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Neither neither do I wink.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, that's a lie.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't count.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No, you totally count because without girls who would go shopping for shoes with me.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I mean, you you serve a very important.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Do you know how many drag queens I know?

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can hook you up.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's see.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Also in chat.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, I I hope you all know these are just jokes because I know we live in a clip happy, you

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
know, world and that whole thing.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So please, I hope you all know we're just having a good time here at all.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They could bring up all my old shit on Twitter.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't fucking care.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's the problem.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's like, you see, I don't care.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not going to resign from whatever political position I'm in.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm well, I already know.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, I mean, there was I I don't hold any political office.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There was that part of me that's like I could never run for political office because of

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the things I've done.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But now look at who's the fucking president.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's like, wow, you can do the worst things in the world and still be president.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Like it's it's amazing.

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Anyway, let's see.

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Going to chat at live dog or dot com.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
See it to bury says, wait, so this is all ours live action, soft reboot kind of kind

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
of.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All right.

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's let's move on.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We got a lot of gaming news to cover because we had a pretty big television event or technology

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
television event that happened this past week.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Loki, the game awards.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So you turn off your stream and you started watching the game awards a little bit.

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, I did.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What do you think I did?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because I was disappointed.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All zero watchers of my streams.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm humble bragging that I got a whole zero.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There you go.

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's way, you know, anyways.

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So, you know, I did watch the game awards a little bit.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So they had lots of announcements as they always do.

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's, you know, one half the reason.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, most the reason you turn tune is probably just to see all the trailers and stuff that

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
they're going to show.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So this is kind of run down some of the things that they announced.

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So they had a game called Sayonara Wild Hearts, which was coming to the switch and like pretty

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
awesome.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That was the one that you were talking about.

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's sort of like an album by Annapurna Interactive and it looks great.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Like music game.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It almost looks a little bit like elite beat agents sort of.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I hope.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's not get our hopes up for something that amazing.

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But no, it looked pretty sweet.

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So very stylized, kind of a music game, a little bit punk.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So that was pretty neat.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And then, of course, there was a brand new game called Journey to the Savage Planet,

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
which looked like some sort of survival game.

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I didn't really get.

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I missed this trailer, unfortunately.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So that's supposed to be coming out next year on all major platforms.

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And then, of course, they announced the console version of the Stanley Parable.

222
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, which is also going to have new endings and different

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
branching paths and gamepad controls.

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I think that's great and all, but it does feel a little late.

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Like this is the type of thing they really should have put out one or two years ago.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Right.

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I mean, well, is Switch one of the consoles?

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's never too late to do a Switch port.

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't remember if the Switch is one of the consoles.

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Everybody wants their game on Switch at this point.

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It would be neat if they patched that stuff into the PC game, too.

232
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because I have to go back and play it to get that achievement for not playing it for five years.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So I think that's due in the next few days for me.

234
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, and I think that also just goes to show that, like, OK, that game's been out a while.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So it is a little weird that it took this long to go to consoles.

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But a good game is a good game, no matter what.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You know, people are mega hyped.

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Maybe perhaps the gentleman who was on before us at the voice.

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was hoping it would have been a sequel to the Stanley Parable.

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Is one of the people that gets really hyped about Katamari Damacy getting re-released this week.

241
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So you know what? Old games can still be fun.

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But I'm hyped for the PC version, which will eventually get hacked to put all sorts of fun stuff in there.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's what I'm hyped about.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Mission, roll up all the dildos.

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's a good call. Which one do you buy?

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The PC one? Because you know modding's coming?

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Or do you get the Switch one for the portability?

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You buy both, because the PC version, there was a site that had it for $10 cheaper, so I got it for $18.

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Look at you.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Versus $29.99, because that's way too fucking much for, you know, buying it twice.

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You buy both, so that Namco will continue to invest in the series, and hopefully make another one at some point.

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, but they really half-assed put that remaster.

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They put it out the same day as kind of another big deal sort of game.

254
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I mean, that's one issue. That's fine. I mean, it happens.

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Physical version is only available at GameStop, by the way.

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I know. That's limited. It's just like, I really hope they aren't expecting $11 billion sales of this.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I want that game to do well. Anyway.

258
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There's a game called Among Trees. It looks pretty nice.

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So that's coming out on Steam Early Access in 2019.

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And that's a Survival Sandbox game.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This was kind of unexpected. A Switch exclusive game, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, the Black Order.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Kind of looking forward to that.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That looks pretty awesome. I am definitely down with that.

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So that, I'm guessing, is coming out next year as well.

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm wondering if it's just a timed exclusive.

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I would assume it's timed exclusive. Or maybe the console version, or Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is getting a different type of game.

267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Or a little bit more expanded game. We'll see.

268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But that's coming out. And that's by Team Ninja as well.

269
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh, Nintendo's publishing it. Well, that's why it's a Switch exclusive.

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's see. What else?

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Supergiant has a new game coming out called Hades. It looks pretty sweet.

272
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Much like all the other games. So that'll be probably next year as well.

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, actually that's launching in the Epic Games Store, which we'll be talking more about later.

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So that's something that Early Access there.

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Far Cry New Dawn, which is launching February 15th for $40.

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And it's going to be a sequel to Far Cry 5 that's set kind of in this post-apocalyptic future.

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Apparently that spoils the end of the game, I guess.

278
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I still haven't finished Far Cry 5. I don't know if I will, but it looks awesome.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's got saw blade guns and it looks kind of like Rage. Rage 2, I should say.

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Scavengers, which is like a sci-fi co-op game.

281
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's see. They had Crash Team Racing was kind of unexpected. So there's a new Crash Racing game coming.

282
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Dead by Daylight is getting a new chapter.

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So they've got a chapter 10 of Darkness Among Us, which is coming out, I guess, this week.

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They have a new killer called The Legion, which... I don't know.

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It sounds like... I swear there was someone that had the name The Legion or something that was like a villain or something.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And then there's a new special power called Feral Frenzy as well.

287
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Still haven't played that game. Probably won't.

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Monster Hunter, there's a game called Dauntless that sort of looks like Monster Hunter.

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
In fact, when I saw the trailer for it, that reminded me of Monster Hunter quite a bit.

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But it's coming to Switch and Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and even mobile next year.

291
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's see, what else?

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Game called The Last Campfire, which was by Hello Games.

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So that was kind of unexpected that that was going to be coming out.

294
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And they're calling it Hello Games Short, so I'm guessing it's not a very long game.

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The one that really caught my attention, though, of course, was The Outer Worlds, which is a game by Obsidian.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And it looks fantastic. It's like a cross between Fallout New Vegas and Mass Effect and just Borderlands and all sorts of fucking awesome shit.

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I actually watched some gameplay of this. I posted a link on Twitter earlier today, and it looks great.

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So I'm really looking forward to this.

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's kind of something to satiate the appetite of people that were hoping for a new Fallout-type game and got disappointed with Fallout 76.

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So, yes, definitely looking forward to that quite a bit.

301
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Other fun stuff.

302
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They talked about PUBG's new map, which is all wintery.

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There's a new gigantic survival MMO, Atlas, that's by the people that did Ark Survival Evolved.

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There's a thing about Wizards of the Coast and pushing Magic Arena with some esports thing.

305
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They made a teaser for Dragon Age 4.

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, supposedly that game is a ways out, too.

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I expect you have questions.

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah, I suppose that game is a long way out.

309
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, it's all soulless twerking.

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah, it's a very, very light teaser.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They had another trailer for Psychonauts 2.

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They showed off a Stranger Things game that was kind of looking a little bit 16-bit.

313
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I gotta be honest, it looked kind of crap.

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Well, that's kind of the gist of the mobile phone, Stranger Things.

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's kind of like a retro style, and it's okay.

316
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
For a mobile phone game, it's okay, but it's not something I would spend a lot of money on.

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's kind of like garbage. I'm just not very interested in that.

318
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Mortal Kombat 11, so that's coming out in April.

319
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So last week's rumors came to light, apparently.

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah.

321
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That was one of the trailers. I will admit, I didn't really watch the game awards.

322
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I just forgot they were happening.

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Man, they're like, hey, it's time to vote.

324
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And then it's like a week later, the awards happen, and I always forget.

325
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Like, oh yeah, they're gonna be on.

326
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And to be honest, all the trailers just show up right there on Twitter anyway.

327
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They get retweeted, and somebody's following it and cutting the trailers as it goes.

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They just all show up online right away.

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So I saw that trailer for Mortal Kombat 11, of course.

330
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm not super big on the violent.

331
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's almost like too much now, but it looked, for what it is, it looked cool.

332
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But obviously, you were seeing a lot of pre-rendered stuff.

333
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But I imagine it's gonna look great.

334
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Mortal Kombat 10 or X or whatever, it looked great.

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So I have no reason to believe 11.

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's probably 10.

337
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Here's the thing. They actually said, they did call it Mortal Kombat X,

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
but they completely acknowledged it was a play on, you know, 10.

339
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But I think it's X because that series is extra when it comes to fighting games.

340
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's very, very extra.

341
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So yeah, 11 is going to be continuing that, you know,

342
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
rampantly violent stuff, clearly, through the trailer.

343
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
All right, cool.

344
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And then, of course, they announced that Persona 5's Joker

345
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
is gonna be the first DLC character for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

346
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So that got everybody excited because they're like, well, shit.

347
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You know, now they're really putting anybody in this game.

348
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So be curious to see what the other four fighters are gonna be.

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Didn't pick up the game, though. Thought about it.

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, that, oh, you didn't pick up Smash?

351
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You're like the one person that didn't.

352
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, like, I just bought my kids, like, four Switch games for Christmas.

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The money thing is real. I understand.

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
My wife an air fryer.

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, I know.

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And a robot vacuum cleaner.

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, maybe somebody will buy that for you for Christmas.

358
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Maybe that'll be a nice thing.

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And books and, like, all this other shit.

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So, yeah, it's been, I didn't pick it up because I didn't know if I'd get to play it.

361
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I didn't want to fight the kids for the Switch.

362
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And I know they'd play it, but, like, I don't know.

363
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Going back, I mean, we can get into a little more of that on our gaming week.

364
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But going back a little bit to the Game Awards itself.

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Obviously, the Persona Smash thing is, like, it's pretty cool.

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's cool, but, you know, also, I'm certainly, like, but they haven't put Persona on a Nintendo platform.

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There was a 3DS game.

368
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, God, that seems so obscure.

369
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I guess you're right, but that just seems like you would think, like, this is gonna motivate them to put Persona 5 on Switch.

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Master Chief.

371
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Or something you would think. I don't know.

372
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't know.

373
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know. But, oh, you think Master Chief in Smash? That's going a little far. I don't know about that.

374
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But, uh, okay. I mean, I think it's cool. Don't get me wrong.

375
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You know what? No, no, not Master Chief. We'll just put Terry Crews in Smash.

376
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Just Terry Crews.

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Just Terry Crews.

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Why not one of the Viva Pinata? There was a 3DS game for Viva Pinata.

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Fuck Viva Pinata.

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Or Minecraft Steve. That would be...

381
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, I think Minecraft Steve is very...

382
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Minecraft Steve would be way more likely than Master Chief.

383
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah, because that would be the big Microsoft, like, oh my God, but there's a ton of people that play Minecraft on Switch.

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Or is there, like, because PUBG doesn't really have any characters.

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No. Yeah, no.

386
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Or not PUBG. Fortnite.

387
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Uh, they could, but I just, yeah. I think we're going a little crazy with the Switch stuff now.

388
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Or the Smash stuff now. I think it's just, uh, you know.

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I mean, now it's like, I think what's happened is that, wait, if they can put a Persona character in Smash, they can do literally anything.

390
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So now all of these, like, fan-wank obscure, because nobody was going to predict that Persona thing. Nobody was going to predict that.

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So now it's like, literally everything is on the table.

392
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So as much as you might be laughing at, like, come on, they're not going to put Minecraft...

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But they did Persona. Anything is possible, y'all.

394
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Super Meat Boy.

395
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Why not? That'd be fun.

396
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, Shovel Knight was in the first game, right?

397
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No. There was always a Shovel Knight amiibo, and I think there was Shovel Knight Assist.

398
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But Shovel Knight was not a character, and a lot of people were pushing for indie representation in Smash, like Shovel Knight, Shantae.

399
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Remember, there was a big campaign about that.

400
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Uh, so, uh, but none of that has come to light as of yet, but again, anything's possible.

401
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
They should've just had a lot more characters in 5.

402
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sure. Oh, there'll be more. There'll be more.

403
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Anyway, uh, so you actually, admittedly, I didn't really watch the Game Awards. I don't think Jamie did either.

404
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What did you think of the bits and pieces of the actual show that you saw?

405
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Because I remember the last time I did see it, I was like...

406
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
They had, like, the orchestra stuff was really awesome.

407
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Honestly, the last time I watched it, it was like, you could do a lot worse. It really wasn't bad.

408
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It was... it's kind of like picking up the excitement for where, like, E3 may have lacked in some places, I guess.

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't know. I think it was nice to have all that stuff there, and all the announcements and everything.

410
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Uh, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

411
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf does point out Joker is in Persona Q2 for the 3DS, so he is in a Nintendo game.

412
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's... still, it's pretty, uh, pretty deep cut.

413
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Uh, Bobby also suggests the Fortnite Battle Bus in Smash.

414
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There is some type of car. I don't... I don't know what it was, but we were...

415
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So, uh, Friday night, some friends and I got together and we were playing a little bit of Smash.

416
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Somebody got a frickin' thing that looked like a pitobus showed up and started driving around the stage.

417
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And I was like, what the fuck even is that?

418
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I was like, what's the reference?

419
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like, I'm trying to catch all these deep cut gaming references.

420
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
There's some deep cut gaming references in Smash.

421
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Nintendo Labo.

422
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's my favorite part.

423
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Uh, let's see.

424
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
ActDeftInChats does point out Shovel Knight is an assist trophy and Shantae is a spirit.

425
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So they did at least do some type of nods to those games.

426
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I mean, I don't know.

427
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's something.

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And Bobby also points out there is a Labo thing in Smash.

429
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Of course there is.

430
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Of course there is.

431
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Nintendo will stop at nothing to self-promote, I'm very sure.

432
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh, it's Cap'n.

433
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, it is.

434
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
ActDeft says Cap'n from Animal Crossing has a bus in Smash as an assist.

435
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You know, his spirit stage.

436
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I just had to play that today.

437
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I can't fucking beat it.

438
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It is so annoying.

439
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
His spirit stage has a constant wind effect on it.

440
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And if you touch the water, pretty much you die.

441
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Your character drowns.

442
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
With some exceptions.

443
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The water is lava.

444
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The water is lava.

445
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So here's the thing.

446
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Here's the thing though.

447
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I know somebody in chat is about to yell this.

448
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I already know if you attach the Snorlax spirit, which is a little further down the road, you

449
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
can avoid the wind thing.

450
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It doesn't push you back as bad.

451
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But it still pushes you.

452
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And then you get, god damn it, what's that big orange bird in Yoshi?

453
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Damn it.

454
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But you get her up the road too and that completely negates the water thing.

455
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So you can actually be in the water.

456
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So, it helps.

457
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And I heard there's some characters that don't drown in the water.

458
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Right.

459
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Well, if you have those certain spirit affictions, you won't.

460
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But here's the thing.

461
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Those attachments will not suggest.

462
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Like, I was just letting the computer suggest what to use every time.

463
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But it was not picking those for me on a stage where I needed it.

464
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It kept giving me stuff where I start with a dark scythe and things like that.

465
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And then the other thing, excuse me, you kind of have to watch for is that not only do you

466
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
have the World of Light mode, but you have that other mode that will just randomly spawn

467
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
like six different, and then it starts to grow, like different spirit things you can

468
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
challenge at any time and they rotate out every five minutes.

469
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Like, don't forget about that because if you dip in there every now and then you can

470
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
grab some stuff that you can then use in the World of Light mode.

471
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So, there's that.

472
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Anyway.

473
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So, look at that.

474
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We're supposed to be having a conversation on the Game Awards and it all ended up on Smash.

475
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That's just, that's what it's going to be this week.

476
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm pretty sure any gaming show you're listening to this week is just going to lose their shit over Smash.

477
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And that's just how it is in the gaming industry this week, I suppose.

478
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So.

479
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah.

480
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Anything that you saw in the Game Award things and those trailers?

481
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Anything that really stuck out to you?

482
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I know you called out a couple of those things that looked interesting to you,

483
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
but what would you say out of all that that they showed are you really looking forward to, Logi?

484
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You know, actually the new Far Cry game, although I wonder if I'm actually going to play it

485
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
because I've seen them buy these Far Cry games and I get tired of them really fast.

486
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But, Far Cry, the new one looks pretty good.

487
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So, I'm interested in that.

488
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And then also, of course, the Outer Worlds looks awesome.

489
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Like, I would definitely pick that up.

490
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Just the world and everything seems really cool.

491
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's very much like Fallout New Vegas.

492
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Like, the vibe is just like, this is totally how we should.

493
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And what's great is they have dialogue trees like you would in the other games.

494
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And you can pick a dumb dialogue tree so that you're an idiot.

495
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And it's hilarious.

496
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Just the response is like, not everybody is...

497
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I forget.

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Just go watch the clip they posted online because it's hilarious.

499
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Just the different dialogue trees that they have there and picking the dumb option each time.

500
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's just the sarcastic option that they had in Fallout 4 or whatever.

501
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I forget what it was, but it looks awesome.

502
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I really want to play that game.

503
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Alright, cool.

504
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So, any suggestions for next year's Game Awards?

505
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because I noticed in chat at live.vongnetwork.com,

506
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Kaijuto says, Game Awards were good, just chill with all the trailers.

507
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
No, I mean, I think it was fine the way it was.

508
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I guess we'll just have to see...

509
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Some of the words are really quick.

510
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't know if we necessarily need best e-sport personality or best YouTuber or whatever.

511
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I think that's kind of...

512
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That really I don't think needs to be there, but it is.

513
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Right.

514
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Trying to give a nod to the community.

515
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Well, as far as honestly, one of the few things I did see from the whole event

516
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
was when SonicFox won that award for the best e-sports personality.

517
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And he gave a great speech that I couldn't help but sit there and just go, yes.

518
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I just thought he was awesome.

519
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So, on one hand, Loki, as much as I understand that maybe we don't need the personalities

520
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
as much in the game thing, I was like, that really was one of the best moments, at least for me.

521
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm just glad Ninja didn't win it.

522
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
He's overexposed.

523
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's overexposed.

524
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Same thing with PewDiePie.

525
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
PewDiePie's not so bad anymore.

526
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
He's not in the forefront as much.

527
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Maybe he's listened to some of the feedback he's gotten about some of his poor decisions.

528
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I would assume.

529
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I don't know.

530
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But, like...

531
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
S2100Matt says Ninja won, though.

532
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So, he must not have seen that part.

533
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Ninja's not an e-sports guy.

534
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

535
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He didn't win the e-sports thing. He did win best...

536
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

537
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Best Fortnite player.

538
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah.

539
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah.

540
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And he got it.

541
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And Tigerlaw says he only got famous because of the whole Drake thing.

542
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, you know what?

543
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Whatever. Do what you gotta do.

544
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I know. Do what you gotta do.

545
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm not gonna hate Ninja.

546
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I don't know the guy.

547
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't watch his stuff.

548
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But I do think some people are just, like, overexposed.

549
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And it doesn't make...

550
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You know, you can't help but go, ugh, again?

551
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Like, there's certain celebrities, right?

552
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You see them in a trailer and you're like, ugh, again?

553
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Tom Cruise still making movies?

554
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You know?

555
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Those types of things.

556
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't know. I can't explain it.

557
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But anyway.

558
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
S2100mattinchat says he won content provider.

559
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah, I know.

560
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Like, whatever.

561
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You know, it's fine.

562
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't have to like these people.

563
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's fine.

564
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I don't even know who he is.

565
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Or, like, I don't even watch his content.

566
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So I don't know why I would not like him in the first place.

567
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's just...

568
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Just like the stories I read.

569
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Like, I guess we're talking about, like, how he goes and, like, tries to ban different players off of Fortnite for...

570
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
He claims that they're stream sniping him, but they just may best him somehow.

571
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And so then he'll go and get them, like, perma-banned from playing Fortnite.

572
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That seems a little dickish.

573
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And that, I guess, has the impression I have of him.

574
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But I don't know.

575
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Do I fucking care?

576
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
No, I don't.

577
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Alright.

578
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, let's see.

579
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Go into our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

580
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Bobby Blackwell says,

581
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm fine with Ninja.

582
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I've seen some of the interviews he's given outside of our gaming realm.

583
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And he's pretty much the face we need right now.

584
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
He says all the right things to the right people in the right language.

585
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Like his CNBC or MSNBC interview right after the Drake thing.

586
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Akuma JP says,

587
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I dislike Ninja character, though.

588
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The way he looked down to other people.

589
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Alright.

590
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Anyway, let's move on from the Game Awards.

591
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah.

592
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I need to thank Akuma JP, by the way.

593
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, me too.

594
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Because Dan super loved his present.

595
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Oh, yeah, because you haven't been here for a little bit.

596
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So Dan had a birthday while you were out.

597
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And you had Akuma JP kind of help you with some shenanigans, right?

598
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So Dan's birthday present this year was Red Dead Redemption 2 Special Edition.

599
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box for PS2.

600
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn, thanks to Akuma JP.

601
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And Dan was absolutely thrilled.

602
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So thank you for helping me make my husband's birthday a success.

603
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Well, why do we transition from that into our gaming weeks?

604
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Because after all, this is the part of the show where we talk about the types of video games we've been playing this week.

605
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So I imagine maybe some playing of that around the Summers household.

606
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Well, of course, there's been a lot of Red Dead Redemption 2.

607
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
We also picked up, well, by we, I mean I braved the crowds.

608
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Picked up Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

609
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And it's been really fun.

610
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Dan's actually been tackling the unlocking while I've been at work.

611
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And we got a new pinball.

612
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We got Monopoly, Stern's Monopoly.

613
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And apparently it was a home use only machine.

614
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It hasn't touched an arcade.

615
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It is in glorious condition.

616
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Just needs a little bit of cleanup.

617
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And that's really been the major gaming that's been happening in my house.

618
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Cool.

619
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Alright, then we'll move right on over to Loki.

620
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
How was your gaming week?

621
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I played a few things this week.

622
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So I finished, like I've gotten to a point now in Pokemon Let's Go.

623
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I think I am basically done with the game.

624
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I finished the game.

625
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I beat all the Final Four or whatever with my, you know,

626
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Uber level Pikachu that basically just single handedly took down the whole Final Four or Elite Four or whatever.

627
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And then I beat them again.

628
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And then I guess you can go back and fight, like refight the other gyms as well if you want to.

629
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Now you've got to the point where you have to fight the different Pokemon masters.

630
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
They're masters of like Pikachu and all these other like things.

631
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So you have to have basically the same Pokemon as them and you fight them.

632
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And it's a hassle. I don't want to do it.

633
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So I don't really know if, I think I'm kind of done with the game at this point.

634
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
My Pokedex isn't filled up all the way, but it could be if I just transport a few other things.

635
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
In fact, I got to do that because I got to, you know, unlock my stupid Meltan.

636
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I have to keep putting new Pokemon into the Pokemon Go park.

637
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And do all that crap.

638
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So I'll probably still play it.

639
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I've been occasionally swapping Pokemon out into the, oh, and I caught Mewtwo.

640
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So I've caught everything in the game, all the like legendaries and stuff.

641
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They make a vaccine for that, you know.

642
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yes.

643
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So I've caught all the legendaries in the game and I don't know.

644
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm kind of getting like bored with it, I guess.

645
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But it's alright. It's an okay game.

646
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I just, I don't really want to grind just to like beat all of the Pokemon masters because why?

647
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't know. There's not really any more story left in the game.

648
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Like once you've got the Go park and you're getting your Meltan boxes, it's kind of like,

649
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
well, there's not, except just the incentive of I beat a fucking Pokemon game.

650
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, I beat a Pokemon game. It was good.

651
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I mean, I like the story of it and everything and I would like to, you know, play through more of them and stuff.

652
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But I just, eh, I don't know if I really want to play like the end end game that they have here.

653
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
There's not really, maybe like they'll add stuff to it later on.

654
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But right now it's like there's not a whole lot in the incentive for me to,

655
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
let's go capture a ton of Pokemon so we can get some candies to level up like a stupid Oddish

656
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
so that I can become the Oddish master.

657
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And who gives a shit about that? No one does.

658
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So I don't know. Or, oh, let's say try to chain catch 31 of these things

659
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and just keep trying to catch the same Pokemon until we find a shiny.

660
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That doesn't really sound like my sort of fun.

661
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Shane would be into that.

662
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I just, I just don't want to do it right now.

663
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I have more, you know, I have other games I could be playing.

664
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You know, Red Dead Redemption 2 or, fuck, I could, there's so many games.

665
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Dude, the horses poop.

666
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Huh?

667
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The horses poop.

668
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah. Horses do poop.

669
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I mean, in the game, I thought it was cool.

670
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yes, they, they're ultra realistic.

671
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And then their balls shrink.

672
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yes.

673
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Um, and then what else?

674
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So I was at the store this week and so I got to try out one of those arcade, one up arcade cabinets.

675
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So I played some, um, Missile Command and Crystal Castles.

676
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And, you know, really, I hate track balls, but track ball controls work pretty good on those games.

677
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So I'm not complaining there.

678
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That actually worked.

679
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It's a pretty good use case right there.

680
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Um, so I tried those out and then what else?

681
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I did more Pokemon Go.

682
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I played some of that.

683
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Um, gosh, I don't know.

684
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Uh, Dance Dance Revolution Euro Mix 2, as I mentioned, I've been playing that this week.

685
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I've been kind of swapping through some of the different mixes I can put on the cabinet.

686
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm kind of getting tired of all of them.

687
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Um, I'm probably, I'm really leaning towards a step mania cabinet cause it's going to be,

688
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
you know, a lot easier to add new songs to it, to keep everything fresh and interesting

689
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
because it's, it's hard like playing like the old, the same old songs.

690
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Once again, I thought Euro Mix 2 be more of a draw because not a lot of people have seen

691
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
a Euro Mix 2 machine in action.

692
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I know, certainly I haven't.

693
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So, um, well, I imagine a lot of people in Europe have, well, yes, they probably, this

694
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
is a worldwide show.

695
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
They had to deal with some bullshit that really they shouldn't have had to deal with.

696
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And now you feel so, like we have to go back.

697
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Remember, we talk a lot about DDR on this show.

698
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Loki's having his Renaissance, his midlife crisis with DDR because this was the stuff

699
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
that we, Orange Launch Radio is here because of DDR.

700
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Orange Lounge is a band in DDR.

701
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Dude, I completely forgot about like, did you know DDR Max had no difficulties in it?

702
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Like I didn't like completely forgot about that.

703
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm like, what?

704
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
There was no difficulties on there?

705
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Like they had no like indicator of what song was difficult.

706
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Oh yeah, because it was, it was just that little, it was that little chart.

707
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
They never had the feet.

708
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It was just that little chart.

709
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Like I'm like, I completely forgot that was a thing.

710
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
How did we know that this was this difficult?

711
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Did we just make that shit up?

712
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Because when Max 2 came out, everything kind of got retconned.

713
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Well, maybe the home versions also had that shit, but like I just completely forgot.

714
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And also my copy of, cause I'm using a super disk.

715
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I obviously don't have a legit Euro Mix 2 in my system, but, uh, it doesn't have any

716
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
of the background videos, which is fine.

717
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I mean, it's kind of actually makes it easier to play certain things.

718
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Also, it seems like they half assed half of the steps of the game because half of the

719
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
steps that are in there for their new license songs don't have free zeros.

720
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They just don't have them.

721
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Not actually play it.

722
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Not good.

723
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
They should have that shit in there.

724
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You can always turn them off if you don't like them.

725
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Right, exactly.

726
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But like, Oh, there's only one song they ran across actually had it.

727
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And it's funny when you do run across the song, it does have it.

728
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It gives you the free zero warning thing, tells you what they are and stuff, which is

729
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
so weird.

730
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Um, so they have that.

731
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And then what else?

732
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Um, so I'll probably switch it up again.

733
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Um, I may end up do, I think I might move to Disney's rave or, um, fifth mix.

734
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Fifth mix will be fun, but Disney's rave, I think it would be fun for a day.

735
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And you're gonna be like, why, why did I do that?

736
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Um, I still do want to come over.

737
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's going to get a little crazy now.

738
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Cause this week, obviously with the changes around here, I got to make sure we're set

739
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and ready to go for that.

740
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Uh, next week, uh, I don't want to say too much about it on air cause I don't know if

741
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm doing it yet, but I might go on the most random fricking trip in the middle of the

742
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
week.

743
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
If I can swing the time.

744
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You're going to Albuquerque.

745
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I I'll tell you in chat.

746
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't want to say until I know I'm going, cause it is literally a random thing.

747
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Uh, but soon I'm hoping to come over.

748
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Right.

749
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And it's great cause you can install new mixes in about 15 minutes.

750
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So it's, it's not a big deal.

751
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Uh, that's why I was like, eh, I'm just going to, I'm taking off fourth plus here.

752
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Um, which I mean, ideally fourth plus is a great mix.

753
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's just, I don't know.

754
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I miss having all those modifies in there cause some of those fourth mix, um, step charts

755
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
are just some weird shit and you really need to have like that spacing in there to be able

756
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
to read it.

757
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And I need to get better just reading charts.

758
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's just really hard.

759
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But, um, so yeah, so that's, that's what I've been doing.

760
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Um, and uh, now this week I have Katamari, so I'll probably be playing some more Katamari.

761
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I also did not buy Earth Defense Force Five because the review has been kind of okay on

762
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
that, but, and I'll probably wait for a sale on that.

763
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I don't know.

764
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
We'll see.

765
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So I don't know.

766
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I could be playing some more new songs, but I'm waiting because, or new games, but I had

767
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
to play the old games too.

768
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, and Just Cause 4.

769
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I need to pick up Just Cause 4 and so many things.

770
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Anyways, that's it.

771
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
All right.

772
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well, let me talk about my gaming week a little bit.

773
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Um, so I've been playing a lot of Smash, just like I'm sure a ton of people have.

774
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Uh, I really am enjoying this Smash game.

775
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Uh, it's, it's probably my favorite so far, but it's easy to say that because I don't

776
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
get into all the technicalities like some tournament players do and all that.

777
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
All I go is that it's pretty and there's a lot of people and there's so many modes and

778
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
this is the best one yet.

779
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And, and honestly, I think that's good enough in some ways.

780
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Uh, so I'm just, I'm having a good time playing it.

781
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The unlocking thing is a little weird.

782
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's a little weird how you only start with eight people.

783
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And so like when I took my Switch over to a house party thing Friday night, cause we

784
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
played some card games.

785
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I know I don't talk a lot about card games on this show, but I played an old school card

786
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
game called Phase 10.

787
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm sure that's a, it's like the same people who do it.

788
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And then we, we played that and then we played a game called Saboteur, which is like, you're

789
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
using cards to build caves and like somebody's lying about it.

790
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So, and these are all people that I met playing these online, like Survivor, Big Brother.

791
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So they're all great liars cause that's, you know, what you do in those games.

792
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Phase 10 destroys friendships.

793
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah.

794
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So we played friend destroying games and then, uh, we played Smash Brothers a little bit

795
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
too, but it was weird because it was like, okay guys, I have the basic eight characters

796
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and Ness.

797
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
That's it.

798
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Like I don't have any other characters so far.

799
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So we kind of, but the good news is, I mean, we were able to unlock some, but the funniest

800
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
fucking thing happened.

801
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So, uh, one of my pals, Curtis, um, he, he only wants to play pit.

802
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Like that's like his favorite character, right?

803
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
He only, so the fact that pit's not in the game, he's like, whatever, I don't care.

804
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well, pit shows up.

805
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So we're playing for like 20 minutes and pit shows up, a new challenger approaches.

806
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And so one of my friends hands me the controller says, you need to do it Rob, cause I'm going

807
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to fuck this up.

808
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And I was like, okay.

809
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So I take the controller and it goes match start and I just start moving to the left

810
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and I fall right off the cliff and die because I forgot that she was playing player one and

811
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I was playing like player four.

812
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So I didn't want to go to the left cause that is going to walk right off the edge.

813
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So anyway, and Curtis is watching me and of course he's already had a bit to drink.

814
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
We're already hyped up because we've been playing saboteur.

815
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
We've been yelling at each other all night and he's like, you did that on purpose.

816
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You bleeped and did that on purpose.

817
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You, you like trying to, so it was just, it was really funny, but I didn't realize this

818
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
until later.

819
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It was my pal Delvin who does his streaming at VG realness, cheap plug.

820
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Um, but he actually told me that if you go into the blue menu, the games and more menu,

821
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
there's actually an icon that'll appear there.

822
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It looks like a little door.

823
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It lets you redo any of the fights.

824
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So I found that out like after I got home Friday night and then I was able to unlock

825
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
pit easy.

826
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So, um, that tip saved my life.

827
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So if you didn't already know about that, that you can re challenge anybody in that

828
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
blue games and more menu with a little door icon, you can, and if you lose to them again,

829
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
it's okay.

830
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
They'll, the door icon goes away, but it will come back after like 10 or 15 minutes.

831
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So, and I know tons of people are cheesing it with the unlocks.

832
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That's just, that's just not how I'm going to do it.

833
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's fine.

834
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I've already unlocked like 25 people, just the normal way.

835
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I just got Simon before the show tonight.

836
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I kind of, yeah, I do want to play the game.

837
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I think it'll be fun.

838
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's just, I don't know.

839
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Maybe I have to get paid.

840
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I feel like at some point, um, there's going to be like a code that'll just unlock everything

841
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
like an up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right type of code.

842
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That'll just unlock everything.

843
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Cause it is weird that like, you know, people are going to have tournaments and it's like

844
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
either somebody has to loan their copy of smash brothers or what are you going to do?

845
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You're not going to be able to unlock everything for a tournament right away.

846
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So I feel like they're going to put out a code at some point, um, to let people do it.

847
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It could also be something they patch into the game later on too, because obviously if

848
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
there's a code, someone's going to find it.

849
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It is weird too, that there's just the whole double unlock thing.

850
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
You know what I mean?

851
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Because, and I say that because not only do you unlock in the regular smash mode, but

852
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
then you have your world of light, which is the single player mode and you only get Kirby

853
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
in that mode to start.

854
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That's it.

855
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You have Kirby and nobody but Kirby, which if you're act deaf is not a problem.

856
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And it forced me to learn to play Kirby who actually, actually now I will say this is

857
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
like the best character.

858
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I act.

859
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah.

860
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Like I am.

861
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I've always been like a nest guy, a pit guy, but now I'm like, okay, well thanks to world

862
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
of light.

863
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I kind of had to fucking teach myself how to play Kirby.

864
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Uh, I'm cheap as fuck.

865
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Just doing that up B move all the time.

866
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The slice thing.

867
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But Hey, you know what y'all are sucking on link for a bit.

868
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Fuck it.

869
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Hey, Oh, um, it works.

870
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Phrasing.

871
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
We're phrasing.

872
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Um, it works on purpose.

873
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So anyway, uh, act depth and chat says tier list be damned.

874
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You know what?

875
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm going to co-sign with that because honestly my favorite character in Wii U smash was Pac-Man

876
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and he's always on like the trash tier.

877
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I don't give a fuck about your tier list.

878
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I want to play Pac-Man.

879
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
He's fun.

880
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Done.

881
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Some of the stages by the way are so good.

882
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Like, have you looked at some of the stages in this new smash?

883
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Like, I guess it brings back stuff from the 3DS and all the other games, but there's,

884
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I love the retro stuff re-imagined.

885
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
They do such a good job with like, there's one that's just straight up, like a remake

886
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
of world one, one from super Mario brothers and the whole level scrolls as you play it.

887
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I think that was in an older game.

888
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I know the Picto chat one was in an older game.

889
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Those are still fun to play, but like they've just, they've just got some crazy.

890
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
They need to update the Picto chat one with all penis drawings.

891
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't think they're going to do that.

892
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
They're not going to do that.

893
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
They totally need to do it.

894
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Bobby Blackwell said there are peni in the Picto chat stage.

895
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I don't know if he's making it up, but no, he says already there.

896
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Hmm.

897
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Uh, what they need to do actually instead of Picto chat is they need to do,

898
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
what was the other one that was, uh, for cat pictures?

899
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That was the, uh, swap note.

900
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yeah.

901
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
They need to do a swap note stage with all cat pictures.

902
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yes.

903
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yes.

904
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh my God.

905
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Anyway, so I'm, I'm loving smash and you know what?

906
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm going to play more of it.

907
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And honestly, that is pretty much all I played this weekend.

908
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Those card games and smash.

909
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And then the rest of my week I played a little bit of wow.

910
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
A little bit of final fantasy.

911
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm still juggling two MMOs.

912
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't know how I do it.

913
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Did you know dark Sakura?

914
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I have a one 20 Alliance and a one 20 hoard and like my Alliance.

915
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Thanks to Delvin.

916
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I've been, I've been working.

917
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Like he's been pity running me through some mythics and I've got some decent

918
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
gear.

919
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Well, clearly those are clouds, Bobby.

920
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I mean, I'll play you there.

921
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That's one jagged penis.

922
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
All right.

923
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Anyway, Bobby's linking and chat pictures of things that may or may not be a

924
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
penis and picked up chat.

925
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It looked like noses shooting lightning time to penis.

926
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
All right.

927
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Anyway, that's it for my gaming week.

928
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So a housekeeping.

929
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So I will.

930
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So we're, we're not taking any shows off for the holidays.

931
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We're still going to be here over the next few weeks.

932
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So as I mentioned earlier,

933
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
and as I've been saying ad nauseum the past couple of weeks next week,

934
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
fingers and toes crossed.

935
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I, I, I'm not definitively saying it will happen.

936
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You'll see a go or no go on Twitter around Friday.

937
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I may not be here on the 30th.

938
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Damn it.

939
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Damn it.

940
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Sorry.

941
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
All right.

942
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's important.

943
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I have this.

944
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm visiting my dad before he moves to Texas for good.

945
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm sorry.

946
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Well then if Jamie can't be here,

947
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
there may not be a show that night or we're going to have to do it in

948
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
advance.

949
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
That's fine too.

950
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Um, so, but anyway, well that's even more the reason why I really hope this

951
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
week.

952
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
We'll see.

953
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
We're doing it early in the day.

954
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So I don't want to, I don't want to keep you from family stuff.

955
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
None of us do.

956
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So yeah, you just go to spend time with dad.

957
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So anyway, uh, next week, uh,

958
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
hopefully assuming everything in on the tech side is ready to go.

959
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We still have shout cast set up as a fallback and we may use it,

960
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
but we will be doing our first show live on Twitch on Sunday night.

961
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
We do video and everything.

962
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It's going to do video and everything.

963
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Don't don't expect the world.

964
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yeah.

965
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
The world I'm expecting it.

966
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Does that mean I'm going to have to start breaking out the wig of the

967
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
week?

968
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah.

969
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You don't need to break out the wig.

970
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You look fabulous.

971
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Thank you girl.

972
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yes.

973
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
She does look fabulous.

974
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You can wear whatever the hell you want.

975
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
The best idea I heard for you,

976
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and I don't even remember if you were there,

977
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
if this was something I was talking about online with somebody,

978
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
but the best idea I heard from you for,

979
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
for how to do you if you are feeling a little camera shy,

980
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
which you have every right to be online because men are trash,

981
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
but you look great.

982
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And I think all of our listeners that we've built up over the years,

983
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
as well as myself, as well as Loki,

984
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
we would fight anyone that tried to come for you.

985
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
You know that you know that giant hat,

986
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
but I'd cut a bitch too.

987
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Well, I loved your SIA idea.

988
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yeah.

989
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So that was the, where the wig thing came from.

990
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah. I love that.

991
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I ordered like all these wigs on wish.

992
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And actually I got a duplicate of the one with the stupid Navy blue roots.

993
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I honestly thought she said wigs on wigs.

994
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I could do that.

995
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Wigs.com for all your wig needs.

996
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Anyway,

997
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I was just thinking wigs.com.

998
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I was just thinking wigs.com.

999
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The secret to a successful OLR? Wig water.

1000
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Anyway, but here's the thing, Darsagra.

1001
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
My favorite idea was that you would be just off to the side

1002
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and you would have a special hand on.

1003
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So you would look like Dr. Claw off to the side.

1004
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That was my favorite.

1005
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I need Ms. Smooshy here to pet.

1006
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
How to handle Jamie if she's camera shy is to do the Dr. Claw thing.

1007
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
How about that?

1008
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Can we set that up?

1009
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We'll see.

1010
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
All right.

1011
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1012
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Bonds006 says, so start a GoFundMe for your wigs.

1013
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Tigerclaw on chat says, you gotta do that if people would pay.

1014
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You guys are going to have to wear a lot of makeup while you're at it.

1015
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You got to look to your best.

1016
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay.

1017
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
There's no amount of makeup that's going to help me.

1018
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You're lucky I'm going to put on pants.

1019
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I cut my hair and shaved today.

1020
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So that even though the camera's not here.

1021
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah, I don't like honest to God.

1022
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
No, look, I understand that makeup when you do certain things is important.

1023
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But for the purposes of OLR, you are lucky if I wear pants.

1024
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I wear enough makeup for everyone.

1025
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
All right.

1026
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm going to be all up in that drag.

1027
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But seriously though, like I'm not like as camera shy as I used to be.

1028
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I was really kind of self-conscious for a bit,

1029
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
but I don't mind now as long as I'm not like, you know,

1030
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
about to do the sneeze face.

1031
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Well, the good news is I think you're in a lot of good company over on Twitch too.

1032
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
There's a lot of women, there's a lot of, you know, different types,

1033
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
different sizes, different colors.

1034
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
There's a lot of just wonderful people on Twitch streaming that have normalized

1035
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
it I think a lot more that it's not just white bros doing streaming on Twitch.

1036
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You know what I mean?

1037
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Like it's the good news is there is a more diverse community.

1038
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I know I am pretty white.

1039
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Hey look, hey look, hey look.

1040
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
There's just because somebody says diversity doesn't mean they're saying

1041
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
get rid of everybody else.

1042
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I know, I know.

1043
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

1044
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I'm also wearing though like my new shirt for today.

1045
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Are we going to do a tacky, a sweater episode?

1046
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Oh, you're not going to be here the rest of the month.

1047
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
No, it's not tacky.

1048
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It's not tacky.

1049
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's my Dilbert Sonomori GameCube shirt.

1050
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I will wear it for, so December 23rd, I think is a show night.

1051
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Let's do a tacky Christmas sweater night for Twitch.

1052
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't have a tacky Christmas sweater.

1053
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I will borrow one from Alan then.

1054
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I refuse to wear anything related to Christmas.

1055
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
All right.

1056
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
What do you guys think? Tacky, tacky Christmas?

1057
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
If they mark down the Hanukkah sweaters at Target, I'll buy one.

1058
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Even though Hanukkah is like ending after tonight.

1059
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Do they sell a tingle sweater?

1060
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Oh my God, perfect.

1061
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You know what?

1062
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Let me internet this.

1063
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Anyway, Vaga Network is our Twitch channel.

1064
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Please go ahead and go over there, subscribe and catch Bobby Black Wolf.

1065
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
We'll also be making the transition with us pretty soon.

1066
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I don't know if they're doing it the first week,

1067
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
but pretty soon after in the next couple of weeks,

1068
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Anime Jam Session will also be joining on the Twitch bandwagon.

1069
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So that's really exciting.

1070
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And you can stay tuned to all of that over at Vaga Network.

1071
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
We'll either be hosting Who's Live,

1072
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
or we're still going to be a network of promoting each other

1073
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
and helping each other and just getting more voices out there.

1074
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So that's what the plan is to do.

1075
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I want to add something in relation to Ranma.

1076
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm super proud that you're using the Hebrew hammer

1077
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
as your Facebook cover picture.

1078
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Bobby Black Wolf says,

1079
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I have an ugly sweater that's gaming related.

1080
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I can wear that on the 23rd.

1081
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
There you go. So Bobby's in for ugly sweater night. I'm with it.

1082
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says,

1083
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Cats on my head is a streamer speed runner

1084
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
that wears a cat thing on her head.

1085
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So you would not be the first to do the...

1086
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But not a real cat because I mean,

1087
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I'm a little bit let down if that's your name.

1088
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And you don't have a real cat on your head.

1089
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The only way we're going to get people to tune in on Twitch

1090
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
is for me to promise that Mr. Smoosh might show up.

1091
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
He will.

1092
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Loki, let's be real.

1093
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
They don't give a shit about you or me.

1094
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
They don't really care what Jamie looks like at the end of the day.

1095
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
They only want to see the cat.

1096
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That's what it is.

1097
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Show us your pussy.

1098
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
This is the internet.

1099
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Your loud, screamy pussy.

1100
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Alright, anyway.

1101
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Let's move on.

1102
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Let's get into some news.

1103
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
The news of the week.

1104
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
There's a lot going on.

1105
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Including a follow up to last week.

1106
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Sort of, right, Loki?

1107
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yeah, so the whole trash bags...

1108
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Should I queue up the Betty Hill theme?

1109
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
No.

1110
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Maybe the shade sound.

1111
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So as we talked about the Fallout 76 collector's edition that they did.

1112
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The $200 one.

1113
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So unfortunately they had sent out originally these nylon bags that were just garbage.

1114
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And people were pissed off because not only did they not get what they were promised.

1115
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Then Bethesda said, oh hey, we'll give you $5 in in-game crap currency.

1116
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And then also we're also going to actually have these canvas backpacks that we'll give out to our influencers instead.

1117
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Even though you did pay $200.

1118
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Well, they decided, hey, we are actually going to send out replacements.

1119
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So please go to our website and file a ticket to get a replacement bag sent to us.

1120
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And we're like, oh finally, they're doing something right.

1121
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Thank god they're actually not Bethesda-ing this up.

1122
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And then they Bethesda the crap out of it by their Bethesda support page leaking Fallout 76 customer names, addresses, and phone numbers.

1123
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
So what was happening is people were logging into their support ticket and they could view everybody's support ticket because that's how websites work.

1124
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So apparently there was an issue where they were able to see other people's information.

1125
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Including their purchase information, whatever they've scanned and uploaded into it.

1126
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Screenshots, names, addresses, and whatnot.

1127
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Bethesda said, of course, that they had fixed the issue.

1128
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
They basically said, hey guys, we resolved the issue.

1129
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,000
No apologies or anything, but they resolved the issue.

1130
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
But they still fucked that up too.

1131
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Because, of course, they did.

1132
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
If I am a lawyer right now that has Bethesda in my sights, I am having the best holiday season.

1133
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
By the way, since this didn't make our show roll, but I saw a video about it today.

1134
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So last week we talked about how, hey, we're going to fix some of these problems that you guys have and we're going to patch the game to make it better.

1135
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So that you guys can enjoy it and it's not so buggy and shitty and stuff like that.

1136
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So guess what came along with that very first patch that they put out.

1137
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So the very first patch that they were doing, one of the things they were trying to fix was this zero health glitch or whatever.

1138
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Where people would basically be indestructible and you couldn't kill them.

1139
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So you would have to basically restart the game if you encountered that.

1140
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Because basically the health would come back and they would just be a bullet sponge.

1141
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Well, they didn't fix that and they also patched in stuff to rebalance the game to make it even grindier.

1142
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So they reduced the amount of the different power cells that they have in there.

1143
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
They reduced the amount that those lasted and they also made it harder to harvest that stuff among other things.

1144
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So while patching the game to fix some of these bugs, they're also patching it to make it more grindy.

1145
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So that you want to use their in-game money to speed the game up.

1146
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Just fuck this company. I mean, seriously.

1147
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
How about they go eat a pile of dicks?

1148
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I can't.

1149
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It's garbage. I'm not even touching this hot garbage at all.

1150
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I didn't really have a lot of interest in Fallout 76 to begin with.

1151
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
But now my interest is at a negative one.

1152
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
My interest is down in the base. I feel bad for Fallout fans. I really do.

1153
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
But at the same time, I'm going to do a special message.

1154
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And Jamie, maybe you can join me in this.

1155
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:21,000
A special message from me, a Mass Effect fan who survived Andromeda, to you, a Fallout fan who will survive Fallout 76.

1156
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It'll be okay.

1157
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I gotta tell you this much. I watched that new...

1158
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
They had a new Anthem trailer that was during the game awards.

1159
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I don't fucking care about the game at all now.

1160
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I didn't care about it much to begin with, but I just like...

1161
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
This is fucking Destiny. I don't want to play this.

1162
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So you know they had like a super secret beta over the weekend, right?

1163
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm not in it, but I'm pretty connected. I know people that are.

1164
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It's not our secret if we know about it.

1165
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
There's an NDA. That's why people aren't talking about it.

1166
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And I don't know if you heard, but EA is taking it very seriously.

1167
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Somebody streamed it and they freaking banned the guy from Origin or something like that.

1168
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
They're taking it very seriously.

1169
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So not a lot getting out there about what's going on.

1170
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But should I say it? Because I have some tea.

1171
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You ready for some tea?

1172
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Now obviously I cannot tell you.

1173
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I cannot tell you where I'm getting this.

1174
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Hold on. I'm looking.

1175
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Because where was it?

1176
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Okay.

1177
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Here's my review of Anthem Alpha.

1178
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I'm sad we aren't ever going to get that Dragon Age game they teased.

1179
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Because BioWare won't be around.

1180
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Ooh, girl.

1181
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
That was a text message I got earlier today, but I ain't telling you from who.

1182
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
That's sad.

1183
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
But hey, Outer Worlds.

1184
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It looks like that's going to be a game that's by the original Fallout people.

1185
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
When Fallout was good.

1186
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So maybe there's hope.

1187
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Maybe Fallout's not going to be necessarily your game, but it'll live on as a spiritual successor.

1188
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Alright, anyway. Let's move on.

1189
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:06,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, CHILD.

1190
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Going to the next...

1191
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I don't know.

1192
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It could be just dramatic.

1193
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
People being dramatic on the internet, hyperbole.

1194
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
No, seriously though.

1195
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
If it doesn't end up being a runaway success, I think that EA will close them down.

1196
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
That's just because that's their MO.

1197
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I think as much as there is over-the-topness and extra-ness sometimes.

1198
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And again, that is one review.

1199
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And it's an early build.

1200
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
So I think that's a fair thing to just acknowledge.

1201
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Don't make your final decisions off of an anonymous message I just read.

1202
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Bobby Blacko says, Rob's friends being dramatic.

1203
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
TigerClanChat says, will Anthem be the downfall of Bioware?

1204
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Let's hope not, because I would like to see that Dragon Age game, and I would like to see a Mass Effect game.

1205
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But I do think there is a lot of money being invested in this, and there's a lot riding on this game.

1206
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't think Bioware or EA can afford to make the same mistakes they made with Andromeda.

1207
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So maybe that's part of the reason they're doing this, to get some of that now.

1208
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Because maybe they'll end up delaying the game again, if it is a mess.

1209
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Dragon Age games have been pretty good so far.

1210
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I need to go back and play the last one. I had the last one.

1211
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Inquisition was great.

1212
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And so the new Dragon Age sounds cool.

1213
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And you know what sucks? I don't necessarily blame them.

1214
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:39,000
And that's unfortunate, though. It's the bad decisions by higher-ups end up when the game does poorly because of their shitty decisions.

1215
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And the dev teams actually take the brunt of it. It's annoying.

1216
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
But that's just EA's fucking M.O., unfortunately.

1217
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,000
We've lost many great studios because of stupid EA, so what are you gonna do?

1218
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Those talented people will find homes elsewhere, and you will get spiritually successor games, much like this new one. I don't know.

1219
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Alright. Anyway, moving on. Let's talk about Doom.

1220
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Did you know Doom turned 25? Doom is now 25 years old.

1221
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And that makes me feel old, because I remember when Doom first came to me.

1222
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I remember calling BBSs to play Doom 2 multiplayer.

1223
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Remember, I could never get Doom to run on my PC, because I only had four megs of RAM.

1224
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And even though you needed four megs of RAM to run it, you could never allocate quite enough using your config.sys file.

1225
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I had Doom in black and white for Mac Classic.

1226
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Oh, that's awesome. I didn't even know they made a black and white version. That's rad.

1227
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
There were some great black and white Mac games back in the day. My favorite was always Crystal Quest.

1228
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Because they did it on 360, they did an arcade version of it.

1229
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I think so.

1230
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And there was one call, I think the Dark Castle.

1231
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I was going to Tetris.

1232
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Oh yeah, Tetris. Anyway.

1233
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
But anyway, this isn't about just Mac games, because Doom was huge on PC as well.

1234
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
December 10th, so the actual anniversary is tomorrow, which honestly will be the day most people listen to this on the podcast.

1235
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Anyway, that's the day it turns 25 years old on December 10th.

1236
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
John Romero will be hopefully revealing something new that day.

1237
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Romero Games is going to announce pre-orders for a project that John Romero just completed.

1238
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That was an email that went out from Romero Games.

1239
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You can follow it on his Twitter, at The Romero, where there are some hints.

1240
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Some people are thinking it could be Black Room is the project that he's been working on.

1241
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So I'm assuming we would see a little bit more about that tomorrow.

1242
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So, there you go.

1243
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
But I'm wondering, you know, obviously we don't know what this project is.

1244
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
We weren't going to know until tomorrow, so we can't speculate too much more.

1245
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But I'm just curious, what do you think about Doom all these years later?

1246
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Do you think Doom is an important game in gaming's history?

1247
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Or where do you think Doom kind of stands for you?

1248
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Yeah, absolutely. It's an important game.

1249
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It helped launch the whole FPS genre.

1250
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I mean, that and Quake, it was one of the pillars of these modern games.

1251
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Yeah, I think a game like Overwatch owes a lot to something like Doom.

1252
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I mean, sure, Overwatch draws from other places as well, as well as Blizzard's own perspective.

1253
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I'm not saying they're just ripoffs, but I think there's so much that, you know, certainly Doom really pushed forward.

1254
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And especially, you know, remember the other, ID Software was kind of really the king of those 3D games back in the day.

1255
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And that movement from Wolfenstein, which was its own amazing, you know, game.

1256
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
But really, Wolfenstein was a 2D game in a 3D space, right?

1257
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Doom was a 3D game in a 3D space, where you started to have the elevation.

1258
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You had walls that weren't just square.

1259
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
You had maps that, you know, were in different shapes.

1260
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Like, Doom really was, like, that pushed forward.

1261
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Yeah, I mean, I remember it was a CompUSA.

1262
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
We had saw, like, Wolfenstein 3D being played on a PC.

1263
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And just, like, just a group of people around going like,

1264
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Holy crap, you know, this looks amazing.

1265
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Back in the day when shareware.

1266
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I fucking love shareware. It was great.

1267
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You'd go to a store, you'd buy a Wolfenstein 3D disc for, like, two bucks.

1268
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Or, like, some dirt cheap. You know, I'd buy a ton of those shareware discs.

1269
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Well, because you could only pay because they couldn't charge you for the shareware, but they could charge you for the disc.

1270
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
That's what it was.

1271
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1272
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
They had copies of it, and it was great.

1273
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Because, like, I'd pick up all these games, and if I liked them, cool.

1274
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I could send my money away, you know, for, you know, the full game.

1275
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Or, you know, wait until the BBS had the pirate, you know, that type of stuff.

1276
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
But, um, it was a great way to do it.

1277
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And I remember they had Doom was, like, you know, on those discs as well one time, and I knew.

1278
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I remember being connected to a BBS for, like, an hour and a half just to download Doom.

1279
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Like, for real. Like, it's just, yeah.

1280
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Man, I miss the BBS community. Those were the days.

1281
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Old Man Alert. Let's see, Bonds006 says, Doom is the granddaddy of SPSs.

1282
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Tigerclaw says, Doom is definitely an important game in history.

1283
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
The same as how Castle Wolfenstein is an important game, even though that was the first FPS game.

1284
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And, let's see, Bonds006 says, Doom, Unreal, Half-Life, WS, Wolfenstein, Counter-Strike.

1285
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Those games will never grow old to me.

1286
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So, yeah. It's important stuff, for sure.

1287
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Well, and then, like, Quake didn't come out that much longer after that,

1288
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
so I'm thinking we're gonna be coming up on the 25th anniversary of Quake as well, right?

1289
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Because that wasn't much later.

1290
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Um, yeah. Quake wasn't much later. Quake was probably, what, like, nine months later, maybe?

1291
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Maybe a year.

1292
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It was probably a few years later.

1293
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Maybe. They'll do something really big for Quake, I'm sure.

1294
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Yeah.

1295
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Must be.

1296
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,000
All right. Anyway, let's move on to the next story, Dark Sakura.

1297
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Wheel.

1298
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I'm sure we are all familiar with Hajime Tabata, who was the Final Fantasy XV director.

1299
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Well, he told Squenix to bite his butt. I'm kidding.

1300
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
He actually left the position as a studio head of Luminous Production on October 31st,

1301
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and he is starting a company called JP Games.

1302
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Unquote says, um,

1303
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I started up my own company called JP Games, Inc.

1304
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Right now, we are preparing for a target January 2019 launch.

1305
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And to everyone who has assisted me until today, I kindly ask for your ongoing support.

1306
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So, there's no more information than that, but we'll see what happens.

1307
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
All right.

1308
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Um, yeah, I mean, very interesting after that whole, uh,

1309
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
him just kind of suddenly leaving Square after Final Fantasy XV was apparently losing money.

1310
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But, you know, wish him well.

1311
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
You know, I think a lot went into that that is not necessarily dude's fault.

1312
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
So, I wish him well and see what creative...

1313
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Sometimes, like, from Ashes...

1314
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And I wouldn't even call Final Fantasy XV, like, a disaster.

1315
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Like, it was a fine game.

1316
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It was a fine game.

1317
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
But, you know, with the financials or whatever, perhaps not turning around the way they wanted,

1318
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and maybe the DLC just kind of went on a little bit too long.

1319
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I think maybe that planning that went into that is kind of where things went wrong.

1320
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
You know, maybe something will rise up from the ashes, right?

1321
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You know, can flop designers make a great game later?

1322
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I'm not calling this guy a flop designer, but we've seen that, right?

1323
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
You know, it's okay. You can make a bad game and then make good ones after that.

1324
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It happens.

1325
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So, all right.

1326
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Uh, well, let's move on.

1327
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
All right. So, this was kind of cool and out of nowhere.

1328
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Apparently, there is a competitor now.

1329
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
A new challenger arrives.

1330
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
So, the Epic Game Store is something that was launched this week,

1331
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and basically, it is going to be a competitor to Steam,

1332
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
another game storefront that you'll be able to put games on for sale,

1333
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
and also to purchase stuff with your Epic Games account,

1334
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
which a lot of people have Epic Games account,

1335
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
because, you know, Fortnite is the shit right now,

1336
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
and everybody is participating with that,

1337
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
or you're like me, you have an Epic account because you use the Unreal Engine.

1338
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Speaking of which, so to kind of step back a little bit,

1339
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and so leading up to this,

1340
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
or actually, we'll talk about this in a little bit.

1341
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So, there was a change in the revenue share on Steam.

1342
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So, Steam right now, for most people, takes like a 30% cut

1343
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
of the revenue that you make on their storefront.

1344
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
So, for example, if you publish a game there,

1345
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
you'll get 70% of it.

1346
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Steam takes their 30% cut.

1347
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So, the main difference with this is the Epic Store

1348
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
is actually only going to take a 12% cut on games.

1349
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
So, you're actually earning an additional percentage there,

1350
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
so 88% on those games.

1351
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And on top of that, so if you're using Unreal 4,

1352
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
normally Epic takes a 5% cut of your revenue from that as well.

1353
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Well, if you use Unreal Engine 4 on the Epic Games storefront,

1354
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
they're actually going to waive that 5% fee,

1355
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
so it's still going to be 12% as well.

1356
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
So, you can make a lot more money on the storefront.

1357
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Plus, being that the storefront is just starting off,

1358
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
you have a lot more visibility as well,

1359
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
so that's also a good thing.

1360
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
What's kind of nice about this, though,

1361
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
as a little bit of a perk to get people their eyes on it and stuff,

1362
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
is they're actually going to start offering free games

1363
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
every two weeks on the storefront.

1364
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
No membership or anything.

1365
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
You just basically create your free account

1366
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and you can add it to your library.

1367
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Well, I like free.

1368
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Tiger Claw on chat says,

1369
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I'm all for a free game every two weeks.

1370
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
That's kind of where I'm at. I like free.

1371
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But the only thing, see, here's the thing.

1372
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Now you've got all these different companies

1373
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
kind of giving you free stuff.

1374
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
So, it's like I have Steam, of course,

1375
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
because you have a huge library on Steam.

1376
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And once in a while, they might have a free game

1377
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
or like a 99-cent game or something.

1378
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Or other sites that have free Steam codes for things.

1379
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
But then you have now Twitch has their own store thing.

1380
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Origin, GOG.

1381
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Origin gives away free games.

1382
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
GOG, once in a while, gives away free games.

1383
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There's another one, too.

1384
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And Transphobia, don't forget about that.

1385
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Well, that's a whole other thing, yes.

1386
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
But we don't cheer on GOG like we used to.

1387
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
PlayStations, Xbox.

1388
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Sure, if you're a yearly subscriber on those things, sure.

1389
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Damn it, there's another one.

1390
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh, Discord just did the store thing.

1391
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And they have like a plus plan type of thing

1392
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
for their Discord Plus where they give away free games.

1393
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So that's the only bummer is that then it's like

1394
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
you have all these different stores on your computer

1395
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
and all these games.

1396
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
But, well, see, Discord, I noticed,

1397
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
is now very big on let us scan your computer

1398
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
and we'll just put shortcuts to all your games

1399
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
no matter where they're from right here in Discord.

1400
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Because I'll tell you what, those guys at Discord,

1401
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I honestly think those guys are so fucking smart.

1402
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I really do, and I'm not being paid by them.

1403
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Of course I use Discord as a fan.

1404
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
We have a VOG Network Discord, plug plug.

1405
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I think what they have done since the beginning

1406
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
is fucking smart, and it should be called out and commended.

1407
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
They put a Trojan horse, the good kind, though,

1408
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
not the virus kind, on everybody's computer

1409
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
by offering those types of services

1410
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
that people were paying for, TeamSpeak, Slack.

1411
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
They give it to you for free,

1412
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
and they got everybody to put Discord on their computers.

1413
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
People put Discord on their phones.

1414
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
When Nintendo couldn't step their pussy up, Discord did.

1415
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And Discord embraced the Pokemon Go thing

1416
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
because that was a mess to coordinate

1417
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
until Discord was like, use us for Pokemon Go.

1418
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And now look, now that they're everywhere in that regard,

1419
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
they're like, oh, well, you know,

1420
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
since we're here on your computer,

1421
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
we're just gonna open up this little store right here.

1422
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Just if you're interested, no pressure,

1423
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
come browse our little store.

1424
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Oh, by the way, if you're a Discord Plus member, though,

1425
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
we'll give you free games.

1426
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
And you know what, since you love Discord, we love you,

1427
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
you know, we wanna be your one-stop shop

1428
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
for all these games.

1429
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Why don't you just, come on, just let us load all the games.

1430
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Dude, they're so smart at what they're doing.

1431
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I honestly think, like, you know,

1432
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I don't wanna be dramatic or nothing,

1433
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
but it is gaming media.

1434
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I think Discord is smarter

1435
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
than any other gaming company out there right now.

1436
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Agree? Disagree?

1437
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I think it's pretty smart.

1438
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Pretty smart, but I don't know.

1439
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I mean, they'll fuck up eventually, everyone does.

1440
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
But for right now?

1441
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I still think for that, though,

1442
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
that before they do things automatically,

1443
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
there'll be like a permission to allow.

1444
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I mean, it's one thing that I really like about,

1445
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
just about any app that installs itself on like your Mac,

1446
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
that it has to ask permission to access things like your photos,

1447
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
like your camera, your microphone.

1448
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Even some of the Apple apps request that approval,

1449
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
like GarageBand does it right now.

1450
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Windows 10 kind of took a lot of cues from that.

1451
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Like, I know with Windows 10,

1452
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
there's a lot of things where it will come up and go,

1453
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
so and so wants to access your device.

1454
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Would you allow this type of thing?

1455
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And even if it's not natively built into Windows 10,

1456
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
a lot of the web browsers,

1457
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
and because so much is built on either a Chrome frame

1458
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
or an Internet Explorer frame,

1459
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
which ironically, I know we all heard this week,

1460
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
is just going to be a Chrome frame pretty soon anyway, right?

1461
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Am I right? Did you hear all that?

1462
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So anyway, but still not going to use it.

1463
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
But those will also ask permission.

1464
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Like if you try to go to a website that wants to access your camera,

1465
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
it's going to tell you.

1466
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So that way you know you're not broadcasting your picture,

1467
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
you know, somewhere you don't want it to be.

1468
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And no, any website that wants some notifications to be sent to me,

1469
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
you can fuck right off.

1470
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
But to be fair, I do first remember that on an Apple system.

1471
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So now that's just kind of becoming the industry standard

1472
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
when it comes to privacy.

1473
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
But since countries like everybody in Europe

1474
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
under the E-L-U-L-A or whatever that, sorry,

1475
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
whatever that acronym is that governs all that,

1476
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,000
that, you know, they have the strangest privacy standards now.

1477
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And I think everybody is kind of having to do these

1478
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
to kind of conform to that, if that makes sense.

1479
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So anyway.

1480
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Anyway, so as I was talking about Epic Games.

1481
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Yeah, sorry.

1482
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Yeah, so with that, you know, some of the things that they want to do,

1483
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
they basically said they want to have a direct relationship with players.

1484
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
So they said people who buy your games automatically subscribe

1485
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
to your newsfeed so you can actually send them updates.

1486
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
So this is, you know, if you're putting content on the storefront.

1487
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
You can connect with creators.

1488
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
They're sending you YouTube content creators,

1489
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Twitch bloggers, and whatnot.

1490
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You control your game pages, and they, you know, welcome all engines.

1491
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
In fact, they mentioned Unity on here as well, which is kind of cool.

1492
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And it's going to be a launcher that's available on PC and Mac,

1493
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
which I think is pretty awesome.

1494
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And then, like I said, you know, two free games a month.

1495
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And in 2019, they're going to be doing that.

1496
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
So let's see.

1497
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Actually, I think they're starting it this month as well.

1498
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
So the first free game is going to be Subnautica,

1499
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
which is, you know, like a $25 game.

1500
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And that's going to be coming out, or free copies available

1501
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
from the 14th to the 27th of December.

1502
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And then after that, Super Meat Boy, which is from the 28th to January 10th.

1503
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
So pretty awesome.

1504
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And then they're going to be doing that through 2019 as well.

1505
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So definitely looking forward to checking that out.

1506
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And I'll add yet another copy of Super Meat Boy,

1507
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
which I have on literally every fucking platform that I practically own.

1508
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Except for the Switch. I don't have it on the Switch,

1509
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
but my kids aren't playing that game.

1510
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
That's it.

1511
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
All right.

1512
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Fortnite, man, it's everywhere.

1513
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I was just at Target the other day.

1514
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
They had like a Fortnite aisle.

1515
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Crazy.

1516
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Speaking of Fortnite, so my son started playing Fortnite.

1517
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And so he's decided that he wants V-Bucks for Christmas,

1518
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
which is their in-game currency.

1519
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
To which I've tried talking him out of that, because I'm like,

1520
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
do you see how much this shit fucking costs?

1521
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'm like, it's basically one to one.

1522
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
So like, you know, $5 is $500 V-Bucks or whatever.

1523
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And like an emote or a dance is like $7.

1524
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I'm like, fuck that.

1525
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
You do not need to pay $7 for a goddamn costume in a game.

1526
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
That is not worth it.

1527
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Especially since I know how you play these games

1528
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
and you fucking get tired of this game in like a moment's time

1529
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
after you've bought in-game currency.

1530
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
So I'll probably get him Robux instead,

1531
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
which is also just throwing money.

1532
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
It might as well just set the money on fire

1533
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
because it's just, you know, pretty much a waste of money.

1534
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
What's that game that Julian likes, Pirate101?

1535
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I remember he talked about it on the show a long time ago.

1536
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
He's still playing it and he's 11.

1537
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Good for him.

1538
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
But I mean, maybe, maybe a game like that would be fun.

1539
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Bitch, I still play Number Munchers.

1540
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
He likes Octodad.

1541
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I had to explain the Oregon Trail to somebody

1542
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
a little younger than me this week

1543
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,000
and how that was like all the rage when we were like in grade school.

1544
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
You know what I mean?

1545
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I had to kind of like explain why that game was cool.

1546
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Have you played the Oregon Trail?

1547
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Yes, I have played the Oregon Trail.

1548
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I have that, but I have not played it though.

1549
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
The parody game, yes.

1550
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Oregon Trail is great.

1551
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Tigerklonchow wants to know about the kid.

1552
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Is he good at Fortnite?

1553
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Because that's a game that looks like it has a steep learning curve.

1554
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
No, he is not very good at it.

1555
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
He is looking forward to,

1556
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
that was something that they announced during the Game Awards, though,

1557
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
is that they've got a creative mode coming out.

1558
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So right now, apparently if you subscribe to their little

1559
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
season pass or whatever they call it,

1560
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
that you get access to it now.

1561
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Otherwise, us, you know,

1562
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
normal people who don't pay money towards that,

1563
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
you have to wait until, I think, the 13th to play that.

1564
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
So he's looking forward to messing around with that.

1565
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
He doesn't really know what he's doing in the game.

1566
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I mean, he might get a kill, you know,

1567
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
but that's why I'm like, you know,

1568
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I don't really want to buy him.

1569
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I'm like, you know, for the amount of money, like,

1570
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
it's been like,

1571
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
it's like talking about this costume pack that was like $30.

1572
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I'm like, you could buy another game for that kind of money.

1573
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Like, why are you going to spend money on a costume

1574
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
in a game that you're only going to play for a little bit?

1575
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Just, no.

1576
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Just don't.

1577
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So, that's it.

1578
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Just have him play Second Life.

1579
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
No.

1580
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
That's, that's just, no.

1581
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
No one should play Second Life.

1582
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
All right.

1583
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I mean, I guess it still is.

1584
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Nobody, nobody plays it anymore.

1585
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
It's probably there. Well, somebody just brought,

1586
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Bonds006 in our chat just brought up Sony Home

1587
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
saying, I blame Sony Home

1588
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
for the normalized trend of buying clothes

1589
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
for my in-game people.

1590
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And Second Life may really be something to blame for that,

1591
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
or just that whole era.

1592
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I actually, isn't it weird that like,

1593
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
despite how much we always kind of made fun of it a little bit,

1594
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
like, there's stuff about Sony Home that I actually kind of miss.

1595
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Like, I just feel like there was so much potential there

1596
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
that really didn't get realized.

1597
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Fortnite, I don't have a problem if you spend money on skins.

1598
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Like, if you're actually playing that a lot,

1599
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
then I have no trouble with you,

1600
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
no problem with you spending money on that kind of stuff

1601
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
if you want to support the game.

1602
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
But I know my kids,

1603
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and they don't have the attention span

1604
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
to play that game for hundreds and hundreds of hours.

1605
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I want it, I want it, I want it,

1606
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and then they'll have it, and it's like, okay, cool, bye.

1607
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And then they're going to play something else.

1608
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I get it.

1609
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
We have Minecraft, I needed Minecraft,

1610
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
and then I got Minecraft, and no.

1611
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
KumaJP suggests, let him earn his own

1612
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
to buy stuff like that.

1613
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Yeah, make him do chores.

1614
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Alright, anyway.

1615
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Let's talk a little bit about

1616
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
what is going on on Steam's marketplace

1617
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
because they are doing a new little profit sharing thing

1618
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
that doesn't have any developers very happy.

1619
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
In short,

1620
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
right now, revenue for Steam games is split

1621
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
70-30, so the developer gets 70%,

1622
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Valve gets 30%,

1623
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
as we know, Epic is undercutting this

1624
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
quite a bit, and that's going to be a huge deal.

1625
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
18%.

1626
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
But, from now on,

1627
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Valve is only going to take 25%

1628
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
if the earnings are above

1629
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
10 million, and only 20%

1630
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
if the earnings go beyond

1631
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
50 million.

1632
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Oh, how generous of that.

1633
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
However, the first 10 million will still be split

1634
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
70-30, and it's going to impact any revenue

1635
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
after October 1st.

1636
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
So, this really does

1637
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
jack and shit for indie developers.

1638
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
It's still going to be 70-30.

1639
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
But, I mean, here's the thing.

1640
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
This was announced almost

1641
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
at the exact same time that

1642
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Epic whipped it out and put it

1643
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
on the table, so to speak.

1644
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Yeah, they announced theirs first, and Epic's like,

1645
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
oh, by the way, since you guys are fucking

1646
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
pissed off about this announcement,

1647
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
here's our $399 US dollars.

1648
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
That's what they did.

1649
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Okay?

1650
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And, yes, that's a throwback to the infamy series.

1651
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You want to talk about trading games?

1652
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
That's right. You want to talk about

1653
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
paying those fees for the

1654
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Unreal Engine? Yeah, let's talk about that.

1655
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So, very interesting

1656
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
what they've done there.

1657
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
That may cause Steam to make a counterplay.

1658
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
You know, the thing is,

1659
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Epic is

1660
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
the company to take on Steam right now

1661
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
because Epic has Fortnite.

1662
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Steam doesn't have any

1663
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
new games that are huge.

1664
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Speaking of, I forgot one of the announcements

1665
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
that they made during the whole

1666
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Game Awards. If it's not Half-Life 3,

1667
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I don't give a fuck. It's not Half-Life 3.

1668
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
It's Counter-Strike.

1669
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Counter-Strike GO is going free to play,

1670
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
and they have this new

1671
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
battle royale mode

1672
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
called Danger Zone,

1673
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
which is in there. Please tell me

1674
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
we played Kenny Loggins. They didn't

1675
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
play Kenny Loggins, but

1676
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
yeah, so now they're trying to compete directly

1677
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
with that by having Counter-Strike GO

1678
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
be free to play, which pissed

1679
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
so many people off.

1680
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So many people are not happy

1681
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
about that either.

1682
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Well, Valve also wanted to explain

1683
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
why a certain Steam algorithm

1684
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
led to smaller games losing traffic.

1685
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
There was a bug in October that made

1686
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
the more-like-this section of

1687
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
pages, I guess, start acting up

1688
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
in favor of more popular games

1689
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
on Steam. Valve did fix this, but

1690
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
it kept a change that factored

1691
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
in the sales, the wishlist

1692
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
popularity, so the games that saw

1693
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
traffic got changed as a result.

1694
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
So, I guess now a new algorithm

1695
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
is in place, and it shows fewer

1696
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
products to a subset of customers. Anyway,

1697
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Valve is saying the traffic has recovered

1698
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
towards the end of October as a result,

1699
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
and things have stabilized, but again,

1700
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
indie developers kind of got one-two

1701
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
punched with

1702
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
both these news articles this week.

1703
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
By the way, have you all checked out

1704
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Falling Plus on Steam?

1705
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Support our buddy YYR, just

1706
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
because he needs it right now after

1707
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
hearing these one-two stories. I hope you all

1708
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And honestly, if you're not going to support

1709
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
YYR because his games don't call to you,

1710
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
then cool, support somebody. Go

1711
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
buy an indie game. We've had tons of indie developers

1712
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
here on this game. Timespinner,

1713
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
go get that, or Monsters &

1714
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Monocles, they'd love your money too. Any of those

1715
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
games we've had here on this show, go give them some

1716
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
money. They'd appreciate that.

1717
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Alright.

1718
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Anyway.

1719
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Moving on, just a few more stories for you guys

1720
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
before we get to the classic peripheral of the month.

1721
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
The last one ever!

1722
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Because we're going to change it in 2019, but we'll get there in a minute.

1723
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
For now, Dark Sakura, what do you have

1724
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
for us? Well, there

1725
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
is a game that we

1726
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
used to talk some shit about

1727
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
until we figured out it was actually good.

1728
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
That is coming out

1729
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
on Instant Games on Facebook.

1730
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You want to know what that is?

1731
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Pump It Up!

1732
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
HTML5 edition. How do you play

1733
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
that on Facebook? I have no fucking clue.

1734
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I guess with a keyboard.

1735
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Well, Andamiro has

1736
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
decided to go via Facebook, so

1737
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
it is playable on

1738
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
mobile, PC, or anywhere else

1739
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
with an internet connection.

1740
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It has 100 songs, different play

1741
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
modes, custom play styles,

1742
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and they'll release more information over

1743
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
time. Now, if it actually

1744
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
has a dance pad, that'll be even

1745
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
better, but no, probably not.

1746
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But anyway,

1747
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
star points are used to buy the songs

1748
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and you start off with 10.

1749
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Step points are used to play the game, and you start

1750
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
with 60 step points, so with each song, and depending

1751
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
on how well you do, you earn

1752
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
more star points as a reward.

1753
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And I'm pretty

1754
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
sure that you can

1755
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
buy more, but right now, the only thing

1756
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
you've got up there is Pump It Up! H5

1757
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
on Instant Games on Facebook.

1758
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And that's it.

1759
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Okay, cool. Like, you know,

1760
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
it's not something I'm probably going to invest a lot of time

1761
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
in, but sure, more

1762
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
mobile games on the go. Why not? As long as

1763
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Run To You is on it, I don't care.

1764
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Bounce with me, bounce with me. Oh, I love

1765
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
that song. Anyway.

1766
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Act F does want to point out, there was Pump It

1767
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Up! Portable on the PSP,

1768
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
two of them, so there was, I guess, another

1769
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
portable version a long time ago, but

1770
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
who has a working PSP? I shouldn't say that.

1771
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Probably a lot of people have to work through PSPs.

1772
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I'm not sure if they're working.

1773
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Do you know what somebody tweeted about today that made me

1774
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
go, aw, somebody tweeted,

1775
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and I'm sorry, I forgot who you are, but somebody tweeted me

1776
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
saying, I first started listening

1777
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
to OLR because of OLRPSP.com,

1778
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
which hasn't been updated since you first started listening.

1779
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Does it even still work?

1780
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I think we stopped paying for it.

1781
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
It's long gone.

1782
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
There's probably a domain squatter there now.

1783
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
But, um, yeah, I just remember,

1784
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
like, oh, remember, I just

1785
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
want to kind of give you a pat on the back, Loki,

1786
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
because a lot of that PSP innovation was you. You did

1787
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
good in that time. Like, that

1788
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
PSP stuff that we really embraced. It was very limited

1789
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
what we could do with that. I know, but still,

1790
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I loved having

1791
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
more podcast stuff on a

1792
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
gaming platform. You know what I mean?

1793
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It's harder to do that now. I can't just whip

1794
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
up an Xbox One game. Thanks to PSP

1795
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Radio that they have their

1796
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
radio app or whatever.

1797
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Aw, everybody in chat is having a

1798
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
moment to pour one out for OLRPSP.

1799
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Oh.

1800
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Bonds006 says, OLR for PSP

1801
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
was the shit. I mean,

1802
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I wish we'd done something

1803
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
that smart since.

1804
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Oh, well.

1805
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
We'll do it for Game Boy at Pants Browser.

1806
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Alright,

1807
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
moving on. Just a couple more stories.

1808
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Loki. So, the Game Wars wasn't the only

1809
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
kind of game showcase that would happen

1810
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
this week. Also, there was the kind of funny

1811
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
game showcase, which

1812
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
they showed off a stream of

1813
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
a bunch of different indie games that are going to be

1814
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
coming out in 2019. So,

1815
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
some of these are actually pretty cool.

1816
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
They showed a new trailer for Super Meat Boy

1817
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Forever, which I guess is now releasing April

1818
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
2019, and of course, you guys are aware

1819
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
what Super Meat Boy is.

1820
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
There's a game called Moving Out, which is

1821
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
by the guys that did Overcooked

1822
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
in Overcooked 2,

1823
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
which looks hilarious. It's a game basically about

1824
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
moving your friends out of a house,

1825
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
but it's just like Overcooked

1826
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
that's kind of silly and fun.

1827
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
So, that's going to be coming

1828
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
out on PC and consoles also in

1829
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
2019. Showed another trailer

1830
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
for ToeJam and Earl Back in the Groove,

1831
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
which is coming out March 1st.

1832
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Then they've got,

1833
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
let's see, a game called Quarantine

1834
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Circular, which is out on the Switch

1835
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
already. Conan

1836
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Unconquered,

1837
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
which looked like a new Conan

1838
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
game. Human Fall

1839
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Flat Dark, which is going to be a DLC

1840
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
update to that game.

1841
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
They had a game called Vain,

1842
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
which I don't really get to watch this

1843
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
trailer, but it looks like

1844
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
some artsy

1845
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
indie game there, and I guess you can turn into

1846
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
a bird. And then they had

1847
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
a game called, this made me think of you Rob,

1848
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Supermarket Shriek.

1849
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It's about a guy,

1850
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
a guy and a goat. It's me

1851
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
when I see box wine is on sale.

1852
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
A guy and a goat being

1853
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
like going through a

1854
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
supermarket screaming and they have to

1855
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
crash into a bunch of stuff. I don't really know what it was,

1856
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
but it looks hilarious. I'm

1857
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
so down, it sounds great. So yeah, that's

1858
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
going to be coming out as well.

1859
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
A game called Fold Apart, which is

1860
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
a game about

1861
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
these two characters that have

1862
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
a long distance

1863
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
love

1864
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
for each other and they have to

1865
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
use this page folding

1866
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
mechanic to get them to meet

1867
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
each other. And that's going to be coming out as

1868
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
well soon. And then

1869
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Desert Child, which is a cyberpunk

1870
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
beat-em-up racer game.

1871
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
That's like retro. That's going to be coming

1872
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
out on consoles and

1873
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
PC as well.

1874
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Actually, that's coming out this week

1875
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
on December 11th. So PS4,

1876
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Switch, and PC. And the

1877
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
little trailer that they had for it looks very

1878
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop.

1879
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
So, looks pretty awesome.

1880
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Seeya Tiberian

1881
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
chat says Rob Roberts is low-key

1882
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
turning into Monique Hart tonight.

1883
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
OK! Brown Cow

1884
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
stunning! Yeah, but Supermarket

1885
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Shriek looks awesome because

1886
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I so watch Supermarket

1887
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Sweep all the time. And

1888
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
that show is fantastic.

1889
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But this doesn't necessarily look like that.

1890
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It's just like ridiculous. I can just imagine

1891
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
you know the goat screaming sound and some guy

1892
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
screaming for no

1893
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
reason whatsoever.

1894
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Rob needs to stream that.

1895
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I'm going to do it. Done. We're going to do

1896
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
some Supermarket Shrieking.

1897
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Oh girl.

1898
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
You should play it too, DartSagra. Be fun.

1899
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Something else that I

1900
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
probably won't be streaming anytime soon because that would

1901
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
involve me having to buy one is the PlayStation

1902
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Classic. They're all over the place. They're just

1903
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
sitting on shelves. Please buy

1904
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
one. Well, here's the

1905
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
thing. Is

1906
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
it really news for me

1907
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
to say they're already finding

1908
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
ways how to hack these things wide-ass open?

1909
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Is that news?

1910
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
No. Is it really news?

1911
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
No.

1912
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
But here I am.

1913
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Apparently some USB keyboards

1914
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
can be plugged into the PlayStation Classic

1915
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
and it will allow you

1916
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I'm sorry, this is just funny.

1917
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
It will allow you to access the emulator

1918
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
settings because of course

1919
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
the PlayStation Classic is using some open source

1920
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
emulator and you can just go in there and

1921
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
access the emulator settings with certain

1922
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
keyboards. I don't know what it is but I guess some

1923
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
will work some more. Some Corsair and

1924
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
stuff keywords and ironically

1925
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
enough I have one of the compatible keyboards

1926
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
for that. How about that? Yep.

1927
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Now they are saying use with caution

1928
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
because you don't know how you're going to fuck up your PlayStation.

1929
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I had heard that somebody went in

1930
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
there and just changed some

1931
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
setting and got the

1932
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
US versions of those games.

1933
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Yeah you can change the rendering setting from

1934
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
NTSC to auto to

1935
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
PAL and you do that. And then there is

1936
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
also a way they can also change

1937
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I think you can overclock the system like 20%

1938
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
doing that as well.

1939
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Which got I guess Ridge Racer

1940
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
type R4 to actually

1941
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
run correctly.

1942
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Now I don't know if I fully

1943
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
understand what exactly happened

1944
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
here but I guess somebody went into the

1945
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
PlayStation and data mined it.

1946
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Which is you know everything gets mined for data right?

1947
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It was the source

1948
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
code because the reason

1949
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
why is the

1950
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
licensing that they had on there.

1951
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
There was a dump of

1952
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
the core that was

1953
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
on a PCSX

1954
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
PlayStation emulator. So they had to have

1955
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I think they dumped it to

1956
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
GitHub or something like that. So they had

1957
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
the source on there. So it

1958
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
showed that there were 36

1959
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
other games I guess like their

1960
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
names were buried in the code or there was something

1961
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
pointed to these games in the code

1962
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
that make it seem like these games

1963
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
were like tested on this

1964
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
or at one point were possibly

1965
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
being included but it ended up not

1966
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
being included. And so of course you know

1967
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
as I'm about to name some of these games

1968
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
these are all the games you really wanted right?

1969
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Such as Chocobos

1970
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Mysterious Dungeon, Crash

1971
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Bandicoot, Driver

1972
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I said that for you Logie. Or guys

1973
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I also said that for you Logie.

1974
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Clona, Clonoa

1975
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I love Clonoa.

1976
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Let's see, Parappa the Rappa I said that for myself.

1977
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Silent Hill, I said that for

1978
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
everybody because if you have taste you love Silent Hill.

1979
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Sweet Coden

1980
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and the first two Tomb Raider games. Obviously

1981
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
the list is gigantic there's many more I'm not

1982
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
saying. So some

1983
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
reports saying these games are actually there on

1984
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
the console but nobody's... No I think they're not.

1985
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yeah I think that would have been a really dumb thing

1986
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
to leave on there and it could have left them open to a lawsuit

1987
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
but certainly some things are pointing

1988
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
out. Weren't some of those in the Japanese

1989
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
version because the Japanese version got different games

1990
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
than we did. We got, like they got

1991
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Armored Core and

1992
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I don't know about, I don't think they get

1993
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Ergites but I thought they had Parasite Eve

1994
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
over there. Yes they do they have some different

1995
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
they have some more RPG type games. So Parasite Eve I could

1996
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
see that but

1997
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
yeah they got the better list out of this

1998
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Clonoa. Well it depends on what you're into but

1999
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
from my perspective yes I agree

2000
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
they got the better list.

2001
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Anyway let's

2002
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
take a trip down memory lane

2003
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
shall we?

2004
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
We're going to do the classic game of the week where every

2005
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
week Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds

2006
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
a game that she thinks hey you brats

2007
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
you should be playing this game this week you don't need no

2008
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
PlayStation Classic for this. It's a little sticky

2009
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
and gross. But this week it

2010
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
is a little bit different because Dark

2011
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Soccer for the past 11

2012
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
months every month in 2018

2013
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
once a month she has flipped

2014
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
the damn script

2015
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
and she's done a peripheral to

2016
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
highlight instead of a game. As you do

2017
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
as you do once in a while. It's how we keep it fresh.

2018
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
So anyway this is the last

2019
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
one we're going to do something else in 2019

2020
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
so we'll talk about that in a minute.

2021
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
But what is the last classic

2022
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
peripheral of the week?

2023
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
It is actually two

2024
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
peripherals. But they are

2025
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
very similar in concept.

2026
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
The first one is

2027
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
the VMU our visual memory

2028
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
unit for Dreamcast. And so

2029
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I didn't really want to have a YouTube of just

2030
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Dreamcast noises. I do

2031
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
have just that lovely

2032
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
intro.

2033
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
It's

2034
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
just like

2035
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
you took the world's biggest P.

2036
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
It's just refreshing. Thank God. I would

2037
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
go for a Dreamcast

2038
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
classic mini. Yes me too.

2039
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
It sounds like the

2040
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
nasty plunge. So anyway

2041
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and now you're just going to hear Sonic Adventure because

2042
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
that's what I picked.

2043
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
You know Dan was actually

2044
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
watching like a full playthrough of that the other day.

2045
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It's probably the same

2046
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
one I'm looking at right now.

2047
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Much longer. Anyway

2048
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
but Sonic used the VMU.

2049
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Yes so the visual memory unit also

2050
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
known as the visual memory system

2051
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
was

2052
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
a memory card

2053
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
that was produced by Sega for the Dreamcast.

2054
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
It had a

2055
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
monochrome LCD

2056
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
multiplayer gaming

2057
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
capability via the connectors on

2058
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
top. Second screen functionality

2059
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
a real time clock file manager

2060
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
built in flash memory and

2061
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
sound capability.

2062
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
It actually before the launch

2063
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
of the Dreamcast

2064
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
in Japan

2065
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
there was actually a special

2066
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Godzilla edition. Guess who owns one?

2067
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
This bitch. I also have

2068
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
the Ghidorah one. And yes

2069
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I raised my mini Godzilla like

2070
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
a freaking Tamagotchi.

2071
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So

2072
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
it is at its

2073
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
most basic function

2074
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
it is a memory card.

2075
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
It's a storage device. But it also

2076
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
will give you like certain

2077
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
layout things like

2078
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
you know a heart sensor in some

2079
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
games you know for your characters health.

2080
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
You know all kinds of

2081
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
different stuff but it has like some other console

2082
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
like features on it. Including

2083
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
a D-pad. It had

2084
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
a couple of buttons. It had

2085
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
you know

2086
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
different you know like a mode

2087
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
and a sleep button.

2088
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
But there were also

2089
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
other special edition VMUs

2090
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
like the ones released by Sonic Team

2091
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Capcom and the Hello Kitty one by

2092
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Sanrio.

2093
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
So it will plug directly into

2094
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
the controller of the

2095
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Dreamcast. And of course

2096
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
that's how you would look down on it to do

2097
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
different playing. You can

2098
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
also hook one to

2099
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
the other via the connectors on the top like I mentioned.

2100
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
The VMU runs on

2101
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
two CR2032 lithium

2102
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
batteries that are inserted

2103
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
into the rear VMU.

2104
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I will tell you this.

2105
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
My Japanese VMUs

2106
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
still freaking work.

2107
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Just saying.

2108
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,000
But a VMU without battery power will

2109
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
beep when the Dreamcast is powered on

2110
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
if the VMU

2111
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
is inserted into the

2112
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Dreamcast controller.

2113
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
So as far as

2114
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
its technical capabilities

2115
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
it had 128 kilobytes

2116
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
of flash memory.

2117
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Holy moly! 48 by 32

2118
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
LCD screen.

2119
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
So basically a VMU

2120
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
is two Commodore 64's stuck

2121
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
taped together.

2122
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
But it actually would fit in

2123
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
your pocket.

2124
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It had a one channel PWM sound

2125
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
source. It had

2126
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
the D-pad. Four input buttons

2127
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
and one reset button.

2128
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
It, like I said, functions as a

2129
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
memory card, second screen, minigames,

2130
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
a calendar to file manager.

2131
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
It only weighed like

2132
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
one and a half ounces.

2133
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
It was really really tiny.

2134
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So as far as the data

2135
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
that it would store,

2136
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
28 kilobytes of it were

2137
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
reserved for system usage and

2138
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
100 kilobytes were used for data

2139
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
storage which was divided into 200 blocks.

2140
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
And then homebrew programs

2141
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
like Dream Explorer or the VMU tool

2142
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
would unlock

2143
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
more of the reserved space

2144
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
that you could save more on it.

2145
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
As far as different minigames

2146
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
you had Chao Adventure

2147
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
from Sonic Adventure

2148
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
games. You had

2149
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Sega GT

2150
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
included Pocket GT which was

2151
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
kind of a top down racer

2152
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
a bit like how Spy Hunter did.

2153
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
But now

2154
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
as I was mentioning for Code Veronica

2155
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
you had a heart meter on it

2156
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
that would show you your character's health.

2157
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
And that was pretty cool.

2158
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Now people have done different homebrew

2159
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
games on it.

2160
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Including a version of Metroid,

2161
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
VMU

2162
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Deepak Man, Breakout, Space Invaders,

2163
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Tetris, VMU Fighter

2164
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
which is a side scrolling shoot em up.

2165
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
VMU Chao Editor 1 and 2

2166
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
so you can make your own Chao.

2167
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
VMU Football for American

2168
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Football. VMU A Sketch

2169
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
which was an Etch A Sketch thing.

2170
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And 3D First Person Shooter.

2171
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
So

2172
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
some of the games that would use

2173
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
them to put in different extras

2174
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
is like that Cardcaptor Sakura game

2175
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
that I have Rob. They came with the plate

2176
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
and all that shit. I'll never get over

2177
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
the fact that you bought a game with a plate.

2178
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
And a clock and a spoon.

2179
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
It also had a pillow case.

2180
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
But it came with a version of Breakout,

2181
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Oyatu, and Toba Kero

2182
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
and it had a clock with different themes on it.

2183
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I'm looking at some

2184
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
of the other ones in here. Godzilla Generation

2185
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
had Atsumete Godzilla,

2186
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000

2187
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Mothra Dream Battle. Jet Set Radio

2188
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
1

2189
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
had, well Jet Grind Radio, Jet Set Radio

2190
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
had a graffiti transfer.

2191
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 would let you do

2192
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
character transfer, colors,

2193
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
and stages.

2194
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Pop and Music had

2195
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Pop and Music Anywhere minigame.

2196
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Power Stone came with three different games

2197
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
on it. Like

2198
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Gun Rock's Gun Gun Shot, Falcon's

2199
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Aerial Adventure, Ayame's Shuriken

2200
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Training.

2201
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Look at some of the other ones on here. I'm just going through

2202
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
some of the best. Shenmue had Shenmue goodies

2203
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
and training instructions.

2204
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
We got all the chao ones.

2205
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Let me see what else.

2206
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Trick Style had Trick Style Jr.

2207
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
on it. Time Stalkers came with different

2208
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
minigames. Tokyo

Bus Guide had a traffic sign

2210
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
quiz.

2211
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Other things is like what they would do just like

2212
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
you know plugged into the games like

2213
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Ready to Rumble would add a punch

2214
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
count and a hit percentage.

2215
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Quick 3 Arena played

2216
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
different

2217
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
animations. Pop and Music

2218
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
had Virtual Pop and Music Controller.

2219
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Namco Museum

2220
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
sorry that was the one that came with

2221
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Packet.

2222
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
NFL 2K came with

2223
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Secret Plays.

2224
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
F355 Challenge came with

2225
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Arcade Connectivity.

2226
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Dino Crisis, Health Condition, and Ammo Count.

2227
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So there's just all kinds of different stuff.

2228
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
D2 had

2229
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
a

2230
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
what's the word I'm thinking of? A compass.

2231
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Girl you're going to go all night if you read every game

2232
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
So for the other versions

2233
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
that came out there were

2234
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
some memory cards

2235
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
that came out like a VMU that

2236
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
had none of the VMU features.

2237
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
So they had no display

2238
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
input button, speaker, built in clock

2239
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
but they had

2240
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
multiple pages to save. There was the

2241
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
4X memory card that Sega released.

2242
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
It had 800 blocks.

2243
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I think I have one of those too.

2244
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
It did not come out in Europe.

2245
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
There were of course a bunch

2246
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
of third party memory cards.

2247
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
But as far as the

2248
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
reception goes, GamesRadar

2249
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
said in a 10 year retrospective

2250
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
it was one of their favorite storage devices.

2251
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Because it was

2252
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
such an original concept.

2253
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
That brings me to the knockoff

2254
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
concept. The Pocket Station.

2255
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Dun dun dun.

2256
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
How about some

2257
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
some

2258
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Vibrobin Music Rob?

2259
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Oh I will work on that right now.

2260
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
You know I love me some Vibrobin.

2261
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So Pocket Station

2262
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
is basically Sony's

2263
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
version of the VMU.

2264
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
It

2265
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
was sold as a

2266
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
combination memory card and a

2267
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
miniature personal digital assistant

2268
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
that had a monochrome

2269
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
LCD, infrared communication

2270
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
capability, a real time clock

2271
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
built in flash memory and sound capability.

2272
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
To use the memory card

2273
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
it has to be connected to a Playstation

2274
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
and it was released exclusively in Japan

2275
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
on January 23, 1999.

2276
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
It was

2277
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
used for specific

2278
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
games.

2279
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It was actually

2280
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
delayed with its release.

2281
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And of course

2282
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Sony was actually planning on releasing it outside of

2283
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Japan, but the release

2284
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
never happened due to

2285
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
inability to meet

2286
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
the Japanese demand for

2287
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
they were focusing on the Japanese market.

2288
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
But a few games such as Final Fantasy 8

2289
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
and Saga Frontier 2

2290
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
still had Pocket Station functionality for

2291
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
their local versions.

2292
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
The most popular game for Pocket Station was

2293
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Doko demo Isho

2294
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
which sold 1.5 million

2295
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
copies in Japan.

2296
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It was the first game to star

2297
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Sony's mascot, Toro.

2298
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Who was that

2299
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
little funny Sony cat looking thing?

2300
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
The Pocket Station

2301
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
was discontinued in July 2002.

2302
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Now

2303
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
it was announced that the Pocket Station

2304
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
was going to be revived

2305
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
as an application for Playstation Vita.

2306
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
It was

2307
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
only available at first to Playstation Plus

2308
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
members and then was released to the

2309
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
general public and was exclusive

2310
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
to Japanese Playstation Vitas.

2311
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It

2312
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
actually had a smaller screen

2313
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
on it than the Dreamcast.

2314
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Five input buttons, one reset

2315
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
buttons. It did

2316
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
have bi-directional infra-red.

2317
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
The

2318
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
battery it used was a 1 CR 2032

2319
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
lithium battery.

2320
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
It had calendar functions and

2321
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
identification numbers. It weighed

2322
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
30 grams and it came in different colors.

2323
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
There was white, crystal clear.

2324
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Black for the

2325
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories limited edition

2326
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
in Japan. Crystal slash clear

2327
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
pink for Tokimeki Memorial 2

2328
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
limited editions.

2329
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
It worked with DDR.

2330
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Everything from third mix,

2331
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
fourth mix, and fifth mix.

2332
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
It worked with Soul

2333
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Hackers. It worked with Digi-One Trainers,

2334
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Final Fantasy VIII, Fire Pro G,

2335
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Grandia,

2336
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
IQ Final,

2337
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Jade Cocoon, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

2338
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I'm just trying to think of some other

2339
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
games that people would know over here. Legend of Mana.

2340
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Weren't they going to re-release

2341
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Vib-Ribbon? Did it ever come out?

2342
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
It did on the Vita and I thought it came out on

2343
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Playstation 3. I don't know if it ever did on

2344
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Playstation 4. Remember, Playstation 4 can't play

2345
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
PS1 games. Well, I don't know why I said

2346
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Vib-Ribbon because it doesn't work with it.

2347
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I guess

2348
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I just wanted to hear Vib-Ribbon.

2349
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
She just wanted to hear Vib-Ribbon.

2350
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
It worked with Ray Crisis.

2351
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Also, super awesome

2352
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
game. It worked with R4.

2353
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
You know what game that I played that it

2354
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
worked with?

2355
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
You don't get music anymore.

2356
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Final Fantasy VIII? Didn't Final Fantasy VIII work

2357
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
with it? That's what I said earlier.

2358
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
It also did work with

2359
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Shirooch Justice Gakuen

2360
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
which was

2361
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
the evolution disc for Rival Schools

2362
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
because there was that

2363
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
dance mode on it. I remember I used to leave it

2364
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
plugged into my Playstation

2365
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
and

2366
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I'd do some mode where the chocobo would

2367
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
walk and it would get items

2368
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
and I just left it running

2369
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
overnight or a couple days

2370
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
and I had like a hundred or so

2371
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
items from that made the game

2372
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
so much easier.

2373
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
It really did actually work with quite a good

2374
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
number of games.

2375
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Chocobo Stallion?

2376
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Ark the Lad 3

2377
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I'm just again trying to think of games that

2378
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I know of that people might

2379
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
recognize. Love Hina 2

2380
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Metal Gear Solid

2381
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Integral

2382
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
and actually Metal Gear Solid

2383
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Integral was one of the US games that would

2384
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
work with. Same with Ray

2385
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Ray Crisis

2386
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
and then Rival Schools 2

2387
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
and Rockman Complete Works

2388
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
and there you go. So yeah

2389
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
it was pretty popular

2390
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
but alas

2391
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
it only had a three year life.

2392
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Alright.

2393
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
It lived about as long as a beta.

2394
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
So there it is. Your classic peripheral of

2395
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
the month. The pairing of the

2396
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
VMU and the PocketStation

2397
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
which kind of mixed memory with portable

2398
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
gaming with...

2399
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
With boredom alleviation. I feel like it was

2400
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
the precursor to other second screen

2401
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
things like cell phone

2402
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
gaming. What do they call that

2403
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Microsoft thing that was short lived? Share

2404
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
screen? Second screen? What do they call that whole thing?

2405
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Or the Wii U quite frankly.

2406
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Or

2407
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
even the DS.

2408
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Kinda. Or what's really kind of like mobile

2409
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
phones now I think honestly has kind of filled in that

2410
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
void. Thank you Smart Glass.

2411
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
We actually have color. Don't be a

2412
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
smart glass. Alright. Before

2413
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
we go to our music break I do

2414
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
want to recap since that was the last

2415
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
speaking of music classic peripheral

2416
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
of the month. Hold on though. I want to

2417
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
recap our twelve peripherals of

2418
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
the twelve days of peripherals. So

2419
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
we had in January the

2420
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
U Force. February

2421
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
was the activator.

2422
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
March was the NG

2423
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Con. April

2424
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
was the Saturn Twin Stick slash Dreamcast

2425
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Twin Stick. May

2426
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
was the XE1 AP.

2427
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
June was the trans vibrator

2428
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
cause obviously if we're gonna do

2429
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
a peripheral we had to do the trans vibrator at some point.

2430
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
So she did that for my birthday month.

2431
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Dance Pads in July.

2432
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Cause you know it was a show that we met

2433
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
playing DDR so we've done our fair share of dance pads.

2434
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
August was the sewing machine.

2435
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
It was the

2436
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Raku Raku mission. The sewing

2437
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
machine. Yes. The sewing machine's awesome.

2438
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
September was the Sega 3D glasses.

2439
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
And October was the

2440
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Steel Battalion controller cause we kinda did a

2441
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
combo that week. And then last

2442
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
month was the Wii Balance board and we ended

2443
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
it with the VMU and the Pocket Station.

2444
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
So. Yes.

2445
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
So starting in 2019

2446
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
so here's the thing. 2017 we mixed

2447
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
it up with the classic system of the month.

2448
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
This year was the classic peripheral

2449
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
of the month. So next year in 2019

2450
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
not only will you get

2451
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
several classic games of the week every month

2452
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
but once a month you're gonna get the

2453
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
drum roll. We're gonna get the classic

2454
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
soundtrack. Game soundtrack.

2455
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Awesome.

2456
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
This is just a way for you to re-highlight

2457
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
games you've already done isn't it?

2458
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Not particularly no. Because

2459
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
there and I'm actually gonna try to

2460
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
avoid the usual stuff like Super Metroid

2461
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
and Final Fantasy. Well I mean you don't have to.

2462
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Well and the thing is

2463
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I want this to actually extend

2464
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
for a couple years because there are so many

2465
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
awesome soundtracks.

2466
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
And there are games out

2467
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
there that one wouldn't think about the

2468
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
degree of how awesome the soundtrack are.

2469
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And I may or may not do some of the ones

2470
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
that I'm gonna name but Zero Wing.

2471
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I mean how's that?

2472
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
There is also

2473
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
oh what was that shooter game

2474
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
that used

2475
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
2 Unlimited's music?

2476
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Oh okay.

2477
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
So like games that maybe used some

2478
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
like cool music that you may have forgot about

2479
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
type of thing. Okay I'm down with that.

2480
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
You know and I'm not gonna go for like anything relatively

2481
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
new either. I'd like to focus on 16

2482
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
and 32 bit systems.

2483
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Even 8 bit systems like Wrecka.

2484
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Although you really should do Alan Wake.

2485
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Oh my god the licensed music in that game is so good.

2486
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
But it's your segment. I'm gonna be going

2487
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
for original pieces.

2488
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
You know I'm just trying to think about

2489
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Ys III Wanderers from Ys.

2490
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Had a really good soundtrack and it's not one that people

2491
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
would just oh Wanderers from Ys

2492
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
or oh here's another one Rob.

2493
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Bejeweled

2494
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
on iPhone. Okay.

2495
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
And I'll tell you this

2496
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
that game has some freaking astounding music

2497
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
in it for a little iPhone game.

2498
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I can co-sign with Bobby Blackwell suggesting

2499
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Last Ninja on Commodore 64.

2500
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
That's one of the greatest like

2501
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
soundtracks that use that chipset.

2502
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Well and see that's what I want to do

2503
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
is I want to focus on the things

2504
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
that I

2505
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
that I know

2506
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
people wouldn't think of at first for like

2507
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
amazing soundtracks. Right.

2508
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
So you're gonna stay away from Final Fantasy 6 cause we all know that one.

2509
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
You know those types of things.

2510
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Exactly. Okay.

2511
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I think it'll be fun.

2512
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
How about Acid Tetris?

2513
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
As a soundtrack featuring

2514
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
our pal. Okay forget it.

2515
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I tried. I tried.

2516
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Alright. But at any rate

2517
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
you know and I'd be happy

2518
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
to take suggestions. I mean

2519
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I kind of wanted to do this one

2520
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
twice a month. Instead

2521
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I'm gonna do it for over the next couple

2522
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
years. Because

2523
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I think that there

2524
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
are enough

2525
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I'd say

2526
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
unrecognized or

2527
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
what's the word I'm thinking of like not regularly

2528
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
thought about.

2529
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
You know soundtracks that

2530
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I think deserve a little bit of love. Sounds

2531
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
good to me. Or fuck even the Guardian Legend

2532
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
soundtrack is pretty fucking amazing.

2533
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
But no one thinks about it. Because

2534
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
honestly there are still people out there

2535
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
those poor ignorant

2536
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
fools who don't know what

2537
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
awesomeness the Guardian Legend is. Basically them

2538
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
kids. They get Gen Z.

2539
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
They need to get the fuck

2540
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
off my lawn and get into my house

2541
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
on my Nintendo.

2542
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Right. And play some

2543
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
fucking good games you dumb shits.

2544
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Classic soundtrack of the month coming in

2545
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
2019. Please look forward to it.

2546
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Yes. Ewada bow. Alright.

2547
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
That's gonna do it for part A. But we've

2548
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
got plenty more show to come. We're gonna take a quick

2549
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
break here live. We haven't done a break

2550
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
live in a while because thanks to Radio Magic.

2551
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
But we are gonna take a break and when we come back we have

2552
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
more of Orange Lounge Radio right after

2553
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
this. Please don't go anywhere.

2554
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

2555
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Lounge Radio. Live and in progress

2556
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
here at the Voice Geeks Network.

2557
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
For episode number 755

2558
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
December 9th of

2559
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
2018. Our show already in progress.

2560
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Already running pretty long.

2561
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Having a lot of good times. I think something about

2562
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Jamie being here and having another person to bounce

2563
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
everything off of I think helps the show be that

2564
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
three hour length we're used to. A lot

2565
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
of the shows without you Jamie have been like two and a half

2566
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
two. It's just shorter

2567
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
when there's less people to talk to here.

2568
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
So. Anyway.

2569
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I have a

2570
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I'm

2571
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
happy to be here. I mean I like

2572
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
having my Sundays off and I don't like

2573
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
working on Sundays. I know. I know.

2574
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
But you know what? Good for you and your job and I

2575
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
know you're doing the type of work you

2576
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
were more wanting to be doing. So sometimes

2577
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
you have to make changes to do that. Radio magic

2578
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
has been fun. Honestly and I was mentioning this

2579
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
to the live only people.

2580
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
But the radio magic stuff that we did

2581
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
has been fun and it's actually

2582
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
kind of got my gears turning for

2583
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
why don't we do something like this all the time

2584
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
even though you might still be here in studio

2585
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
maybe there's a way we can do pre-recorded

2586
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
segments that kind of allow us to

2587
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
have a break in studio but still

2588
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
do everything that you kind of get during the show.

2589
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I've been wanting to do a mini cast.

2590
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Yeah. That's like

2591
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
maybe an expansion of the

2592
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
classic game. Yeah maybe. Like

2593
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Jamie talk shit about games. Or something like

2594
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I know I know there are some there's a couple

2595
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
of you out there that missed the

2596
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Pokestop podcast. Maybe something

2597
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
like that once a month for like seven minutes just

2598
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
to recap like what we've been doing. Maybe we'll be fun.

2599
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
So I don't know. There's a lot of a lot of ideas

2600
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
kind of floating around out there. We'll see what we

2601
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
land on. Just a little bit of behind the scenes stuff.

2602
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Yeah. I am

2603
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
actually working on my iMac right now.

2604
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
And I've already got

2605
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
logic. So

2606
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I've already

2607
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I'm going to be ordering

2608
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
an interface.

2609
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
And I'm going to be getting hijack

2610
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
for my own computer.

2611
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
So I'll be able to start doing like

2612
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
more like Skype feeds and everything.

2613
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
It would be kind of like a bit like pump up the volume

2614
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
was. Except it just be me

2615
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
and whoever calls and talking shit.

2616
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
But you know what. That's a thing people do on

2617
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Twitch. Like just chilling. I think

2618
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
that's like a category. I don't know if that's what the categories

2619
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
go. Just chatting I think is what it's called maybe.

2620
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
But I would use Twitch for that.

2621
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
But I'd record it. Yeah. You know

2622
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
why not. And just I don't know how to do

2623
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
it live because I don't think I'm going to use shoutcast.

2624
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
But we'll see what happens.

2625
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
We'll see. Anyway as

2626
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
as we were addressing with the live

2627
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
listeners I think the theme

2628
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
an appropriate theme for

2629
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
the future of O.L.R. and why

2630
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
we're doing this big change. You know after 16 years

2631
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
look to the sky. That's what it is

2632
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
right. Look to the sky. I'm just

2633
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
really excited. I'm really to this guy.

2634
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I'm really hopeful that

2635
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
we will be able to grow after

2636
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
you know it's we haven't had a lot of

2637
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
new people. Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate

2638
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
every new person that comes around to O.L.R. and I know some friends

2639
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I've told about the show started listening and so forth.

2640
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I really appreciate that. But like on a bigger scale

2641
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
we have not really been able to grow in a very long time.

2642
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
And I think this is going to really help us to do

2643
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
that. So I really hope you guys will welcome in

2644
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
with open arms next week the new people

2645
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
that are going to poke in on Twitch being like what

2646
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
the hell's this. You know as long as

2647
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
you know you know the number

2648
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
one rule is going to be be

2649
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
cool. Like don't

2650
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
don't be a jerk. So anyway

2651
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
as long as I'm sorry we don't take dick

2652
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
pics. Yeah but most honestly

2653
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I don't get I don't get a lot

2654
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
of bullshit on Twitch like when I

2655
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
watch stuff like the Pokemon reruns

2656
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
or like Bob Ross especially

2657
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
like you know you would think like watching

2658
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Bob Ross with the chat room is just going to be like the

2659
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
worst thing in the world but actually like the chat

2660
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
room made that whole experience.

2661
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
It really did. So I'm

2662
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I'm hopeful. I really am.

2663
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Alright anyway

2664
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
let's move on. We've still got some news

2665
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
too. We still have a show to do. Changes

2666
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
or not we're still going to be covering the news. So let's

2667
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
get to it. Loki with some rapid fire

2668
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
news starting us off. Yep. So

2669
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
there is a new mod for

2670
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
the Game Boy Advance to allow

2671
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
you to connect it via

2672
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
HDMI to a TV.

2673
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
It'll actually upscale it and everything. So it's

2674
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
the GBA Consolizer

2675
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
and

2676
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
it's by this guy

2677
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Steven Williams who goes by Woozle

2678
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
on YouTube. And basically

2679
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
it's this device that you actually have to wire

2680
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
up to a

2681
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Game Boy Advance. It even has a

2682
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Super NES controller

2683
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
port. So you can actually hook up

2684
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Super NES controller to it as well.

2685
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
But it'll upscale it. It looks awesome.

2686
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
It has lots of different

2687
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
tweaks. So you can actually

2688
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
adjust

2689
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
the color to see what it would actually look like

2690
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
without the backlight and everything

2691
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
or

2692
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
even just

2693
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
being able to

2694
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I guess

2695
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
make it look like other screens. They have options

2696
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
to select between the different types of screens that you would

2697
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
play it on. Even like a PSP as well.

2698
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Pretty cool though.

2699
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
And I'm not sure if it's for sale

2700
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
just yet but probably

2701
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
is going to be something that he's going to offer

2702
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
at some point.

2703
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Pretty cool looking device. So they were showing

2704
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
off like Yoshi's Island

2705
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
and everything with that Mario Kart

2706
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Super Circuit. It's all

2707
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
upscaled and crisp.

2708
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
So you can do that or

2709
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
you can

2710
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
buy a

2711
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
SNES Classic or any

2712
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
of their device and just throw it

2713
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
on there for

2714
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
cheap and upscale it yourself.

2715
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
But this is actually using

2716
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
the legit hardware though.

2717
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Fair enough.

2718
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Alright and then

2719
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
so there's

2720
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
going to be some more backwards compatibility

2721
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
for Xbox One.

2722
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I know that everybody's looking forward to this

2723
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
but Duke Nukem Forever is now

2724
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
supported on the

2725
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Xbox One. For the dozens and dozens

2726
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
of people that play that game. There's several

2727
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
of you.

2728
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Also The Darkness is getting

2729
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
support as well and XCom

2730
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Declassified. Those were

2731
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Xbox 360 tells.

2732
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Cool.

2733
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Neat.

2734
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
But seriously though there are better games than

2735
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Duke Nukem Forever.

2736
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
All of the games.

2737
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Literally any other game.

2738
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Anyhow

2739
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
except what was the one that Shane called in to talk

2740
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
about a couple weeks ago? The Quiet Man?

2741
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
The Quiet Place? Remember that one he called in

2742
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
a couple weeks ago? He's like this game is fucking terrible.

2743
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
He actually was texting me about

2744
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
it earlier this week because I guess they

2745
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
he's like

2746
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I kinda almost want to play it again after

2747
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
that trailer but he's like but it's so

2748
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
bad.

2749
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
But now they have audio in the game

2750
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
so it's not fucked up.

2751
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
That'll be a thing

2752
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
we can do for a break in the future is

2753
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
make a new person play The Quiet

2754
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Man.

2755
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Make Loki play The Quiet Man. I love this.

2756
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Anyhow.

2757
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I would say we'd do that if we didn't get emails

2758
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
but then that's just gonna

2759
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
convince people not to send us emails so we're not gonna.

2760
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Alright.

2761
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Moving on let's talk about some retro

2762
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
sales numbers. For every email we receive

2763
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I have to play The Quiet Man for one minute.

2764
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
I like where this is

2765
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
going. Alright. Yeah but I gotta read

2766
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
em. Alright moving on.

2767
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Retro consoles were a big deal

2768
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
this year and in fact one out of every

2769
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
five consoles sold in the US this year

2770
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
was a retro device. That is according to

2771
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
NPD's Matt Piscatella.

2772
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
We're getting to that part of the year where

2773
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
we're gonna look back on the year in review.

2774
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
2018 in review.

2775
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
When it comes to

2776
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
console sales one out of every five was a retro

2777
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
console. Of course Nintendo snatched

2778
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
all the wigs when it came to the retro world

2779
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
with their classic NES

2780
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
coming back and of course the classic SNES

2781
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
which just came out last year.

2782
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Reggie Fils-Aime in an interview with the New York Times

2783
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
suggesting why these are

2784
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
being sold so well and why people

2785
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
love them so much. Remember

2786
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
people remember the colors and shape

2787
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
of the console and the feel of the controllers

2788
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
from their childhood and they have a visceral

2789
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
reaction when they first fire up their

2790
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
favorite NES or Super NES

2791
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
games. Or if you're Loki

2792
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
you have that reaction the first time you hack

2793
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
the fuck out of that thing. That's what he said.

2794
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Believe it or not.

2795
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Funny enough I actually did play

2796
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
that was one thing I did play this week I forgot

2797
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
to mention. Not the NES

2798
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
classic but I played the

2799
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
NES games that you get for free

2800
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
well not free cause you pay for the online service

2801
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
so the NES

2802
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
collection that they have

2803
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
on there. So I played Dr. Mario

2804
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
because I was like bored and I didn't know what games

2805
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
to play. I played a little bit of that and that was

2806
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
alright.

2807
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
But yeah I think a lot of those

2808
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
consoles are selling also because you don't sell any fucking

2809
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
games through virtual console anymore so

2810
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
it's their only way to get them.

2811
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
So but no

2812
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
they're pretty decent consoles.

2813
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I can't wait to see the NPD numbers for the

2814
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
PlayStation Classic though.

2815
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Those are not gonna be good.

2816
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Yeah we'll see what that looks like pretty soon.

2817
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I'll still pick one up at some point

2818
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
when it gets fully hacked open and it's

2819
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
dropped in price. By the way act deft

2820
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
with a compromise idea on your Quiet Man

2821
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
thing. One minute of

2822
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Loki playing the Quiet Man for every

2823
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
single email that is well written and has

2824
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
good grammar. Then he won't be

2825
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
playing at all. Hooray!

2826
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
That's his win win. So we'll go

2827
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
for that. Alright. Bobby

2828
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Blackwell suggests I'll get a PlayStation Classic

2829
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
if it's $20. That's my bar.

2830
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I feel like

2831
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
if the price on those starts to fall fast

2832
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
which I think is gonna happen. Those fuckers

2833
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
are gonna end up at big lots. Just wait.

2834
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I'd buy one for $20 too.

2835
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Why not?

2836
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I bought a Dreamcast for $40. They were way too

2837
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
expensive for the price. They really were.

2838
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I don't know. It's just

2839
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
They still hold up

2840
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
well. Even if you watch the

2841
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Digital Foundry video where they're talking about

2842
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
the visuals and stuff and the different emulators

2843
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
that are available. They're like

2844
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
this is running on the PCSX

2845
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Classic

2846
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
and this is what

2847
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
PCSX also can look like.

2848
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Why didn't we get

2849
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
that? Because that looks great.

2850
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
This looks like shit.

2851
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Speaking of things that might have cost

2852
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
too much when they first came out, Street Fighter

2853
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
5 is going to be getting some in-game

2854
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
advertisements.

2855
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Capcom calls it sponsored

2856
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
content and it's coming on the 11th of December

2857
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
and it's going to show you about

2858
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
costumes, bundles, and the Capcom Pro Tour.

2859
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
You can turn these

2860
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
game ads off, but players

2861
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
of course are encouraged to keep them on because you

2862
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
get extra fight money in ranked

2863
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
and casual matches when you have them enabled.

2864
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Boy oh boy.

2865
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Extra fight money for watching ads. Wow that sounds like a

2866
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
mobile fucking game. Every character

2867
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
has ad-style costumes where the sponsored

2868
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
content will appear somewhere on the clothing or model.

2869
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
So for example, here's Ryu and Balrog

2870
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
where they have the

2871
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Capcom Pro Tour logo

2872
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
like they're a fucking NASCAR.

2873
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I don't have a problem with the Capcom Pro Tour

2874
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
stuff, but like, we're going to get

2875
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Cup Noodle shit. Can I get

2876
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
a Cup Noodle tattoo on my buttocks?

2877
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
That's what I would like to have on my

2878
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
in-game character. Cup Noodle.

2879
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
That was some fucking

2880
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
weird crossover shit for me.

2881
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
But you know what?

2882
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
More people

2883
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
have talked about Cup Noodles since that game came out

2884
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
than ever did before. Well then there was the Pizza Hut

2885
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
crossover that they had with, I think it was

2886
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
like, um, oh god what was it?

2887
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Uh, Neptunia? I can't remember

2888
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
It fucking works, Loki. I see like

2889
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Cup Noodles stacked and stacked and stacked

2890
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
at Target or something and I kind of giggle.

2891
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I go, heh, Cup Noodle. Final Fantasy.

2892
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
And then I go, god damn it, it worked.

2893
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I'm a consumer whore.

2894
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
It was super extra. It was just ridiculous.

2895
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Anyway, you can

2896
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
turn in-game ads off, but obviously

2897
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
people are obviously irritated about it

2898
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
because...

2899
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
No, this um,

2900
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
meme that somebody did where they have like a

2901
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Pornhub logo on the floor and KFC

2902
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
in the background, yeah that's pretty fucking great.

2903
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Honestly, I would keep in-game ads on if I'm

2904
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
gonna get like KFC advertisements.

2905
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
And Pornhub. And Pornhub, hell yeah.

2906
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Somebody needs to hack that

2907
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
so that it just plays a random Pornhub

2908
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
video in the background on those stages. You know

2909
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
that's something hackers are gonna be working on.

2910
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
No they're not.

2911
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Loki. Rule 34.

2912
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Is it rule 34 or 37?

2913
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Rule 34 of the internet. If you

2914
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
envision it, it will be made.

2915
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Well that's just if there's gonna be porn.

2916
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
There's always porn for...

2917
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
So why are you sitting here breaking rule 34?

2918
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Somebody is going to porn

2919
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Street Fighter 5. Wait for it.

2920
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
They've already done that with costume

2921
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
hacks and stuff. Do you know, especially

2922
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
not to sidetrack things too much,

2923
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
but with Tumblr

2924
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
about to lose

2925
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
all of their porn.

2926
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Well it's nice to see how they're gonna go the way of the MySpace

2927
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Pornhub is

2928
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
like, hey-o

2929
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Tumblr people, come over here

2930
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
because Pornhub is

2931
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
another one of those companies that for what it is

2932
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
we all know what Pornhub's got.

2933
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
We all know what it is. Y'all know if you have

2934
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
a need for something like that in your life or not.

2935
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
But Pornhub does a great job

2936
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
of just being who they are.

2937
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
You know what I mean?

2938
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Anyway.

2939
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Well they own all of the porns

2940
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
like a lot of the top porn sites

2941
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
and shit. That's all owned by Pornhub.

2942
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
They own like all of them.

2943
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
They just need to fucking put out a legit

2944
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
video service that's not

2945
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
porn. Oh just

2946
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
take video hub

2947
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
or something. Yeah they'll just fucking take

2948
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
on YouTube. I hope so.

2949
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Whatever. They're making

2950
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
boatloads of porn money. Let's move something

2951
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
less porny from Dark Sakura. Sorry Jamie.

2952
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
We're being very unclassy on this show.

2953
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Porn is inevitable. It's true.

2954
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
So um

2955
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
of course Dragon Quest 11 S

2956
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
we are waiting for

2957
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
for Switch. But Squeenix

2958
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
is actually thinking about

2959
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
the next Dragon Quest game

2960
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Dragon Quest 12. And it was even

2961
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
asked how is the 12th entry going

2962
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
and Horii said

2963
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I actually came up with the keywords but I can't see

2964
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
anything here. And he added

2965
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
that since Dragon Quest 11

2966
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
scenario was well received this time I went

2967
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
the same reception for gameplay systems

2968
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
but I could also surprise everyone and make it

2969
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
an epic. Now I just feel like teasing

2970
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
everyone and that it is still many

2971
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
years away. Hopefully enough time

2972
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
for them to get a new composer.

2973
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
And then

2974
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
for the other

2975
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
thing Capcom is working on

2976
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
a mystery game that will surprise

2977
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
and hopefully delight.

2978
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
They actually want to

2979
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
make a game. This was in an interview with

2980
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Famitsu.

2981
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Jun Takeuchi

2982
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
is you know their senior

2983
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
producer and is going over this.

2984
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
And says and if we keep gradually

2985
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
increasing the size of our stuff I'm thinking that at some

2986
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
point we might be able to handle four AAA titles

2987
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
at once.

2988
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So Takeuchi

2989
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
said we are currently working on a title

2990
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
that will make our fans think wow they're

2991
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
making that. So

2992
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I mean

2993
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I don't know they're already doing

2994
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
the Resident Evil 2 remake.

2995
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
That's

2996
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
not really a surprise.

2997
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So I mean

2998
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
we've already we've already had

2999
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Mega Man 11.

3000
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
And I'm trying to think of what

3001
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
would what would Capcom I mean

3002
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
if it's Rival Schools 3.

3003
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Fuck yeah. It better be.

3004
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Bitches you hear me.

3005
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
They've already had their first year of school

3006
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
they've had their second year of school we fucking need

3007
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
their third year of school. Maybe another Capcom

3008
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
versus SNK.

3009
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
No it's Rival Schools it better be.

3010
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Personally I prefer the Capcom

3011
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
SNK but I don't I don't hate her suggestion.

3012
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
So we had Chirich Justice Kakuen then we had

3013
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Moru Justice Kakuen which is burning.

3014
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
What would be even better than

3015
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
burning. You know we're still waiting

3016
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
on for crossovers though we never did get

3017
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
we got Street Fighter versus Tekken but we never got

3018
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Tekken versus Street Fighter. We're still waiting on that

3019
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
one. Yeah let's keep waiting. Yeah

3020
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I have a feeling. Maybe we'll have

3021
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
a Street Fighter versus Pokemon.

3022
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I would love that. Bob Coffee

3023
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
in chat says Rival Schools 3 technically

3024
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
already happened. No it didn't.

3025
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
No because um

3026
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Chirich Justice Kakuen

3027
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
had a sequel to that which was Chirich

3028
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Justice Kakuen to like the evolution

3029
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
disc or whatever. Moru Justice

3030
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Kakuen was a new installment in the

3031
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
series. Now

3032
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
even though you guys are joking about this whole like

3033
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Pokken thing I would I would be there

3034
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
in a heartbeat for Tekken versus Pokken

3035
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
but why not because Tekken has those fucking

3036
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
nuts characters like Panda

3037
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
and Bear and the tree thing.

3038
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I want Pokemon.

3039
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Oh well Pokken was Pokemon.

3040
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
It was

3041
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
a Tekken game.

3042
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
I want a Pokemon game with

3043
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Street Fighter. Oh so you want to go

3044
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
around and collect fighters and you know

3045
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Chun Li used spinning bird kick. It's super

3046
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
effective. You want that?

3047
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I just want another PlayStation All-Star game.

3048
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I know that they you know

3049
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
You know they're doing another jump

3050
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
superstar right? Yeah.

3051
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
It's got like all the Dragon Ball and

3052
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
What if it was Capcom versus

3053
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Shonen Jump?

3054
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Can I take another Tatsunoko Capcom game?

3055
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
I would love another Tatsunoko versus Capcom

3056
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
with you know actually playing on a good controller.

3057
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I did a double take when I saw an arcade machine on one of those

3058
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
at round one not that long ago. I was like what?

3059
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Anyway let's move on with the release dates.

3060
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I found out they have

3061
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
an arcade cabinet also for a Pokken tournament.

3062
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I did not realize that. Yeah.

3063
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I think they're obviously more popular probably overseas

3064
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
than here. 2019 by the way is the year

3065
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
we're finally going to get a local round one.

3066
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I downloaded

3067
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
an image of that.

3068
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Anywho. Did you know

3069
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
it is going in at the Galleria

3070
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
because they have the signs up for it now.

3071
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
It's the old Sears.

3072
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
As some speculated but here's the thing

3073
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
the first floor is round one.

3074
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
The second floor is going to be a new movie theater.

3075
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Yeah so interesting.

3076
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
It would be cool if we had another dinner theater except that's still way too far

3077
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
for me to drive. Yeah Roseville is kind of far.

3078
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Yeah I like the dinner theater.

3079
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I'm down with round one.

3080
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
You mean like the movie girl?

3081
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Yeah. They are building

3082
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
one at Waten El Camino.

3083
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
That's closer to me.

3084
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
You know the Walmart that flopped across the street.

3085
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Sorry local talk for a minute.

3086
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
The one that was the Montgomery Ward.

3087
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Yeah so across the street where they have Winco

3088
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
they're putting in so Macy's went away.

3089
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
But I think one of the other things that had gone away

3090
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
in there previously is going to be turned into another

3091
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
movie girl place. Well that's cool they're actually revitalizing

3092
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
the old country club shopping mall.

3093
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Which does tie to this show

3094
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
because Country Club Lanes the bowling alley

3095
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
across the street was like one of the places we used to play

3096
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
DDR all the time because they were the only

3097
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
place that had like fifth

3098
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
mix. They had a

3099
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Japanese first mix.

3100
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
They had something after that.

3101
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Yeah they were like the only ones that had fifth mix for a while.

3102
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
So yeah we used to go

3103
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
there like play midnight to three in the morning.

3104
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
But

3105
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I actually have been sitting on for a while.

3106
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
I won for my work and I haven't figured out what I'm

3107
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
going to use it for. I have a

3108
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
gift certificate for a party

3109
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
for 10 at

3110
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Country Club Lanes including laser

3111
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
tag and bowling and arcade gameplay

3112
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
and like we were going to

3113
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I was originally going to use it for like my

3114
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
son's birthday but then we're going to

3115
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
this broccoli farm to

3116
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
you know for his birthday.

3117
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
But

3118
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
yes this is what my wife has been

3119
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
wanting to do. She wants to tell

3120
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
them what they're going to. We're going to I finally convinced

3121
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
her that we're going to tell them on Christmas

3122
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
but right now

3123
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
you're going to have a blue harvest.

3124
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
This broccoli farm

3125
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
just makes me

3126
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
think of blue harvest.

3127
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Because that was originally this

3128
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
broccoli farm. We tell them that they're going to

3129
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
L.A. but they're like oh yeah we're going to the

3130
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
broccoli farm. You'll love it.

3131
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I don't want to go to a broccoli farm.

3132
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
This is terrible.

3133
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
This is when you first

3134
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
said you were going to have kids

3135
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
years and years ago. This

3136
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
was what I was waiting for were these

3137
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
epic fucking troll moves. I knew you were going to pull on

3138
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
the kids. It wasn't my idea. It was

3139
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
her idea. I think it's terrible. I don't

3140
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I don't know that. I don't

3141
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
I don't like it one bit. I

3142
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I keep telling them like don't worry

3143
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
you'll have fun. Don't worry

3144
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
it'll be fun. And they're just like I want to

3145
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
stay home. I don't even want to go on this trip.

3146
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
They're going to the broccoli farm.

3147
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I'm sorry

3148
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
it's my favorite thing.

3149
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
You're just going to just think

3150
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
what we do when we do twitch you're going

3151
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
to get to see the laughing. I'm like beat red

3152
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
right now. Her idea was to

3153
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
like not even tell them at all until we got

3154
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
there. Like we're going to just arrive

3155
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
there and then they're going to all of a sudden

3156
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
notice that hey

3157
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
there's this giant castle and lights and fireworks

3158
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
and shit. And what is this

3159
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
you know.

3160
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
So that's her idea. I wanted to tell

3161
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
them so they can look forward to it but

3162
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I will see. So you're going to do it on Christmas.

3163
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
You're going to say the broccoli farm is

3164
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
next door to Disneyland. So we're going to go to Disneyland.

3165
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Yeah. Broccoli farm

3166
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
burned down. Broccoli farm burned

3167
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
down. Knott's Broccoli Farm.

3168
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
It makes me think of

3169
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
the old deep thoughts of Jack

3170
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Handy. One day I took my

3171
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I said my nephews that I was going

3172
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
to Disneyland. We

3173
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
drove by an abandoned farm

3174
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
house. I said oh no Disneyland burned

3175
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
down and went home.

3176
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
The end.

3177
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
So anyways I don't even remember what the hell

3178
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
we were talking about. Oh release dates.

3179
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
We were going to do release dates

3180
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
but then you started talking

3181
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
about the broccoli farm. Which do they even fucking

3182
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
grow broccoli on a farm? Yes.

3183
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Sure they do.

3184
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
No Rob they pull broccoli out of their

3185
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
asses. We're on so many tangents I don't even remember where

3186
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
we are. And that's the shape of broccoli.

3187
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. It's shaped

3188
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
like a sphincter. Oh right right right.

3189
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
So yeah I was going to yeah because

3190
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
we the party that's right the party

3191
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I have. Oh right. I'm sitting on this I don't know

3192
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
what the hell I'm going to use it for now because I don't

3193
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
really want to wait until my next son's birthday party.

3194
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
It's 10 people that's not a lot so

3195
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I'm just like maybe just one of these weekends we'll

3196
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
just have an impromptu laser tag bowling

3197
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
arcade party

3198
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
for 10 people.

3199
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
We should just invite strangers.

3200
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I guess.

3201
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
And pizza they have pizza.

3202
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
All right.

3203
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Did you win 10 tickets to the broccoli

3204
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
farm? I did not.

3205
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Now I want to do I swear to

3206
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
God so you know now my brain is going

3207
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
on all these like tape segments I want to do for

3208
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
O.L.R. I swear to God Loki you and I are going

3209
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
to a broccoli farm and taping something for

3210
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
O.L.R. You know actually

3211
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Rob. What? Apple Hill

3212
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
has a tomato farm. Do they?

3213
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Actually Becky and I used to go

3214
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
there to pick heirloom tomatoes.

3215
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
I used to go to pet the alpacas. That's

3216
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
why I like Apple Hill.

3217
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
All right anyway. Let's go have

3218
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000

3219
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Let's travel

3220
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
around the world and check out release dates.

3221
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I don't know if there's a lot this week I think finally

3222
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
with Smash and Katamari and all that out

3223
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
I think we're finally kind of dying down

3224
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
but let's see. Apparently there's a broccoli farm

3225
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
in Salinas. Is there really?

3226
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Because there's this viral video of some

3227
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
boy named Max who really wants to go to a broccoli

3228
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
farm. Did something break behind you?

3229
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Oh I thought I heard like a smash.

3230
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Oh okay. Anyways

3231
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000

02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
letting you know.

3253
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Can we get broccoli tycoon?

3254
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
And last but not least

3255
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
on PC and Xbox One.

3256
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
And that's it. You know

3257
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
what's happening in the chat room now.

3258
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
If you go to live.vognetwork.com

3259
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Poppin Broccoli. Broccoli Eater 3

3260
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Broccoli vs Capcom. Broccoli

3261
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Defense Force. Dead by Broccoli.

3262
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Super Broccoli Brothers. I like Dead by Broccoli.

3263
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I hope to God YYR

3264
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
is listening tonight. That's all I have to say.

3265
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I think I want that. I also like Broccoli

3266
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
No Touch Gene. I kind of want

3267
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
like a game that's Loki

3268
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
and the family at the Broccoli Farm. Loki goes to

3269
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
the Broccoli Farm.

3270
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
You know what I would

3271
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I would do a children's book.

3272
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Really? Well she wanted

3273
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
to get them like t-shirts that said you know

3274
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I heart broccoli.

3275
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I can't make that happen.

3276
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
You know Broccoli 3.

3277
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I don't know.

3278
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I just think it's a bit elaborate to like

3279
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
upset them this much. And don't forget about the

3280
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
sequel. Kale Quest. Cause I'm gonna have to listen to

3281
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
eight hours in the car

3282
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
of like them complaining about this.

3283
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
And she does this a lot where she'll like

3284
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
stir them up and then she's like okay bye

3285
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
I'm leaving. And then I had to deal with the

3286
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
aftermath of like this bullshit.

3287
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
So.

3288
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Well you know what I said the sequel should be Kale

3289
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Quest.

3290
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
And we've lost Rob. I'm broken.

3291
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Okay. It's not

3292
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
even that funny. I don't know why I can't

3293
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
stop laughing. It's funny because it's not.

3294
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Coming out on the Playstation 4

3295
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
in Japan this week.

3296
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
God Eater 3.

3297
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
I hope God's eating his broccoli.

3298
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
He's broken.

3299
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
You're supposed to save this for the show when we have video.

3300
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
This is no good.

3301
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
It's not good radio.

3302
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
This is a teaser.

3303
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Rob loses his shit.

3304
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Okay.

3305
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
No broccoli does make you shit.

3306
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Didelius the Awakening of

3307
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Golden Jazz. Judge Eyes.

3308
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Shinigami

3309
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
no to Econ. Shinigami

3310
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
no broccoli. No more fucking

3311
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
broccoli. And Fortnite

3312
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Deep Freeze Bundle. Cause you know what they're

3313
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
freezing. Broccoli.

3314
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
On the Nintendo Switch this week

3315
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Didelius the Awakening of

3316
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Golden Jazz is on the Switch as well.

3317
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Peach Ball. Senran

3318
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Kagura is out as well. And there's

3319
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
some type of double pack with that as well.

3320
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Maybe it comes with broccoli. I don't know.

3321
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
There's also Mickey

3322
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
and Friends Special Card Pocket

3323
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
24. So it's like Disney branded

3324
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Switch stuff. Yeah. Sure.

3325
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Maybe

3326
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Loki can buy some at the broccoli

3327
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
farm. I don't know. Anyway.

3328
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Dark Sakura. What's coming out in the UK?

3329
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
You better get through this segment

3330
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
without naming a vegetable.

3331
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Aubergine.

3332
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Okay. My Little Writing Champion

3333
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
on December 14th. And the

3334
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
only other thing coming out that week

3335
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
V-Rally 4.

3336
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
On the 14th.

3337
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
You know what else they get?

3338
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Brussels sprouts.

3339
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Let's get

3340
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
to the mailbag. Because every week

3341
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
you guys email us.

3342
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3343
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
and Jamie will probably yell at me for not

3344
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
deleting old emails. You know

3345
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
that shit pisses me off.

3346
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
So just make sure they're from December 3rd or after.

3347
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I think there's only one from today. I think

3348
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
last I checked. But Dark Sakura

3349
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
is going to go to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3350
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
and read some of her favorite emails on the air.

3351
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Um. Yeah. There's one. Can I

3352
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
actually. Can we have a heart to heart moment?

3353
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Since we're doing. Talking about changes.

3354
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Um. Ch-ch-ch-changing.

3355
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
The lack of participation in this segment

3356
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
has me concerned. I'm thinking about getting rid

3357
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
of it. Um. So.

3358
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
You might want to give your feedback over

3359
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
on Twitter. At Twitter.com

3360
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
slash O-L-R. Should we continue to do the

3361
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
emails?

3362
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Because I just think people

3363
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
aren't writing emails anymore. They're writing Facebook

3364
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
messages. So I'm open to.

3365
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
So is that going to mean I'm going to have to read everyone's social media

3366
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
and critique them of the grammar? Well. I'm

3367
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
considering bringing back

3368
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
something akin to the Fugu question of the week.

3369
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
But obviously Google Plus is going away.

3370
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
So it'll either just be Facebook or social media.

3371
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Maybe something with Facebook and Twitter.

3372
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Maybe something with Discord. I don't know.

3373
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I would love to hear suggestions. But I just feel

3374
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
like email ain't it sis.

3375
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Because it's. Maybe it'll change

3376
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
when we get some new folks and stuff.

3377
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
But I just feel like you guys aren't.

3378
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Well I think for now if you want to send us

3379
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
anything on Twitter. Of course

3380
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
tag at O-L-R. But add

3381
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
your hashtag tweet O-L-R.

3382
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I don't know what that's going to do. But sure.

3383
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Because if we do it specifically to

3384
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
bring something to our attention or make a comment. Oh OK.

3385
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Then the hashtag tweet O-L-R

3386
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
is going to be directed to us. Alright.

3387
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Well I'm going to stew on that. I'm not saying it's going away yet.

3388
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
I'm just saying it's up.

3389
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
It is up for elimination. That is

3390
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
what I'm saying. So

3391
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
if y'all want to lip sync for your life and

3392
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
save the segment you can. But

3393
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
I'm just saying the emails of the week are.

3394
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
You thought your email sent.

3395
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
But it bounced.

3396
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Your email was stamped

3397
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
return to sender.

3398
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Winner winner

3399
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
chicken dinner.

3400
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Loser loser

3401
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
broccoli.

3402
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
I'm doing my

3403
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
my tricksy

3404
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
does RuPaul.

3405
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
To go with your RuPaul shirt.

3406
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
OK. Read the goddamn email.

3407
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
You requested that I stop it

3408
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
but instead I'm just getting started.

3409
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
OK. Hey everyone.

3410
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
One question for all of y'all.

3411
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
I don't remember if this was ever asked

3412
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
but is there a video game

3413
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
that you have played that has gotten you through a

3414
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
tough time in your life.

3415
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
For me it was Secret of Mana.

3416
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I know I have mentioned it but this game has got me

3417
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
through a rough time in my teen years.

3418
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
That's it. See you all on the flip side.

3419
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Ronma P.S. Shabbat Shalom Uchan.

3420
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Because it was

3421
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
as my rabbi said

3422
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
he said happy Shabbatica.

3423
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Because the seventh night

3424
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
was on Shabbat.

3425
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Alright. So

3426
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
as far as games

3427
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
that got me through a really tough

3428
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
position. Well certainly

3429
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
actually Legend of Zelda Link to the Past

3430
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I was really really unhappy

3431
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
for a while and that was just like my

3432
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
obsession of getting my head out of

3433
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
you know

3434
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
actually just getting myself out of my own head for a while

3435
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
and living in another world because the real world

3436
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
was absolute shit garbage.

3437
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Um.

3438
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Right now. Um.

3439
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I don't know if there's anything right now

3440
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
that's really doing it for me. I'll just go play

3441
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
pinball to get my aggressions out.

3442
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
I'm trying to think of something else

3443
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
that really kind of pulled me out of a

3444
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
tough loop.

3445
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I'd say the Guardian Legend did it

3446
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
for me for a while. It was sort of like having a sense

3447
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
of accomplishment when nothing else was going right.

3448
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Because the game was fucking hard.

3449
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
But.

3450
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Yeah. I don't know

3451
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
most of the video games I was playing were to get me

3452
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
not thinking about just

3453
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
all the garbage that was going into my life

3454
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
when I was a kid.

3455
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
So. That's it.

3456
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Um.

3457
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
So. To go from a

3458
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
very laughy note to a maybe somewhat more

3459
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
serious one. Um.

3460
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Dance Dance Revolution. Like.

3461
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Not to be too sappy but

3462
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
like those were not always

3463
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
the greatest years of my life.

3464
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Being just dropped out of college and

3465
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
dealing with a lot of things about myself

3466
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
that I was just learning in regards

3467
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
to who and what I

3468
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
was attracted to sort of thing.

3469
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
And it was not

3470
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
always the greatest period and I kind of

3471
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
actually fell out of gaming in general for a long time.

3472
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
But then

3473
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
you know Rocky Horror

3474
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
was a big part of that and so

3475
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
you know admittedly the first time I ever saw Dance Dance

3476
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Revolution was at a Rocky Horror

3477
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
convention. If you didn't know that story that is the

3478
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
absolute truth. The first time I ever played Dance Dance Revolution

3479
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
was at the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror convention

3480
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
at the Hard Rock Hotel.

3481
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
And honestly from finding

3482
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Dance Dance Revolution I met

3483
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
people that I'm doing this show with

3484
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
right now. Um.

3485
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Some other amazingly awesome people

3486
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
too. Some not so awesome people but you know

3487
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I'm just kidding. They're not around anymore.

3488
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
We don't talk about them. No. But no for real.

3489
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Like so many awesome people that are in

3490
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
my life including many of you that are

3491
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
still supporting this show to this day and all that.

3492
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
And like honestly like

3493
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
yeah. Like I didn't mean to go from

3494
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
like broccoli jokes to a really heavy

3495
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
response to your question but like

3496
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
what would

3497
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
this life be without

3498
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
what that game and that community

3499
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
and everything did for me. It's

3500
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
weird to think about. I mean

3501
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
for the most part I probably would have turned out somewhat

3502
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
the same but I probably would

3503
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
have this show. I wouldn't know you guys.

3504
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
It would be different. It would be so different.

3505
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
So. There you go.

3506
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I remember that first visit over to your apartment

3507
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
where we had to tread lightly.

3508
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Because I lived upstairs.

3509
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Yeah. And the downstairs neighbor

3510
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
who listened to gospel at 6 a.m. on a Sunday

3511
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
and always woke me up. I was afraid of you know

3512
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
getting her back basically. I don't know. She

3513
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
deserved it. Yeah. Probably.

3514
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
That was fun. I think I brought you

3515
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
third mix on that visit.

3516
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I think you did. You did because

3517
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I had that jungle mix dance pad and you brought

3518
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
it was you or my old

3519
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
crazy roommate that brought that.

3520
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I think we were both there that day. I think

3521
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
he brought the

3522
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
CD image. You brought the plug

3523
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
thing that let us play it. That's right.

3524
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Yeah. It was the

3525
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
what were they called back then? Not the game genie

3526
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
but it was. It was the plug thing

3527
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
in the back. Game shark. That was it.

3528
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
No. Anyway Loki do you have a question

3529
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
now that I've killed the funny

3530
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
mood? No. I

3531
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
don't have anything actually.

3532
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
So. Alright.

3533
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Maybe DDR I guess but.

3534
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I would think Earth Defense Force gave

3535
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
you a good distraction. Do you want another serious

3536
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
answer? World of Warcraft?

3537
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Because certainly that community

3538
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
did a lot for me too. You know I totally

3539
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
love my years doing Horde House

3540
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
and getting really involved with that community and

3541
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
many of the people that I met there that I'm still in touch with to this day.

3542
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
But I think also more importantly

3543
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
you know when Alan and

3544
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I first met which is weird to

3545
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
think about that like all of this would be chronicled

3546
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
on this show in the archives because

3547
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
this show has existed longer than I've

3548
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
known Alan which is a weird thought but it is what it is.

3549
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
This show's been on longer than I've been married to

3550
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Dan. Isn't it weird to think

3551
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
about before he had kids?

3552
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I mean it's just like this show has been

3553
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
so huge. But anyway

3554
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
in all seriousness because Alan and I

3555
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
were dating like long distance

3556
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
for a while. Well I mean I say long distance. What do you

3557
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
call it when like your boyfriend

3558
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
lives two hours away? So you

3559
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
can't see each other on weeknights. Moderately distanced.

3560
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Moderately long distance.

3561
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
But one way that we used to

3562
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
hang out and I'm using my

3563
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
cody fingers is by playing World of Warcraft.

3564
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I know that sounds so nerdy and so

3565
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
super weird but just being able

3566
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
to exist at the same time in the

3567
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
same space just kind of like

3568
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
being with each other even though you're not

3569
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
you know what I mean? Like you're not really with each other

3570
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
but you're kind of with each other. You're doing

3571
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
the same thing in the same place at the same time.

3572
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
When Dan and I started getting together you know

3573
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
after he called me when I had that bad breakup

3574
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
we were hanging out on AOL

3575
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
role playing

3576
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
in

3577
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
not Town Square Sailor Moon by that point.

3578
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I think we'd moved on to Kuno's Island

3579
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
was our chat room of choice.

3580
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
And we would exchange like bad fan fiction with each

3581
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
other. You know

3582
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
I'd critique the grammar because I've

3583
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
been doing that since I was in middle school.

3584
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Right. So

3585
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
yeah.

3586
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Alright.

3587
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Yeah thanks for the email even though it took us from

3588
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
by the way the broccoli is still going in the chat.

3589
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
But I did

3590
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
post a tweet I think you can appreciate

3591
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
I will not serenade everyone with Bob breath.

3592
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
You can probably appreciate this dark soccer.

3593
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I just took a screenshot of our chat room

3594
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
lit up with all the broccoli puns and I just

3595
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
put can't wait to bring this romper room fuckery to

3596
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Twitch.

3597
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
That's a good term for it.

3598
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Romper room fuckery.

3599
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
That means I actually have to sign into my Twitch account

3600
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
on my computer

3601
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
now. PUBG players unknown

3602
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
broccoli grounds.

3603
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
You guys stop.

3604
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
All right. That's it for e-mails.

3605
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
You can still e-mail us for now.

3606
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Participate at orangelaundrydo.com. We'll let you know in the next couple weeks

3607
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
what we decide to do with the segment. But for now

3608
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
send us e-mails because

3609
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
otherwise I'm going to talk about the hollow slice

3610
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
spectacular. What? I really don't like broccoli

3611
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
unless it's tempura.

3612
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I used to

3613
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
be a picky eater and I wouldn't really eat

3614
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
broccoli but now I actually find

3615
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
it to be one of the better greens.

3616
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I used to really like broccoli and now I don't

3617
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
unless it is blanched

3618
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
or tempura.

3619
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
I'll eat just like steamed. I love like

3620
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
a teriyaki chicken

3621
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
bowl that's like half broccoli

3622
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
anymore. No I'll do like broccoli

3623
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
on a chicken bowl. Just the littlest bit of teriyaki

3624
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
sauce on it. It's not kind of they'll want broccoli

3625
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
beef. I think I'm going to stop by Chinese on the way home.

3626
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
All right. Anyway. Moving on.

3627
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
We have more believe it or not

3628
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
video game related stories here. Loki. We do.

3629
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
We're not going to be talking

3630
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
about grand sets of broccoli I guess.

3631
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
All right.

3632
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
So Microsoft is looking

3633
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
to bring the game pass

3634
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
to other

3635
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
devices. They say every devices

3636
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
or every device.

3637
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
So of course they have it on Xbox.

3638
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I know that they're planning on bringing it to

3639
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
PC. So possibly

3640
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
maybe other systems

3641
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
as well. They're saying you know

3642
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
apparently

3643
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
there was

3644
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
a report from GameSpot

3645
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
that talked about

3646
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
it was during the Barclays conference

3647
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
where they're saying what do you

3648
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
when you think about reaching

3649
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
customer with this content

3650
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
where they're only compute device

3651
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
could be Android phone

3652
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
you think about

3653
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
well what are the ways

3654
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
that person pays for content

3655
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
today. So we built Xbox game pass

3656
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
started on console and it will come to

3657
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
PC and eventually it will come to every device

3658
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
we use the flywheel that we have

3659
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
with customers on Xbox

3660
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
to start the growth with

3661
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
in the Xbox game pass.

3662
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Not sure if this is something we'll see

3663
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
like come on other consoles.

3664
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
It would be neat if they

3665
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
did that. I just don't think that's going to happen.

3666
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
But it may be other

3667
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
maybe Xbox devices whenever

3668
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
that come you know whatever the next

3669
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Xbox system and stuff.

3670
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I just don't think that like you know

3671
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Xbox games on the switch

3672
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
is going to be a thing. Maybe

3673
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
though on Android and

3674
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
the other thing could be like on

3675
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
TV. So like you can get like an app

3676
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
or something that runs on like

3677
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
your Android TV

3678
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
or Roku or something like that.

3679
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
And

3680
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
you can get games through that.

3681
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I can't even look at you

3682
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
without thinking about the broccoli farm.

3683
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
But game pass

3684
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
yes game pass

3685
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
this makes sense for Microsoft

3686
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
to bring this everywhere. It's just a

3687
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
matter of time before they put it on the computer.

3688
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
It's already it's kind of already be there

3689
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
right. I haven't really explored that at Windows 10. But you would think

3690
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
like you can purchase it on

3691
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Windows 10. But I don't know if there's

3692
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
anything there's got to be a client inbound

3693
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
for Windows soon. There's just got to be like

3694
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
it makes sense for them to it's

3695
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
basically their answer to Netflix. It really is

3696
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Netflix we know makes oodles and oodles of money

3697
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
and it makes so much money that they're able

3698
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
to spend that money on making new shows

3699
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
like Sabrina and

3700
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Queer Eye I was just watching

3701
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
the other night and God Netflix makes

3702
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
so many fucking shows now and they're

3703
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
doing it all from subscription dollars.

3704
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
They're watching Adam Maroon's Everything.

3705
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Although I don't think that was a Netflix original show.

3706
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
But that show is awesome.

3707
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Anyway

3708
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
let's move on to a console

3709
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
that probably won't have game pass but

3710
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
boy this sounds

3711
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
like a fucking mess and

3712
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
believe it or not it's something that Soulja Boy

3713
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
has a hand in. Soulja Boy

3714
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Soulja Boy

3715
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
is making a new console

3716
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
called the Soulja Game Console

3717
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
and handheld. Well let's

3718
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
just be honest here he's not making shit.

3719
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
He's just lending his name to it.

3720
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Probably more like.

3721
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
But anyway the handheld is going to play

3722
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Switch, 3DS, Vita, Neo Geo, GBC

3723
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Game Boy, GBA games. 3,000

3724
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
of them built in.

3725
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Well that doesn't sound like a lawsuit waiting to happen.

3726
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Anbernic

3727
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
is the developer of this

3728
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Soulja Watch console

3729
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
or whatever it is. Anyway

3730
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
it's a Chinese retailer that puts a lot of

3731
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
this together and I guess these

3732
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
consoles are retro mini video

3733
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
game consoles and yeah

3734
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
basically it's going to be just

3735
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
an emulator box and

3736
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
lord knows what kind of games

3737
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
are on this thing that are of

3738
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
questionable legalities.

3739
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Yeah so anyway.

3740
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Which I like how they had like

3741
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
you know Tumor, Lara Croft

3742
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
and like Tekken characters

3743
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
and shit advertising this and like

3744
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
they're asking for trouble.

3745
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
You know what's funny is if you want to buy the console

3746
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
and the handheld together it's

3747
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
$199 but if you

3748
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
want to just get the direct version without the

3749
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Soulja Boy stuff on it $105.99.

3750
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Right.

3751
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
It's just it's a quick

3752
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
cash in is all it is. It really is.

3753
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
It really is. They're just taking the broccoli

3754
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
and running. Uh Dark Sakura

3755
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
what do you have for us?

3756
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Uh broccoli. No I'm

3757
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
kidding. I have

3758
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Nintendo news kind of.

3759
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Build-A-Bear is

3760
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
working with Nintendo to have

3761
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
a few plushies in their shop.

3762
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
One of them

3763
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
is two different colors of Yoshi.

3764
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
One of them

3765
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
is a Bowser and the other one is

3766
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
a bear that gets Mario outfits

3767
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
and there's also

3768
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
a piranha plant.

3769
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Um it is a

3770
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
stuffed piranha plant for $10.50

3771
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
and a kind of freaking want one.

3772
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Um

3773
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
but there's also it looks like there's like little

3774
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
you know accessories you can get like

3775
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
a Yoshi coin wrist accessory

3776
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
and just all kinds of cute stuff

3777
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
um even the Bowser for

3778
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
as mean as he as he looks he looks really

3779
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
adorable. And of course there's the Mario

3780
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
and Luigi outfits. Um

3781
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I'm actually going to their collection page

3782
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
just to have a look at it.

3783
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
And um so let's

3784
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
see what else we've got on here. Ugh

3785
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
stop it. I hate whether

3786
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
you went without cookies.

3787
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Bitch I might.

3788
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Um but there's also like a little

3789
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Yoshi hoodie and a Princess Peach

3790
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
dress. And

3791
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
uh you

3792
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
can get like Bowser five and one

3793
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
sounds and you can get the Super Mario

3794
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Brothers theme song. So it's

3795
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
kind of cute you know.

3796
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I would actually get just the Yoshi

3797
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
hoodie for one of my ball

3798
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
jointed dolls. But yeah

3799
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
pretty cute.

3800
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Yeah I

3801
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I wouldn't mind getting some of this stuff

3802
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
from the Build-A-Bear stuff. I think it would be really

3803
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
cute. So um

3804
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
I did do uh like a Pikachu

3805
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
one once. It was super cute.

3806
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
So. Remember the one that

3807
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
um we got for Allen? Mhm.

3808
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
We got him a

3809
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
a cat. It was the Hello Kitty Ursula.

3810
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Yeah Ursula. Yeah we still have that.

3811
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Hello Ursula.

3812
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Yeah it's great.

3813
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Alright uh let's just do

3814
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
a couple more stories Loki. And then we're gonna open up the

3815
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio all one word

3816
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
on Skype. But I'm gonna

3817
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
warn you guys if we don't get a lot of calls tonight we're just gonna

3818
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
end the show cause it's already almost nine o'clock so

3819
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
we've been running along tonight. So Loki. So apparently

3820
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Steam is kind of walking back

3821
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
this whole allowing sex games

3822
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
on their platform. Mainly

3823
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
they're cracking down on

3824
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
some of these games that depict

3825
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
um girls

3826
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
that might look a little young.

3827
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
How has the Steam. How long has the

3828
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Steam store been open? Like how

3829
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
how are we just now having this

3830
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
conversation about you know maybe

3831
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
sex games

3832
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
featuring characters that are insinuated to be

3833
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
minors could possibly

3834
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
be a bad. I mean come on.

3835
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
It's 2018. Why are we talking about this now?

3836
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Steam

3837
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
you are a mess. So apparently

3838
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
yeah there was um one of the

3839
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
publishers affected by this was a game

3840
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Hello Goodbye and they

3841
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
have games

3842
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Cross Love Hello or yeah

3843
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Cross Love Hello Goodbye and

3844
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Emotionalist. I guess

3845
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
we're for a couple of the games that were

3846
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
in question. The

3847
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
publisher of Hello Goodbye they said that

3848
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
the Steam version

3849
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
had to be censored

3850
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
and could not have adult content.

3851
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
But the other

3852
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
I don't know the other ones

3853
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I'm not sure what they're going to be doing there but

3854
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
apparently it says um

3855
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
you know these scenes aren't

3856
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
there to be artificially

3857
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
shoehorned in. It says that while they

3858
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
do exist further proof of

3859
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
the characters ages

3860
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
beyond the disclaimer in the beginning

3861
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
explicitly states that they're um

3862
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
them being 18. So the real reason

3863
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
they're there is to further

3864
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
many a times the themes of the

3865
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
story. So what they're trying to

3866
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
say is basically that you know

3867
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
they're pushing a story narrative

3868
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
but I don't know

3869
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
I guess it's just a style you know this

3870
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
lowly style

3871
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
that's in the game. I don't know whatever

3872
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
it's going to either be on the platform or it's

3873
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
not going to be on the platform and

3874
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
there's other platforms that can host those

3875
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
type of games.

3876
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Alright uh but you really

3877
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
shouldn't support those games

3878
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
that are you know

3879
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
gross. Like that's just

3880
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
like some things are just don't need to

3881
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
be existing and

3882
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
games that have young young girls

3883
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
like that no just no all the no.

3884
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Alright uh anyhow

3885
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
ending on a very serious note tonight this is

3886
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
this is sad and yes it does relate to Orange

3887
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Lounge Radio watch this. Pete Shelley

3888
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
which Jason did reference

3889
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
in the intro so I'm finally getting around to what

3890
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
he talked about there in the intro but Pete Shelley

3891
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
who was the leader of the punk rock

3892
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
band the Buzzcocks died

3893
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
this week at the age of 63.

3894
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
So um he passed this week and I know

3895
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
he's been very influential but did

3896
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
you know a club mix

3897
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
of one of his songs was once in

3898
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
DDR?

3899
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
What?

3900
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Well

3901
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Are you telling me it's a cover?

3902
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
No it's

3903
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
it is

3904
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
it is a sample of his voice

3905
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
based on the song that he obviously did

3906
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
so if you remember

3907
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
the song Telephone Operator from

3908
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
DDR that was Pete Shelley

3909
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
who was the voice in that song

3910
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
unfortunately he passed away this week at

3911
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
63 so rest in

3912
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
peace.

3913
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
That is it for this

3914
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at least the

3915
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000

3931
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
literally ended me like I'm actually kind of glad

3932
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
it's getting out of my system tonight so I can be

3933
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
a professional next week.

3934
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Hold on

3935
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000

I'm a professional alright well what's

02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
on your mind tonight besides making fun of me?

3941
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
You mentioned two buck

3942
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
chuck that's not professional

3943
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
you know it's like four buck chuck now

3944
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
you

3945
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
you are the Blanche Gemero

3946
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
of OLR okay? You can still get the tamponio

3947
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
from Trader Joe's that I like for three bucks

3948
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000

3949
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
oh good

3950
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
lord people okay look

3951
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
this Playstation class thing had

3952
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
me rolling the fact that you can

3953
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
plug in a keyboard and hit

3954
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
escape and you get these

3955
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
I'm just laughing

3956
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
about all of that I'm just

3957
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
wow. We knew it was gonna

3958
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
happen we just didn't think it would be so easy

3959
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
the keyboard they probably tested like a

3960
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Sony keyboard that they probably tested in

3961
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
house probably didn't work

3962
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
and in house

3963
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
in their QA department they probably just have a bunch of

3964
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Sony keyboards it's just probably have

3965
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
it's probably however they

3966
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
decided to the device ID

3967
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
however they're filtering that for

3968
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
some reason it's not catching everything and so

3969
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
it's catching or allowing certain

3970
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
things to work on it

3971
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
that's exactly what I was thinking

3972
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
so Loki nailed that right on the head

3973
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
but

3974
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
it's kind of interesting that this comes up in

3975
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
topic because I decided to break out my

3976
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
SNES classic and actually

3977
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
pack it and put some custom ROMs on there

3978
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
and when I was

3979
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
getting my stuff together I forgot

3980
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
a friend of mine gave me a Raspberry Pi 3

3981
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
so I think in the next few

3982
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
couple of weeks I will be putting together my own

3983
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Playstation classic

3984
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
and the thing is I'm just doing it because

3985
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
I can do it you know

3986
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
and

3987
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
it's interesting

3988
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
that

3989
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Jamie mentioned Wanderer Some Ease

3990
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
because that was one of the games I

3991
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
wrote my SNES classic and I remember playing

3992
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
the hell out of that game

3993
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
it was a good game

3994
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
there's some good underappreciated classics

3995
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
I'm really surprised we haven't already

3996
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
heard Nintendo start talking about

3997
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
a classic NES 2

3998
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
or something along those lines but maybe

3999
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
that's something that's going to be next year I don't know

4000
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
also they probably have the Switch Online

4001
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
thing they're kind of looking at right now

4002
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
because December's games are going to be out

4003
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
this week I think is when the December

4004
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
games hit which Ninja Gaiden

4005
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
I know is one of them that's a pretty big deal

4006
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
I don't remember all of them but I know Ninja Gaiden

4007
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
was the one that really caught my eye

4008
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
but after this month we don't know what

4009
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
they have on deck for January, February, March

4010
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
so it's going to be interesting to see how that continues to

4011
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
grow out

4012
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
well I don't have the Switch

4013
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
just yet I know Mako-chan

4014
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
she has a Switch I was there

4015
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
when she bought it so you know she'll probably jump on

4016
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
that right there

4017
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
oh thank you Ninja Gaiden, Wario's

4018
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Woods and Adventures of Lolo

4019
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
we're looking at Broccoli 3 nice try

4020
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Adventures of Lolo are the games

4021
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
that are coming out that's right Lolo I love the soundtrack

4022
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
to Lolo it's such a cute little soundtrack

4023
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
I don't know I enjoyed the

4024
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
soundtrack more to Adventure

4025
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Island you know I love Adventure

4026
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Island I wish they would put that game out you know Adventure

4027
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Island is just

4028
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
what did they call Adventure Island

4029
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
when it was on Turbo Graphics

4030
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
when it was an original Hudson game

4031
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
oh no they did get it as Adventure Island

4032
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
on Turbo Graphics though I know

4033
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
it was based on another series

4034
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
was it Monster Boy?

4035
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
I think it was Monster Boy

4036
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Wonder Boy

4037
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
I think I know what you're talking about

4038
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
I know on Turbo Graphics it was called New Adventure Island

4039
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
there was a spinoff of these games

4040
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
on Sega and I had one of them

4041
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
I think it was called Revenge of

4042
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Drankon or something like that

4043
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
it basically was part of the whole Adventure Island

4044
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
family but it was just like a

4045
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
offshoot of it and I used to play that

4046
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
all the time on my Game Gear

4047
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I loved Adventure Island on the

4048
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Nintendo I remember that was one of the early Nintendo

4049
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
games I played and had that cute little

4050
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

4051
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

4052
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
and like one of the power-ups was randomly

4053
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
like a skateboard

4054
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
maybe someone from Konami

4055
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
is listening maybe we'll get a new

4056
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Adventure Island for our next gen console

4057
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
oh honey if anybody from Konami was listening

4058
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
they unsubscribed a long time ago

4059
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
sorry to say

4060
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I don't know

4061
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Twitch may give us a second chance

4062
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
a lot of that though because I think

4063
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
there's definitely going to be a lot of people that are like

4064
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
that shit's still on

4065
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
that's

4066
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
that's usually the reaction I get

4067
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
when somebody's like oh yeah I remember

4068
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
O.L.R. I'm like actually we're still doing it

4069
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
that shit's still going?

4070
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
I just

4071
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
realize you know

4072
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
going through my archives I've been doing my podcast

4073
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
I've been doing my podcast for ten years

4074
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I'm just like wait

4075
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
how do we do ten years

4076
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
and not do a ten year show

4077
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
I'm like did we do it or did I

4078
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
actually forget you know

4079
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
I'm just like wow

4080
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
I distinctly remember

4081
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
the early shows

4082
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
I remember that house we were in

4083
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
I remember having the people over

4084
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
I remember how they were all like big parties basically

4085
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
I remember some of the subsequent shows

4086
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
but I just I feel like I'm like

4087
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
all of that was across a scope of

4088
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
sixteen years

4089
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Jesus

4090
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
and like then I have to sit here and think about

4091
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
okay we call this studio

4092
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
N7 because it's the

4093
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
seventh studio

4094
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
and the first was that house

4095
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
I was renting a room in where my

4096
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
roommate was like totally cool with us doing the show

4097
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
the second was

4098
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
oh it was when I lived with you

4099
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
then the third

4100
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
was

4101
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
that when I was at that other house

4102
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
and then we were doing it at Dark

4103
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Socrates for a bit

4104
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
oh there was the apartment with Extrofer

4105
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
that was the studio

4106
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
see I can't even remember

4107
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
World of Warcraft

4108
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
oh that too yes

4109
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
oh my god he was so good at Devil's Crush

4110
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
you know what he's really good at now actually

4111
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I know we haven't had Extrofer on the show in a long time

4112
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
you know what he's moved on to

4113
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
he actually moved back east

4114
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
that's one of the reasons we don't really get to hear from him a lot anymore

4115
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
is all about Tetris Effect

4116
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
he had like a top 100 score

4117
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
at one point yeah he's really into it

4118
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
so

4119
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
that's pretty impressive

4120
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
yep

4121
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
well Rama anything else on your mind before we wrap up tonight

4122
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
yes

4123
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
in response to bringing

4124
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Romper Room to Twitch

4125
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
yes I can't see you

4126
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
as Miss Molly I just

4127
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
can't no

4128
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
but I can't see you

4129
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
as Miss Frizzle driving all of us in a

4130
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
magic school bus okay

4131
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
that I that that that

4132
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
that do that

4133
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
I can see that easily hands

4134
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
down

4135
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
I'm fucking excited yes

4136
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
let me answer a question

4137
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
is this related to the call Act Broccoli wants

4138
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
they're all fucking changing their names to Broccoli

4139
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
in chat Act Broccoli wants to know

4140
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
what number was the studio when you started broadcasting

4141
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
on Justin TV that would have been

4142
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
number 4 because that was before

4143
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
your house right Dark Sakura

4144
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
and then there was the house

4145
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
that was the one that was in Rancho

4146
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
so that was 4 because then it was your house after that

4147
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
then it was my apartment

4148
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
and then it was here yeah because we were moving

4149
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
out of the house right so we moved

4150
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
to the apartment because we didn't have a studio

4151
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
space at the rental

4152
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
right so it was number 4

4153
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
yeah yeah

4154
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
that would have been after the Exeter

4155
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
apartment yes

4156
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I miss Jeremy

4157
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
there you go alright

4158
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Rama I'm gonna let you go buddy okay

4159
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
one more thing I promise you

4160
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
this whole thing about

4161
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
not having to be forced to wear pants

4162
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
during Twitch I feel you on that

4163
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
believe you me I feel

4164
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
you on that to be fair

4165
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
because one of the things

4166
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
that makes OLR unique is that we are

4167
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
in the same room when we do this all

4168
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
out of respect for Loki and Jamie

4169
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
I do wear pants when we do

4170
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
the show but I have been known to

4171
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
wear like gym shorts

4172
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
pajama bottoms a hoop skirt

4173
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
a Snuggie

4174
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
a Snuggie definitely have done

4175
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
shows in a Snuggie did you see that they've actually

4176
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
revitalized the concept of the Snuggie but

4177
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
as like a big cloak

4178
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
it's like a big Sherpa

4179
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
lined like a blanket

4180
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
like a cloak with a hood

4181
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
with a hood awesome

4182
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
but to be fair I might have thought about it

4183
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
I'm not gonna promise that Snuggies are gonna go away

4184
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
dude if you

4185
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
if you start wearing Snuggies I know the rest

4186
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
of my staff will on the benefits

4187
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
side I have like 60 different

4188
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
geek shirts I will be sitting here wearing

4189
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
a different shirt every

4190
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
week

4191
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
tigerclaw on chat says do you also wear a tank top

4192
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
oh no I don't have a body for a tank top

4193
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
um right now I have a

4194
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
RuPaul what you can

4195
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
wear whatever you want I don't want

4196
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
to wear a tank top until I got guns

4197
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
um but right now um I have

4198
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
a RuPaul shirt on maybe I'll wear it next week

4199
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
too it says step your pussy up

4200
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
okay

4201
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
okay so just so you have an idea of the

4202
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
wardrobe I'm gonna be bringing to OLR

4203
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
okay okay alright alright

4204
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I know I said last thing and I'm getting out of here

4205
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
but what can I say I just

4206
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I bring the comedy and I bring the pain

4207
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
to the show um

4208
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
in response to the whole soldier console

4209
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
uh huh you can find

4210
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
the same one on

4211
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
AliExpress for 75

4212
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
dollars oh yeah no that came up right at the end

4213
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
there I don't know if you heard of it yeah

4214
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
a bunch of people went digging for it

4215
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
I'm just laughing I'm just like

4216
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
who wants to buy that garbage

4217
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
nobody's gonna buy that garbage

4218
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
also by the way the retro core who does

4219
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
battle of the ports also

4220
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
does reviews of those knockoff multi

4221
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
cart systems and

4222
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
his reviews are actually pretty honest and show them

4223
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
running like not emulated

4224
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
he'll do some of them through um

4225
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
a capture but he'll also show them on

4226
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
the tv and on the screen

4227
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
and what they actually look like and take them apart

4228
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
I'd say before anyone buys any of the knockoffs

4229
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
like that check out Retro Core's

4230
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000

for Kingdom Hearts that probably

4244
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000

4245
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000

there's that um

4250
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
there is a game called I guess

4251
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
Satisfactory which

4252
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
was it's okay it was on steam

4253
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
um and it got delisted

4254
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000

hmm

4259
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
I'd be curious about that I mean did it break a rule

4260
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
what happened

4261
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
um

4262
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
yeah I don't

4263
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
know maybe he they just delisted

4264
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
too I don't know

4265
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
no we'll see maybe a deal

4266
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
they they worked on with them

4267
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
well we're gonna wrap up here in studio thank you guys

4268
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
so much for tuning into another week of Orange Lounge

4269
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Radio uh we'll be back to do it all again

4270
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
uh in seven days although

4271
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
it may have a fresh coat of paint but

4272
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
uh we're really excited about that thank you guys who

4273
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
stuck with us over the years through the

4274
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
thick and thin and all the broccoli uh if

4275
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio I'm gonna tell you

4276
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
the same thing uh tell a friend or two

4277
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
about the show help us spread the word because we are the show

4278
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
where every gamer has a voice but we can only put

4279
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
those voices out there if they're actually you know here

4280
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
in the studio to be able to air um

4281
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
bear with us there's gonna be some changes

4282
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
ahead and I know a lot of people don't like

4283
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
change but I think in the long run even

4284
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
though the first couple shows might be rough

4285
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
um I think it's gonna be a change is inevitable I think it's gonna be

4286
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
a great thing I really do I'm really excited

4287
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
to welcoming more people to OLR

4288
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
uh doing some more things with visibility

4289
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
uh and just it kinda

4290
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
and I responded to a tweet about this

4291
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
today um you know was

4292
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
kinda like it's a new era it's a really big change

4293
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
for OLR but you know what we've been here before

4294
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
uh at one point uh

4295
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
we were doing a three hour show about nothing but

4296
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
DDR and music games and at some

4297
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
point we actually had to say you know what

4298
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
that that isn't really working for us anymore let's

4299
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
just discuss all games like we're doing on

4300
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
our podcast uh that

4301
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
has uh gone on and uh

4302
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
you know that was a big change or you know

4303
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
speaking of when I used the phrase all games

4304
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
when we left our live 365

4305
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
network to join the all games network and

4306
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
then when we made that change in the all games network

4307
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
to come here to to VOG those were all

4308
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
big changes too and you know those were all very important

4309
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
eras of the show that made this show

4310
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
what it is but it was a change and anyway

4311
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
my point is with all those changes

4312
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
um it helps things not get stale

4313
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
and so not to say that like I'm feeling

4314
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
stale around here cause especially after tonight

4315
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
I mean you know it was a funny fuckin

4316
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
show and we had some good moments but

4317
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
you know I think I think that type of stuff like

4318
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
really just kinda motivates you to keep going and so

4319
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
when someone asks me in the

4320
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
future OL that shit

4321
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
still going OLR it's still going

4322
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I can say yeah and it's

4323
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
even better than you remember

4324
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
so thank you guys uh so

4325
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
much for supporting us uh over the years

4326
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000

me if we're right back here on Shoutcast in a week

4330
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
I know I've done a lot of hype but technical issues

4331
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
we're gonna be doing a lot of changes

4332
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
so I have to make sure the technical issues are 100%

4333
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
cause I'm not doing a show

4334
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000

02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000

4336
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000

4347
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Carl

4348
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000

4349
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
things okay

4350
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
I eat hands and I kill

4351
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
people sorry

4352
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
I'm thinking of uh llamas

4353
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
llamas with hats

4354
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
uh my final

4355
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
thought tonight is um

4356
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
look to the sky yes it is

4357
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
uh Loki your final thought tonight

4358
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
I don't know I wanted to do

4359
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
another llamas with hats reference but

4360
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
sadly I am a bit rusty when it comes with

4361
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
llamas with hats

4362
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
just remember there was

4363
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
I have a craving

4364
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
that only hands will satisfy

4365
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
I don't remember exactly

4366
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
I don't know

4367
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
go watch the whole series it's awesome

4368
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
which by the way

4369
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
isn't there supposed to be another

4370
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Charlie the Unicorn thing that they're working on

4371
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
