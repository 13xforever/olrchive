7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week we bid a fond farewell to our telephone operator, Pete Shelley. Nese Palares and Det, but I believe he found his.
20000	27000	Stay tuned for more stories, happy, sad, hilarious, and facepalmy, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	44000	It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with our 755th episode for this December the 9th of 2018.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.
51000	60000	For the last time tonight, before you panic, of course I'm talking about the last time on Shoutcast, allegedly, assuming all of the tech tests and all that stuff go well.
60000	68000	Next week, live, we will be over on Twitch, and I'll reiterate, we've been talking about that for a few weeks now, but I'll reiterate that in a minute.
68000	74000	In the meantime, joining us for this special episode of Orange Lounge Radio, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
74000	75000	Sup bitches.
75000	78000	Welcome back, nice to have you here without the use of radio magic.
78000	79000	Happy Hanukkah.
79000	80000	That's what I was going to say.
80000	87000	Instead tonight we have Hanukkah magic bringing DarkSakura to the studio, but Hanukkah magic is the real deal.
87000	88000	She's here live.
88000	89000	I sure am.
89000	90000	It's great to have you.
90000	91000	I'm trying to get back in the chat.
91000	101000	And you know what is very special about Jamie being here is that, and you know tonight is a special night because Jamie actually got in the kitchen and cooked for the show tonight.
101000	107000	Now, before y'all send your hate mail, I would never make those types of jokes anymore, however.
107000	108000	I did it on purpose.
108000	111000	She did it on purpose because of the holiday.
111000	119000	As the token Jew, I have to, you know, we have a, Loki here is our Jew adjacent.
119000	120000	We needed latkes.
120000	121000	Yes.
121000	124000	And I have my candles on fire right now.
124000	125000	Yep.
125000	126000	So we have.
126000	127000	And they're on full blast.
127000	128000	Tonight's the last night.
128000	129000	Tonight is the last night.
129000	130000	So it's every candle.
130000	136000	So I have two Hanukiah with all nine candles on it because you have your Shamash and your eight candles.
136000	137000	Right.
137000	138000	The, the, the one that lights the others.
138000	139000	Eighteen candles.
139000	140000	That's right.
140000	141000	I hope the house doesn't burn down.
141000	144000	You get to blow them out when they graduate high school.
144000	147000	Now you get to follow miss crackers recipe.
147000	148000	Sis degree.
148000	149000	Very.
149000	155000	Um, I actually just bought straights kosher latke mix and did it from a box.
155000	162000	And dark soccer of course is reading from our live chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice geeks network.
162000	171000	Twitch TV slash vog network and a vog network.com and a, you can actually follow us live over at live dot vog network.com.
171000	174000	And again, we're trying to make everything with the change as seamless as possible.
174000	181000	Uh, if you go to live dot vog network.com next week, what you're going to see is instead of the regular chat room, you're just going to see the Twitch with us there and all that stuff.
181000	189000	So, um, hopefully for those of you that go to live dot vog network.com out of habit and the fact that I'll probably still say it on the show because I've been saying it for years.
189000	194000	Um, that will still work as a portal to where we are taping live.
194000	196000	And if you're listening on the podcast feed, then great.
196000	197000	You can keep doing that.
197000	201000	Uh, everything will still be as it is on the podcast feed as we've been saying for weeks and weeks.
201000	208000	Um, so I don't want to dwell on it too much tonight because again, we're still waiting on the final things to arrive from a technical perspective.
208000	212000	And then we're going to kind of remodel this room in some ways to get it broadcast ready.
212000	216000	And uh, yeah, we're aiming for next Sunday being the first show.
216000	225000	That way it gives us kind of like gives us two or three weeks and then in 2019 we're going to go full steam ahead with the promo and about really trying to get out there about like,
225000	233000	Hey, did you know that these old assholes who've been doing this show since their mid twenties are still going and they're going now on Twitch.
233000	234000	Won't that be fun?
234000	235000	Yep.
235000	236000	All right, well say hello to that old asshole.
236000	237000	It's tech master Loki.
237000	238000	It's here every week.
238000	239000	Hello.
239000	240000	How are you doing Loki?
240000	241000	I'm fine.
241000	247000	It's funny because you were talking about that you were doing your own Twitch stream playing DDR this week and you're doing a stream on Thursday night.
247000	248000	Right?
248000	249000	Yes.
249000	250000	Were you still doing Euro mix or are you back on max now?
250000	252000	I'm on Euro mix too.
252000	253000	Okay.
253000	254000	I'm still playing that.
254000	255000	Okay.
255000	259000	And so you've been doing some DDR on your Twitch stream and then as you were like, you were like, why isn't anybody here?
259000	260000	Where did everybody go?
260000	262000	And Oh yeah, the game awards were tonight.
262000	263000	Right?
263000	265000	Well, sometimes there aren't, isn't anyone there.
265000	272000	So, and it wasn't exactly the most, um, a smooth going stream.
272000	276000	I had a ton of drops for some reason, which I never have that issue weird.
276000	281000	Um, and then also the kids came out and said that the cat had gotten into our bedroom somehow.
281000	284000	And so I had to go fish her out of that in the middle of the stream.
284000	289000	And then it took me four reboots that finally get your mix to, to boot up.
289000	293000	So it was like really being a pain in the ass.
293000	294000	It's okay.
294000	297000	It's as I mentioned on the stream several times, you're a mix too.
297000	300000	It's just like, it's confusing.
300000	304000	It is such like this weird, ugly stepchild of the DDR series.
304000	308000	Not to say it's bad, but it's like max too was pretty streamlined.
308000	313000	You know, you had your options menu where you put in your speed mods and difficulties and stuff like that.
313000	314000	And it's all makes sense.
314000	316000	You're a mix too.
316000	320000	When you select the song, you select the difficulty after you select the song, all of your mods,
320000	326000	including speed mods have to be done with foot panel, um, combos like you would in like fourth mix.
326000	327000	Oh God. All right.
327000	328000	It's fucking weird.
328000	329000	All right.
329000	330000	It makes no sense whatsoever.
330000	335000	And then like on top of that, you can't do speed mods or any other mods in nonstop.
335000	337000	So at least I haven't figured out a way to do that.
337000	341000	And nonstop is integrated into the neural, um, song selection.
341000	346000	So when you first start off, it says nonstop and you can select that and it goes in the nonstop mode.
346000	348000	It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.
348000	353000	And for anybody that hasn't played DDR in a long time, that whole last two minutes of you ranting probably didn't make any sense either.
353000	356000	It was based off of max two.
356000	359000	Just leave it how max two was put different songs in there.
359000	360000	Done.
360000	361000	You don't have to do anything else.
361000	363000	They said they like, let's fuck it all up.
363000	366000	Let me go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com for some comments.
366000	371000	A dark Tetsuya says, so next Sunday is like the soft launch slash beta test slash working out the kinks.
371000	372000	Yes.
372000	373000	Fallout 76 launch.
373000	374000	It is.
374000	375000	It is absolutely that it is.
375000	376000	It is.
376000	380000	It is a well it's vog early access starts next week.
380000	382000	You have to understand we're going the AAA route.
382000	383000	So we're launching this.
383000	385000	It's feature complete.
385000	386000	Absolutely.
386000	394000	That's what next week bugs that are in there are complete, which is funny because next week is OLR 756.
394000	396000	So it's kind of works.
397000	399000	Kinda sorta.
399000	405000	Anyway, also in our chat, see a Tiberian chat says in insert Blanche, Devereaux, the change memes here.
405000	411000	That's a very, that's a very apropro comparison is that OLR is going through menopause.
411000	412000	Would that be correct?
412000	413000	Dark soccer.
413000	415000	OLR is going through menopause.
415000	418000	I would say we're actually getting ready to graduate high school.
418000	423000	I would, I would say with this move to twitch, we're going to go hang out with the cool like going to college.
423000	424000	Yeah, we're going to hang out.
424000	425000	It's like Jerry blank.
425000	428000	You know, I'm back in school from strangers, the candy.
428000	429000	Yeah, I never watched.
429000	433000	Well, how about how about Sally O'Malley from Saturday Night Live?
433000	436000	I'm 50, 50 years old.
436000	437000	You know what?
437000	441000	We're going to be going to college and learning how to hang out in coffee shops.
441000	442000	Right.
442000	446000	We're going to hang out with the cool kids like Ninja and have a cool have CBV vapes.
446000	447000	Yep.
447000	453000	I'm cool like Ninja and sneak a Boone's Strawberry Hill from our older friends.
453000	455000	We're not playing enough Fortnite to be cool.
455000	457000	So, you know, Sonic Fox.
457000	459000	I got he's gay, black, furry.
459000	461000	I got one of those three things going for me.
461000	464000	So, you know, we were cool with them.
464000	466000	It is become gay and furry.
466000	467000	Stop it.
467000	468000	All right.
468000	471000	Going to our chat at live dog network dot com.
471000	474000	Act Def says Ninja doesn't hang out with girls, though.
474000	476000	Well, you know, married, though.
476000	479000	Neither neither do I wink.
479000	480000	Well, that's a lie.
480000	481000	I don't count.
481000	485000	No, you totally count because without girls who would go shopping for shoes with me.
485000	488000	I mean, you you serve a very important.
488000	489000	Do you know how many drag queens I know?
489000	491000	I can hook you up.
491000	492000	Let's see.
492000	493000	Also in chat.
493000	500000	No, I I hope you all know these are just jokes because I know we live in a clip happy, you
500000	502000	know, world and that whole thing.
502000	505000	So please, I hope you all know we're just having a good time here at all.
505000	507000	They could bring up all my old shit on Twitter.
507000	509000	I don't fucking care.
509000	510000	That's the problem.
510000	511000	It's like, you see, I don't care.
511000	514000	I'm not going to resign from whatever political position I'm in.
514000	515000	I'm well, I already know.
515000	519000	Well, I mean, there was I I don't hold any political office.
519000	522000	There was that part of me that's like I could never run for political office because of
522000	524000	the things I've done.
524000	526000	But now look at who's the fucking president.
526000	530000	It's like, wow, you can do the worst things in the world and still be president.
530000	531000	Like it's it's amazing.
531000	533000	Anyway, let's see.
533000	535000	Going to chat at live dog or dot com.
536000	540000	See it to bury says, wait, so this is all ours live action, soft reboot kind of kind
540000	541000	of.
541000	542000	All right.
542000	543000	Let's let's move on.
543000	549000	We got a lot of gaming news to cover because we had a pretty big television event or technology
549000	551000	television event that happened this past week.
551000	553000	Loki, the game awards.
553000	554000	Yes.
554000	557000	So you turn off your stream and you started watching the game awards a little bit.
557000	558000	Yes, I did.
558000	559000	What do you think I did?
559000	560000	Because I was disappointed.
560000	562000	All zero watchers of my streams.
562000	564000	I'm humble bragging that I got a whole zero.
564000	565000	There you go.
565000	568000	That's way, you know, anyways.
568000	570000	So, you know, I did watch the game awards a little bit.
570000	572000	So they had lots of announcements as they always do.
572000	574000	It's, you know, one half the reason.
574000	578000	Well, most the reason you turn tune is probably just to see all the trailers and stuff that
578000	579000	they're going to show.
579000	582000	So this is kind of run down some of the things that they announced.
582000	589000	So they had a game called Sayonara Wild Hearts, which was coming to the switch and like pretty
589000	590000	awesome.
590000	591000	That was the one that you were talking about.
592000	599000	That's sort of like an album by Annapurna Interactive and it looks great.
599000	600000	Like music game.
600000	604000	It almost looks a little bit like elite beat agents sort of.
604000	605000	I hope.
605000	607000	Let's not get our hopes up for something that amazing.
607000	608000	But no, it looked pretty sweet.
608000	612000	So very stylized, kind of a music game, a little bit punk.
612000	615000	So that was pretty neat.
616000	625000	And then, of course, there was a brand new game called Journey to the Savage Planet,
625000	628000	which looked like some sort of survival game.
628000	629000	I didn't really get.
629000	632000	I missed this trailer, unfortunately.
632000	637000	So that's supposed to be coming out next year on all major platforms.
637000	642000	And then, of course, they announced the console version of the Stanley Parable.
642000	647000	The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, which is also going to have new endings and different
647000	651000	branching paths and gamepad controls.
651000	654000	I think that's great and all, but it does feel a little late.
654000	658000	Like this is the type of thing they really should have put out one or two years ago.
658000	659000	Right.
659000	661000	I mean, well, is Switch one of the consoles?
661000	662000	It's never too late to do a Switch port.
662000	664000	I don't remember if the Switch is one of the consoles.
664000	667000	Everybody wants their game on Switch at this point.
667000	670000	It would be neat if they patched that stuff into the PC game, too.
670000	674000	Because I have to go back and play it to get that achievement for not playing it for five years.
674000	678000	So I think that's due in the next few days for me.
678000	682000	Well, and I think that also just goes to show that, like, OK, that game's been out a while.
682000	685000	So it is a little weird that it took this long to go to consoles.
685000	688000	But a good game is a good game, no matter what.
688000	690000	You know, people are mega hyped.
690000	693000	Maybe perhaps the gentleman who was on before us at the voice.
693000	695000	I was hoping it would have been a sequel to the Stanley Parable.
695000	699000	Is one of the people that gets really hyped about Katamari Damacy getting re-released this week.
699000	701000	So you know what? Old games can still be fun.
701000	706000	But I'm hyped for the PC version, which will eventually get hacked to put all sorts of fun stuff in there.
706000	708000	That's what I'm hyped about.
708000	710000	Mission, roll up all the dildos.
710000	713000	That's a good call. Which one do you buy?
713000	715000	The PC one? Because you know modding's coming?
715000	717000	Or do you get the Switch one for the portability?
717000	722000	You buy both, because the PC version, there was a site that had it for $10 cheaper, so I got it for $18.
722000	723000	Look at you.
723000	728000	Versus $29.99, because that's way too fucking much for, you know, buying it twice.
728000	734000	You buy both, so that Namco will continue to invest in the series, and hopefully make another one at some point.
734000	737000	Yeah, but they really half-assed put that remaster.
737000	741000	They put it out the same day as kind of another big deal sort of game.
741000	744000	I mean, that's one issue. That's fine. I mean, it happens.
744000	746000	Physical version is only available at GameStop, by the way.
746000	751000	I know. That's limited. It's just like, I really hope they aren't expecting $11 billion sales of this.
751000	753000	But I want that game to do well. Anyway.
753000	756000	There's a game called Among Trees. It looks pretty nice.
757000	761000	So that's coming out on Steam Early Access in 2019.
763000	765000	And that's a Survival Sandbox game.
765000	773000	This was kind of unexpected. A Switch exclusive game, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, the Black Order.
773000	774000	Kind of looking forward to that.
774000	777000	That looks pretty awesome. I am definitely down with that.
777000	781000	So that, I'm guessing, is coming out next year as well.
781000	783000	I'm wondering if it's just a timed exclusive.
783000	792000	I would assume it's timed exclusive. Or maybe the console version, or Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is getting a different type of game.
792000	794000	Or a little bit more expanded game. We'll see.
794000	799000	But that's coming out. And that's by Team Ninja as well.
799000	802000	Oh, Nintendo's publishing it. Well, that's why it's a Switch exclusive.
804000	806000	Let's see. What else?
806000	810000	Supergiant has a new game coming out called Hades. It looks pretty sweet.
810000	814000	Much like all the other games. So that'll be probably next year as well.
814000	820000	Oh, actually that's launching in the Epic Games Store, which we'll be talking more about later.
820000	824000	So that's something that Early Access there.
824000	830000	Far Cry New Dawn, which is launching February 15th for $40.
830000	835000	And it's going to be a sequel to Far Cry 5 that's set kind of in this post-apocalyptic future.
835000	839000	Apparently that spoils the end of the game, I guess.
839000	845000	I still haven't finished Far Cry 5. I don't know if I will, but it looks awesome.
845000	852000	It's got saw blade guns and it looks kind of like Rage. Rage 2, I should say.
852000	857000	Scavengers, which is like a sci-fi co-op game.
859000	866000	Let's see. They had Crash Team Racing was kind of unexpected. So there's a new Crash Racing game coming.
866000	870000	Dead by Daylight is getting a new chapter.
870000	876000	So they've got a chapter 10 of Darkness Among Us, which is coming out, I guess, this week.
876000	881000	They have a new killer called The Legion, which... I don't know.
881000	888000	It sounds like... I swear there was someone that had the name The Legion or something that was like a villain or something.
888000	893000	And then there's a new special power called Feral Frenzy as well.
893000	896000	Still haven't played that game. Probably won't.
896000	902000	Monster Hunter, there's a game called Dauntless that sort of looks like Monster Hunter.
902000	906000	In fact, when I saw the trailer for it, that reminded me of Monster Hunter quite a bit.
906000	911000	But it's coming to Switch and Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and even mobile next year.
914000	916000	Let's see, what else?
916000	920000	Game called The Last Campfire, which was by Hello Games.
920000	923000	So that was kind of unexpected that that was going to be coming out.
923000	928000	And they're calling it Hello Games Short, so I'm guessing it's not a very long game.
928000	935000	The one that really caught my attention, though, of course, was The Outer Worlds, which is a game by Obsidian.
936000	946000	And it looks fantastic. It's like a cross between Fallout New Vegas and Mass Effect and just Borderlands and all sorts of fucking awesome shit.
946000	952000	And I actually watched some gameplay of this. I posted a link on Twitter earlier today, and it looks great.
952000	955000	So I'm really looking forward to this.
955000	964000	It's kind of something to satiate the appetite of people that were hoping for a new Fallout-type game and got disappointed with Fallout 76.
964000	969000	So, yes, definitely looking forward to that quite a bit.
969000	971000	Other fun stuff.
971000	975000	They talked about PUBG's new map, which is all wintery.
977000	984000	There's a new gigantic survival MMO, Atlas, that's by the people that did Ark Survival Evolved.
984000	990000	There's a thing about Wizards of the Coast and pushing Magic Arena with some esports thing.
990000	993000	They made a teaser for Dragon Age 4.
996000	998000	Well, supposedly that game is a ways out, too.
998000	999000	I expect you have questions.
999000	1002000	Yeah, I suppose that game is a long way out.
1002000	1004000	Yeah, it's all soulless twerking.
1004000	1007000	Yeah, it's a very, very light teaser.
1007000	1010000	They had another trailer for Psychonauts 2.
1011000	1016000	They showed off a Stranger Things game that was kind of looking a little bit 16-bit.
1016000	1018000	I gotta be honest, it looked kind of crap.
1018000	1021000	Well, that's kind of the gist of the mobile phone, Stranger Things.
1021000	1023000	It's kind of like a retro style, and it's okay.
1023000	1027000	For a mobile phone game, it's okay, but it's not something I would spend a lot of money on.
1027000	1030000	It's kind of like garbage. I'm just not very interested in that.
1030000	1033000	Mortal Kombat 11, so that's coming out in April.
1033000	1036000	So last week's rumors came to light, apparently.
1036000	1037000	Yeah.
1037000	1041000	That was one of the trailers. I will admit, I didn't really watch the game awards.
1041000	1043000	I just forgot they were happening.
1043000	1046000	Man, they're like, hey, it's time to vote.
1046000	1049000	And then it's like a week later, the awards happen, and I always forget.
1049000	1051000	Like, oh yeah, they're gonna be on.
1051000	1055000	And to be honest, all the trailers just show up right there on Twitter anyway.
1055000	1059000	They get retweeted, and somebody's following it and cutting the trailers as it goes.
1059000	1061000	They just all show up online right away.
1061000	1063000	So I saw that trailer for Mortal Kombat 11, of course.
1063000	1066000	I'm not super big on the violent.
1066000	1072000	It's almost like too much now, but it looked, for what it is, it looked cool.
1072000	1076000	But obviously, you were seeing a lot of pre-rendered stuff.
1076000	1078000	But I imagine it's gonna look great.
1078000	1081000	Mortal Kombat 10 or X or whatever, it looked great.
1081000	1083000	So I have no reason to believe 11.
1083000	1084000	It's probably 10.
1084000	1088000	Here's the thing. They actually said, they did call it Mortal Kombat X,
1088000	1092000	but they completely acknowledged it was a play on, you know, 10.
1092000	1095000	But I think it's X because that series is extra when it comes to fighting games.
1095000	1097000	It's very, very extra.
1097000	1101000	So yeah, 11 is going to be continuing that, you know,
1101000	1104000	rampantly violent stuff, clearly, through the trailer.
1104000	1105000	All right, cool.
1105000	1109000	And then, of course, they announced that Persona 5's Joker
1109000	1114000	is gonna be the first DLC character for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
1114000	1117000	So that got everybody excited because they're like, well, shit.
1117000	1119000	You know, now they're really putting anybody in this game.
1119000	1124000	So be curious to see what the other four fighters are gonna be.
1124000	1127000	Didn't pick up the game, though. Thought about it.
1127000	1129000	Yeah, that, oh, you didn't pick up Smash?
1129000	1130000	You're like the one person that didn't.
1130000	1135000	Well, like, I just bought my kids, like, four Switch games for Christmas.
1135000	1137000	The money thing is real. I understand.
1138000	1139000	My wife an air fryer.
1139000	1140000	Yeah, I know.
1140000	1141000	And a robot vacuum cleaner.
1141000	1144000	Well, maybe somebody will buy that for you for Christmas.
1144000	1145000	Maybe that'll be a nice thing.
1145000	1147000	And books and, like, all this other shit.
1147000	1154000	So, yeah, it's been, I didn't pick it up because I didn't know if I'd get to play it.
1154000	1158000	I didn't want to fight the kids for the Switch.
1158000	1161000	And I know they'd play it, but, like, I don't know.
1161000	1165000	Going back, I mean, we can get into a little more of that on our gaming week.
1165000	1167000	But going back a little bit to the Game Awards itself.
1167000	1171000	Obviously, the Persona Smash thing is, like, it's pretty cool.
1171000	1178000	It's cool, but, you know, also, I'm certainly, like, but they haven't put Persona on a Nintendo platform.
1178000	1179000	There was a 3DS game.
1179000	1182000	Oh, God, that seems so obscure.
1182000	1188000	I guess you're right, but that just seems like you would think, like, this is gonna motivate them to put Persona 5 on Switch.
1188000	1189000	Master Chief.
1189000	1190000	Or something you would think. I don't know.
1190000	1191000	I don't know.
1191000	1197000	I don't know. But, oh, you think Master Chief in Smash? That's going a little far. I don't know about that.
1197000	1200000	But, uh, okay. I mean, I think it's cool. Don't get me wrong.
1200000	1205000	You know what? No, no, not Master Chief. We'll just put Terry Crews in Smash.
1205000	1206000	Just Terry Crews.
1206000	1207000	Just Terry Crews.
1207000	1210000	Why not one of the Viva Pinata? There was a 3DS game for Viva Pinata.
1210000	1211000	Fuck Viva Pinata.
1211000	1213000	Or Minecraft Steve. That would be...
1213000	1215000	Yeah, I think Minecraft Steve is very...
1215000	1217000	Minecraft Steve would be way more likely than Master Chief.
1217000	1224000	Yeah, because that would be the big Microsoft, like, oh my God, but there's a ton of people that play Minecraft on Switch.
1224000	1228000	Or is there, like, because PUBG doesn't really have any characters.
1228000	1230000	No. Yeah, no.
1230000	1232000	Or not PUBG. Fortnite.
1232000	1238000	Uh, they could, but I just, yeah. I think we're going a little crazy with the Switch stuff now.
1238000	1241000	Or the Smash stuff now. I think it's just, uh, you know.
1241000	1248000	I mean, now it's like, I think what's happened is that, wait, if they can put a Persona character in Smash, they can do literally anything.
1248000	1254000	So now all of these, like, fan-wank obscure, because nobody was going to predict that Persona thing. Nobody was going to predict that.
1254000	1257000	So now it's like, literally everything is on the table.
1257000	1260000	So as much as you might be laughing at, like, come on, they're not going to put Minecraft...
1260000	1264000	But they did Persona. Anything is possible, y'all.
1264000	1265000	Super Meat Boy.
1265000	1268000	Why not? That'd be fun.
1268000	1270000	Well, Shovel Knight was in the first game, right?
1270000	1273000	No. There was always a Shovel Knight amiibo, and I think there was Shovel Knight Assist.
1273000	1280000	But Shovel Knight was not a character, and a lot of people were pushing for indie representation in Smash, like Shovel Knight, Shantae.
1280000	1282000	Remember, there was a big campaign about that.
1282000	1287000	Uh, so, uh, but none of that has come to light as of yet, but again, anything's possible.
1287000	1289000	They should've just had a lot more characters in 5.
1289000	1292000	I'm sure. Oh, there'll be more. There'll be more.
1292000	1297000	Anyway, uh, so you actually, admittedly, I didn't really watch the Game Awards. I don't think Jamie did either.
1297000	1300000	What did you think of the bits and pieces of the actual show that you saw?
1300000	1302000	Because I remember the last time I did see it, I was like...
1302000	1304000	They had, like, the orchestra stuff was really awesome.
1304000	1308000	Honestly, the last time I watched it, it was like, you could do a lot worse. It really wasn't bad.
1308000	1316000	It was... it's kind of like picking up the excitement for where, like, E3 may have lacked in some places, I guess.
1316000	1322000	I don't know. I think it was nice to have all that stuff there, and all the announcements and everything.
1323000	1326000	Uh, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1326000	1332000	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf does point out Joker is in Persona Q2 for the 3DS, so he is in a Nintendo game.
1332000	1334000	It's... still, it's pretty, uh, pretty deep cut.
1334000	1338000	Uh, Bobby also suggests the Fortnite Battle Bus in Smash.
1338000	1343000	There is some type of car. I don't... I don't know what it was, but we were...
1343000	1347000	So, uh, Friday night, some friends and I got together and we were playing a little bit of Smash.
1347000	1351000	Somebody got a frickin' thing that looked like a pitobus showed up and started driving around the stage.
1351000	1353000	And I was like, what the fuck even is that?
1353000	1355000	I was like, what's the reference?
1355000	1357000	Like, I'm trying to catch all these deep cut gaming references.
1357000	1360000	There's some deep cut gaming references in Smash.
1360000	1361000	Nintendo Labo.
1361000	1362000	That's my favorite part.
1362000	1363000	Uh, let's see.
1363000	1369000	ActDeftInChats does point out Shovel Knight is an assist trophy and Shantae is a spirit.
1369000	1372000	So they did at least do some type of nods to those games.
1372000	1373000	I mean, I don't know.
1373000	1374000	It's something.
1374000	1378000	And Bobby also points out there is a Labo thing in Smash.
1378000	1379000	Of course there is.
1379000	1380000	Of course there is.
1380000	1384000	Nintendo will stop at nothing to self-promote, I'm very sure.
1384000	1386000	Oh, it's Cap'n.
1386000	1387000	Oh, it is.
1387000	1391000	ActDeft says Cap'n from Animal Crossing has a bus in Smash as an assist.
1391000	1393000	You know, his spirit stage.
1393000	1395000	I just had to play that today.
1395000	1397000	I can't fucking beat it.
1397000	1398000	It is so annoying.
1398000	1402000	His spirit stage has a constant wind effect on it.
1402000	1405000	And if you touch the water, pretty much you die.
1405000	1406000	Your character drowns.
1406000	1407000	With some exceptions.
1407000	1408000	The water is lava.
1408000	1409000	The water is lava.
1409000	1410000	So here's the thing.
1410000	1411000	Here's the thing though.
1411000	1412000	I know somebody in chat is about to yell this.
1412000	1417000	I already know if you attach the Snorlax spirit, which is a little further down the road, you
1417000	1418000	can avoid the wind thing.
1418000	1419000	It doesn't push you back as bad.
1419000	1421000	But it still pushes you.
1421000	1427000	And then you get, god damn it, what's that big orange bird in Yoshi?
1427000	1428000	Damn it.
1428000	1432000	But you get her up the road too and that completely negates the water thing.
1432000	1434000	So you can actually be in the water.
1434000	1435000	So, it helps.
1435000	1438000	And I heard there's some characters that don't drown in the water.
1438000	1439000	Right.
1439000	1443000	Well, if you have those certain spirit affictions, you won't.
1443000	1444000	But here's the thing.
1444000	1448000	Those attachments will not suggest.
1448000	1452000	Like, I was just letting the computer suggest what to use every time.
1452000	1456000	But it was not picking those for me on a stage where I needed it.
1456000	1461000	It kept giving me stuff where I start with a dark scythe and things like that.
1461000	1464000	And then the other thing, excuse me, you kind of have to watch for is that not only do you
1464000	1472000	have the World of Light mode, but you have that other mode that will just randomly spawn
1472000	1477000	like six different, and then it starts to grow, like different spirit things you can
1477000	1479000	challenge at any time and they rotate out every five minutes.
1479000	1482000	Like, don't forget about that because if you dip in there every now and then you can
1482000	1485000	grab some stuff that you can then use in the World of Light mode.
1485000	1487000	So, there's that.
1487000	1489000	Anyway.
1489000	1491000	So, look at that.
1491000	1493000	We're supposed to be having a conversation on the Game Awards and it all ended up on Smash.
1494000	1496000	That's just, that's what it's going to be this week.
1496000	1499000	I'm pretty sure any gaming show you're listening to this week is just going to lose their shit over Smash.
1499000	1502000	And that's just how it is in the gaming industry this week, I suppose.
1502000	1503000	So.
1503000	1504000	Yeah.
1504000	1509000	Anything that you saw in the Game Award things and those trailers?
1509000	1510000	Anything that really stuck out to you?
1510000	1513000	I know you called out a couple of those things that looked interesting to you,
1513000	1517000	but what would you say out of all that that they showed are you really looking forward to, Logi?
1517000	1522000	You know, actually the new Far Cry game, although I wonder if I'm actually going to play it
1522000	1525000	because I've seen them buy these Far Cry games and I get tired of them really fast.
1525000	1529000	But, Far Cry, the new one looks pretty good.
1529000	1531000	So, I'm interested in that.
1531000	1535000	And then also, of course, the Outer Worlds looks awesome.
1535000	1537000	Like, I would definitely pick that up.
1537000	1540000	Just the world and everything seems really cool.
1540000	1543000	It's very much like Fallout New Vegas.
1543000	1547000	Like, the vibe is just like, this is totally how we should.
1548000	1552000	And what's great is they have dialogue trees like you would in the other games.
1552000	1557000	And you can pick a dumb dialogue tree so that you're an idiot.
1557000	1558000	And it's hilarious.
1558000	1563000	Just the response is like, not everybody is...
1563000	1564000	I forget.
1564000	1567000	Just go watch the clip they posted online because it's hilarious.
1567000	1571000	Just the different dialogue trees that they have there and picking the dumb option each time.
1571000	1576000	It's just the sarcastic option that they had in Fallout 4 or whatever.
1576000	1579000	I forget what it was, but it looks awesome.
1579000	1581000	I really want to play that game.
1581000	1582000	Alright, cool.
1582000	1586000	So, any suggestions for next year's Game Awards?
1586000	1588000	Because I noticed in chat at live.vongnetwork.com,
1588000	1592000	Kaijuto says, Game Awards were good, just chill with all the trailers.
1595000	1599000	No, I mean, I think it was fine the way it was.
1599000	1602000	I guess we'll just have to see...
1602000	1605000	Some of the words are really quick.
1606000	1614000	I don't know if we necessarily need best e-sport personality or best YouTuber or whatever.
1614000	1616000	I think that's kind of...
1616000	1620000	That really I don't think needs to be there, but it is.
1620000	1621000	Right.
1621000	1623000	Trying to give a nod to the community.
1623000	1628000	Well, as far as honestly, one of the few things I did see from the whole event
1628000	1633000	was when SonicFox won that award for the best e-sports personality.
1633000	1639000	And he gave a great speech that I couldn't help but sit there and just go, yes.
1639000	1641000	I just thought he was awesome.
1641000	1646000	So, on one hand, Loki, as much as I understand that maybe we don't need the personalities
1646000	1650000	as much in the game thing, I was like, that really was one of the best moments, at least for me.
1650000	1652000	I'm just glad Ninja didn't win it.
1654000	1655000	He's overexposed.
1655000	1656000	It's overexposed.
1656000	1658000	Same thing with PewDiePie.
1658000	1661000	PewDiePie's not so bad anymore.
1661000	1665000	He's not in the forefront as much.
1665000	1668000	Maybe he's listened to some of the feedback he's gotten about some of his poor decisions.
1668000	1669000	I would assume.
1669000	1670000	I don't know.
1670000	1672000	But, like...
1672000	1674000	S2100Matt says Ninja won, though.
1674000	1676000	So, he must not have seen that part.
1676000	1677000	Ninja's not an e-sports guy.
1677000	1678000	Oh, that's right. Yeah.
1678000	1681000	He didn't win the e-sports thing. He did win best...
1681000	1682000	Yeah, yeah.
1682000	1683000	Best Fortnite player.
1683000	1684000	Yeah.
1684000	1685000	Yeah.
1685000	1686000	And he got it.
1686000	1689000	And Tigerlaw says he only got famous because of the whole Drake thing.
1689000	1690000	Well, you know what?
1690000	1691000	Whatever. Do what you gotta do.
1691000	1692000	I know. Do what you gotta do.
1692000	1694000	I'm not gonna hate Ninja.
1694000	1695000	I don't know the guy.
1695000	1696000	I don't watch his stuff.
1696000	1700000	But I do think some people are just, like, overexposed.
1700000	1701000	And it doesn't make...
1701000	1704000	You know, you can't help but go, ugh, again?
1704000	1706000	Like, there's certain celebrities, right?
1706000	1709000	You see them in a trailer and you're like, ugh, again?
1709000	1711000	Tom Cruise still making movies?
1711000	1712000	You know?
1712000	1713000	Those types of things.
1713000	1715000	I don't know. I can't explain it.
1715000	1716000	But anyway.
1717000	1721000	S2100mattinchat says he won content provider.
1721000	1723000	Yeah, I know.
1723000	1725000	Like, whatever.
1725000	1726000	You know, it's fine.
1726000	1728000	I don't have to like these people.
1728000	1729000	It's fine.
1729000	1732000	And I don't even know who he is.
1732000	1736000	Or, like, I don't even watch his content.
1736000	1739000	So I don't know why I would not like him in the first place.
1739000	1740000	It's just...
1740000	1742000	Just like the stories I read.
1742000	1748000	Like, I guess we're talking about, like, how he goes and, like, tries to ban different players off of Fortnite for...
1748000	1753000	He claims that they're stream sniping him, but they just may best him somehow.
1753000	1758000	And so then he'll go and get them, like, perma-banned from playing Fortnite.
1758000	1760000	That seems a little dickish.
1760000	1763000	And that, I guess, has the impression I have of him.
1763000	1765000	But I don't know.
1765000	1766000	Do I fucking care?
1766000	1767000	No, I don't.
1768000	1769000	Alright.
1769000	1770000	Well, let's see.
1770000	1772000	Go into our chat at live.vognetwork.com.
1772000	1773000	Bobby Blackwell says,
1773000	1774000	I'm fine with Ninja.
1774000	1776000	I've seen some of the interviews he's given outside of our gaming realm.
1776000	1778000	And he's pretty much the face we need right now.
1778000	1781000	He says all the right things to the right people in the right language.
1781000	1786000	Like his CNBC or MSNBC interview right after the Drake thing.
1786000	1788000	Akuma JP says,
1788000	1790000	I dislike Ninja character, though.
1790000	1792000	The way he looked down to other people.
1793000	1794000	Alright.
1794000	1797000	Anyway, let's move on from the Game Awards.
1797000	1798000	Yeah.
1798000	1800000	I need to thank Akuma JP, by the way.
1800000	1801000	Oh, me too.
1801000	1804000	Because Dan super loved his present.
1804000	1806000	Oh, yeah, because you haven't been here for a little bit.
1806000	1807000	So Dan had a birthday while you were out.
1807000	1811000	And you had Akuma JP kind of help you with some shenanigans, right?
1811000	1816000	So Dan's birthday present this year was Red Dead Redemption 2 Special Edition.
1817000	1821000	The Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box for PS2.
1821000	1825000	And Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn, thanks to Akuma JP.
1825000	1827000	And Dan was absolutely thrilled.
1827000	1831000	So thank you for helping me make my husband's birthday a success.
1833000	1836000	Well, why do we transition from that into our gaming weeks?
1836000	1840000	Because after all, this is the part of the show where we talk about the types of video games we've been playing this week.
1840000	1844000	So I imagine maybe some playing of that around the Summers household.
1844000	1848000	Well, of course, there's been a lot of Red Dead Redemption 2.
1848000	1854000	We also picked up, well, by we, I mean I braved the crowds.
1854000	1857000	Picked up Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
1857000	1859000	And it's been really fun.
1859000	1863000	Dan's actually been tackling the unlocking while I've been at work.
1863000	1865000	And we got a new pinball.
1865000	1868000	We got Monopoly, Stern's Monopoly.
1868000	1871000	And apparently it was a home use only machine.
1871000	1872000	It hasn't touched an arcade.
1872000	1874000	It is in glorious condition.
1874000	1876000	Just needs a little bit of cleanup.
1876000	1881000	And that's really been the major gaming that's been happening in my house.
1882000	1883000	Cool.
1883000	1885000	Alright, then we'll move right on over to Loki.
1885000	1886000	How was your gaming week?
1886000	1888000	I played a few things this week.
1888000	1895000	So I finished, like I've gotten to a point now in Pokemon Let's Go.
1895000	1898000	I think I am basically done with the game.
1898000	1900000	I finished the game.
1900000	1904000	I beat all the Final Four or whatever with my, you know,
1904000	1911000	Uber level Pikachu that basically just single handedly took down the whole Final Four or Elite Four or whatever.
1911000	1913000	And then I beat them again.
1913000	1921000	And then I guess you can go back and fight, like refight the other gyms as well if you want to.
1921000	1926000	Now you've got to the point where you have to fight the different Pokemon masters.
1926000	1930000	They're masters of like Pikachu and all these other like things.
1930000	1933000	So you have to have basically the same Pokemon as them and you fight them.
1933000	1936000	And it's a hassle. I don't want to do it.
1936000	1941000	So I don't really know if, I think I'm kind of done with the game at this point.
1941000	1947000	My Pokedex isn't filled up all the way, but it could be if I just transport a few other things.
1947000	1951000	In fact, I got to do that because I got to, you know, unlock my stupid Meltan.
1951000	1956000	So I have to keep putting new Pokemon into the Pokemon Go park.
1957000	1959000	And do all that crap.
1959000	1961000	So I'll probably still play it.
1961000	1966000	I've been occasionally swapping Pokemon out into the, oh, and I caught Mewtwo.
1966000	1972000	So I've caught everything in the game, all the like legendaries and stuff.
1972000	1974000	They make a vaccine for that, you know.
1974000	1975000	Yes.
1975000	1982000	So I've caught all the legendaries in the game and I don't know.
1982000	1985000	I'm kind of getting like bored with it, I guess.
1985000	1987000	But it's alright. It's an okay game.
1987000	1993000	I just, I don't really want to grind just to like beat all of the Pokemon masters because why?
1993000	1997000	I don't know. There's not really any more story left in the game.
1997000	2000000	Like once you've got the Go park and you're getting your Meltan boxes, it's kind of like,
2000000	2006000	well, there's not, except just the incentive of I beat a fucking Pokemon game.
2006000	2009000	Yeah, I beat a Pokemon game. It was good.
2009000	2014000	I mean, I like the story of it and everything and I would like to, you know, play through more of them and stuff.
2014000	2020000	But I just, eh, I don't know if I really want to play like the end end game that they have here.
2020000	2023000	There's not really, maybe like they'll add stuff to it later on.
2023000	2027000	But right now it's like there's not a whole lot in the incentive for me to,
2027000	2032000	let's go capture a ton of Pokemon so we can get some candies to level up like a stupid Oddish
2032000	2034000	so that I can become the Oddish master.
2034000	2036000	And who gives a shit about that? No one does.
2036000	2041000	So I don't know. Or, oh, let's say try to chain catch 31 of these things
2041000	2044000	and just keep trying to catch the same Pokemon until we find a shiny.
2044000	2049000	That doesn't really sound like my sort of fun.
2049000	2050000	Shane would be into that.
2050000	2053000	I just, I just don't want to do it right now.
2053000	2056000	I have more, you know, I have other games I could be playing.
2056000	2062000	You know, Red Dead Redemption 2 or, fuck, I could, there's so many games.
2062000	2063000	Dude, the horses poop.
2063000	2064000	Huh?
2064000	2065000	The horses poop.
2065000	2068000	Yeah. Horses do poop.
2068000	2070000	I mean, in the game, I thought it was cool.
2070000	2072000	Yes, they, they're ultra realistic.
2072000	2073000	And then their balls shrink.
2073000	2074000	Yes.
2074000	2076000	Um, and then what else?
2076000	2084000	So I was at the store this week and so I got to try out one of those arcade, one up arcade cabinets.
2084000	2092000	So I played some, um, Missile Command and Crystal Castles.
2092000	2099000	And, you know, really, I hate track balls, but track ball controls work pretty good on those games.
2099000	2100000	So I'm not complaining there.
2100000	2101000	That actually worked.
2101000	2103000	It's a pretty good use case right there.
2103000	2107000	Um, so I tried those out and then what else?
2107000	2111000	I did more Pokemon Go.
2111000	2113000	I played some of that.
2113000	2117000	Um, gosh, I don't know.
2117000	2122000	Uh, Dance Dance Revolution Euro Mix 2, as I mentioned, I've been playing that this week.
2122000	2126000	I've been kind of swapping through some of the different mixes I can put on the cabinet.
2126000	2128000	I'm kind of getting tired of all of them.
2128000	2133000	Um, I'm probably, I'm really leaning towards a step mania cabinet cause it's going to be,
2133000	2139000	you know, a lot easier to add new songs to it, to keep everything fresh and interesting
2139000	2143000	because it's, it's hard like playing like the old, the same old songs.
2143000	2146000	Once again, I thought Euro Mix 2 be more of a draw because not a lot of people have seen
2146000	2148000	a Euro Mix 2 machine in action.
2148000	2150000	I know, certainly I haven't.
2150000	2155000	So, um, well, I imagine a lot of people in Europe have, well, yes, they probably, this
2155000	2156000	is a worldwide show.
2156000	2160000	They had to deal with some bullshit that really they shouldn't have had to deal with.
2160000	2162000	And now you feel so, like we have to go back.
2162000	2165000	Remember, we talk a lot about DDR on this show.
2165000	2169000	Loki's having his Renaissance, his midlife crisis with DDR because this was the stuff
2169000	2173000	that we, Orange Launch Radio is here because of DDR.
2173000	2174000	Orange Lounge is a band in DDR.
2174000	2179000	Dude, I completely forgot about like, did you know DDR Max had no difficulties in it?
2179000	2181000	Like I didn't like completely forgot about that.
2181000	2183000	I'm like, what?
2183000	2185000	There was no difficulties on there?
2185000	2188000	Like they had no like indicator of what song was difficult.
2188000	2191000	Oh yeah, because it was, it was just that little, it was that little chart.
2191000	2192000	They never had the feet.
2192000	2193000	It was just that little chart.
2193000	2195000	Like I'm like, I completely forgot that was a thing.
2195000	2198000	How did we know that this was this difficult?
2198000	2199000	Did we just make that shit up?
2199000	2202000	Because when Max 2 came out, everything kind of got retconned.
2202000	2206000	Well, maybe the home versions also had that shit, but like I just completely forgot.
2206000	2210000	And also my copy of, cause I'm using a super disk.
2210000	2214000	I obviously don't have a legit Euro Mix 2 in my system, but, uh, it doesn't have any
2214000	2216000	of the background videos, which is fine.
2216000	2219000	I mean, it's kind of actually makes it easier to play certain things.
2219000	2222000	Also, it seems like they half assed half of the steps of the game because half of the
2222000	2227000	steps that are in there for their new license songs don't have free zeros.
2227000	2230000	They just don't have them.
2230000	2231000	Not actually play it.
2231000	2232000	Not good.
2232000	2233000	They should have that shit in there.
2233000	2235000	You can always turn them off if you don't like them.
2235000	2236000	Right, exactly.
2236000	2239000	But like, Oh, there's only one song they ran across actually had it.
2239000	2241000	And it's funny when you do run across the song, it does have it.
2241000	2244000	It gives you the free zero warning thing, tells you what they are and stuff, which is
2244000	2245000	so weird.
2245000	2247000	Um, so they have that.
2247000	2250000	And then what else?
2250000	2252000	Um, so I'll probably switch it up again.
2252000	2260000	Um, I may end up do, I think I might move to Disney's rave or, um, fifth mix.
2260000	2266000	Fifth mix will be fun, but Disney's rave, I think it would be fun for a day.
2266000	2268000	And you're gonna be like, why, why did I do that?
2268000	2270000	Um, I still do want to come over.
2270000	2271000	It's going to get a little crazy now.
2271000	2274000	Cause this week, obviously with the changes around here, I got to make sure we're set
2274000	2275000	and ready to go for that.
2275000	2279000	Uh, next week, uh, I don't want to say too much about it on air cause I don't know if
2279000	2282000	I'm doing it yet, but I might go on the most random fricking trip in the middle of the
2282000	2283000	week.
2283000	2284000	If I can swing the time.
2284000	2285000	You're going to Albuquerque.
2285000	2286000	I I'll tell you in chat.
2286000	2291000	I don't want to say until I know I'm going, cause it is literally a random thing.
2291000	2294000	Uh, but soon I'm hoping to come over.
2294000	2295000	Right.
2295000	2297000	And it's great cause you can install new mixes in about 15 minutes.
2297000	2298000	So it's, it's not a big deal.
2298000	2302000	Uh, that's why I was like, eh, I'm just going to, I'm taking off fourth plus here.
2302000	2306000	Um, which I mean, ideally fourth plus is a great mix.
2306000	2308000	It's just, I don't know.
2308000	2315000	I miss having all those modifies in there cause some of those fourth mix, um, step charts
2315000	2320000	are just some weird shit and you really need to have like that spacing in there to be able
2320000	2321000	to read it.
2321000	2323000	And I need to get better just reading charts.
2323000	2324000	It's just really hard.
2324000	2327000	But, um, so yeah, so that's, that's what I've been doing.
2327000	2333000	Um, and uh, now this week I have Katamari, so I'll probably be playing some more Katamari.
2333000	2339000	I also did not buy Earth Defense Force Five because the review has been kind of okay on
2339000	2343000	that, but, and I'll probably wait for a sale on that.
2343000	2344000	I don't know.
2344000	2345000	We'll see.
2345000	2346000	So I don't know.
2346000	2351000	I could be playing some more new songs, but I'm waiting because, or new games, but I had
2351000	2352000	to play the old games too.
2352000	2353000	Oh, and Just Cause 4.
2353000	2356000	I need to pick up Just Cause 4 and so many things.
2356000	2357000	Anyways, that's it.
2357000	2358000	All right.
2358000	2360000	Well, let me talk about my gaming week a little bit.
2360000	2364000	Um, so I've been playing a lot of Smash, just like I'm sure a ton of people have.
2364000	2367000	Uh, I really am enjoying this Smash game.
2367000	2371000	Uh, it's, it's probably my favorite so far, but it's easy to say that because I don't
2371000	2375000	get into all the technicalities like some tournament players do and all that.
2375000	2379000	All I go is that it's pretty and there's a lot of people and there's so many modes and
2379000	2380000	this is the best one yet.
2380000	2384000	And, and honestly, I think that's good enough in some ways.
2384000	2387000	Uh, so I'm just, I'm having a good time playing it.
2387000	2388000	The unlocking thing is a little weird.
2388000	2390000	It's a little weird how you only start with eight people.
2390000	2395000	And so like when I took my Switch over to a house party thing Friday night, cause we
2395000	2396000	played some card games.
2396000	2399000	I know I don't talk a lot about card games on this show, but I played an old school card
2399000	2401000	game called Phase 10.
2401000	2403000	I'm sure that's a, it's like the same people who do it.
2403000	2408000	And then we, we played that and then we played a game called Saboteur, which is like, you're
2408000	2414000	using cards to build caves and like somebody's lying about it.
2414000	2418000	So, and these are all people that I met playing these online, like Survivor, Big Brother.
2418000	2421000	So they're all great liars cause that's, you know, what you do in those games.
2421000	2423000	Phase 10 destroys friendships.
2423000	2424000	Yeah.
2424000	2429000	So we played friend destroying games and then, uh, we played Smash Brothers a little bit
2429000	2433000	too, but it was weird because it was like, okay guys, I have the basic eight characters
2433000	2434000	and Ness.
2434000	2435000	That's it.
2435000	2437000	Like I don't have any other characters so far.
2437000	2442000	So we kind of, but the good news is, I mean, we were able to unlock some, but the funniest
2442000	2443000	fucking thing happened.
2443000	2448000	So, uh, one of my pals, Curtis, um, he, he only wants to play pit.
2448000	2450000	Like that's like his favorite character, right?
2450000	2454000	He only, so the fact that pit's not in the game, he's like, whatever, I don't care.
2454000	2455000	Well, pit shows up.
2455000	2459000	So we're playing for like 20 minutes and pit shows up, a new challenger approaches.
2459000	2463000	And so one of my friends hands me the controller says, you need to do it Rob, cause I'm going
2463000	2464000	to fuck this up.
2464000	2465000	And I was like, okay.
2465000	2469000	So I take the controller and it goes match start and I just start moving to the left
2469000	2476000	and I fall right off the cliff and die because I forgot that she was playing player one and
2476000	2478000	I was playing like player four.
2478000	2482000	So I didn't want to go to the left cause that is going to walk right off the edge.
2482000	2487000	So anyway, and Curtis is watching me and of course he's already had a bit to drink.
2487000	2490000	We're already hyped up because we've been playing saboteur.
2490000	2493000	We've been yelling at each other all night and he's like, you did that on purpose.
2493000	2495000	You bleeped and did that on purpose.
2495000	2501000	You, you like trying to, so it was just, it was really funny, but I didn't realize this
2501000	2502000	until later.
2502000	2506000	It was my pal Delvin who does his streaming at VG realness, cheap plug.
2506000	2512000	Um, but he actually told me that if you go into the blue menu, the games and more menu,
2512000	2514000	there's actually an icon that'll appear there.
2514000	2515000	It looks like a little door.
2515000	2518000	It lets you redo any of the fights.
2518000	2522000	So I found that out like after I got home Friday night and then I was able to unlock
2522000	2523000	pit easy.
2523000	2526000	So, um, that tip saved my life.
2526000	2529000	So if you didn't already know about that, that you can re challenge anybody in that
2529000	2534000	blue games and more menu with a little door icon, you can, and if you lose to them again,
2534000	2535000	it's okay.
2535000	2539000	They'll, the door icon goes away, but it will come back after like 10 or 15 minutes.
2539000	2543000	So, and I know tons of people are cheesing it with the unlocks.
2543000	2545000	That's just, that's just not how I'm going to do it.
2545000	2546000	It's fine.
2546000	2549000	I've already unlocked like 25 people, just the normal way.
2549000	2551000	I just got Simon before the show tonight.
2551000	2553000	I kind of, yeah, I do want to play the game.
2553000	2554000	I think it'll be fun.
2554000	2557000	It's just, I don't know.
2557000	2558000	Maybe I have to get paid.
2558000	2564000	I feel like at some point, um, there's going to be like a code that'll just unlock everything
2564000	2566000	like an up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right type of code.
2566000	2568000	That'll just unlock everything.
2568000	2572000	Cause it is weird that like, you know, people are going to have tournaments and it's like
2572000	2576000	either somebody has to loan their copy of smash brothers or what are you going to do?
2576000	2578000	You're not going to be able to unlock everything for a tournament right away.
2578000	2582000	So I feel like they're going to put out a code at some point, um, to let people do it.
2582000	2586000	It could also be something they patch into the game later on too, because obviously if
2586000	2588000	there's a code, someone's going to find it.
2588000	2591000	It is weird too, that there's just the whole double unlock thing.
2591000	2592000	You know what I mean?
2592000	2596000	Because, and I say that because not only do you unlock in the regular smash mode, but
2596000	2600000	then you have your world of light, which is the single player mode and you only get Kirby
2600000	2601000	in that mode to start.
2601000	2602000	That's it.
2602000	2606000	You have Kirby and nobody but Kirby, which if you're act deaf is not a problem.
2606000	2610000	And it forced me to learn to play Kirby who actually, actually now I will say this is
2610000	2611000	like the best character.
2611000	2612000	I act.
2612000	2613000	Yeah.
2613000	2614000	Like I am.
2614000	2618000	I've always been like a nest guy, a pit guy, but now I'm like, okay, well thanks to world
2618000	2619000	of light.
2619000	2622000	I kind of had to fucking teach myself how to play Kirby.
2622000	2623000	Uh, I'm cheap as fuck.
2623000	2626000	Just doing that up B move all the time.
2626000	2628000	The slice thing.
2628000	2631000	But Hey, you know what y'all are sucking on link for a bit.
2631000	2632000	Fuck it.
2632000	2634000	Hey, Oh, um, it works.
2634000	2635000	Phrasing.
2635000	2636000	We're phrasing.
2636000	2640000	Um, it works on purpose.
2640000	2645000	So anyway, uh, act depth and chat says tier list be damned.
2645000	2646000	You know what?
2646000	2650000	I'm going to co-sign with that because honestly my favorite character in Wii U smash was Pac-Man
2650000	2652000	and he's always on like the trash tier.
2652000	2654000	I don't give a fuck about your tier list.
2654000	2656000	I want to play Pac-Man.
2656000	2657000	He's fun.
2657000	2658000	Done.
2658000	2661000	Some of the stages by the way are so good.
2661000	2664000	Like, have you looked at some of the stages in this new smash?
2664000	2668000	Like, I guess it brings back stuff from the 3DS and all the other games, but there's,
2668000	2670000	I love the retro stuff re-imagined.
2670000	2674000	They do such a good job with like, there's one that's just straight up, like a remake
2674000	2679000	of world one, one from super Mario brothers and the whole level scrolls as you play it.
2679000	2680000	I think that was in an older game.
2680000	2683000	I know the Picto chat one was in an older game.
2683000	2685000	Those are still fun to play, but like they've just, they've just got some crazy.
2685000	2689000	They need to update the Picto chat one with all penis drawings.
2689000	2691000	I don't think they're going to do that.
2691000	2693000	They're not going to do that.
2693000	2694000	They totally need to do it.
2694000	2697000	Bobby Blackwell said there are peni in the Picto chat stage.
2697000	2700000	I don't know if he's making it up, but no, he says already there.
2700000	2701000	Hmm.
2701000	2704000	Uh, what they need to do actually instead of Picto chat is they need to do,
2704000	2707000	what was the other one that was, uh, for cat pictures?
2707000	2710000	That was the, uh, swap note.
2710000	2711000	Yeah.
2711000	2713000	They need to do a swap note stage with all cat pictures.
2713000	2714000	Yes.
2714000	2715000	Yes.
2715000	2716000	Oh my God.
2716000	2718000	Anyway, so I'm, I'm loving smash and you know what?
2718000	2719000	I'm going to play more of it.
2719000	2722000	And honestly, that is pretty much all I played this weekend.
2722000	2723000	Those card games and smash.
2723000	2726000	And then the rest of my week I played a little bit of wow.
2726000	2727000	A little bit of final fantasy.
2727000	2729000	I'm still juggling two MMOs.
2729000	2730000	I don't know how I do it.
2730000	2731000	Did you know dark Sakura?
2731000	2735000	I have a one 20 Alliance and a one 20 hoard and like my Alliance.
2735000	2736000	Thanks to Delvin.
2736000	2737000	I've been, I've been working.
2737000	2740000	Like he's been pity running me through some mythics and I've got some decent
2740000	2741000	gear.
2741000	2742000	Well, clearly those are clouds, Bobby.
2742000	2744000	I mean, I'll play you there.
2744000	2746000	That's one jagged penis.
2746000	2747000	All right.
2747000	2753000	Anyway, Bobby's linking and chat pictures of things that may or may not be a
2753000	2754000	penis and picked up chat.
2754000	2757000	It looked like noses shooting lightning time to penis.
2757000	2758000	All right.
2758000	2760000	Anyway, that's it for my gaming week.
2760000	2761000	So a housekeeping.
2761000	2762000	So I will.
2762000	2765000	So we're, we're not taking any shows off for the holidays.
2765000	2767000	We're still going to be here over the next few weeks.
2767000	2768000	So as I mentioned earlier,
2768000	2771000	and as I've been saying ad nauseum the past couple of weeks next week,
2771000	2773000	fingers and toes crossed.
2773000	2776000	I, I, I'm not definitively saying it will happen.
2776000	2779000	You'll see a go or no go on Twitter around Friday.
2779000	2781000	I may not be here on the 30th.
2781000	2782000	Damn it.
2782000	2783000	Damn it.
2783000	2784000	Sorry.
2784000	2785000	All right.
2785000	2786000	It's important.
2786000	2787000	I have this.
2787000	2790000	I'm visiting my dad before he moves to Texas for good.
2790000	2792000	I'm sorry.
2792000	2793000	Well then if Jamie can't be here,
2793000	2796000	there may not be a show that night or we're going to have to do it in
2796000	2797000	advance.
2797000	2798000	That's fine too.
2798000	2802000	Um, so, but anyway, well that's even more the reason why I really hope this
2802000	2803000	week.
2803000	2804000	We'll see.
2804000	2805000	We're doing it early in the day.
2805000	2807000	So I don't want to, I don't want to keep you from family stuff.
2807000	2808000	None of us do.
2808000	2810000	So yeah, you just go to spend time with dad.
2810000	2812000	So anyway, uh, next week, uh,
2812000	2815000	hopefully assuming everything in on the tech side is ready to go.
2815000	2817000	We still have shout cast set up as a fallback and we may use it,
2817000	2822000	but we will be doing our first show live on Twitch on Sunday night.
2822000	2823000	We do video and everything.
2823000	2825000	It's going to do video and everything.
2825000	2827000	Don't don't expect the world.
2827000	2828000	Yeah.
2828000	2830000	The world I'm expecting it.
2830000	2832000	Does that mean I'm going to have to start breaking out the wig of the
2832000	2833000	week?
2833000	2834000	Yeah.
2834000	2835000	You don't need to break out the wig.
2835000	2836000	You look fabulous.
2836000	2837000	Thank you girl.
2837000	2838000	Yes.
2838000	2839000	She does look fabulous.
2839000	2843000	You can wear whatever the hell you want.
2843000	2845000	The best idea I heard for you,
2845000	2846000	and I don't even remember if you were there,
2846000	2848000	if this was something I was talking about online with somebody,
2848000	2850000	but the best idea I heard from you for,
2850000	2853000	for how to do you if you are feeling a little camera shy,
2853000	2856000	which you have every right to be online because men are trash,
2856000	2858000	but you look great.
2858000	2861000	And I think all of our listeners that we've built up over the years,
2861000	2863000	as well as myself, as well as Loki,
2863000	2865000	we would fight anyone that tried to come for you.
2865000	2867000	You know that you know that giant hat,
2867000	2868000	but I'd cut a bitch too.
2868000	2870000	Well, I loved your SIA idea.
2870000	2871000	Yeah.
2871000	2873000	So that was the, where the wig thing came from.
2873000	2874000	Yeah. I love that.
2874000	2876000	I ordered like all these wigs on wish.
2876000	2879000	And actually I got a duplicate of the one with the stupid Navy blue roots.
2879000	2882000	I honestly thought she said wigs on wigs.
2882000	2883000	I could do that.
2883000	2885000	Wigs.com for all your wig needs.
2885000	2886000	Anyway,
2886000	2887000	I was just thinking wigs.com.
2887000	2888000	I was just thinking wigs.com.
2888000	2891000	The secret to a successful OLR? Wig water.
2891000	2893000	Anyway, but here's the thing, Darsagra.
2893000	2896000	My favorite idea was that you would be just off to the side
2896000	2898000	and you would have a special hand on.
2898000	2903000	So you would look like Dr. Claw off to the side.
2903000	2904000	That was my favorite.
2904000	2906000	I need Ms. Smooshy here to pet.
2906000	2911000	How to handle Jamie if she's camera shy is to do the Dr. Claw thing.
2911000	2912000	How about that?
2912000	2913000	Can we set that up?
2913000	2914000	We'll see.
2914000	2915000	All right.
2915000	2918000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2918000	2922000	Bonds006 says, so start a GoFundMe for your wigs.
2922000	2926000	Tigerclaw on chat says, you gotta do that if people would pay.
2926000	2928000	You guys are going to have to wear a lot of makeup while you're at it.
2928000	2929000	You got to look to your best.
2929000	2930000	Okay.
2930000	2931000	There's no amount of makeup that's going to help me.
2931000	2934000	You're lucky I'm going to put on pants.
2934000	2936000	I cut my hair and shaved today.
2936000	2938000	So that even though the camera's not here.
2938000	2940000	Yeah, I don't like honest to God.
2940000	2944000	No, look, I understand that makeup when you do certain things is important.
2944000	2948000	But for the purposes of OLR, you are lucky if I wear pants.
2948000	2951000	I wear enough makeup for everyone.
2951000	2952000	All right.
2952000	2956000	I'm going to be all up in that drag.
2956000	2961000	But seriously though, like I'm not like as camera shy as I used to be.
2961000	2965000	I was really kind of self-conscious for a bit,
2965000	2968000	but I don't mind now as long as I'm not like, you know,
2968000	2971000	about to do the sneeze face.
2972000	2976000	Well, the good news is I think you're in a lot of good company over on Twitch too.
2976000	2980000	There's a lot of women, there's a lot of, you know, different types,
2980000	2982000	different sizes, different colors.
2982000	2987000	There's a lot of just wonderful people on Twitch streaming that have normalized
2987000	2991000	it I think a lot more that it's not just white bros doing streaming on Twitch.
2991000	2992000	You know what I mean?
2992000	2995000	Like it's the good news is there is a more diverse community.
2995000	2996000	I know I am pretty white.
2997000	2999000	Hey look, hey look, hey look.
2999000	3003000	There's just because somebody says diversity doesn't mean they're saying
3003000	3005000	get rid of everybody else.
3005000	3006000	I know, I know.
3006000	3007000	Yeah, exactly.
3007000	3009000	I'm also wearing though like my new shirt for today.
3009000	3011000	Are we going to do a tacky, a sweater episode?
3011000	3012000	Oh, you're not going to be here the rest of the month.
3012000	3013000	No, it's not tacky.
3013000	3014000	It's not tacky.
3014000	3018000	It's my Dilbert Sonomori GameCube shirt.
3018000	3022000	I will wear it for, so December 23rd, I think is a show night.
3022000	3024000	Let's do a tacky Christmas sweater night for Twitch.
3024000	3025000	I don't have a tacky Christmas sweater.
3025000	3027000	I will borrow one from Alan then.
3027000	3029000	I refuse to wear anything related to Christmas.
3029000	3030000	All right.
3030000	3031000	What do you guys think? Tacky, tacky Christmas?
3031000	3034000	If they mark down the Hanukkah sweaters at Target, I'll buy one.
3034000	3036000	Even though Hanukkah is like ending after tonight.
3036000	3038000	Do they sell a tingle sweater?
3038000	3040000	Oh my God, perfect.
3040000	3042000	You know what?
3042000	3043000	Let me internet this.
3043000	3046000	Anyway, Vaga Network is our Twitch channel.
3046000	3050000	Please go ahead and go over there, subscribe and catch Bobby Black Wolf.
3050000	3053000	We'll also be making the transition with us pretty soon.
3053000	3055000	I don't know if they're doing it the first week,
3055000	3057000	but pretty soon after in the next couple of weeks,
3057000	3062000	Anime Jam Session will also be joining on the Twitch bandwagon.
3062000	3063000	So that's really exciting.
3063000	3066000	And you can stay tuned to all of that over at Vaga Network.
3066000	3068000	We'll either be hosting Who's Live,
3068000	3071000	or we're still going to be a network of promoting each other
3071000	3074000	and helping each other and just getting more voices out there.
3074000	3076000	So that's what the plan is to do.
3076000	3080000	I want to add something in relation to Ranma.
3080000	3083000	I'm super proud that you're using the Hebrew hammer
3083000	3087000	as your Facebook cover picture.
3087000	3089000	Bobby Black Wolf says,
3089000	3091000	I have an ugly sweater that's gaming related.
3091000	3093000	I can wear that on the 23rd.
3093000	3095000	There you go. So Bobby's in for ugly sweater night. I'm with it.
3095000	3097000	Dungeon Buster in chat says,
3097000	3100000	Cats on my head is a streamer speed runner
3100000	3102000	that wears a cat thing on her head.
3102000	3105000	So you would not be the first to do the...
3105000	3107000	But not a real cat because I mean,
3107000	3109000	I'm a little bit let down if that's your name.
3109000	3111000	And you don't have a real cat on your head.
3111000	3113000	The only way we're going to get people to tune in on Twitch
3113000	3116000	is for me to promise that Mr. Smoosh might show up.
3116000	3117000	He will.
3117000	3118000	Loki, let's be real.
3118000	3120000	They don't give a shit about you or me.
3120000	3122000	They don't really care what Jamie looks like at the end of the day.
3122000	3124000	They only want to see the cat.
3124000	3125000	That's what it is.
3125000	3126000	Show us your pussy.
3126000	3128000	This is the internet.
3128000	3130000	Your loud, screamy pussy.
3130000	3132000	Alright, anyway.
3132000	3134000	Let's move on.
3134000	3136000	Let's get into some news.
3136000	3137000	The news of the week.
3137000	3138000	There's a lot going on.
3138000	3140000	Including a follow up to last week.
3140000	3141000	Sort of, right, Loki?
3141000	3143000	Yeah, so the whole trash bags...
3143000	3145000	Should I queue up the Betty Hill theme?
3145000	3146000	No.
3146000	3148000	Maybe the shade sound.
3148000	3153000	So as we talked about the Fallout 76 collector's edition that they did.
3153000	3157000	The $200 one.
3157000	3161000	So unfortunately they had sent out originally these nylon bags that were just garbage.
3161000	3166000	And people were pissed off because not only did they not get what they were promised.
3166000	3173000	Then Bethesda said, oh hey, we'll give you $5 in in-game crap currency.
3173000	3182000	And then also we're also going to actually have these canvas backpacks that we'll give out to our influencers instead.
3182000	3184000	Even though you did pay $200.
3184000	3189000	Well, they decided, hey, we are actually going to send out replacements.
3189000	3199000	So please go to our website and file a ticket to get a replacement bag sent to us.
3199000	3203000	And we're like, oh finally, they're doing something right.
3203000	3208000	Thank god they're actually not Bethesda-ing this up.
3208000	3218000	And then they Bethesda the crap out of it by their Bethesda support page leaking Fallout 76 customer names, addresses, and phone numbers.
3218000	3225000	So what was happening is people were logging into their support ticket and they could view everybody's support ticket because that's how websites work.
3225000	3231000	So apparently there was an issue where they were able to see other people's information.
3231000	3236000	Including their purchase information, whatever they've scanned and uploaded into it.
3236000	3238000	Screenshots, names, addresses, and whatnot.
3238000	3242000	Bethesda said, of course, that they had fixed the issue.
3242000	3247000	They basically said, hey guys, we resolved the issue.
3247000	3253000	No apologies or anything, but they resolved the issue.
3253000	3255000	But they still fucked that up too.
3255000	3257000	Because, of course, they did.
3257000	3263000	If I am a lawyer right now that has Bethesda in my sights, I am having the best holiday season.
3263000	3269000	By the way, since this didn't make our show roll, but I saw a video about it today.
3269000	3278000	So last week we talked about how, hey, we're going to fix some of these problems that you guys have and we're going to patch the game to make it better.
3278000	3282000	So that you guys can enjoy it and it's not so buggy and shitty and stuff like that.
3282000	3286000	So guess what came along with that very first patch that they put out.
3286000	3293000	So the very first patch that they were doing, one of the things they were trying to fix was this zero health glitch or whatever.
3293000	3296000	Where people would basically be indestructible and you couldn't kill them.
3297000	3305000	So you would have to basically restart the game if you encountered that.
3305000	3310000	Because basically the health would come back and they would just be a bullet sponge.
3310000	3317000	Well, they didn't fix that and they also patched in stuff to rebalance the game to make it even grindier.
3317000	3324000	So they reduced the amount of the different power cells that they have in there.
3324000	3329000	They reduced the amount that those lasted and they also made it harder to harvest that stuff among other things.
3329000	3335000	So while patching the game to fix some of these bugs, they're also patching it to make it more grindy.
3335000	3339000	So that you want to use their in-game money to speed the game up.
3339000	3342000	Just fuck this company. I mean, seriously.
3342000	3344000	How about they go eat a pile of dicks?
3345000	3347000	I can't.
3347000	3352000	It's garbage. I'm not even touching this hot garbage at all.
3352000	3357000	I didn't really have a lot of interest in Fallout 76 to begin with.
3357000	3360000	But now my interest is at a negative one.
3360000	3364000	My interest is down in the base. I feel bad for Fallout fans. I really do.
3364000	3369000	But at the same time, I'm going to do a special message.
3369000	3371000	And Jamie, maybe you can join me in this.
3371000	3381000	A special message from me, a Mass Effect fan who survived Andromeda, to you, a Fallout fan who will survive Fallout 76.
3381000	3383000	It'll be okay.
3383000	3386000	I gotta tell you this much. I watched that new...
3386000	3390000	They had a new Anthem trailer that was during the game awards.
3390000	3392000	I don't fucking care about the game at all now.
3392000	3396000	I didn't care about it much to begin with, but I just like...
3396000	3398000	This is fucking Destiny. I don't want to play this.
3398000	3400000	So you know they had like a super secret beta over the weekend, right?
3400000	3404000	I'm not in it, but I'm pretty connected. I know people that are.
3404000	3406000	It's not our secret if we know about it.
3406000	3408000	There's an NDA. That's why people aren't talking about it.
3408000	3411000	And I don't know if you heard, but EA is taking it very seriously.
3411000	3415000	Somebody streamed it and they freaking banned the guy from Origin or something like that.
3415000	3417000	They're taking it very seriously.
3417000	3421000	So not a lot getting out there about what's going on.
3421000	3426000	But should I say it? Because I have some tea.
3426000	3428000	You ready for some tea?
3428000	3430000	Now obviously I cannot tell you.
3430000	3434000	I cannot tell you where I'm getting this.
3434000	3436000	Hold on. I'm looking.
3436000	3438000	Because where was it?
3438000	3440000	Okay.
3440000	3443000	Here's my review of Anthem Alpha.
3443000	3447000	I'm sad we aren't ever going to get that Dragon Age game they teased.
3447000	3449000	Because BioWare won't be around.
3449000	3451000	Ooh, girl.
3451000	3455000	That was a text message I got earlier today, but I ain't telling you from who.
3455000	3457000	That's sad.
3457000	3459000	But hey, Outer Worlds.
3459000	3463000	It looks like that's going to be a game that's by the original Fallout people.
3463000	3465000	When Fallout was good.
3465000	3468000	So maybe there's hope.
3468000	3473000	Maybe Fallout's not going to be necessarily your game, but it'll live on as a spiritual successor.
3474000	3477000	Alright, anyway. Let's move on.
3479000	3486000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, CHILD.
3486000	3488000	Going to the next...
3488000	3490000	I don't know.
3490000	3492000	It could be just dramatic.
3492000	3494000	People being dramatic on the internet, hyperbole.
3494000	3496000	No, seriously though.
3496000	3501000	If it doesn't end up being a runaway success, I think that EA will close them down.
3501000	3503000	That's just because that's their MO.
3503000	3508000	I think as much as there is over-the-topness and extra-ness sometimes.
3508000	3510000	And again, that is one review.
3510000	3513000	And it's an early build.
3513000	3515000	So I think that's a fair thing to just acknowledge.
3515000	3518000	Don't make your final decisions off of an anonymous message I just read.
3519000	3522000	Bobby Blacko says, Rob's friends being dramatic.
3523000	3526000	TigerClanChat says, will Anthem be the downfall of Bioware?
3527000	3531000	Let's hope not, because I would like to see that Dragon Age game, and I would like to see a Mass Effect game.
3531000	3536000	But I do think there is a lot of money being invested in this, and there's a lot riding on this game.
3537000	3542000	I don't think Bioware or EA can afford to make the same mistakes they made with Andromeda.
3543000	3546000	So maybe that's part of the reason they're doing this, to get some of that now.
3546000	3550000	Because maybe they'll end up delaying the game again, if it is a mess.
3550000	3554000	Dragon Age games have been pretty good so far.
3554000	3557000	I need to go back and play the last one. I had the last one.
3557000	3559000	Inquisition was great.
3559000	3564000	And so the new Dragon Age sounds cool.
3566000	3570000	And you know what sucks? I don't necessarily blame them.
3570000	3579000	And that's unfortunate, though. It's the bad decisions by higher-ups end up when the game does poorly because of their shitty decisions.
3579000	3583000	And the dev teams actually take the brunt of it. It's annoying.
3583000	3587000	But that's just EA's fucking M.O., unfortunately.
3587000	3594000	We've lost many great studios because of stupid EA, so what are you gonna do?
3594000	3605000	Those talented people will find homes elsewhere, and you will get spiritually successor games, much like this new one. I don't know.
3605000	3610000	Alright. Anyway, moving on. Let's talk about Doom.
3610000	3615000	Did you know Doom turned 25? Doom is now 25 years old.
3615000	3619000	And that makes me feel old, because I remember when Doom first came to me.
3619000	3622000	I remember calling BBSs to play Doom 2 multiplayer.
3622000	3628000	Remember, I could never get Doom to run on my PC, because I only had four megs of RAM.
3628000	3636000	And even though you needed four megs of RAM to run it, you could never allocate quite enough using your config.sys file.
3636000	3641000	I had Doom in black and white for Mac Classic.
3641000	3645000	Oh, that's awesome. I didn't even know they made a black and white version. That's rad.
3645000	3651000	There were some great black and white Mac games back in the day. My favorite was always Crystal Quest.
3651000	3655000	Because they did it on 360, they did an arcade version of it.
3655000	3656000	I think so.
3656000	3658000	And there was one call, I think the Dark Castle.
3658000	3659000	I was going to Tetris.
3659000	3661000	Oh yeah, Tetris. Anyway.
3661000	3665000	But anyway, this isn't about just Mac games, because Doom was huge on PC as well.
3665000	3671000	December 10th, so the actual anniversary is tomorrow, which honestly will be the day most people listen to this on the podcast.
3671000	3675000	Anyway, that's the day it turns 25 years old on December 10th.
3675000	3680000	John Romero will be hopefully revealing something new that day.
3680000	3685000	Romero Games is going to announce pre-orders for a project that John Romero just completed.
3685000	3687000	That was an email that went out from Romero Games.
3687000	3691000	You can follow it on his Twitter, at The Romero, where there are some hints.
3691000	3696000	Some people are thinking it could be Black Room is the project that he's been working on.
3696000	3699000	So I'm assuming we would see a little bit more about that tomorrow.
3699000	3700000	So, there you go.
3700000	3703000	But I'm wondering, you know, obviously we don't know what this project is.
3703000	3706000	We weren't going to know until tomorrow, so we can't speculate too much more.
3706000	3710000	But I'm just curious, what do you think about Doom all these years later?
3710000	3713000	Do you think Doom is an important game in gaming's history?
3713000	3715000	Or where do you think Doom kind of stands for you?
3715000	3717000	Yeah, absolutely. It's an important game.
3717000	3721000	It helped launch the whole FPS genre.
3721000	3726000	I mean, that and Quake, it was one of the pillars of these modern games.
3726000	3730000	Yeah, I think a game like Overwatch owes a lot to something like Doom.
3730000	3734000	I mean, sure, Overwatch draws from other places as well, as well as Blizzard's own perspective.
3734000	3741000	I'm not saying they're just ripoffs, but I think there's so much that, you know, certainly Doom really pushed forward.
3741000	3747000	And especially, you know, remember the other, ID Software was kind of really the king of those 3D games back in the day.
3747000	3753000	And that movement from Wolfenstein, which was its own amazing, you know, game.
3753000	3757000	But really, Wolfenstein was a 2D game in a 3D space, right?
3757000	3762000	Doom was a 3D game in a 3D space, where you started to have the elevation.
3762000	3764000	You had walls that weren't just square.
3764000	3767000	You had maps that, you know, were in different shapes.
3767000	3771000	Like, Doom really was, like, that pushed forward.
3771000	3775000	Yeah, I mean, I remember it was a CompUSA.
3775000	3780000	We had saw, like, Wolfenstein 3D being played on a PC.
3780000	3783000	And just, like, just a group of people around going like,
3783000	3785000	Holy crap, you know, this looks amazing.
3786000	3789000	Back in the day when shareware.
3789000	3791000	I fucking love shareware. It was great.
3791000	3797000	You'd go to a store, you'd buy a Wolfenstein 3D disc for, like, two bucks.
3797000	3801000	Or, like, some dirt cheap. You know, I'd buy a ton of those shareware discs.
3801000	3804000	Well, because you could only pay because they couldn't charge you for the shareware, but they could charge you for the disc.
3804000	3805000	That's what it was.
3806000	3808000	Yeah, yeah, I think so.
3808000	3810000	They had copies of it, and it was great.
3810000	3814000	Because, like, I'd pick up all these games, and if I liked them, cool.
3814000	3818000	I could send my money away, you know, for, you know, the full game.
3818000	3822000	Or, you know, wait until the BBS had the pirate, you know, that type of stuff.
3822000	3825000	But, um, it was a great way to do it.
3825000	3831000	And I remember they had Doom was, like, you know, on those discs as well one time, and I knew.
3831000	3835000	I remember being connected to a BBS for, like, an hour and a half just to download Doom.
3835000	3837000	Like, for real. Like, it's just, yeah.
3837000	3839000	Man, I miss the BBS community. Those were the days.
3839000	3844000	Old Man Alert. Let's see, Bonds006 says, Doom is the granddaddy of SPSs.
3844000	3848000	Tigerclaw says, Doom is definitely an important game in history.
3848000	3852000	The same as how Castle Wolfenstein is an important game, even though that was the first FPS game.
3852000	3861000	And, let's see, Bonds006 says, Doom, Unreal, Half-Life, WS, Wolfenstein, Counter-Strike.
3861000	3863000	Those games will never grow old to me.
3863000	3866000	So, yeah. It's important stuff, for sure.
3866000	3870000	Well, and then, like, Quake didn't come out that much longer after that,
3870000	3874000	so I'm thinking we're gonna be coming up on the 25th anniversary of Quake as well, right?
3874000	3877000	Because that wasn't much later.
3877000	3882000	Um, yeah. Quake wasn't much later. Quake was probably, what, like, nine months later, maybe?
3882000	3883000	Maybe a year.
3883000	3886000	It was probably a few years later.
3886000	3889000	Maybe. They'll do something really big for Quake, I'm sure.
3889000	3890000	Yeah.
3890000	3891000	Must be.
3891000	3897000	All right. Anyway, let's move on to the next story, Dark Sakura.
3897000	3899000	Wheel.
3899000	3906000	I'm sure we are all familiar with Hajime Tabata, who was the Final Fantasy XV director.
3906000	3911000	Well, he told Squenix to bite his butt. I'm kidding.
3911000	3917000	He actually left the position as a studio head of Luminous Production on October 31st,
3917000	3921000	and he is starting a company called JP Games.
3921000	3923000	Unquote says, um,
3923000	3926000	I started up my own company called JP Games, Inc.
3926000	3930000	Right now, we are preparing for a target January 2019 launch.
3930000	3936000	And to everyone who has assisted me until today, I kindly ask for your ongoing support.
3936000	3940000	So, there's no more information than that, but we'll see what happens.
3942000	3943000	All right.
3943000	3947000	Um, yeah, I mean, very interesting after that whole, uh,
3947000	3951000	him just kind of suddenly leaving Square after Final Fantasy XV was apparently losing money.
3951000	3953000	But, you know, wish him well.
3953000	3958000	You know, I think a lot went into that that is not necessarily dude's fault.
3958000	3961000	So, I wish him well and see what creative...
3961000	3964000	Sometimes, like, from Ashes...
3964000	3967000	And I wouldn't even call Final Fantasy XV, like, a disaster.
3967000	3969000	Like, it was a fine game.
3969000	3971000	It was a fine game.
3971000	3976000	But, you know, with the financials or whatever, perhaps not turning around the way they wanted,
3976000	3979000	and maybe the DLC just kind of went on a little bit too long.
3979000	3983000	I think maybe that planning that went into that is kind of where things went wrong.
3983000	3986000	You know, maybe something will rise up from the ashes, right?
3986000	3989000	You know, can flop designers make a great game later?
3989000	3992000	I'm not calling this guy a flop designer, but we've seen that, right?
3992000	3995000	You know, it's okay. You can make a bad game and then make good ones after that.
3995000	3996000	It happens.
3996000	3998000	So, all right.
3998000	4000000	Uh, well, let's move on.
4000000	4004000	All right. So, this was kind of cool and out of nowhere.
4004000	4007000	Apparently, there is a competitor now.
4007000	4010000	A new challenger arrives.
4010000	4015000	So, the Epic Game Store is something that was launched this week,
4015000	4020000	and basically, it is going to be a competitor to Steam,
4020000	4025000	another game storefront that you'll be able to put games on for sale,
4025000	4028000	and also to purchase stuff with your Epic Games account,
4028000	4030000	which a lot of people have Epic Games account,
4030000	4032000	because, you know, Fortnite is the shit right now,
4032000	4035000	and everybody is participating with that,
4035000	4040000	or you're like me, you have an Epic account because you use the Unreal Engine.
4040000	4045000	Speaking of which, so to kind of step back a little bit,
4045000	4049000	and so leading up to this,
4049000	4051000	or actually, we'll talk about this in a little bit.
4051000	4056000	So, there was a change in the revenue share on Steam.
4056000	4059000	So, Steam right now, for most people, takes like a 30% cut
4059000	4062000	of the revenue that you make on their storefront.
4062000	4065000	So, for example, if you publish a game there,
4065000	4066000	you'll get 70% of it.
4066000	4068000	Steam takes their 30% cut.
4068000	4072000	So, the main difference with this is the Epic Store
4072000	4075000	is actually only going to take a 12% cut on games.
4075000	4079000	So, you're actually earning an additional percentage there,
4079000	4081000	so 88% on those games.
4081000	4084000	And on top of that, so if you're using Unreal 4,
4084000	4090000	normally Epic takes a 5% cut of your revenue from that as well.
4090000	4096000	Well, if you use Unreal Engine 4 on the Epic Games storefront,
4096000	4098000	they're actually going to waive that 5% fee,
4098000	4100000	so it's still going to be 12% as well.
4100000	4105000	So, you can make a lot more money on the storefront.
4105000	4108000	Plus, being that the storefront is just starting off,
4108000	4110000	you have a lot more visibility as well,
4110000	4112000	so that's also a good thing.
4112000	4114000	What's kind of nice about this, though,
4114000	4118000	as a little bit of a perk to get people their eyes on it and stuff,
4118000	4120000	is they're actually going to start offering free games
4120000	4122000	every two weeks on the storefront.
4122000	4123000	No membership or anything.
4123000	4125000	You just basically create your free account
4125000	4127000	and you can add it to your library.
4127000	4128000	Well, I like free.
4128000	4129000	Tiger Claw on chat says,
4129000	4131000	I'm all for a free game every two weeks.
4131000	4132000	That's kind of where I'm at. I like free.
4132000	4134000	But the only thing, see, here's the thing.
4134000	4135000	Now you've got all these different companies
4135000	4136000	kind of giving you free stuff.
4136000	4139000	So, it's like I have Steam, of course,
4139000	4141000	because you have a huge library on Steam.
4141000	4143000	And once in a while, they might have a free game
4143000	4145000	or like a 99-cent game or something.
4145000	4147000	Or other sites that have free Steam codes for things.
4147000	4152000	But then you have now Twitch has their own store thing.
4152000	4153000	Origin, GOG.
4153000	4155000	Origin gives away free games.
4155000	4158000	GOG, once in a while, gives away free games.
4158000	4160000	There's another one, too.
4160000	4162000	And Transphobia, don't forget about that.
4162000	4164000	Well, that's a whole other thing, yes.
4164000	4167000	But we don't cheer on GOG like we used to.
4167000	4170000	PlayStations, Xbox.
4170000	4173000	Sure, if you're a yearly subscriber on those things, sure.
4173000	4176000	Damn it, there's another one.
4176000	4178000	Oh, Discord just did the store thing.
4178000	4181000	And they have like a plus plan type of thing
4181000	4183000	for their Discord Plus where they give away free games.
4183000	4185000	So that's the only bummer is that then it's like
4185000	4188000	you have all these different stores on your computer
4188000	4189000	and all these games.
4189000	4192000	But, well, see, Discord, I noticed,
4192000	4196000	is now very big on let us scan your computer
4196000	4198000	and we'll just put shortcuts to all your games
4198000	4201000	no matter where they're from right here in Discord.
4201000	4204000	Because I'll tell you what, those guys at Discord,
4204000	4208000	I honestly think those guys are so fucking smart.
4208000	4210000	I really do, and I'm not being paid by them.
4210000	4212000	Of course I use Discord as a fan.
4212000	4214000	We have a VOG Network Discord, plug plug.
4214000	4216000	I think what they have done since the beginning
4216000	4219000	is fucking smart, and it should be called out and commended.
4219000	4222000	They put a Trojan horse, the good kind, though,
4222000	4225000	not the virus kind, on everybody's computer
4225000	4227000	by offering those types of services
4227000	4230000	that people were paying for, TeamSpeak, Slack.
4230000	4232000	They give it to you for free,
4232000	4235000	and they got everybody to put Discord on their computers.
4235000	4237000	People put Discord on their phones.
4237000	4240000	When Nintendo couldn't step their pussy up, Discord did.
4240000	4243000	And Discord embraced the Pokemon Go thing
4243000	4245000	because that was a mess to coordinate
4245000	4248000	until Discord was like, use us for Pokemon Go.
4248000	4251000	And now look, now that they're everywhere in that regard,
4251000	4253000	they're like, oh, well, you know,
4253000	4256000	since we're here on your computer,
4256000	4259000	we're just gonna open up this little store right here.
4259000	4263000	Just if you're interested, no pressure,
4263000	4265000	come browse our little store.
4265000	4269000	Oh, by the way, if you're a Discord Plus member, though,
4269000	4271000	we'll give you free games.
4271000	4274000	And you know what, since you love Discord, we love you,
4274000	4276000	you know, we wanna be your one-stop shop
4276000	4277000	for all these games.
4277000	4280000	Why don't you just, come on, just let us load all the games.
4280000	4283000	Dude, they're so smart at what they're doing.
4283000	4285000	I honestly think, like, you know,
4285000	4287000	I don't wanna be dramatic or nothing,
4287000	4290000	but it is gaming media.
4290000	4292000	I think Discord is smarter
4292000	4295000	than any other gaming company out there right now.
4295000	4297000	Agree? Disagree?
4297000	4299000	I think it's pretty smart.
4299000	4301000	Pretty smart, but I don't know.
4301000	4303000	I mean, they'll fuck up eventually, everyone does.
4303000	4305000	But for right now?
4305000	4307000	I still think for that, though,
4307000	4309000	that before they do things automatically,
4309000	4311000	there'll be like a permission to allow.
4311000	4314000	I mean, it's one thing that I really like about,
4314000	4318000	just about any app that installs itself on like your Mac,
4318000	4322000	that it has to ask permission to access things like your photos,
4322000	4324000	like your camera, your microphone.
4324000	4328000	Even some of the Apple apps request that approval,
4328000	4330000	like GarageBand does it right now.
4330000	4334000	Windows 10 kind of took a lot of cues from that.
4334000	4336000	Like, I know with Windows 10,
4336000	4338000	there's a lot of things where it will come up and go,
4338000	4340000	so and so wants to access your device.
4340000	4341000	Would you allow this type of thing?
4341000	4343000	And even if it's not natively built into Windows 10,
4343000	4345000	a lot of the web browsers,
4345000	4349000	and because so much is built on either a Chrome frame
4349000	4351000	or an Internet Explorer frame,
4351000	4353000	which ironically, I know we all heard this week,
4353000	4355000	is just going to be a Chrome frame pretty soon anyway, right?
4355000	4357000	Am I right? Did you hear all that?
4357000	4359000	So anyway, but still not going to use it.
4359000	4362000	But those will also ask permission.
4362000	4365000	Like if you try to go to a website that wants to access your camera,
4365000	4366000	it's going to tell you.
4366000	4368000	So that way you know you're not broadcasting your picture,
4368000	4371000	you know, somewhere you don't want it to be.
4371000	4373000	And no, any website that wants some notifications to be sent to me,
4373000	4375000	you can fuck right off.
4375000	4379000	But to be fair, I do first remember that on an Apple system.
4379000	4381000	So now that's just kind of becoming the industry standard
4381000	4382000	when it comes to privacy.
4382000	4387000	But since countries like everybody in Europe
4387000	4390000	under the E-L-U-L-A or whatever that, sorry,
4390000	4393000	whatever that acronym is that governs all that,
4393000	4399000	that, you know, they have the strangest privacy standards now.
4399000	4401000	And I think everybody is kind of having to do these
4401000	4404000	to kind of conform to that, if that makes sense.
4404000	4405000	So anyway.
4405000	4407000	Anyway, so as I was talking about Epic Games.
4407000	4408000	Yeah, sorry.
4408000	4411000	Yeah, so with that, you know, some of the things that they want to do,
4411000	4415000	they basically said they want to have a direct relationship with players.
4415000	4418000	So they said people who buy your games automatically subscribe
4418000	4421000	to your newsfeed so you can actually send them updates.
4421000	4424000	So this is, you know, if you're putting content on the storefront.
4424000	4427000	You can connect with creators.
4427000	4429000	They're sending you YouTube content creators,
4429000	4431000	Twitch bloggers, and whatnot.
4431000	4436000	You control your game pages, and they, you know, welcome all engines.
4436000	4439000	In fact, they mentioned Unity on here as well, which is kind of cool.
4439000	4443000	And it's going to be a launcher that's available on PC and Mac,
4443000	4446000	which I think is pretty awesome.
4446000	4449000	And then, like I said, you know, two free games a month.
4450000	4453000	And in 2019, they're going to be doing that.
4453000	4454000	So let's see.
4454000	4456000	Actually, I think they're starting it this month as well.
4456000	4459000	So the first free game is going to be Subnautica,
4459000	4462000	which is, you know, like a $25 game.
4462000	4465000	And that's going to be coming out, or free copies available
4465000	4468000	from the 14th to the 27th of December.
4468000	4473000	And then after that, Super Meat Boy, which is from the 28th to January 10th.
4473000	4475000	So pretty awesome.
4475000	4478000	And then they're going to be doing that through 2019 as well.
4480000	4483000	So definitely looking forward to checking that out.
4483000	4485000	And I'll add yet another copy of Super Meat Boy,
4485000	4489000	which I have on literally every fucking platform that I practically own.
4489000	4491000	Except for the Switch. I don't have it on the Switch,
4491000	4493000	but my kids aren't playing that game.
4493000	4494000	That's it.
4495000	4496000	All right.
4496000	4498000	Fortnite, man, it's everywhere.
4498000	4499000	I was just at Target the other day.
4499000	4501000	They had like a Fortnite aisle.
4501000	4502000	Crazy.
4502000	4504000	Speaking of Fortnite, so my son started playing Fortnite.
4504000	4508000	And so he's decided that he wants V-Bucks for Christmas,
4508000	4510000	which is their in-game currency.
4510000	4515000	To which I've tried talking him out of that, because I'm like,
4515000	4517000	do you see how much this shit fucking costs?
4517000	4522000	I'm like, it's basically one to one.
4522000	4526000	So like, you know, $5 is $500 V-Bucks or whatever.
4526000	4529000	And like an emote or a dance is like $7.
4529000	4531000	I'm like, fuck that.
4531000	4536000	You do not need to pay $7 for a goddamn costume in a game.
4536000	4538000	That is not worth it.
4538000	4541000	Especially since I know how you play these games
4541000	4544000	and you fucking get tired of this game in like a moment's time
4544000	4546000	after you've bought in-game currency.
4548000	4550000	So I'll probably get him Robux instead,
4550000	4551000	which is also just throwing money.
4551000	4553000	It might as well just set the money on fire
4553000	4555000	because it's just, you know, pretty much a waste of money.
4555000	4558000	What's that game that Julian likes, Pirate101?
4558000	4560000	I remember he talked about it on the show a long time ago.
4560000	4562000	He's still playing it and he's 11.
4562000	4563000	Good for him.
4563000	4567000	But I mean, maybe, maybe a game like that would be fun.
4567000	4569000	Bitch, I still play Number Munchers.
4569000	4571000	He likes Octodad.
4571000	4575000	I had to explain the Oregon Trail to somebody
4575000	4577000	a little younger than me this week
4577000	4583000	and how that was like all the rage when we were like in grade school.
4583000	4584000	You know what I mean?
4584000	4587000	I had to kind of like explain why that game was cool.
4587000	4589000	Have you played the Oregon Trail?
4589000	4591000	Yes, I have played the Oregon Trail.
4591000	4593000	I have that, but I have not played it though.
4593000	4594000	The parody game, yes.
4594000	4596000	Oregon Trail is great.
4596000	4598000	Tigerklonchow wants to know about the kid.
4598000	4600000	Is he good at Fortnite?
4600000	4602000	Because that's a game that looks like it has a steep learning curve.
4602000	4604000	No, he is not very good at it.
4604000	4606000	He is looking forward to,
4606000	4609000	that was something that they announced during the Game Awards, though,
4609000	4612000	is that they've got a creative mode coming out.
4612000	4615000	So right now, apparently if you subscribe to their little
4616000	4619000	season pass or whatever they call it,
4619000	4621000	that you get access to it now.
4621000	4623000	Otherwise, us, you know,
4623000	4626000	normal people who don't pay money towards that,
4626000	4629000	you have to wait until, I think, the 13th to play that.
4629000	4631000	So he's looking forward to messing around with that.
4631000	4633000	He doesn't really know what he's doing in the game.
4633000	4635000	I mean, he might get a kill, you know,
4635000	4638000	but that's why I'm like, you know,
4638000	4640000	I don't really want to buy him.
4640000	4642000	I'm like, you know, for the amount of money, like,
4642000	4644000	it's been like,
4644000	4647000	it's like talking about this costume pack that was like $30.
4647000	4650000	I'm like, you could buy another game for that kind of money.
4650000	4652000	Like, why are you going to spend money on a costume
4652000	4654000	in a game that you're only going to play for a little bit?
4654000	4656000	Just, no.
4656000	4658000	Just don't.
4658000	4660000	So, that's it.
4660000	4662000	Just have him play Second Life.
4662000	4664000	No.
4664000	4666000	That's, that's just, no.
4666000	4668000	No one should play Second Life.
4668000	4670000	All right.
4671000	4673000	I mean, I guess it still is.
4673000	4675000	Nobody, nobody plays it anymore.
4675000	4676000	It's probably there. Well, somebody just brought,
4676000	4678000	Bonds006 in our chat just brought up Sony Home
4678000	4680000	saying, I blame Sony Home
4680000	4682000	for the normalized trend of buying clothes
4682000	4684000	for my in-game people.
4684000	4686000	And Second Life may really be something to blame for that,
4686000	4688000	or just that whole era.
4688000	4690000	I actually, isn't it weird that like,
4690000	4692000	despite how much we always kind of made fun of it a little bit,
4692000	4694000	like, there's stuff about Sony Home that I actually kind of miss.
4694000	4696000	Like, I just feel like there was so much potential there
4696000	4698000	that really didn't get realized.
4698000	4700000	Fortnite, I don't have a problem if you spend money on skins.
4700000	4702000	Like, if you're actually playing that a lot,
4702000	4704000	then I have no trouble with you,
4704000	4706000	no problem with you spending money on that kind of stuff
4706000	4708000	if you want to support the game.
4708000	4710000	But I know my kids,
4710000	4712000	and they don't have the attention span
4712000	4714000	to play that game for hundreds and hundreds of hours.
4714000	4716000	I want it, I want it, I want it,
4716000	4718000	and then they'll have it, and it's like, okay, cool, bye.
4718000	4720000	And then they're going to play something else.
4720000	4722000	I get it.
4722000	4724000	We have Minecraft, I needed Minecraft,
4724000	4726000	and then I got Minecraft, and no.
4726000	4728000	KumaJP suggests, let him earn his own
4728000	4730000	to buy stuff like that.
4730000	4732000	Yeah, make him do chores.
4732000	4734000	Alright, anyway.
4734000	4736000	Let's talk a little bit about
4736000	4738000	what is going on on Steam's marketplace
4738000	4740000	because they are doing a new little profit sharing thing
4740000	4742000	that doesn't have any developers very happy.
4742000	4744000	In short,
4744000	4746000	right now, revenue for Steam games is split
4746000	4748000	70-30, so the developer gets 70%,
4748000	4750000	Valve gets 30%,
4750000	4752000	as we know, Epic is undercutting this
4752000	4754000	quite a bit, and that's going to be a huge deal.
4754000	4756000	18%.
4756000	4758000	But, from now on,
4758000	4760000	Valve is only going to take 25%
4760000	4762000	if the earnings are above
4762000	4764000	10 million, and only 20%
4764000	4766000	if the earnings go beyond
4766000	4768000	50 million.
4768000	4770000	Oh, how generous of that.
4770000	4772000	However, the first 10 million will still be split
4772000	4774000	70-30, and it's going to impact any revenue
4774000	4776000	after October 1st.
4776000	4778000	So, this really does
4778000	4780000	jack and shit for indie developers.
4780000	4782000	It's still going to be 70-30.
4782000	4784000	But, I mean, here's the thing.
4784000	4786000	This was announced almost
4786000	4788000	at the exact same time that
4788000	4790000	Epic whipped it out and put it
4790000	4792000	on the table, so to speak.
4792000	4794000	Yeah, they announced theirs first, and Epic's like,
4794000	4796000	oh, by the way, since you guys are fucking
4796000	4798000	pissed off about this announcement,
4798000	4802000	here's our $399 US dollars.
4802000	4804000	That's what they did.
4804000	4806000	Okay?
4806000	4808000	And, yes, that's a throwback to the infamy series.
4808000	4810000	You want to talk about trading games?
4810000	4812000	That's right. You want to talk about
4812000	4814000	paying those fees for the
4814000	4816000	Unreal Engine? Yeah, let's talk about that.
4816000	4818000	So, very interesting
4818000	4820000	what they've done there.
4820000	4822000	That may cause Steam to make a counterplay.
4822000	4824000	You know, the thing is,
4824000	4826000	Epic is
4826000	4828000	the company to take on Steam right now
4828000	4830000	because Epic has Fortnite.
4830000	4832000	Steam doesn't have any
4832000	4834000	new games that are huge.
4834000	4836000	Speaking of, I forgot one of the announcements
4836000	4838000	that they made during the whole
4838000	4840000	Game Awards. If it's not Half-Life 3,
4840000	4842000	I don't give a fuck. It's not Half-Life 3.
4842000	4844000	It's Counter-Strike.
4844000	4846000	Counter-Strike GO is going free to play,
4846000	4848000	and they have this new
4848000	4850000	battle royale mode
4850000	4852000	called Danger Zone,
4852000	4854000	which is in there. Please tell me
4854000	4856000	we played Kenny Loggins. They didn't
4856000	4858000	play Kenny Loggins, but
4858000	4860000	yeah, so now they're trying to compete directly
4860000	4862000	with that by having Counter-Strike GO
4862000	4864000	be free to play, which pissed
4864000	4866000	so many people off.
4866000	4868000	So many people are not happy
4868000	4870000	about that either.
4870000	4872000	Well, Valve also wanted to explain
4872000	4874000	why a certain Steam algorithm
4874000	4876000	led to smaller games losing traffic.
4876000	4878000	There was a bug in October that made
4878000	4880000	the more-like-this section of
4880000	4882000	pages, I guess, start acting up
4882000	4884000	in favor of more popular games
4884000	4886000	on Steam. Valve did fix this, but
4886000	4888000	it kept a change that factored
4888000	4890000	in the sales, the wishlist
4890000	4892000	popularity, so the games that saw
4892000	4894000	traffic got changed as a result.
4894000	4896000	So, I guess now a new algorithm
4896000	4898000	is in place, and it shows fewer
4898000	4900000	products to a subset of customers. Anyway,
4900000	4902000	Valve is saying the traffic has recovered
4902000	4904000	towards the end of October as a result,
4904000	4906000	and things have stabilized, but again,
4906000	4908000	indie developers kind of got one-two
4908000	4910000	punched with
4910000	4912000	both these news articles this week.
4912000	4914000	By the way, have you all checked out
4914000	4916000	Falling Plus on Steam?
4916000	4918000	Support our buddy YYR, just
4918000	4920000	because he needs it right now after
4920000	4922000	hearing these one-two stories. I hope you all
4922000	4924000	And honestly, if you're not going to support
4924000	4926000	YYR because his games don't call to you,
4926000	4928000	then cool, support somebody. Go
4928000	4930000	buy an indie game. We've had tons of indie developers
4930000	4932000	here on this game. Timespinner,
4932000	4934000	go get that, or Monsters &
4934000	4936000	Monocles, they'd love your money too. Any of those
4936000	4938000	games we've had here on this show, go give them some
4938000	4940000	money. They'd appreciate that.
4940000	4942000	Alright.
4942000	4944000	Anyway.
4944000	4946000	Moving on, just a few more stories for you guys
4946000	4948000	before we get to the classic peripheral of the month.
4948000	4950000	The last one ever!
4950000	4952000	Because we're going to change it in 2019, but we'll get there in a minute.
4952000	4954000	For now, Dark Sakura, what do you have
4954000	4956000	for us? Well, there
4956000	4958000	is a game that we
4958000	4960000	used to talk some shit about
4960000	4962000	until we figured out it was actually good.
4962000	4964000	That is coming out
4964000	4966000	on Instant Games on Facebook.
4966000	4968000	You want to know what that is?
4968000	4970000	Pump It Up!
4970000	4972000	HTML5 edition. How do you play
4972000	4974000	that on Facebook? I have no fucking clue.
4974000	4976000	I guess with a keyboard.
4976000	4978000	Well, Andamiro has
4978000	4980000	decided to go via Facebook, so
4980000	4982000	it is playable on
4982000	4984000	mobile, PC, or anywhere else
4984000	4986000	with an internet connection.
4986000	4988000	It has 100 songs, different play
4988000	4990000	modes, custom play styles,
4990000	4992000	and they'll release more information over
4992000	4994000	time. Now, if it actually
4994000	4996000	has a dance pad, that'll be even
4996000	4998000	better, but no, probably not.
4998000	5000000	But anyway,
5000000	5002000	star points are used to buy the songs
5002000	5004000	and you start off with 10.
5004000	5006000	Step points are used to play the game, and you start
5006000	5008000	with 60 step points, so with each song, and depending
5008000	5010000	on how well you do, you earn
5010000	5012000	more star points as a reward.
5012000	5014000	And I'm pretty
5014000	5016000	sure that you can
5016000	5018000	buy more, but right now, the only thing
5018000	5020000	you've got up there is Pump It Up! H5
5020000	5022000	on Instant Games on Facebook.
5022000	5024000	And that's it.
5024000	5026000	Okay, cool. Like, you know,
5026000	5028000	it's not something I'm probably going to invest a lot of time
5028000	5030000	in, but sure, more
5030000	5032000	mobile games on the go. Why not? As long as
5032000	5034000	Run To You is on it, I don't care.
5034000	5036000	Bounce with me, bounce with me. Oh, I love
5036000	5038000	that song. Anyway.
5038000	5040000	Act F does want to point out, there was Pump It
5040000	5042000	Up! Portable on the PSP,
5042000	5044000	two of them, so there was, I guess, another
5044000	5046000	portable version a long time ago, but
5046000	5048000	who has a working PSP? I shouldn't say that.
5048000	5050000	Probably a lot of people have to work through PSPs.
5050000	5052000	I'm not sure if they're working.
5052000	5054000	Do you know what somebody tweeted about today that made me
5054000	5056000	go, aw, somebody tweeted,
5056000	5058000	and I'm sorry, I forgot who you are, but somebody tweeted me
5058000	5060000	saying, I first started listening
5060000	5062000	to OLR because of OLRPSP.com,
5062000	5064000	which hasn't been updated since you first started listening.
5064000	5066000	Does it even still work?
5066000	5068000	I think we stopped paying for it.
5068000	5070000	It's long gone.
5070000	5072000	There's probably a domain squatter there now.
5072000	5074000	But, um, yeah, I just remember,
5074000	5076000	like, oh, remember, I just
5076000	5078000	want to kind of give you a pat on the back, Loki,
5078000	5080000	because a lot of that PSP innovation was you. You did
5080000	5082000	good in that time. Like, that
5082000	5084000	PSP stuff that we really embraced. It was very limited
5084000	5086000	what we could do with that. I know, but still,
5086000	5088000	I loved having
5088000	5090000	more podcast stuff on a
5090000	5092000	gaming platform. You know what I mean?
5092000	5094000	It's harder to do that now. I can't just whip
5094000	5096000	up an Xbox One game. Thanks to PSP
5096000	5098000	Radio that they have their
5098000	5100000	radio app or whatever.
5100000	5102000	Aw, everybody in chat is having a
5102000	5104000	moment to pour one out for OLRPSP.
5104000	5106000	Oh.
5106000	5108000	Bonds006 says, OLR for PSP
5108000	5110000	was the shit. I mean,
5110000	5112000	I wish we'd done something
5112000	5114000	that smart since.
5114000	5116000	Oh, well.
5116000	5118000	We'll do it for Game Boy at Pants Browser.
5118000	5120000	Alright,
5120000	5122000	moving on. Just a couple more stories.
5122000	5124000	Loki. So, the Game Wars wasn't the only
5124000	5126000	kind of game showcase that would happen
5126000	5128000	this week. Also, there was the kind of funny
5128000	5130000	game showcase, which
5130000	5132000	they showed off a stream of
5132000	5134000	a bunch of different indie games that are going to be
5134000	5136000	coming out in 2019. So,
5136000	5138000	some of these are actually pretty cool.
5138000	5140000	They showed a new trailer for Super Meat Boy
5140000	5142000	Forever, which I guess is now releasing April
5142000	5144000	2019, and of course, you guys are aware
5144000	5146000	what Super Meat Boy is.
5146000	5148000	There's a game called Moving Out, which is
5148000	5150000	by the guys that did Overcooked
5150000	5152000	in Overcooked 2,
5152000	5154000	which looks hilarious. It's a game basically about
5154000	5156000	moving your friends out of a house,
5156000	5158000	but it's just like Overcooked
5158000	5160000	that's kind of silly and fun.
5160000	5162000	So, that's going to be coming
5162000	5164000	out on PC and consoles also in
5164000	5166000	2019. Showed another trailer
5166000	5168000	for ToeJam and Earl Back in the Groove,
5168000	5170000	which is coming out March 1st.
5172000	5174000	Then they've got,
5174000	5176000	let's see, a game called Quarantine
5176000	5178000	Circular, which is out on the Switch
5178000	5180000	already. Conan
5180000	5182000	Unconquered,
5182000	5184000	which looked like a new Conan
5184000	5186000	game. Human Fall
5186000	5188000	Flat Dark, which is going to be a DLC
5188000	5190000	update to that game.
5190000	5192000	They had a game called Vain,
5192000	5194000	which I don't really get to watch this
5194000	5196000	trailer, but it looks like
5196000	5198000	some artsy
5198000	5200000	indie game there, and I guess you can turn into
5200000	5202000	a bird. And then they had
5202000	5204000	a game called, this made me think of you Rob,
5204000	5206000	Supermarket Shriek.
5208000	5210000	It's about a guy,
5210000	5212000	a guy and a goat. It's me
5212000	5214000	when I see box wine is on sale.
5214000	5216000	A guy and a goat being
5216000	5218000	like going through a
5218000	5220000	supermarket screaming and they have to
5220000	5222000	crash into a bunch of stuff. I don't really know what it was,
5222000	5224000	but it looks hilarious. I'm
5224000	5226000	so down, it sounds great. So yeah, that's
5226000	5228000	going to be coming out as well.
5228000	5230000	A game called Fold Apart, which is
5230000	5232000	a game about
5232000	5234000	these two characters that have
5234000	5236000	a long distance
5236000	5238000	love
5238000	5240000	for each other and they have to
5240000	5242000	use this page folding
5242000	5244000	mechanic to get them to meet
5244000	5246000	each other. And that's going to be coming out as
5246000	5248000	well soon. And then
5248000	5250000	Desert Child, which is a cyberpunk
5250000	5252000	beat-em-up racer game.
5252000	5254000	That's like retro. That's going to be coming
5254000	5256000	out on consoles and
5256000	5258000	PC as well.
5258000	5260000	Actually, that's coming out this week
5260000	5262000	on December 11th. So PS4,
5262000	5264000	Switch, and PC. And the
5264000	5266000	little trailer that they had for it looks very
5266000	5268000	reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop.
5268000	5270000	So, looks pretty awesome.
5270000	5272000	Seeya Tiberian
5272000	5274000	chat says Rob Roberts is low-key
5274000	5276000	turning into Monique Hart tonight.
5276000	5278000	OK! Brown Cow
5278000	5280000	stunning! Yeah, but Supermarket
5280000	5282000	Shriek looks awesome because
5282000	5284000	I so watch Supermarket
5284000	5286000	Sweep all the time. And
5286000	5288000	that show is fantastic.
5288000	5290000	But this doesn't necessarily look like that.
5290000	5292000	It's just like ridiculous. I can just imagine
5292000	5294000	you know the goat screaming sound and some guy
5294000	5296000	screaming for no
5296000	5298000	reason whatsoever.
5298000	5300000	Rob needs to stream that.
5300000	5302000	I'm going to do it. Done. We're going to do
5302000	5304000	some Supermarket Shrieking.
5304000	5306000	Oh girl.
5306000	5308000	You should play it too, DartSagra. Be fun.
5308000	5310000	Something else that I
5310000	5312000	probably won't be streaming anytime soon because that would
5312000	5314000	involve me having to buy one is the PlayStation
5314000	5316000	Classic. They're all over the place. They're just
5316000	5318000	sitting on shelves. Please buy
5318000	5320000	one. Well, here's the
5320000	5322000	thing. Is
5322000	5324000	it really news for me
5324000	5326000	to say they're already finding
5326000	5328000	ways how to hack these things wide-ass open?
5328000	5330000	Is that news?
5330000	5332000	No. Is it really news?
5332000	5334000	No.
5334000	5336000	But here I am.
5336000	5338000	Apparently some USB keyboards
5338000	5340000	can be plugged into the PlayStation Classic
5340000	5342000	and it will allow you
5342000	5344000	I'm sorry, this is just funny.
5344000	5346000	It will allow you to access the emulator
5346000	5348000	settings because of course
5348000	5350000	the PlayStation Classic is using some open source
5350000	5352000	emulator and you can just go in there and
5352000	5354000	access the emulator settings with certain
5354000	5356000	keyboards. I don't know what it is but I guess some
5356000	5358000	will work some more. Some Corsair and
5358000	5360000	stuff keywords and ironically
5360000	5362000	enough I have one of the compatible keyboards
5362000	5364000	for that. How about that? Yep.
5364000	5366000	Now they are saying use with caution
5366000	5368000	because you don't know how you're going to fuck up your PlayStation.
5368000	5370000	I had heard that somebody went in
5370000	5372000	there and just changed some
5372000	5374000	setting and got the
5374000	5376000	US versions of those games.
5376000	5378000	Yeah you can change the rendering setting from
5378000	5380000	NTSC to auto to
5380000	5382000	PAL and you do that. And then there is
5382000	5384000	also a way they can also change
5384000	5386000	I think you can overclock the system like 20%
5386000	5388000	doing that as well.
5388000	5390000	Which got I guess Ridge Racer
5390000	5392000	type R4 to actually
5392000	5394000	run correctly.
5394000	5396000	Now I don't know if I fully
5396000	5398000	understand what exactly happened
5398000	5400000	here but I guess somebody went into the
5400000	5402000	PlayStation and data mined it.
5402000	5404000	Which is you know everything gets mined for data right?
5404000	5406000	It was the source
5406000	5408000	code because the reason
5408000	5410000	why is the
5410000	5412000	licensing that they had on there.
5412000	5414000	There was a dump of
5414000	5416000	the core that was
5416000	5418000	on a PCSX
5418000	5420000	PlayStation emulator. So they had to have
5420000	5422000	I think they dumped it to
5422000	5424000	GitHub or something like that. So they had
5424000	5426000	the source on there. So it
5426000	5428000	showed that there were 36
5428000	5430000	other games I guess like their
5430000	5432000	names were buried in the code or there was something
5432000	5434000	pointed to these games in the code
5434000	5436000	that make it seem like these games
5436000	5438000	were like tested on this
5438000	5440000	or at one point were possibly
5440000	5442000	being included but it ended up not
5442000	5444000	being included. And so of course you know
5444000	5446000	as I'm about to name some of these games
5446000	5448000	these are all the games you really wanted right?
5448000	5450000	Such as Chocobos
5450000	5452000	Mysterious Dungeon, Crash
5452000	5454000	Bandicoot, Driver
5454000	5456000	I said that for you Logie. Or guys
5456000	5458000	I also said that for you Logie.
5458000	5460000	Clona, Clonoa
5460000	5462000	I love Clonoa.
5462000	5464000	Let's see, Parappa the Rappa I said that for myself.
5464000	5466000	Silent Hill, I said that for
5466000	5468000	everybody because if you have taste you love Silent Hill.
5468000	5470000	Sweet Coden
5470000	5472000	and the first two Tomb Raider games. Obviously
5472000	5474000	the list is gigantic there's many more I'm not
5474000	5476000	saying. So some
5476000	5478000	reports saying these games are actually there on
5478000	5480000	the console but nobody's... No I think they're not.
5480000	5482000	Yeah I think that would have been a really dumb thing
5482000	5484000	to leave on there and it could have left them open to a lawsuit
5484000	5486000	but certainly some things are pointing
5486000	5488000	out. Weren't some of those in the Japanese
5488000	5490000	version because the Japanese version got different games
5490000	5492000	than we did. We got, like they got
5492000	5494000	Armored Core and
5494000	5496000	I don't know about, I don't think they get
5496000	5498000	Ergites but I thought they had Parasite Eve
5498000	5500000	over there. Yes they do they have some different
5500000	5502000	they have some more RPG type games. So Parasite Eve I could
5502000	5504000	see that but
5504000	5506000	yeah they got the better list out of this
5506000	5508000	Clonoa. Well it depends on what you're into but
5508000	5510000	from my perspective yes I agree
5510000	5512000	they got the better list.
5512000	5514000	Anyway let's
5514000	5516000	take a trip down memory lane
5516000	5518000	shall we?
5518000	5520000	We're going to do the classic game of the week where every
5520000	5522000	week Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds
5522000	5524000	a game that she thinks hey you brats
5524000	5526000	you should be playing this game this week you don't need no
5526000	5528000	PlayStation Classic for this. It's a little sticky
5528000	5530000	and gross. But this week it
5530000	5532000	is a little bit different because Dark
5532000	5534000	Soccer for the past 11
5534000	5536000	months every month in 2018
5536000	5538000	once a month she has flipped
5538000	5540000	the damn script
5540000	5542000	and she's done a peripheral to
5542000	5544000	highlight instead of a game. As you do
5544000	5546000	as you do once in a while. It's how we keep it fresh.
5546000	5548000	So anyway this is the last
5548000	5550000	one we're going to do something else in 2019
5550000	5552000	so we'll talk about that in a minute.
5552000	5554000	But what is the last classic
5554000	5556000	peripheral of the week?
5556000	5558000	It is actually two
5558000	5560000	peripherals. But they are
5560000	5562000	very similar in concept.
5562000	5564000	The first one is
5564000	5566000	the VMU our visual memory
5566000	5568000	unit for Dreamcast. And so
5568000	5570000	I didn't really want to have a YouTube of just
5570000	5572000	Dreamcast noises. I do
5572000	5574000	have just that lovely
5574000	5576000	intro.
5576000	5578000	It's
5578000	5580000	just like
5580000	5582000	you took the world's biggest P.
5582000	5584000	It's just refreshing. Thank God. I would
5584000	5586000	go for a Dreamcast
5586000	5588000	classic mini. Yes me too.
5588000	5590000	It sounds like the
5590000	5592000	nasty plunge. So anyway
5592000	5594000	and now you're just going to hear Sonic Adventure because
5594000	5596000	that's what I picked.
5596000	5598000	You know Dan was actually
5598000	5600000	watching like a full playthrough of that the other day.
5600000	5602000	It's probably the same
5602000	5604000	one I'm looking at right now.
5604000	5606000	Much longer. Anyway
5606000	5608000	but Sonic used the VMU.
5608000	5610000	Yes so the visual memory unit also
5610000	5612000	known as the visual memory system
5612000	5614000	was
5614000	5616000	a memory card
5616000	5618000	that was produced by Sega for the Dreamcast.
5618000	5620000	It had a
5620000	5622000	monochrome LCD
5622000	5624000	multiplayer gaming
5624000	5626000	capability via the connectors on
5626000	5628000	top. Second screen functionality
5628000	5630000	a real time clock file manager
5630000	5632000	built in flash memory and
5632000	5634000	sound capability.
5634000	5636000	It actually before the launch
5636000	5638000	of the Dreamcast
5638000	5640000	in Japan
5640000	5642000	there was actually a special
5642000	5644000	Godzilla edition. Guess who owns one?
5644000	5646000	This bitch. I also have
5646000	5648000	the Ghidorah one. And yes
5648000	5650000	I raised my mini Godzilla like
5650000	5652000	a freaking Tamagotchi.
5652000	5654000	So
5654000	5656000	it is at its
5656000	5658000	most basic function
5658000	5660000	it is a memory card.
5660000	5662000	It's a storage device. But it also
5662000	5664000	will give you like certain
5664000	5666000	layout things like
5666000	5668000	you know a heart sensor in some
5668000	5670000	games you know for your characters health.
5670000	5674000	You know all kinds of
5674000	5676000	different stuff but it has like some other console
5676000	5678000	like features on it. Including
5678000	5680000	a D-pad. It had
5680000	5682000	a couple of buttons. It had
5682000	5684000	you know
5684000	5686000	different you know like a mode
5686000	5688000	and a sleep button.
5688000	5690000	But there were also
5690000	5692000	other special edition VMUs
5692000	5694000	like the ones released by Sonic Team
5694000	5696000	Capcom and the Hello Kitty one by
5696000	5698000	Sanrio.
5698000	5700000	So it will plug directly into
5700000	5702000	the controller of the
5702000	5704000	Dreamcast. And of course
5704000	5706000	that's how you would look down on it to do
5706000	5708000	different playing. You can
5708000	5710000	also hook one to
5710000	5712000	the other via the connectors on the top like I mentioned.
5712000	5714000	The VMU runs on
5714000	5716000	two CR2032 lithium
5716000	5718000	batteries that are inserted
5718000	5720000	into the rear VMU.
5720000	5722000	I will tell you this.
5722000	5724000	My Japanese VMUs
5724000	5726000	still freaking work.
5726000	5728000	Just saying.
5728000	5734000	But a VMU without battery power will
5734000	5736000	beep when the Dreamcast is powered on
5736000	5738000	if the VMU
5738000	5740000	is inserted into the
5740000	5742000	Dreamcast controller.
5742000	5744000	So as far as
5744000	5746000	its technical capabilities
5746000	5748000	it had 128 kilobytes
5748000	5750000	of flash memory.
5750000	5752000	Holy moly! 48 by 32
5752000	5754000	LCD screen.
5754000	5756000	So basically a VMU
5756000	5758000	is two Commodore 64's stuck
5758000	5760000	taped together.
5760000	5762000	But it actually would fit in
5762000	5764000	your pocket.
5764000	5766000	It had a one channel PWM sound
5766000	5768000	source. It had
5768000	5770000	the D-pad. Four input buttons
5770000	5772000	and one reset button.
5772000	5774000	It, like I said, functions as a
5774000	5776000	memory card, second screen, minigames,
5776000	5778000	a calendar to file manager.
5780000	5782000	It only weighed like
5782000	5784000	one and a half ounces.
5784000	5786000	It was really really tiny.
5788000	5790000	So as far as the data
5790000	5792000	that it would store,
5792000	5794000	28 kilobytes of it were
5794000	5796000	reserved for system usage and
5796000	5798000	100 kilobytes were used for data
5798000	5800000	storage which was divided into 200 blocks.
5802000	5804000	And then homebrew programs
5804000	5806000	like Dream Explorer or the VMU tool
5806000	5808000	would unlock
5808000	5810000	more of the reserved space
5810000	5812000	that you could save more on it.
5812000	5814000	As far as different minigames
5814000	5816000	you had Chao Adventure
5816000	5818000	from Sonic Adventure
5818000	5820000	games. You had
5820000	5822000	Sega GT
5822000	5824000	included Pocket GT which was
5824000	5826000	kind of a top down racer
5826000	5828000	a bit like how Spy Hunter did.
5828000	5830000	But now
5830000	5832000	as I was mentioning for Code Veronica
5832000	5834000	you had a heart meter on it
5834000	5836000	that would show you your character's health.
5836000	5838000	And that was pretty cool.
5838000	5840000	Now people have done different homebrew
5840000	5842000	games on it.
5842000	5844000	Including a version of Metroid,
5844000	5846000	VMU
5846000	5848000	Deepak Man, Breakout, Space Invaders,
5848000	5850000	Tetris, VMU Fighter
5850000	5852000	which is a side scrolling shoot em up.
5852000	5854000	VMU Chao Editor 1 and 2
5854000	5856000	so you can make your own Chao.
5856000	5858000	VMU Football for American
5858000	5860000	Football. VMU A Sketch
5860000	5862000	which was an Etch A Sketch thing.
5862000	5864000	And 3D First Person Shooter.
5864000	5866000	So
5866000	5868000	some of the games that would use
5868000	5870000	them to put in different extras
5870000	5872000	is like that Cardcaptor Sakura game
5872000	5874000	that I have Rob. They came with the plate
5874000	5876000	and all that shit. I'll never get over
5876000	5878000	the fact that you bought a game with a plate.
5878000	5880000	And a clock and a spoon.
5880000	5882000	It also had a pillow case.
5882000	5884000	But it came with a version of Breakout,
5884000	5886000	Oyatu, and Toba Kero
5886000	5888000	and it had a clock with different themes on it.
5888000	5890000	I'm looking at some
5890000	5892000	of the other ones in here. Godzilla Generation
5892000	5894000	had Atsumete Godzilla,
5894000	5896000	Gamera Dream Battle and
5896000	5898000	Mothra Dream Battle. Jet Set Radio
5898000	5900000	1
5900000	5902000	had, well Jet Grind Radio, Jet Set Radio
5902000	5904000	had a graffiti transfer.
5904000	5906000	Marvel vs. Capcom 2 would let you do
5906000	5908000	character transfer, colors,
5908000	5910000	and stages.
5910000	5912000	Pop and Music had
5912000	5914000	Pop and Music Anywhere minigame.
5914000	5916000	Power Stone came with three different games
5916000	5918000	on it. Like
5918000	5920000	Gun Rock's Gun Gun Shot, Falcon's
5920000	5922000	Aerial Adventure, Ayame's Shuriken
5922000	5924000	Training.
5924000	5926000	Look at some of the other ones on here. I'm just going through
5926000	5928000	some of the best. Shenmue had Shenmue goodies
5928000	5930000	and training instructions.
5930000	5932000	We got all the chao ones.
5932000	5934000	Let me see what else.
5934000	5936000	Trick Style had Trick Style Jr.
5936000	5938000	on it. Time Stalkers came with different
5938000	5940000	minigames. Tokyo
5940000	5942000	Bus Guide had a traffic sign
5942000	5944000	quiz.
5944000	5946000	Other things is like what they would do just like
5946000	5948000	you know plugged into the games like
5948000	5950000	Ready to Rumble would add a punch
5950000	5952000	count and a hit percentage.
5952000	5954000	Quick 3 Arena played
5954000	5956000	different
5956000	5958000	animations. Pop and Music
5958000	5960000	had Virtual Pop and Music Controller.
5960000	5962000	Namco Museum
5962000	5964000	sorry that was the one that came with
5964000	5966000	Packet.
5966000	5968000	NFL 2K came with
5968000	5970000	Secret Plays.
5970000	5972000	F355 Challenge came with
5972000	5974000	Arcade Connectivity.
5974000	5976000	Dino Crisis, Health Condition, and Ammo Count.
5976000	5978000	So there's just all kinds of different stuff.
5978000	5980000	D2 had
5980000	5982000	a
5982000	5984000	what's the word I'm thinking of? A compass.
5984000	5986000	Girl you're going to go all night if you read every game
5986000	5988000	So for the other versions
5988000	5990000	that came out there were
5990000	5992000	some memory cards
5992000	5994000	that came out like a VMU that
5994000	5996000	had none of the VMU features.
5996000	5998000	So they had no display
5998000	6000000	input button, speaker, built in clock
6000000	6002000	but they had
6002000	6004000	multiple pages to save. There was the
6004000	6006000	4X memory card that Sega released.
6006000	6008000	It had 800 blocks.
6008000	6010000	I think I have one of those too.
6010000	6012000	It did not come out in Europe.
6012000	6014000	There were of course a bunch
6014000	6016000	of third party memory cards.
6016000	6018000	But as far as the
6018000	6020000	reception goes, GamesRadar
6020000	6022000	said in a 10 year retrospective
6022000	6024000	it was one of their favorite storage devices.
6024000	6026000	Because it was
6026000	6028000	such an original concept.
6028000	6030000	That brings me to the knockoff
6030000	6032000	concept. The Pocket Station.
6032000	6034000	Dun dun dun.
6034000	6036000	How about some
6036000	6038000	some
6038000	6040000	Vibrobin Music Rob?
6040000	6042000	Oh I will work on that right now.
6042000	6044000	You know I love me some Vibrobin.
6044000	6046000	So Pocket Station
6046000	6048000	is basically Sony's
6048000	6050000	version of the VMU.
6050000	6052000	It
6052000	6054000	was sold as a
6054000	6056000	combination memory card and a
6056000	6058000	miniature personal digital assistant
6058000	6060000	that had a monochrome
6060000	6062000	LCD, infrared communication
6062000	6064000	capability, a real time clock
6064000	6066000	built in flash memory and sound capability.
6066000	6068000	To use the memory card
6068000	6070000	it has to be connected to a Playstation
6070000	6072000	and it was released exclusively in Japan
6072000	6074000	on January 23, 1999.
6074000	6076000	It was
6076000	6078000	used for specific
6078000	6080000	games.
6080000	6082000	It was actually
6082000	6084000	delayed with its release.
6084000	6086000	And of course
6086000	6088000	Sony was actually planning on releasing it outside of
6088000	6090000	Japan, but the release
6090000	6092000	never happened due to
6092000	6094000	inability to meet
6094000	6096000	the Japanese demand for
6096000	6098000	they were focusing on the Japanese market.
6098000	6100000	But a few games such as Final Fantasy 8
6100000	6102000	and Saga Frontier 2
6102000	6104000	still had Pocket Station functionality for
6104000	6106000	their local versions.
6106000	6108000	The most popular game for Pocket Station was
6108000	6110000	Doko demo Isho
6110000	6112000	which sold 1.5 million
6112000	6114000	copies in Japan.
6114000	6116000	It was the first game to star
6116000	6118000	Sony's mascot, Toro.
6118000	6120000	Who was that
6120000	6122000	little funny Sony cat looking thing?
6122000	6124000	The Pocket Station
6124000	6126000	was discontinued in July 2002.
6126000	6128000	Now
6128000	6130000	it was announced that the Pocket Station
6130000	6132000	was going to be revived
6132000	6134000	as an application for Playstation Vita.
6134000	6136000	It was
6136000	6138000	only available at first to Playstation Plus
6138000	6140000	members and then was released to the
6140000	6142000	general public and was exclusive
6142000	6144000	to Japanese Playstation Vitas.
6144000	6146000	It
6146000	6148000	actually had a smaller screen
6148000	6150000	on it than the Dreamcast.
6150000	6152000	Five input buttons, one reset
6152000	6154000	buttons. It did
6154000	6156000	have bi-directional infra-red.
6156000	6158000	The
6158000	6160000	battery it used was a 1 CR 2032
6160000	6162000	lithium battery.
6162000	6164000	It had calendar functions and
6164000	6166000	identification numbers. It weighed
6166000	6168000	30 grams and it came in different colors.
6168000	6170000	There was white, crystal clear.
6170000	6172000	Black for the
6172000	6174000	Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories limited edition
6174000	6176000	in Japan. Crystal slash clear
6176000	6178000	pink for Tokimeki Memorial 2
6178000	6180000	limited editions.
6180000	6182000	It worked with DDR.
6182000	6184000	Everything from third mix,
6184000	6186000	fourth mix, and fifth mix.
6186000	6188000	It worked with Soul
6188000	6190000	Hackers. It worked with Digi-One Trainers,
6190000	6192000	Final Fantasy VIII, Fire Pro G,
6192000	6194000	Grandia,
6194000	6196000	IQ Final,
6196000	6198000	Jade Cocoon, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
6198000	6200000	I'm just trying to think of some other
6200000	6202000	games that people would know over here. Legend of Mana.
6202000	6204000	Weren't they going to re-release
6204000	6206000	Vib-Ribbon? Did it ever come out?
6206000	6208000	It did on the Vita and I thought it came out on
6208000	6210000	Playstation 3. I don't know if it ever did on
6210000	6212000	Playstation 4. Remember, Playstation 4 can't play
6212000	6214000	PS1 games. Well, I don't know why I said
6214000	6216000	Vib-Ribbon because it doesn't work with it.
6216000	6218000	I guess
6218000	6220000	I just wanted to hear Vib-Ribbon.
6220000	6222000	She just wanted to hear Vib-Ribbon.
6222000	6224000	It worked with Ray Crisis.
6224000	6226000	Also, super awesome
6226000	6228000	game. It worked with R4.
6228000	6230000	You know what game that I played that it
6230000	6232000	worked with?
6232000	6234000	You don't get music anymore.
6234000	6236000	Final Fantasy VIII? Didn't Final Fantasy VIII work
6236000	6238000	with it? That's what I said earlier.
6238000	6240000	It also did work with
6240000	6242000	Shirooch Justice Gakuen
6244000	6246000	which was
6246000	6248000	the evolution disc for Rival Schools
6248000	6250000	because there was that
6250000	6252000	dance mode on it. I remember I used to leave it
6252000	6254000	plugged into my Playstation
6254000	6256000	and
6256000	6258000	I'd do some mode where the chocobo would
6258000	6260000	walk and it would get items
6260000	6262000	and I just left it running
6262000	6264000	overnight or a couple days
6264000	6266000	and I had like a hundred or so
6266000	6268000	items from that made the game
6268000	6270000	so much easier.
6270000	6272000	It really did actually work with quite a good
6272000	6274000	number of games.
6274000	6276000	Chocobo Stallion?
6278000	6280000	Ark the Lad 3
6280000	6282000	I'm just again trying to think of games that
6282000	6284000	I know of that people might
6284000	6286000	recognize. Love Hina 2
6286000	6288000	Metal Gear Solid
6288000	6290000	Integral
6290000	6292000	and actually Metal Gear Solid
6292000	6294000	Integral was one of the US games that would
6294000	6296000	work with. Same with Ray
6296000	6298000	Ray Crisis
6298000	6300000	and then Rival Schools 2
6300000	6302000	and Rockman Complete Works
6302000	6304000	and there you go. So yeah
6304000	6306000	it was pretty popular
6306000	6308000	but alas
6308000	6310000	it only had a three year life.
6310000	6312000	Alright.
6312000	6314000	It lived about as long as a beta.
6314000	6316000	So there it is. Your classic peripheral of
6316000	6318000	the month. The pairing of the
6318000	6320000	VMU and the PocketStation
6320000	6322000	which kind of mixed memory with portable
6322000	6324000	gaming with...
6324000	6326000	With boredom alleviation. I feel like it was
6326000	6328000	the precursor to other second screen
6328000	6330000	things like cell phone
6330000	6332000	gaming. What do they call that
6332000	6334000	Microsoft thing that was short lived? Share
6334000	6336000	screen? Second screen? What do they call that whole thing?
6336000	6338000	Or the Wii U quite frankly.
6338000	6340000	Or
6340000	6342000	even the DS.
6342000	6344000	Kinda. Or what's really kind of like mobile
6344000	6346000	phones now I think honestly has kind of filled in that
6346000	6348000	void. Thank you Smart Glass.
6348000	6350000	We actually have color. Don't be a
6350000	6352000	smart glass. Alright. Before
6352000	6354000	we go to our music break I do
6354000	6356000	want to recap since that was the last
6356000	6358000	speaking of music classic peripheral
6358000	6360000	of the month. Hold on though. I want to
6360000	6362000	recap our twelve peripherals of
6362000	6364000	the twelve days of peripherals. So
6364000	6366000	we had in January the
6366000	6368000	U Force. February
6368000	6370000	was the activator.
6370000	6372000	March was the NG
6372000	6374000	Con. April
6374000	6376000	was the Saturn Twin Stick slash Dreamcast
6376000	6378000	Twin Stick. May
6378000	6380000	was the XE1 AP.
6380000	6382000	June was the trans vibrator
6382000	6384000	cause obviously if we're gonna do
6384000	6386000	a peripheral we had to do the trans vibrator at some point.
6386000	6388000	So she did that for my birthday month.
6388000	6390000	Dance Pads in July.
6390000	6392000	Cause you know it was a show that we met
6392000	6394000	playing DDR so we've done our fair share of dance pads.
6394000	6396000	August was the sewing machine.
6396000	6398000	It was the
6398000	6400000	Raku Raku mission. The sewing
6400000	6402000	machine. Yes. The sewing machine's awesome.
6402000	6404000	September was the Sega 3D glasses.
6404000	6406000	And October was the
6406000	6408000	Steel Battalion controller cause we kinda did a
6408000	6410000	combo that week. And then last
6410000	6412000	month was the Wii Balance board and we ended
6412000	6414000	it with the VMU and the Pocket Station.
6414000	6416000	So. Yes.
6416000	6418000	So starting in 2019
6418000	6420000	so here's the thing. 2017 we mixed
6420000	6422000	it up with the classic system of the month.
6422000	6424000	This year was the classic peripheral
6424000	6426000	of the month. So next year in 2019
6426000	6428000	not only will you get
6428000	6430000	several classic games of the week every month
6430000	6432000	but once a month you're gonna get the
6432000	6434000	drum roll. We're gonna get the classic
6434000	6436000	soundtrack. Game soundtrack.
6436000	6438000	Awesome.
6438000	6440000	This is just a way for you to re-highlight
6440000	6442000	games you've already done isn't it?
6442000	6444000	Not particularly no. Because
6444000	6446000	there and I'm actually gonna try to
6446000	6448000	avoid the usual stuff like Super Metroid
6448000	6450000	and Final Fantasy. Well I mean you don't have to.
6450000	6452000	Well and the thing is
6452000	6454000	I want this to actually extend
6454000	6456000	for a couple years because there are so many
6456000	6458000	awesome soundtracks.
6458000	6460000	And there are games out
6460000	6462000	there that one wouldn't think about the
6462000	6464000	degree of how awesome the soundtrack are.
6464000	6466000	And I may or may not do some of the ones
6466000	6468000	that I'm gonna name but Zero Wing.
6468000	6470000	I mean how's that?
6470000	6472000	There is also
6472000	6474000	oh what was that shooter game
6474000	6476000	that used
6476000	6478000	2 Unlimited's music?
6478000	6480000	Oh okay.
6480000	6482000	So like games that maybe used some
6482000	6484000	like cool music that you may have forgot about
6484000	6486000	type of thing. Okay I'm down with that.
6486000	6488000	You know and I'm not gonna go for like anything relatively
6488000	6490000	new either. I'd like to focus on 16
6490000	6492000	and 32 bit systems.
6492000	6494000	Even 8 bit systems like Wrecka.
6494000	6496000	Although you really should do Alan Wake.
6496000	6498000	Oh my god the licensed music in that game is so good.
6498000	6500000	But it's your segment. I'm gonna be going
6500000	6502000	for original pieces.
6502000	6504000	You know I'm just trying to think about
6504000	6506000	Ys III Wanderers from Ys.
6506000	6508000	Had a really good soundtrack and it's not one that people
6508000	6510000	would just oh Wanderers from Ys
6510000	6512000	or oh here's another one Rob.
6512000	6514000	Bejeweled
6514000	6516000	on iPhone. Okay.
6516000	6518000	And I'll tell you this
6518000	6520000	that game has some freaking astounding music
6520000	6522000	in it for a little iPhone game.
6522000	6524000	I can co-sign with Bobby Blackwell suggesting
6524000	6526000	Last Ninja on Commodore 64.
6526000	6528000	That's one of the greatest like
6528000	6530000	soundtracks that use that chipset.
6530000	6532000	Well and see that's what I want to do
6532000	6534000	is I want to focus on the things
6534000	6536000	that I
6536000	6538000	that I know
6538000	6540000	people wouldn't think of at first for like
6540000	6542000	amazing soundtracks. Right.
6542000	6544000	So you're gonna stay away from Final Fantasy 6 cause we all know that one.
6544000	6546000	You know those types of things.
6546000	6548000	Exactly. Okay.
6548000	6550000	I think it'll be fun.
6550000	6552000	How about Acid Tetris?
6552000	6554000	As a soundtrack featuring
6554000	6556000	our pal. Okay forget it.
6556000	6558000	I tried. I tried.
6558000	6560000	Alright. But at any rate
6560000	6562000	you know and I'd be happy
6562000	6564000	to take suggestions. I mean
6564000	6566000	I kind of wanted to do this one
6566000	6568000	twice a month. Instead
6568000	6570000	I'm gonna do it for over the next couple
6570000	6572000	years. Because
6572000	6574000	I think that there
6574000	6576000	are enough
6576000	6578000	I'd say
6578000	6580000	unrecognized or
6580000	6582000	what's the word I'm thinking of like not regularly
6582000	6584000	thought about.
6584000	6586000	You know soundtracks that
6586000	6588000	I think deserve a little bit of love. Sounds
6588000	6590000	good to me. Or fuck even the Guardian Legend
6590000	6592000	soundtrack is pretty fucking amazing.
6592000	6594000	But no one thinks about it. Because
6594000	6596000	honestly there are still people out there
6596000	6598000	those poor ignorant
6598000	6600000	fools who don't know what
6600000	6602000	awesomeness the Guardian Legend is. Basically them
6602000	6604000	kids. They get Gen Z.
6604000	6606000	They need to get the fuck
6606000	6608000	off my lawn and get into my house
6608000	6610000	on my Nintendo.
6610000	6612000	Right. And play some
6612000	6614000	fucking good games you dumb shits.
6614000	6616000	Classic soundtrack of the month coming in
6616000	6618000	2019. Please look forward to it.
6618000	6620000	Yes. Ewada bow. Alright.
6620000	6622000	That's gonna do it for part A. But we've
6622000	6624000	got plenty more show to come. We're gonna take a quick
6624000	6626000	break here live. We haven't done a break
6626000	6628000	live in a while because thanks to Radio Magic.
6628000	6630000	But we are gonna take a break and when we come back we have
6630000	6632000	more of Orange Lounge Radio right after
6632000	6634000	this. Please don't go anywhere.
6640000	6642000	Welcome back everybody to Orange
6642000	6644000	Lounge Radio. Live and in progress
6644000	6646000	here at the Voice Geeks Network.
6646000	6648000	For episode number 755
6648000	6650000	December 9th of
6650000	6652000	2018. Our show already in progress.
6652000	6654000	Already running pretty long.
6654000	6656000	Having a lot of good times. I think something about
6656000	6658000	Jamie being here and having another person to bounce
6658000	6660000	everything off of I think helps the show be that
6660000	6662000	three hour length we're used to. A lot
6662000	6664000	of the shows without you Jamie have been like two and a half
6664000	6666000	two. It's just shorter
6666000	6668000	when there's less people to talk to here.
6668000	6670000	So. Anyway.
6670000	6672000	I have a
6672000	6674000	I'm
6674000	6676000	happy to be here. I mean I like
6676000	6678000	having my Sundays off and I don't like
6678000	6680000	working on Sundays. I know. I know.
6680000	6682000	But you know what? Good for you and your job and I
6682000	6684000	know you're doing the type of work you
6684000	6686000	were more wanting to be doing. So sometimes
6686000	6688000	you have to make changes to do that. Radio magic
6688000	6690000	has been fun. Honestly and I was mentioning this
6690000	6692000	to the live only people.
6692000	6694000	But the radio magic stuff that we did
6694000	6696000	has been fun and it's actually
6696000	6698000	kind of got my gears turning for
6698000	6700000	why don't we do something like this all the time
6700000	6702000	even though you might still be here in studio
6702000	6704000	maybe there's a way we can do pre-recorded
6704000	6706000	segments that kind of allow us to
6706000	6708000	have a break in studio but still
6708000	6710000	do everything that you kind of get during the show.
6710000	6712000	I've been wanting to do a mini cast.
6712000	6714000	Yeah. That's like
6714000	6716000	maybe an expansion of the
6716000	6718000	classic game. Yeah maybe. Like
6718000	6720000	Jamie talk shit about games. Or something like
6720000	6722000	I know I know there are some there's a couple
6722000	6724000	of you out there that missed the
6724000	6726000	Pokestop podcast. Maybe something
6726000	6728000	like that once a month for like seven minutes just
6728000	6730000	to recap like what we've been doing. Maybe we'll be fun.
6730000	6732000	So I don't know. There's a lot of a lot of ideas
6732000	6734000	kind of floating around out there. We'll see what we
6734000	6736000	land on. Just a little bit of behind the scenes stuff.
6736000	6738000	Yeah. I am
6738000	6740000	actually working on my iMac right now.
6740000	6742000	And I've already got
6742000	6744000	logic. So
6744000	6746000	I've already
6746000	6748000	I'm going to be ordering
6748000	6750000	an interface.
6750000	6752000	And I'm going to be getting hijack
6752000	6754000	for my own computer.
6754000	6756000	So I'll be able to start doing like
6756000	6758000	more like Skype feeds and everything.
6758000	6760000	It would be kind of like a bit like pump up the volume
6760000	6762000	was. Except it just be me
6762000	6764000	and whoever calls and talking shit.
6764000	6766000	But you know what. That's a thing people do on
6766000	6768000	Twitch. Like just chilling. I think
6768000	6770000	that's like a category. I don't know if that's what the categories
6770000	6772000	go. Just chatting I think is what it's called maybe.
6772000	6774000	But I would use Twitch for that.
6774000	6776000	But I'd record it. Yeah. You know
6776000	6778000	why not. And just I don't know how to do
6778000	6780000	it live because I don't think I'm going to use shoutcast.
6780000	6782000	But we'll see what happens.
6782000	6784000	We'll see. Anyway as
6784000	6786000	as we were addressing with the live
6786000	6788000	listeners I think the theme
6788000	6790000	an appropriate theme for
6790000	6792000	the future of O.L.R. and why
6792000	6794000	we're doing this big change. You know after 16 years
6794000	6796000	look to the sky. That's what it is
6796000	6798000	right. Look to the sky. I'm just
6798000	6800000	really excited. I'm really to this guy.
6800000	6802000	I'm really hopeful that
6802000	6804000	we will be able to grow after
6804000	6806000	you know it's we haven't had a lot of
6806000	6808000	new people. Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate
6808000	6810000	every new person that comes around to O.L.R. and I know some friends
6810000	6812000	I've told about the show started listening and so forth.
6812000	6814000	I really appreciate that. But like on a bigger scale
6814000	6816000	we have not really been able to grow in a very long time.
6816000	6818000	And I think this is going to really help us to do
6818000	6820000	that. So I really hope you guys will welcome in
6820000	6822000	with open arms next week the new people
6822000	6824000	that are going to poke in on Twitch being like what
6824000	6826000	the hell's this. You know as long as
6826000	6828000	you know you know the number
6828000	6830000	one rule is going to be be
6830000	6832000	cool. Like don't
6832000	6834000	don't be a jerk. So anyway
6834000	6836000	as long as I'm sorry we don't take dick
6836000	6838000	pics. Yeah but most honestly
6838000	6840000	I don't get I don't get a lot
6840000	6842000	of bullshit on Twitch like when I
6842000	6844000	watch stuff like the Pokemon reruns
6844000	6846000	or like Bob Ross especially
6846000	6848000	like you know you would think like watching
6848000	6850000	Bob Ross with the chat room is just going to be like the
6850000	6852000	worst thing in the world but actually like the chat
6852000	6854000	room made that whole experience.
6854000	6856000	It really did. So I'm
6856000	6858000	I'm hopeful. I really am.
6858000	6860000	Alright anyway
6860000	6862000	let's move on. We've still got some news
6862000	6864000	too. We still have a show to do. Changes
6864000	6866000	or not we're still going to be covering the news. So let's
6866000	6868000	get to it. Loki with some rapid fire
6868000	6870000	news starting us off. Yep. So
6870000	6872000	there is a new mod for
6872000	6874000	the Game Boy Advance to allow
6874000	6876000	you to connect it via
6876000	6878000	HDMI to a TV.
6878000	6880000	It'll actually upscale it and everything. So it's
6880000	6882000	the GBA Consolizer
6882000	6884000	and
6884000	6886000	it's by this guy
6886000	6888000	Steven Williams who goes by Woozle
6888000	6890000	on YouTube. And basically
6890000	6892000	it's this device that you actually have to wire
6892000	6894000	up to a
6894000	6896000	Game Boy Advance. It even has a
6896000	6898000	Super NES controller
6898000	6900000	port. So you can actually hook up
6900000	6902000	Super NES controller to it as well.
6902000	6904000	But it'll upscale it. It looks awesome.
6904000	6906000	It has lots of different
6906000	6908000	tweaks. So you can actually
6908000	6910000	adjust
6910000	6912000	the color to see what it would actually look like
6912000	6914000	without the backlight and everything
6914000	6916000	or
6916000	6918000	even just
6918000	6920000	being able to
6920000	6922000	I guess
6922000	6924000	make it look like other screens. They have options
6924000	6926000	to select between the different types of screens that you would
6926000	6928000	play it on. Even like a PSP as well.
6928000	6930000	Pretty cool though.
6930000	6932000	And I'm not sure if it's for sale
6932000	6934000	just yet but probably
6934000	6936000	is going to be something that he's going to offer
6936000	6938000	at some point.
6938000	6940000	Pretty cool looking device. So they were showing
6940000	6942000	off like Yoshi's Island
6942000	6944000	and everything with that Mario Kart
6944000	6946000	Super Circuit. It's all
6946000	6948000	upscaled and crisp.
6948000	6950000	So you can do that or
6950000	6952000	you can
6952000	6954000	buy a
6954000	6956000	SNES Classic or any
6956000	6958000	of their device and just throw it
6958000	6960000	on there for
6960000	6962000	cheap and upscale it yourself.
6962000	6964000	But this is actually using
6964000	6966000	the legit hardware though.
6966000	6968000	Fair enough.
6968000	6970000	Alright and then
6970000	6972000	so there's
6972000	6974000	going to be some more backwards compatibility
6974000	6976000	for Xbox One.
6976000	6978000	I know that everybody's looking forward to this
6978000	6980000	but Duke Nukem Forever is now
6980000	6982000	supported on the
6982000	6984000	Xbox One. For the dozens and dozens
6984000	6986000	of people that play that game. There's several
6986000	6988000	of you.
6988000	6990000	Also The Darkness is getting
6990000	6992000	support as well and XCom
6992000	6994000	Declassified. Those were
6994000	6996000	Xbox 360 tells.
6996000	6998000	Cool.
6998000	7000000	Neat.
7000000	7002000	But seriously though there are better games than
7002000	7004000	Duke Nukem Forever.
7004000	7006000	All of the games.
7006000	7008000	Literally any other game.
7008000	7010000	Anyhow
7010000	7012000	except what was the one that Shane called in to talk
7012000	7014000	about a couple weeks ago? The Quiet Man?
7014000	7016000	The Quiet Place? Remember that one he called in
7016000	7018000	a couple weeks ago? He's like this game is fucking terrible.
7018000	7020000	He actually was texting me about
7020000	7022000	it earlier this week because I guess they
7022000	7024000	he's like
7024000	7026000	I kinda almost want to play it again after
7026000	7028000	that trailer but he's like but it's so
7028000	7030000	bad.
7030000	7032000	But now they have audio in the game
7032000	7034000	so it's not fucked up.
7034000	7036000	That'll be a thing
7036000	7038000	we can do for a break in the future is
7038000	7040000	make a new person play The Quiet
7040000	7042000	Man.
7042000	7044000	Make Loki play The Quiet Man. I love this.
7044000	7046000	Anyhow.
7046000	7048000	I would say we'd do that if we didn't get emails
7048000	7050000	but then that's just gonna
7050000	7052000	convince people not to send us emails so we're not gonna.
7052000	7054000	Alright.
7054000	7056000	Moving on let's talk about some retro
7056000	7058000	sales numbers. For every email we receive
7058000	7060000	I have to play The Quiet Man for one minute.
7060000	7062000	I like where this is
7062000	7064000	going. Alright. Yeah but I gotta read
7064000	7066000	em. Alright moving on.
7066000	7068000	Retro consoles were a big deal
7068000	7070000	this year and in fact one out of every
7070000	7072000	five consoles sold in the US this year
7072000	7074000	was a retro device. That is according to
7074000	7076000	NPD's Matt Piscatella.
7076000	7078000	We're getting to that part of the year where
7078000	7080000	we're gonna look back on the year in review.
7080000	7082000	2018 in review.
7082000	7084000	When it comes to
7084000	7086000	console sales one out of every five was a retro
7086000	7088000	console. Of course Nintendo snatched
7088000	7090000	all the wigs when it came to the retro world
7090000	7092000	with their classic NES
7092000	7094000	coming back and of course the classic SNES
7094000	7096000	which just came out last year.
7096000	7098000	Reggie Fils-Aime in an interview with the New York Times
7098000	7100000	suggesting why these are
7100000	7102000	being sold so well and why people
7102000	7104000	love them so much. Remember
7104000	7106000	people remember the colors and shape
7106000	7108000	of the console and the feel of the controllers
7108000	7110000	from their childhood and they have a visceral
7110000	7112000	reaction when they first fire up their
7112000	7114000	favorite NES or Super NES
7114000	7116000	games. Or if you're Loki
7116000	7118000	you have that reaction the first time you hack
7118000	7120000	the fuck out of that thing. That's what he said.
7120000	7122000	Believe it or not.
7122000	7124000	Funny enough I actually did play
7124000	7126000	that was one thing I did play this week I forgot
7126000	7128000	to mention. Not the NES
7128000	7130000	classic but I played the
7130000	7132000	NES games that you get for free
7132000	7134000	well not free cause you pay for the online service
7134000	7136000	so the NES
7136000	7138000	collection that they have
7138000	7140000	on there. So I played Dr. Mario
7140000	7142000	because I was like bored and I didn't know what games
7142000	7144000	to play. I played a little bit of that and that was
7144000	7146000	alright.
7146000	7148000	But yeah I think a lot of those
7148000	7150000	consoles are selling also because you don't sell any fucking
7150000	7152000	games through virtual console anymore so
7152000	7154000	it's their only way to get them.
7154000	7156000	So but no
7156000	7158000	they're pretty decent consoles.
7158000	7160000	I can't wait to see the NPD numbers for the
7160000	7162000	PlayStation Classic though.
7162000	7164000	Those are not gonna be good.
7164000	7166000	Yeah we'll see what that looks like pretty soon.
7166000	7168000	I'll still pick one up at some point
7168000	7170000	when it gets fully hacked open and it's
7170000	7172000	dropped in price. By the way act deft
7172000	7174000	with a compromise idea on your Quiet Man
7174000	7176000	thing. One minute of
7176000	7178000	Loki playing the Quiet Man for every
7178000	7180000	single email that is well written and has
7180000	7182000	good grammar. Then he won't be
7182000	7184000	playing at all. Hooray!
7184000	7186000	That's his win win. So we'll go
7186000	7188000	for that. Alright. Bobby
7188000	7190000	Blackwell suggests I'll get a PlayStation Classic
7190000	7192000	if it's $20. That's my bar.
7192000	7194000	I feel like
7194000	7196000	if the price on those starts to fall fast
7196000	7198000	which I think is gonna happen. Those fuckers
7198000	7200000	are gonna end up at big lots. Just wait.
7200000	7202000	I'd buy one for $20 too.
7202000	7204000	Why not?
7204000	7206000	I bought a Dreamcast for $40. They were way too
7206000	7208000	expensive for the price. They really were.
7208000	7210000	I don't know. It's just
7210000	7212000	They still hold up
7212000	7214000	well. Even if you watch the
7214000	7216000	Digital Foundry video where they're talking about
7216000	7218000	the visuals and stuff and the different emulators
7218000	7220000	that are available. They're like
7220000	7222000	this is running on the PCSX
7222000	7224000	Classic
7224000	7226000	and this is what
7226000	7228000	PCSX also can look like.
7228000	7230000	Why didn't we get
7230000	7232000	that? Because that looks great.
7232000	7234000	This looks like shit.
7234000	7236000	Speaking of things that might have cost
7236000	7238000	too much when they first came out, Street Fighter
7238000	7240000	5 is going to be getting some in-game
7240000	7242000	advertisements.
7242000	7244000	Capcom calls it sponsored
7244000	7246000	content and it's coming on the 11th of December
7246000	7248000	and it's going to show you about
7248000	7250000	costumes, bundles, and the Capcom Pro Tour.
7250000	7252000	You can turn these
7252000	7254000	game ads off, but players
7254000	7256000	of course are encouraged to keep them on because you
7256000	7258000	get extra fight money in ranked
7258000	7260000	and casual matches when you have them enabled.
7260000	7262000	Boy oh boy.
7262000	7264000	Extra fight money for watching ads. Wow that sounds like a
7264000	7266000	mobile fucking game. Every character
7266000	7268000	has ad-style costumes where the sponsored
7268000	7270000	content will appear somewhere on the clothing or model.
7270000	7272000	So for example, here's Ryu and Balrog
7272000	7274000	where they have the
7274000	7276000	Capcom Pro Tour logo
7276000	7278000	like they're a fucking NASCAR.
7278000	7280000	I don't have a problem with the Capcom Pro Tour
7280000	7282000	stuff, but like, we're going to get
7282000	7284000	Cup Noodle shit. Can I get
7284000	7286000	a Cup Noodle tattoo on my buttocks?
7286000	7288000	That's what I would like to have on my
7288000	7290000	in-game character. Cup Noodle.
7290000	7292000	That was some fucking
7292000	7294000	weird crossover shit for me.
7294000	7296000	But you know what?
7296000	7298000	More people
7298000	7300000	have talked about Cup Noodles since that game came out
7300000	7302000	than ever did before. Well then there was the Pizza Hut
7302000	7304000	crossover that they had with, I think it was
7304000	7306000	like, um, oh god what was it?
7306000	7308000	Uh, Neptunia? I can't remember
7308000	7310000	It fucking works, Loki. I see like
7310000	7312000	Cup Noodles stacked and stacked and stacked
7312000	7314000	at Target or something and I kind of giggle.
7314000	7316000	I go, heh, Cup Noodle. Final Fantasy.
7316000	7318000	And then I go, god damn it, it worked.
7318000	7320000	I'm a consumer whore.
7320000	7322000	It was super extra. It was just ridiculous.
7322000	7324000	Anyway, you can
7324000	7326000	turn in-game ads off, but obviously
7326000	7328000	people are obviously irritated about it
7328000	7330000	because...
7330000	7332000	No, this um,
7332000	7334000	meme that somebody did where they have like a
7334000	7336000	Pornhub logo on the floor and KFC
7336000	7338000	in the background, yeah that's pretty fucking great.
7338000	7340000	Honestly, I would keep in-game ads on if I'm
7340000	7342000	gonna get like KFC advertisements.
7342000	7344000	And Pornhub. And Pornhub, hell yeah.
7344000	7346000	Somebody needs to hack that
7346000	7348000	so that it just plays a random Pornhub
7348000	7350000	video in the background on those stages. You know
7350000	7352000	that's something hackers are gonna be working on.
7352000	7354000	No they're not.
7354000	7356000	Loki. Rule 34.
7356000	7358000	Is it rule 34 or 37?
7359000	7361000	Rule 34 of the internet. If you
7361000	7363000	envision it, it will be made.
7363000	7365000	Well that's just if there's gonna be porn.
7365000	7367000	There's always porn for...
7367000	7369000	So why are you sitting here breaking rule 34?
7369000	7371000	Somebody is going to porn
7371000	7373000	Street Fighter 5. Wait for it.
7373000	7375000	They've already done that with costume
7375000	7377000	hacks and stuff. Do you know, especially
7377000	7379000	not to sidetrack things too much,
7379000	7381000	but with Tumblr
7381000	7383000	about to lose
7383000	7385000	all of their porn.
7385000	7387000	Well it's nice to see how they're gonna go the way of the MySpace
7387000	7389000	Pornhub is
7389000	7391000	like, hey-o
7391000	7393000	Tumblr people, come over here
7393000	7395000	because Pornhub is
7395000	7397000	another one of those companies that for what it is
7397000	7399000	we all know what Pornhub's got.
7399000	7401000	We all know what it is. Y'all know if you have
7401000	7403000	a need for something like that in your life or not.
7403000	7405000	But Pornhub does a great job
7405000	7407000	of just being who they are.
7407000	7409000	You know what I mean?
7409000	7411000	Anyway.
7411000	7413000	Well they own all of the porns
7413000	7415000	like a lot of the top porn sites
7415000	7417000	and shit. That's all owned by Pornhub.
7417000	7419000	They own like all of them.
7419000	7421000	They just need to fucking put out a legit
7421000	7423000	video service that's not
7423000	7425000	porn. Oh just
7425000	7427000	take video hub
7427000	7429000	or something. Yeah they'll just fucking take
7429000	7431000	on YouTube. I hope so.
7431000	7433000	Whatever. They're making
7433000	7435000	boatloads of porn money. Let's move something
7435000	7437000	less porny from Dark Sakura. Sorry Jamie.
7437000	7439000	We're being very unclassy on this show.
7439000	7441000	Porn is inevitable. It's true.
7441000	7443000	So um
7443000	7445000	of course Dragon Quest 11 S
7445000	7447000	we are waiting for
7447000	7449000	for Switch. But Squeenix
7449000	7451000	is actually thinking about
7451000	7453000	the next Dragon Quest game
7453000	7455000	Dragon Quest 12. And it was even
7455000	7457000	asked how is the 12th entry going
7457000	7459000	and Horii said
7459000	7461000	I actually came up with the keywords but I can't see
7461000	7463000	anything here. And he added
7463000	7465000	that since Dragon Quest 11
7465000	7467000	scenario was well received this time I went
7467000	7469000	the same reception for gameplay systems
7469000	7471000	but I could also surprise everyone and make it
7471000	7473000	an epic. Now I just feel like teasing
7473000	7475000	everyone and that it is still many
7475000	7477000	years away. Hopefully enough time
7477000	7479000	for them to get a new composer.
7479000	7481000	And then
7481000	7483000	for the other
7483000	7485000	thing Capcom is working on
7485000	7487000	a mystery game that will surprise
7487000	7489000	and hopefully delight.
7489000	7491000	They actually want to
7491000	7493000	make a game. This was in an interview with
7493000	7495000	Famitsu.
7495000	7497000	Jun Takeuchi
7497000	7499000	is you know their senior
7499000	7501000	producer and is going over this.
7501000	7503000	And says and if we keep gradually
7503000	7505000	increasing the size of our stuff I'm thinking that at some
7505000	7507000	point we might be able to handle four AAA titles
7507000	7509000	at once.
7509000	7511000	So Takeuchi
7511000	7513000	said we are currently working on a title
7513000	7515000	that will make our fans think wow they're
7515000	7517000	making that. So
7517000	7519000	I mean
7519000	7521000	I don't know they're already doing
7521000	7523000	the Resident Evil 2 remake.
7523000	7525000	That's
7525000	7527000	not really a surprise.
7527000	7529000	So I mean
7529000	7531000	we've already we've already had
7531000	7533000	Mega Man 11.
7533000	7535000	And I'm trying to think of what
7535000	7537000	would what would Capcom I mean
7537000	7539000	if it's Rival Schools 3.
7539000	7541000	Fuck yeah. It better be.
7541000	7543000	Bitches you hear me.
7543000	7545000	They've already had their first year of school
7545000	7547000	they've had their second year of school we fucking need
7547000	7549000	their third year of school. Maybe another Capcom
7549000	7551000	versus SNK.
7551000	7553000	No it's Rival Schools it better be.
7553000	7555000	Personally I prefer the Capcom
7555000	7557000	SNK but I don't I don't hate her suggestion.
7557000	7559000	So we had Chirich Justice Kakuen then we had
7559000	7561000	Moru Justice Kakuen which is burning.
7561000	7563000	What would be even better than
7563000	7565000	burning. You know we're still waiting
7565000	7567000	on for crossovers though we never did get
7567000	7569000	we got Street Fighter versus Tekken but we never got
7569000	7571000	Tekken versus Street Fighter. We're still waiting on that
7571000	7573000	one. Yeah let's keep waiting. Yeah
7573000	7575000	I have a feeling. Maybe we'll have
7575000	7577000	a Street Fighter versus Pokemon.
7579000	7581000	I would love that. Bob Coffee
7581000	7583000	in chat says Rival Schools 3 technically
7583000	7585000	already happened. No it didn't.
7585000	7587000	No because um
7587000	7589000	Chirich Justice Kakuen
7589000	7591000	had a sequel to that which was Chirich
7591000	7593000	Justice Kakuen to like the evolution
7593000	7595000	disc or whatever. Moru Justice
7595000	7597000	Kakuen was a new installment in the
7597000	7599000	series. Now
7599000	7601000	even though you guys are joking about this whole like
7601000	7603000	Pokken thing I would I would be there
7603000	7605000	in a heartbeat for Tekken versus Pokken
7605000	7607000	but why not because Tekken has those fucking
7607000	7609000	nuts characters like Panda
7609000	7611000	and Bear and the tree thing.
7611000	7613000	I want Pokemon.
7613000	7615000	Oh well Pokken was Pokemon.
7615000	7617000	It was
7617000	7619000	a Tekken game.
7619000	7621000	I want a Pokemon game with
7621000	7623000	Street Fighter. Oh so you want to go
7623000	7625000	around and collect fighters and you know
7625000	7627000	Chun Li used spinning bird kick. It's super
7627000	7629000	effective. You want that?
7629000	7631000	I just want another PlayStation All-Star game.
7631000	7633000	I know that they you know
7633000	7635000	You know they're doing another jump
7635000	7637000	superstar right? Yeah.
7637000	7639000	It's got like all the Dragon Ball and
7639000	7641000	What if it was Capcom versus
7641000	7643000	Shonen Jump?
7643000	7645000	Can I take another Tatsunoko Capcom game?
7645000	7647000	I would love another Tatsunoko versus Capcom
7647000	7649000	with you know actually playing on a good controller.
7649000	7651000	I did a double take when I saw an arcade machine on one of those
7651000	7653000	at round one not that long ago. I was like what?
7653000	7655000	Anyway let's move on with the release dates.
7655000	7657000	I found out they have
7657000	7659000	an arcade cabinet also for a Pokken tournament.
7659000	7661000	I did not realize that. Yeah.
7661000	7663000	I think they're obviously more popular probably overseas
7663000	7665000	than here. 2019 by the way is the year
7665000	7667000	we're finally going to get a local round one.
7667000	7669000	I downloaded
7669000	7671000	an image of that.
7671000	7673000	Anywho. Did you know
7673000	7675000	it is going in at the Galleria
7675000	7677000	because they have the signs up for it now.
7677000	7679000	It's the old Sears.
7679000	7681000	As some speculated but here's the thing
7681000	7683000	the first floor is round one.
7683000	7685000	The second floor is going to be a new movie theater.
7685000	7687000	Yeah so interesting.
7687000	7689000	It would be cool if we had another dinner theater except that's still way too far
7689000	7691000	for me to drive. Yeah Roseville is kind of far.
7691000	7693000	Yeah I like the dinner theater.
7693000	7695000	I'm down with round one.
7695000	7697000	You mean like the movie girl?
7697000	7699000	Yeah. They are building
7699000	7701000	one at Waten El Camino.
7701000	7703000	That's closer to me.
7703000	7705000	You know the Walmart that flopped across the street.
7705000	7707000	Sorry local talk for a minute.
7707000	7709000	The one that was the Montgomery Ward.
7709000	7711000	Yeah so across the street where they have Winco
7711000	7713000	they're putting in so Macy's went away.
7713000	7715000	But I think one of the other things that had gone away
7715000	7717000	in there previously is going to be turned into another
7717000	7719000	movie girl place. Well that's cool they're actually revitalizing
7719000	7721000	the old country club shopping mall.
7721000	7723000	Which does tie to this show
7723000	7725000	because Country Club Lanes the bowling alley
7725000	7727000	across the street was like one of the places we used to play
7727000	7729000	DDR all the time because they were the only
7729000	7731000	place that had like fifth
7731000	7733000	mix. They had a
7733000	7735000	Japanese first mix.
7735000	7737000	They had something after that.
7737000	7739000	Yeah they were like the only ones that had fifth mix for a while.
7739000	7741000	So yeah we used to go
7741000	7743000	there like play midnight to three in the morning.
7743000	7745000	But
7745000	7747000	I actually have been sitting on for a while.
7747000	7749000	I won for my work and I haven't figured out what I'm
7749000	7751000	going to use it for. I have a
7751000	7753000	gift certificate for a party
7753000	7755000	for 10 at
7755000	7757000	Country Club Lanes including laser
7757000	7759000	tag and bowling and arcade gameplay
7759000	7761000	and like we were going to
7761000	7763000	I was originally going to use it for like my
7763000	7765000	son's birthday but then we're going to
7765000	7767000	this broccoli farm to
7767000	7769000	you know for his birthday.
7769000	7771000	But
7773000	7775000	yes this is what my wife has been
7775000	7777000	wanting to do. She wants to tell
7777000	7779000	them what they're going to. We're going to I finally convinced
7779000	7781000	her that we're going to tell them on Christmas
7781000	7783000	but right now
7783000	7785000	you're going to have a blue harvest.
7785000	7787000	This broccoli farm
7787000	7789000	just makes me
7789000	7791000	think of blue harvest.
7791000	7793000	Because that was originally this
7793000	7795000	broccoli farm. We tell them that they're going to
7795000	7797000	L.A. but they're like oh yeah we're going to the
7797000	7799000	broccoli farm. You'll love it.
7799000	7801000	I don't want to go to a broccoli farm.
7801000	7803000	This is terrible.
7805000	7807000	This is when you first
7807000	7809000	said you were going to have kids
7809000	7811000	years and years ago. This
7811000	7813000	was what I was waiting for were these
7813000	7815000	epic fucking troll moves. I knew you were going to pull on
7815000	7817000	the kids. It wasn't my idea. It was
7817000	7819000	her idea. I think it's terrible. I don't
7819000	7821000	I don't know that. I don't
7821000	7823000	I don't like it one bit. I
7823000	7825000	I keep telling them like don't worry
7825000	7827000	you'll have fun. Don't worry
7827000	7829000	it'll be fun. And they're just like I want to
7829000	7831000	stay home. I don't even want to go on this trip.
7831000	7833000	They're going to the broccoli farm.
7833000	7835000	I'm sorry
7835000	7837000	it's my favorite thing.
7837000	7839000	You're just going to just think
7839000	7841000	what we do when we do twitch you're going
7841000	7843000	to get to see the laughing. I'm like beat red
7843000	7845000	right now. Her idea was to
7845000	7847000	like not even tell them at all until we got
7847000	7849000	there. Like we're going to just arrive
7849000	7851000	there and then they're going to all of a sudden
7851000	7853000	notice that hey
7853000	7855000	there's this giant castle and lights and fireworks
7855000	7857000	and shit. And what is this
7857000	7859000	you know.
7859000	7861000	So that's her idea. I wanted to tell
7861000	7863000	them so they can look forward to it but
7863000	7865000	I will see. So you're going to do it on Christmas.
7865000	7867000	You're going to say the broccoli farm is
7867000	7869000	next door to Disneyland. So we're going to go to Disneyland.
7869000	7871000	Yeah. Broccoli farm
7871000	7873000	burned down. Broccoli farm burned
7873000	7875000	down. Knott's Broccoli Farm.
7879000	7881000	It makes me think of
7881000	7883000	the old deep thoughts of Jack
7883000	7885000	Handy. One day I took my
7885000	7887000	I said my nephews that I was going
7887000	7889000	to Disneyland. We
7889000	7891000	drove by an abandoned farm
7891000	7893000	house. I said oh no Disneyland burned
7893000	7895000	down and went home.
7895000	7897000	The end.
7897000	7899000	So anyways I don't even remember what the hell
7899000	7901000	we were talking about. Oh release dates.
7901000	7903000	We were going to do release dates
7903000	7905000	but then you started talking
7905000	7907000	about the broccoli farm. Which do they even fucking
7907000	7909000	grow broccoli on a farm? Yes.
7909000	7911000	Sure they do.
7915000	7917000	No Rob they pull broccoli out of their
7917000	7919000	asses. We're on so many tangents I don't even remember where
7919000	7921000	we are. And that's the shape of broccoli.
7921000	7923000	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. It's shaped
7923000	7925000	like a sphincter. Oh right right right.
7925000	7927000	So yeah I was going to yeah because
7927000	7929000	we the party that's right the party
7929000	7931000	I have. Oh right. I'm sitting on this I don't know
7931000	7933000	what the hell I'm going to use it for now because I don't
7933000	7935000	really want to wait until my next son's birthday party.
7935000	7937000	It's 10 people that's not a lot so
7937000	7939000	I'm just like maybe just one of these weekends we'll
7939000	7941000	just have an impromptu laser tag bowling
7941000	7943000	arcade party
7943000	7945000	for 10 people.
7945000	7947000	We should just invite strangers.
7947000	7949000	I guess.
7951000	7953000	And pizza they have pizza.
7953000	7955000	All right.
7955000	7957000	Did you win 10 tickets to the broccoli
7957000	7959000	farm? I did not.
7959000	7961000	Now I want to do I swear to
7961000	7963000	God so you know now my brain is going
7963000	7965000	on all these like tape segments I want to do for
7965000	7967000	O.L.R. I swear to God Loki you and I are going
7967000	7969000	to a broccoli farm and taping something for
7969000	7971000	O.L.R. You know actually
7971000	7973000	Rob. What? Apple Hill
7973000	7975000	has a tomato farm. Do they?
7975000	7977000	Actually Becky and I used to go
7977000	7979000	there to pick heirloom tomatoes.
7979000	7981000	I used to go to pet the alpacas. That's
7981000	7983000	why I like Apple Hill.
7983000	7985000	All right anyway. Let's go have
7985000	7987000	the alpacalypse.
7987000	7989000	Let's travel
7989000	7991000	around the world and check out release dates.
7991000	7993000	I don't know if there's a lot this week I think finally
7993000	7995000	with Smash and Katamari and all that out
7995000	7997000	I think we're finally kind of dying down
7997000	7999000	but let's see. Apparently there's a broccoli farm
7999000	8001000	in Salinas. Is there really?
8001000	8003000	Because there's this viral video of some
8003000	8005000	boy named Max who really wants to go to a broccoli
8005000	8007000	farm. Did something break behind you?
8007000	8009000	Oh I thought I heard like a smash.
8009000	8011000	Oh okay. Anyways
8011000	8013000	so let's talk about
8013000	8015000	games that are coming out. So this week and I

8063000	8065000	what's happening in the chat room now.

8083000	8085000	I think I want that. I also like Broccoli
8085000	8087000	No Touch Gene. I kind of want
8087000	8089000	like a game that's Loki
8089000	8091000	and the family at the Broccoli Farm. Loki goes to
8091000	8093000	the Broccoli Farm.
8093000	8095000	You know what I would
8095000	8097000	I would do a children's book.
8097000	8099000	Really? Well she wanted
8099000	8101000	to get them like t-shirts that said you know
8101000	8103000	I heart broccoli.
8103000	8105000	I can't make that happen.
8105000	8107000	You know Broccoli 3.
8107000	8109000	I don't know.
8109000	8111000	I just think it's a bit elaborate to like
8111000	8113000	upset them this much. And don't forget about the
8113000	8115000	sequel. Kale Quest. Cause I'm gonna have to listen to
8115000	8117000	eight hours in the car
8117000	8119000	of like them complaining about this.
8119000	8121000	And she does this a lot where she'll like
8121000	8123000	stir them up and then she's like okay bye
8123000	8125000	I'm leaving. And then I had to deal with the
8125000	8127000	aftermath of like this bullshit.
8127000	8129000	So.
8129000	8131000	Well you know what I said the sequel should be Kale
8131000	8133000	Quest.
8135000	8137000	And we've lost Rob. I'm broken.
8139000	8141000	Okay. It's not
8141000	8143000	even that funny. I don't know why I can't
8143000	8145000	stop laughing. It's funny because it's not.
8147000	8149000	Coming out on the Playstation 4

8163000	8165000	You're supposed to save this for the show when we have video.
8165000	8167000	This is no good.
8167000	8169000	It's not good radio.
8169000	8171000	This is a teaser.
8171000	8173000	Rob loses his shit.
8173000	8175000	Okay.
8175000	8177000	No broccoli does make you shit.
8177000	8179000	Didelius the Awakening of
8179000	8181000	Golden Jazz. Judge Eyes.
8181000	8183000	Shinigami
8183000	8185000	no to Econ. Shinigami
8185000	8187000	no broccoli. No more fucking
8187000	8189000	broccoli. And Fortnite
8189000	8191000	Deep Freeze Bundle. Cause you know what they're
8191000	8193000	freezing. Broccoli.
8197000	8199000	On the Nintendo Switch this week
8199000	8201000	Didelius the Awakening of
8201000	8203000	Golden Jazz is on the Switch as well.
8203000	8205000	Peach Ball. Senran
8205000	8207000	Kagura is out as well. And there's
8207000	8209000	some type of double pack with that as well.
8209000	8211000	Maybe it comes with broccoli. I don't know.
8211000	8213000	There's also Mickey
8213000	8215000	and Friends Special Card Pocket
8215000	8217000	24. So it's like Disney branded
8217000	8219000	Switch stuff. Yeah. Sure.
8219000	8221000	Maybe
8221000	8223000	Loki can buy some at the broccoli
8223000	8225000	farm. I don't know. Anyway.
8225000	8227000	Dark Sakura. What's coming out in the UK?
8227000	8229000	You better get through this segment
8229000	8231000	without naming a vegetable.
8231000	8233000	Aubergine.
8233000	8235000	Okay. My Little Writing Champion
8235000	8237000	on December 14th. And the
8237000	8239000	only other thing coming out that week
8239000	8241000	V-Rally 4.
8241000	8243000	On the 14th.
8243000	8245000	You know what else they get?
8245000	8247000	Brussels sprouts.
8247000	8249000	Let's get
8249000	8251000	to the mailbag. Because every week
8251000	8253000	you guys email us.
8253000	8255000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8255000	8257000	and Jamie will probably yell at me for not
8257000	8259000	deleting old emails. You know
8259000	8261000	that shit pisses me off.
8261000	8263000	So just make sure they're from December 3rd or after.
8263000	8265000	I think there's only one from today. I think
8265000	8267000	last I checked. But Dark Sakura
8267000	8269000	is going to go to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8269000	8271000	and read some of her favorite emails on the air.
8271000	8273000	Um. Yeah. There's one. Can I
8273000	8275000	actually. Can we have a heart to heart moment?
8275000	8277000	Since we're doing. Talking about changes.
8277000	8279000	Um. Ch-ch-ch-changing.
8279000	8281000	The lack of participation in this segment
8281000	8283000	has me concerned. I'm thinking about getting rid
8283000	8285000	of it. Um. So.
8285000	8287000	You might want to give your feedback over
8287000	8289000	on Twitter. At Twitter.com
8289000	8291000	slash O-L-R. Should we continue to do the
8291000	8293000	emails?
8293000	8295000	Because I just think people
8295000	8297000	aren't writing emails anymore. They're writing Facebook
8297000	8299000	messages. So I'm open to.
8299000	8301000	So is that going to mean I'm going to have to read everyone's social media
8301000	8303000	and critique them of the grammar? Well. I'm
8303000	8305000	considering bringing back
8305000	8307000	something akin to the Fugu question of the week.
8307000	8309000	But obviously Google Plus is going away.
8309000	8311000	So it'll either just be Facebook or social media.
8311000	8313000	Maybe something with Facebook and Twitter.
8313000	8315000	Maybe something with Discord. I don't know.
8315000	8317000	I would love to hear suggestions. But I just feel
8317000	8319000	like email ain't it sis.
8319000	8321000	Because it's. Maybe it'll change
8321000	8323000	when we get some new folks and stuff.
8323000	8325000	But I just feel like you guys aren't.
8325000	8327000	Well I think for now if you want to send us
8327000	8329000	anything on Twitter. Of course
8329000	8331000	tag at O-L-R. But add
8331000	8333000	your hashtag tweet O-L-R.
8335000	8337000	I don't know what that's going to do. But sure.
8337000	8339000	Because if we do it specifically to
8339000	8341000	bring something to our attention or make a comment. Oh OK.
8341000	8343000	Then the hashtag tweet O-L-R
8343000	8345000	is going to be directed to us. Alright.
8345000	8347000	Well I'm going to stew on that. I'm not saying it's going away yet.
8347000	8349000	I'm just saying it's up.
8349000	8351000	It is up for elimination. That is
8351000	8353000	what I'm saying. So
8353000	8355000	if y'all want to lip sync for your life and
8355000	8357000	save the segment you can. But
8357000	8359000	I'm just saying the emails of the week are.
8359000	8361000	You thought your email sent.
8361000	8363000	But it bounced.
8363000	8365000	Your email was stamped
8365000	8367000	return to sender.
8367000	8369000	Winner winner
8369000	8371000	chicken dinner.
8371000	8373000	Loser loser
8373000	8375000	broccoli.
8375000	8377000	I'm doing my
8377000	8379000	my tricksy
8379000	8381000	does RuPaul.
8381000	8383000	To go with your RuPaul shirt.
8385000	8387000	OK. Read the goddamn email.
8389000	8391000	You requested that I stop it
8391000	8393000	but instead I'm just getting started.
8393000	8395000	OK. Hey everyone.
8395000	8397000	One question for all of y'all.
8397000	8399000	I don't remember if this was ever asked
8399000	8401000	but is there a video game
8401000	8403000	that you have played that has gotten you through a
8403000	8405000	tough time in your life.
8405000	8407000	For me it was Secret of Mana.
8407000	8409000	I know I have mentioned it but this game has got me
8409000	8411000	through a rough time in my teen years.
8411000	8413000	That's it. See you all on the flip side.
8413000	8415000	Ronma P.S. Shabbat Shalom Uchan.
8415000	8417000	Because it was
8417000	8419000	as my rabbi said
8419000	8421000	he said happy Shabbatica.
8421000	8423000	Because the seventh night
8423000	8425000	was on Shabbat.
8425000	8427000	Alright. So
8427000	8429000	as far as games
8429000	8431000	that got me through a really tough
8431000	8433000	position. Well certainly
8433000	8435000	actually Legend of Zelda Link to the Past
8435000	8437000	I was really really unhappy
8437000	8439000	for a while and that was just like my
8439000	8441000	obsession of getting my head out of
8441000	8443000	you know
8443000	8445000	actually just getting myself out of my own head for a while
8445000	8447000	and living in another world because the real world
8447000	8449000	was absolute shit garbage.
8449000	8451000	Um.
8451000	8453000	Right now. Um.
8453000	8455000	I don't know if there's anything right now
8455000	8457000	that's really doing it for me. I'll just go play
8457000	8459000	pinball to get my aggressions out.
8459000	8461000	I'm trying to think of something else
8461000	8463000	that really kind of pulled me out of a
8463000	8465000	tough loop.
8465000	8467000	I'd say the Guardian Legend did it
8467000	8469000	for me for a while. It was sort of like having a sense
8469000	8471000	of accomplishment when nothing else was going right.
8471000	8473000	Because the game was fucking hard.
8473000	8475000	But.
8475000	8477000	Yeah. I don't know
8477000	8479000	most of the video games I was playing were to get me
8479000	8481000	not thinking about just
8481000	8483000	all the garbage that was going into my life
8483000	8485000	when I was a kid.
8485000	8487000	So. That's it.
8489000	8491000	Um.
8491000	8493000	So. To go from a
8493000	8495000	very laughy note to a maybe somewhat more
8495000	8497000	serious one. Um.
8497000	8499000	Dance Dance Revolution. Like.
8499000	8501000	Not to be too sappy but
8501000	8503000	like those were not always
8503000	8505000	the greatest years of my life.
8505000	8507000	Being just dropped out of college and
8507000	8509000	dealing with a lot of things about myself
8509000	8511000	that I was just learning in regards
8511000	8513000	to who and what I
8513000	8515000	was attracted to sort of thing.
8515000	8517000	And it was not
8517000	8519000	always the greatest period and I kind of
8519000	8521000	actually fell out of gaming in general for a long time.
8521000	8523000	But then
8523000	8525000	you know Rocky Horror
8525000	8527000	was a big part of that and so
8527000	8529000	you know admittedly the first time I ever saw Dance Dance
8529000	8531000	Revolution was at a Rocky Horror
8531000	8533000	convention. If you didn't know that story that is the
8533000	8535000	absolute truth. The first time I ever played Dance Dance Revolution
8535000	8537000	was at the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror convention
8537000	8539000	at the Hard Rock Hotel.
8539000	8541000	And honestly from finding
8541000	8543000	Dance Dance Revolution I met
8543000	8545000	people that I'm doing this show with
8545000	8547000	right now. Um.
8547000	8549000	Some other amazingly awesome people
8549000	8551000	too. Some not so awesome people but you know
8551000	8553000	I'm just kidding. They're not around anymore.
8553000	8555000	We don't talk about them. No. But no for real.
8555000	8557000	Like so many awesome people that are in
8557000	8559000	my life including many of you that are
8559000	8561000	still supporting this show to this day and all that.
8561000	8563000	And like honestly like
8563000	8565000	yeah. Like I didn't mean to go from
8565000	8567000	like broccoli jokes to a really heavy
8567000	8569000	response to your question but like
8569000	8571000	what would
8571000	8573000	this life be without
8573000	8575000	what that game and that community
8575000	8577000	and everything did for me. It's
8577000	8579000	weird to think about. I mean
8579000	8581000	for the most part I probably would have turned out somewhat
8581000	8583000	the same but I probably would
8583000	8585000	have this show. I wouldn't know you guys.
8585000	8587000	It would be different. It would be so different.
8587000	8589000	So. There you go.
8589000	8591000	I remember that first visit over to your apartment
8591000	8593000	where we had to tread lightly.
8593000	8595000	Because I lived upstairs.
8595000	8597000	Yeah. And the downstairs neighbor
8597000	8599000	who listened to gospel at 6 a.m. on a Sunday
8599000	8601000	and always woke me up. I was afraid of you know
8601000	8603000	getting her back basically. I don't know. She
8603000	8605000	deserved it. Yeah. Probably.
8605000	8607000	That was fun. I think I brought you
8607000	8609000	third mix on that visit.
8609000	8611000	I think you did. You did because
8611000	8613000	I had that jungle mix dance pad and you brought
8613000	8615000	it was you or my old
8615000	8617000	crazy roommate that brought that.
8617000	8619000	I think we were both there that day. I think
8619000	8621000	he brought the
8621000	8623000	CD image. You brought the plug
8623000	8625000	thing that let us play it. That's right.
8625000	8627000	Yeah. It was the
8627000	8629000	what were they called back then? Not the game genie
8629000	8631000	but it was. It was the plug thing
8631000	8633000	in the back. Game shark. That was it.
8633000	8635000	No. Anyway Loki do you have a question
8635000	8637000	now that I've killed the funny
8637000	8639000	mood? No. I
8639000	8641000	don't have anything actually.
8641000	8643000	So. Alright.
8643000	8645000	Maybe DDR I guess but.
8645000	8647000	I would think Earth Defense Force gave
8647000	8649000	you a good distraction. Do you want another serious
8649000	8651000	answer? World of Warcraft?
8651000	8653000	Because certainly that community
8653000	8655000	did a lot for me too. You know I totally
8655000	8657000	love my years doing Horde House
8657000	8659000	and getting really involved with that community and
8659000	8661000	many of the people that I met there that I'm still in touch with to this day.
8661000	8663000	But I think also more importantly
8663000	8665000	you know when Alan and
8665000	8667000	I first met which is weird to
8667000	8669000	think about that like all of this would be chronicled
8669000	8671000	on this show in the archives because
8671000	8673000	this show has existed longer than I've
8673000	8675000	known Alan which is a weird thought but it is what it is.
8675000	8677000	This show's been on longer than I've been married to
8677000	8679000	Dan. Isn't it weird to think
8679000	8681000	about before he had kids?
8681000	8683000	I mean it's just like this show has been
8683000	8685000	so huge. But anyway
8685000	8687000	in all seriousness because Alan and I
8687000	8689000	were dating like long distance
8689000	8691000	for a while. Well I mean I say long distance. What do you
8691000	8693000	call it when like your boyfriend
8693000	8695000	lives two hours away? So you
8695000	8697000	can't see each other on weeknights. Moderately distanced.
8697000	8699000	Moderately long distance.
8699000	8701000	But one way that we used to
8701000	8703000	hang out and I'm using my
8703000	8705000	cody fingers is by playing World of Warcraft.
8705000	8707000	I know that sounds so nerdy and so
8707000	8709000	super weird but just being able
8709000	8711000	to exist at the same time in the
8711000	8713000	same space just kind of like
8713000	8715000	being with each other even though you're not
8715000	8717000	you know what I mean? Like you're not really with each other
8717000	8719000	but you're kind of with each other. You're doing
8719000	8721000	the same thing in the same place at the same time.
8721000	8723000	When Dan and I started getting together you know
8723000	8725000	after he called me when I had that bad breakup
8725000	8727000	we were hanging out on AOL
8727000	8729000	role playing
8729000	8731000	in
8731000	8733000	not Town Square Sailor Moon by that point.
8733000	8735000	I think we'd moved on to Kuno's Island
8735000	8737000	was our chat room of choice.
8737000	8739000	And we would exchange like bad fan fiction with each
8739000	8741000	other. You know
8741000	8743000	I'd critique the grammar because I've
8743000	8745000	been doing that since I was in middle school.
8745000	8747000	Right. So
8747000	8749000	yeah.
8749000	8751000	Alright.
8751000	8753000	Yeah thanks for the email even though it took us from
8753000	8755000	by the way the broccoli is still going in the chat.
8755000	8757000	But I did
8757000	8759000	post a tweet I think you can appreciate
8759000	8761000	I will not serenade everyone with Bob breath.
8761000	8763000	You can probably appreciate this dark soccer.
8763000	8765000	I just took a screenshot of our chat room
8765000	8767000	lit up with all the broccoli puns and I just
8767000	8769000	put can't wait to bring this romper room fuckery to
8769000	8771000	Twitch.
8773000	8775000	That's a good term for it.
8775000	8777000	Romper room fuckery.
8777000	8779000	That means I actually have to sign into my Twitch account
8779000	8781000	on my computer
8781000	8783000	now. PUBG players unknown
8783000	8785000	broccoli grounds.
8785000	8787000	You guys stop.
8787000	8789000	All right. That's it for e-mails.
8789000	8791000	You can still e-mail us for now.
8791000	8793000	Participate at orangelaundrydo.com. We'll let you know in the next couple weeks
8793000	8795000	what we decide to do with the segment. But for now
8795000	8797000	send us e-mails because
8797000	8799000	otherwise I'm going to talk about the hollow slice
8799000	8801000	spectacular. What? I really don't like broccoli
8801000	8803000	unless it's tempura.
8803000	8805000	I used to
8805000	8807000	be a picky eater and I wouldn't really eat
8807000	8809000	broccoli but now I actually find
8809000	8811000	it to be one of the better greens.
8811000	8813000	I used to really like broccoli and now I don't
8813000	8815000	unless it is blanched
8815000	8817000	or tempura.
8817000	8819000	I'll eat just like steamed. I love like
8819000	8821000	a teriyaki chicken
8821000	8823000	bowl that's like half broccoli
8823000	8825000	anymore. No I'll do like broccoli
8825000	8827000	on a chicken bowl. Just the littlest bit of teriyaki
8827000	8829000	sauce on it. It's not kind of they'll want broccoli
8829000	8831000	beef. I think I'm going to stop by Chinese on the way home.
8831000	8833000	All right. Anyway. Moving on.
8833000	8835000	We have more believe it or not
8835000	8837000	video game related stories here. Loki. We do.
8837000	8839000	We're not going to be talking
8839000	8841000	about grand sets of broccoli I guess.
8841000	8843000	All right.
8843000	8845000	So Microsoft is looking
8845000	8847000	to bring the game pass
8847000	8849000	to other
8849000	8851000	devices. They say every devices
8851000	8853000	or every device.
8853000	8855000	So of course they have it on Xbox.
8855000	8857000	I know that they're planning on bringing it to
8857000	8859000	PC. So possibly
8859000	8861000	maybe other systems
8861000	8863000	as well. They're saying you know
8863000	8865000	apparently
8865000	8867000	there was
8867000	8869000	a report from GameSpot
8869000	8871000	that talked about
8871000	8873000	it was during the Barclays conference
8873000	8875000	where they're saying what do you
8875000	8877000	when you think about reaching
8877000	8879000	customer with this content
8879000	8881000	where they're only compute device
8881000	8883000	could be Android phone
8883000	8885000	you think about
8885000	8887000	well what are the ways
8887000	8889000	that person pays for content
8889000	8891000	today. So we built Xbox game pass
8891000	8893000	started on console and it will come to
8893000	8895000	PC and eventually it will come to every device
8895000	8897000	we use the flywheel that we have
8897000	8899000	with customers on Xbox
8899000	8901000	to start the growth with
8901000	8903000	in the Xbox game pass.
8903000	8905000	Not sure if this is something we'll see
8905000	8907000	like come on other consoles.
8907000	8909000	It would be neat if they
8909000	8911000	did that. I just don't think that's going to happen.
8911000	8913000	But it may be other
8913000	8915000	maybe Xbox devices whenever
8915000	8917000	that come you know whatever the next
8917000	8919000	Xbox system and stuff.
8919000	8921000	I just don't think that like you know
8921000	8923000	Xbox games on the switch
8923000	8925000	is going to be a thing. Maybe
8925000	8927000	though on Android and
8927000	8929000	the other thing could be like on
8929000	8931000	TV. So like you can get like an app
8931000	8933000	or something that runs on like
8933000	8935000	your Android TV
8935000	8937000	or Roku or something like that.
8937000	8939000	And
8939000	8941000	you can get games through that.
8941000	8943000	I can't even look at you
8943000	8945000	without thinking about the broccoli farm.
8949000	8951000	But game pass
8951000	8953000	yes game pass
8953000	8955000	this makes sense for Microsoft
8955000	8957000	to bring this everywhere. It's just a
8957000	8959000	matter of time before they put it on the computer.
8959000	8961000	It's already it's kind of already be there
8961000	8963000	right. I haven't really explored that at Windows 10. But you would think
8963000	8965000	like you can purchase it on
8965000	8967000	Windows 10. But I don't know if there's
8967000	8969000	anything there's got to be a client inbound
8969000	8971000	for Windows soon. There's just got to be like
8971000	8973000	it makes sense for them to it's
8973000	8975000	basically their answer to Netflix. It really is
8975000	8977000	Netflix we know makes oodles and oodles of money
8977000	8979000	and it makes so much money that they're able
8979000	8981000	to spend that money on making new shows
8981000	8983000	like Sabrina and
8983000	8985000	Queer Eye I was just watching
8985000	8987000	the other night and God Netflix makes
8987000	8989000	so many fucking shows now and they're
8989000	8991000	doing it all from subscription dollars.
8991000	8993000	They're watching Adam Maroon's Everything.
8993000	8995000	Although I don't think that was a Netflix original show.
8995000	8997000	But that show is awesome.
8997000	8999000	Anyway
8999000	9001000	let's move on to a console
9001000	9003000	that probably won't have game pass but
9003000	9005000	boy this sounds
9005000	9007000	like a fucking mess and
9007000	9009000	believe it or not it's something that Soulja Boy
9009000	9011000	has a hand in. Soulja Boy
9011000	9013000	Soulja Boy
9013000	9015000	is making a new console
9015000	9017000	called the Soulja Game Console
9017000	9019000	and handheld. Well let's
9019000	9021000	just be honest here he's not making shit.
9021000	9023000	He's just lending his name to it.
9023000	9025000	Probably more like.
9025000	9027000	But anyway the handheld is going to play
9027000	9029000	Switch, 3DS, Vita, Neo Geo, GBC
9029000	9031000	Game Boy, GBA games. 3,000
9031000	9033000	of them built in.
9033000	9035000	Well that doesn't sound like a lawsuit waiting to happen.
9035000	9037000	Anbernic
9037000	9039000	is the developer of this
9039000	9041000	Soulja Watch console
9041000	9043000	or whatever it is. Anyway
9043000	9045000	it's a Chinese retailer that puts a lot of
9045000	9047000	this together and I guess these
9047000	9049000	consoles are retro mini video
9049000	9051000	game consoles and yeah
9051000	9053000	basically it's going to be just
9053000	9055000	an emulator box and
9055000	9057000	lord knows what kind of games
9057000	9059000	are on this thing that are of
9059000	9061000	questionable legalities.
9061000	9063000	Yeah so anyway.
9063000	9065000	Which I like how they had like
9065000	9067000	you know Tumor, Lara Croft
9067000	9069000	and like Tekken characters
9069000	9071000	and shit advertising this and like
9071000	9073000	they're asking for trouble.
9073000	9075000	You know what's funny is if you want to buy the console
9075000	9077000	and the handheld together it's
9077000	9079000	$199 but if you
9079000	9081000	want to just get the direct version without the
9081000	9083000	Soulja Boy stuff on it $105.99.
9083000	9085000	Right.
9085000	9087000	It's just it's a quick
9087000	9089000	cash in is all it is. It really is.
9089000	9091000	It really is. They're just taking the broccoli
9091000	9093000	and running. Uh Dark Sakura
9093000	9095000	what do you have for us?
9095000	9097000	Uh broccoli. No I'm
9097000	9099000	kidding. I have
9099000	9101000	Nintendo news kind of.
9101000	9103000	Build-A-Bear is
9103000	9105000	working with Nintendo to have
9105000	9107000	a few plushies in their shop.
9107000	9109000	One of them
9109000	9111000	is two different colors of Yoshi.
9111000	9113000	One of them
9113000	9115000	is a Bowser and the other one is
9115000	9117000	a bear that gets Mario outfits
9117000	9119000	and there's also
9119000	9121000	a piranha plant.
9121000	9123000	Um it is a
9123000	9125000	stuffed piranha plant for $10.50
9125000	9127000	and a kind of freaking want one.
9127000	9129000	Um
9129000	9131000	but there's also it looks like there's like little
9131000	9133000	you know accessories you can get like
9133000	9135000	a Yoshi coin wrist accessory
9135000	9137000	and just all kinds of cute stuff
9137000	9139000	um even the Bowser for
9139000	9141000	as mean as he as he looks he looks really
9141000	9143000	adorable. And of course there's the Mario
9143000	9145000	and Luigi outfits. Um
9145000	9147000	I'm actually going to their collection page
9147000	9149000	just to have a look at it.
9149000	9151000	And um so let's
9151000	9153000	see what else we've got on here. Ugh
9153000	9155000	stop it. I hate whether
9155000	9157000	you went without cookies.
9157000	9159000	Bitch I might.
9159000	9161000	Um but there's also like a little
9161000	9163000	Yoshi hoodie and a Princess Peach
9163000	9165000	dress. And
9165000	9167000	uh you
9167000	9169000	can get like Bowser five and one
9169000	9171000	sounds and you can get the Super Mario
9171000	9173000	Brothers theme song. So it's
9173000	9175000	kind of cute you know.
9175000	9177000	I would actually get just the Yoshi
9177000	9179000	hoodie for one of my ball
9179000	9181000	jointed dolls. But yeah
9181000	9183000	pretty cute.
9183000	9185000	Yeah I
9185000	9187000	I wouldn't mind getting some of this stuff
9187000	9189000	from the Build-A-Bear stuff. I think it would be really
9189000	9191000	cute. So um
9191000	9193000	I did do uh like a Pikachu
9193000	9195000	one once. It was super cute.
9195000	9197000	So. Remember the one that
9197000	9199000	um we got for Allen? Mhm.
9199000	9201000	We got him a
9201000	9203000	a cat. It was the Hello Kitty Ursula.
9203000	9205000	Yeah Ursula. Yeah we still have that.
9205000	9207000	Hello Ursula.
9207000	9209000	Yeah it's great.
9209000	9211000	Alright uh let's just do
9211000	9213000	a couple more stories Loki. And then we're gonna open up the
9213000	9215000	Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio all one word
9215000	9217000	on Skype. But I'm gonna
9217000	9219000	warn you guys if we don't get a lot of calls tonight we're just gonna
9219000	9221000	end the show cause it's already almost nine o'clock so
9221000	9223000	we've been running along tonight. So Loki. So apparently
9223000	9225000	Steam is kind of walking back
9225000	9227000	this whole allowing sex games
9227000	9229000	on their platform. Mainly
9229000	9231000	they're cracking down on
9231000	9233000	some of these games that depict
9233000	9235000	um girls
9235000	9237000	that might look a little young.
9237000	9239000	How has the Steam. How long has the
9239000	9241000	Steam store been open? Like how
9241000	9243000	how are we just now having this
9243000	9245000	conversation about you know maybe
9245000	9247000	sex games
9247000	9249000	featuring characters that are insinuated to be
9249000	9251000	minors could possibly
9251000	9253000	be a bad. I mean come on.
9253000	9255000	It's 2018. Why are we talking about this now?
9255000	9257000	Steam
9257000	9259000	you are a mess. So apparently
9259000	9261000	yeah there was um one of the
9261000	9263000	publishers affected by this was a game
9263000	9265000	Hello Goodbye and they
9265000	9267000	have games
9267000	9269000	Cross Love Hello or yeah
9269000	9271000	Cross Love Hello Goodbye and
9271000	9273000	Emotionalist. I guess
9273000	9275000	we're for a couple of the games that were
9275000	9277000	in question. The
9277000	9279000	publisher of Hello Goodbye they said that
9279000	9281000	the Steam version
9281000	9283000	had to be censored
9283000	9285000	and could not have adult content.
9285000	9287000	But the other
9287000	9289000	I don't know the other ones
9289000	9291000	I'm not sure what they're going to be doing there but
9291000	9293000	apparently it says um
9293000	9295000	you know these scenes aren't
9295000	9297000	there to be artificially
9297000	9299000	shoehorned in. It says that while they
9299000	9301000	do exist further proof of
9301000	9303000	the characters ages
9303000	9305000	beyond the disclaimer in the beginning
9305000	9307000	explicitly states that they're um
9307000	9309000	them being 18. So the real reason
9309000	9311000	they're there is to further
9311000	9313000	many a times the themes of the
9313000	9315000	story. So what they're trying to
9315000	9317000	say is basically that you know
9317000	9319000	they're pushing a story narrative
9319000	9321000	but I don't know
9321000	9323000	I guess it's just a style you know this
9323000	9325000	lowly style
9325000	9327000	that's in the game. I don't know whatever
9327000	9329000	it's going to either be on the platform or it's
9329000	9331000	not going to be on the platform and
9331000	9333000	there's other platforms that can host those
9333000	9335000	type of games.
9335000	9337000	Alright uh but you really
9337000	9339000	shouldn't support those games
9339000	9341000	that are you know
9341000	9343000	gross. Like that's just
9343000	9345000	like some things are just don't need to
9345000	9347000	be existing and
9347000	9349000	games that have young young girls
9349000	9351000	like that no just no all the no.
9351000	9353000	Alright uh anyhow
9353000	9355000	ending on a very serious note tonight this is
9355000	9357000	this is sad and yes it does relate to Orange
9357000	9359000	Lounge Radio watch this. Pete Shelley
9359000	9361000	which Jason did reference
9361000	9363000	in the intro so I'm finally getting around to what
9363000	9365000	he talked about there in the intro but Pete Shelley
9365000	9367000	who was the leader of the punk rock
9367000	9369000	band the Buzzcocks died
9369000	9371000	this week at the age of 63.
9371000	9373000	So um he passed this week and I know
9373000	9375000	he's been very influential but did
9375000	9377000	you know a club mix
9377000	9379000	of one of his songs was once in
9379000	9381000	DDR?
9381000	9383000	What?
9383000	9385000	Well
9385000	9387000	Are you telling me it's a cover?
9387000	9389000	No it's
9389000	9391000	it is
9391000	9393000	it is a sample of his voice
9393000	9395000	based on the song that he obviously did
9395000	9397000	so if you remember
9397000	9399000	the song Telephone Operator from
9399000	9401000	DDR that was Pete Shelley
9401000	9403000	who was the voice in that song
9403000	9405000	unfortunately he passed away this week at
9405000	9407000	63 so rest in
9407000	9409000	peace.
9409000	9411000	That is it for this
9411000	9413000	week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at least the
9413000	9415000	scripted news the part we knew we were going to talk
9415000	9417000	about now we're going to open up the skype
9417000	9419000	line over at Orange Lounge Radio
9419000	9421000	all one word on skype and you can give us
9421000	9423000	a call and talk about anything you would like to talk
9423000	9425000	about tonight maybe you want to talk about
9425000	9427000	some of the news
9427000	9429000	we've talked about maybe you want to share a broccoli
9429000	9431000	recipe I don't know but we do have it
9431000	9433000	lighting up already so let's get to it
9433000	9435000	Hi you're on Broccoli Lounge Radio who's this?
9435000	9437000	It is the king of the broccoli
9437000	9439000	Rama. Hey Rama how you doing?
9439000	9441000	I'm good how is everybody else
9441000	9443000	out there? I'm dead
9443000	9445000	tonight basically this show has
9445000	9447000	literally ended me like I'm actually kind of glad
9447000	9449000	it's getting out of my system tonight so I can be
9449000	9451000	a professional next week.
9451000	9453000	Hold on
9453000	9455000	you said professional I got to mute myself for one
9455000	9457000	second I'm sorry. Fuck all the
9457000	9459000	way off. Oh
9459000	9461000	baby.
9461000	9463000	I'm a professional alright well what's
9463000	9465000	on your mind tonight besides making fun of me?
9465000	9467000	You mentioned two buck
9467000	9469000	chuck that's not professional
9469000	9471000	you know it's like four buck chuck now
9471000	9473000	you
9473000	9475000	you are the Blanche Gemero
9475000	9477000	of OLR okay? You can still get the tamponio
9477000	9479000	from Trader Joe's that I like for three bucks
9479000	9481000	oh so it's three buck chuck alright anyway
9483000	9485000	oh good
9485000	9487000	lord people okay look
9487000	9489000	this Playstation class thing had
9489000	9491000	me rolling the fact that you can
9491000	9493000	plug in a keyboard and hit
9493000	9495000	escape and you get these
9495000	9497000	I'm just laughing
9497000	9499000	about all of that I'm just
9499000	9501000	wow. We knew it was gonna
9501000	9503000	happen we just didn't think it would be so easy
9503000	9505000	the keyboard they probably tested like a
9505000	9507000	Sony keyboard that they probably tested in
9507000	9509000	house probably didn't work
9509000	9511000	and in house
9511000	9513000	in their QA department they probably just have a bunch of
9513000	9515000	Sony keyboards it's just probably have
9515000	9517000	it's probably however they
9517000	9519000	decided to the device ID
9519000	9521000	however they're filtering that for
9521000	9523000	some reason it's not catching everything and so
9523000	9525000	it's catching or allowing certain
9525000	9527000	things to work on it
9527000	9529000	that's exactly what I was thinking
9529000	9531000	so Loki nailed that right on the head
9533000	9535000	but
9535000	9537000	it's kind of interesting that this comes up in
9537000	9539000	topic because I decided to break out my
9539000	9541000	SNES classic and actually
9541000	9543000	pack it and put some custom ROMs on there
9543000	9545000	and when I was
9545000	9547000	getting my stuff together I forgot
9547000	9549000	a friend of mine gave me a Raspberry Pi 3
9549000	9551000	so I think in the next few
9551000	9553000	couple of weeks I will be putting together my own
9553000	9555000	Playstation classic
9555000	9557000	and the thing is I'm just doing it because
9557000	9559000	I can do it you know
9559000	9561000	and
9561000	9563000	it's interesting
9563000	9565000	that
9565000	9567000	Jamie mentioned Wanderer Some Ease
9567000	9569000	because that was one of the games I
9569000	9571000	wrote my SNES classic and I remember playing
9571000	9573000	the hell out of that game
9573000	9575000	it was a good game
9575000	9577000	there's some good underappreciated classics
9577000	9579000	I'm really surprised we haven't already
9579000	9581000	heard Nintendo start talking about
9581000	9583000	a classic NES 2
9583000	9585000	or something along those lines but maybe
9585000	9587000	that's something that's going to be next year I don't know
9587000	9589000	also they probably have the Switch Online
9589000	9591000	thing they're kind of looking at right now
9591000	9593000	because December's games are going to be out
9593000	9595000	this week I think is when the December
9595000	9597000	games hit which Ninja Gaiden
9597000	9599000	I know is one of them that's a pretty big deal
9599000	9601000	I don't remember all of them but I know Ninja Gaiden
9601000	9603000	was the one that really caught my eye
9603000	9605000	but after this month we don't know what
9605000	9607000	they have on deck for January, February, March
9607000	9609000	so it's going to be interesting to see how that continues to
9609000	9611000	grow out
9611000	9613000	well I don't have the Switch
9613000	9615000	just yet I know Mako-chan
9615000	9617000	she has a Switch I was there
9617000	9619000	when she bought it so you know she'll probably jump on
9619000	9621000	that right there
9621000	9623000	oh thank you Ninja Gaiden, Wario's
9623000	9625000	Woods and Adventures of Lolo
9625000	9627000	we're looking at Broccoli 3 nice try
9627000	9629000	Adventures of Lolo are the games
9629000	9631000	that are coming out that's right Lolo I love the soundtrack
9631000	9633000	to Lolo it's such a cute little soundtrack
9633000	9635000	I don't know I enjoyed the
9635000	9637000	soundtrack more to Adventure
9637000	9639000	Island you know I love Adventure
9639000	9641000	Island I wish they would put that game out you know Adventure
9641000	9643000	Island is just
9643000	9645000	what did they call Adventure Island
9645000	9647000	when it was on Turbo Graphics
9647000	9649000	when it was an original Hudson game
9649000	9651000	oh no they did get it as Adventure Island
9651000	9653000	on Turbo Graphics though I know
9653000	9655000	it was based on another series
9655000	9657000	was it Monster Boy?
9657000	9659000	I think it was Monster Boy
9659000	9661000	Wonder Boy
9661000	9663000	I think I know what you're talking about
9663000	9665000	I know on Turbo Graphics it was called New Adventure Island
9665000	9667000	there was a spinoff of these games
9667000	9669000	on Sega and I had one of them
9669000	9671000	I think it was called Revenge of
9671000	9673000	Drankon or something like that
9673000	9675000	it basically was part of the whole Adventure Island
9675000	9677000	family but it was just like a
9677000	9679000	offshoot of it and I used to play that
9679000	9681000	all the time on my Game Gear
9681000	9683000	I loved Adventure Island on the
9683000	9685000	Nintendo I remember that was one of the early Nintendo
9685000	9687000	games I played and had that cute little
9687000	9689000	doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
9689000	9691000	doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
9691000	9693000	and like one of the power-ups was randomly
9693000	9695000	like a skateboard
9695000	9697000	maybe someone from Konami
9697000	9699000	is listening maybe we'll get a new
9699000	9701000	Adventure Island for our next gen console
9701000	9703000	oh honey if anybody from Konami was listening
9703000	9705000	they unsubscribed a long time ago
9705000	9707000	sorry to say
9707000	9709000	I don't know
9709000	9711000	Twitch may give us a second chance
9711000	9713000	a lot of that though because I think
9713000	9715000	there's definitely going to be a lot of people that are like
9715000	9717000	that shit's still on
9717000	9719000	that's
9719000	9721000	that's usually the reaction I get
9721000	9723000	when somebody's like oh yeah I remember
9723000	9725000	O.L.R. I'm like actually we're still doing it
9725000	9727000	that shit's still going?
9727000	9729000	I just
9729000	9731000	realize you know
9731000	9733000	going through my archives I've been doing my podcast
9733000	9735000	I've been doing my podcast for ten years
9735000	9737000	I'm just like wait
9737000	9739000	how do we do ten years
9739000	9741000	and not do a ten year show
9741000	9743000	I'm like did we do it or did I
9743000	9745000	actually forget you know
9745000	9747000	I'm just like wow
9747000	9749000	I distinctly remember
9749000	9751000	the early shows
9751000	9753000	I remember that house we were in
9753000	9755000	I remember having the people over
9755000	9757000	I remember how they were all like big parties basically
9757000	9759000	I remember some of the subsequent shows
9759000	9761000	but I just I feel like I'm like
9761000	9763000	all of that was across a scope of
9763000	9765000	sixteen years
9765000	9767000	Jesus
9767000	9769000	and like then I have to sit here and think about
9769000	9771000	okay we call this studio
9771000	9773000	N7 because it's the
9773000	9775000	seventh studio
9775000	9777000	and the first was that house
9777000	9779000	I was renting a room in where my
9779000	9781000	roommate was like totally cool with us doing the show
9781000	9783000	the second was
9783000	9785000	oh it was when I lived with you
9785000	9787000	then the third
9787000	9789000	was
9789000	9791000	that when I was at that other house
9791000	9793000	and then we were doing it at Dark
9793000	9795000	Socrates for a bit
9795000	9797000	oh there was the apartment with Extrofer
9797000	9799000	that was the studio
9799000	9801000	see I can't even remember
9801000	9803000	World of Warcraft
9803000	9805000	oh that too yes
9805000	9807000	oh my god he was so good at Devil's Crush
9807000	9809000	you know what he's really good at now actually
9809000	9811000	I know we haven't had Extrofer on the show in a long time
9811000	9813000	you know what he's moved on to
9813000	9815000	he actually moved back east
9815000	9817000	that's one of the reasons we don't really get to hear from him a lot anymore
9817000	9819000	is all about Tetris Effect
9819000	9821000	he had like a top 100 score
9821000	9823000	at one point yeah he's really into it
9823000	9825000	so
9825000	9827000	that's pretty impressive
9827000	9829000	yep
9829000	9831000	well Rama anything else on your mind before we wrap up tonight
9831000	9833000	yes
9833000	9835000	in response to bringing
9835000	9837000	Romper Room to Twitch
9837000	9839000	yes I can't see you
9839000	9841000	as Miss Molly I just
9841000	9843000	can't no
9843000	9845000	but I can't see you
9845000	9847000	as Miss Frizzle driving all of us in a
9847000	9849000	magic school bus okay
9849000	9851000	that I that that that
9851000	9853000	that do that
9853000	9855000	I can see that easily hands
9855000	9857000	down
9857000	9859000	I'm fucking excited yes
9859000	9861000	let me answer a question
9861000	9863000	is this related to the call Act Broccoli wants
9863000	9865000	they're all fucking changing their names to Broccoli
9865000	9867000	in chat Act Broccoli wants to know
9867000	9869000	what number was the studio when you started broadcasting
9869000	9871000	on Justin TV that would have been
9871000	9873000	number 4 because that was before
9873000	9875000	your house right Dark Sakura
9875000	9877000	and then there was the house
9877000	9879000	that was the one that was in Rancho
9879000	9881000	so that was 4 because then it was your house after that
9881000	9883000	then it was my apartment
9883000	9885000	and then it was here yeah because we were moving
9885000	9887000	out of the house right so we moved
9887000	9889000	to the apartment because we didn't have a studio
9889000	9891000	space at the rental
9891000	9893000	right so it was number 4
9893000	9895000	yeah yeah
9895000	9897000	that would have been after the Exeter
9897000	9899000	apartment yes
9899000	9901000	I miss Jeremy
9901000	9903000	there you go alright
9903000	9905000	Rama I'm gonna let you go buddy okay
9905000	9907000	one more thing I promise you
9907000	9909000	this whole thing about
9909000	9911000	not having to be forced to wear pants
9911000	9913000	during Twitch I feel you on that
9913000	9915000	believe you me I feel
9915000	9917000	you on that to be fair
9917000	9919000	because one of the things
9919000	9921000	that makes OLR unique is that we are
9921000	9923000	in the same room when we do this all
9923000	9925000	out of respect for Loki and Jamie
9925000	9927000	I do wear pants when we do
9927000	9929000	the show but I have been known to
9929000	9931000	wear like gym shorts
9931000	9933000	pajama bottoms a hoop skirt
9933000	9935000	a Snuggie
9935000	9937000	a Snuggie definitely have done
9937000	9939000	shows in a Snuggie did you see that they've actually
9939000	9941000	revitalized the concept of the Snuggie but
9941000	9943000	as like a big cloak
9943000	9945000	it's like a big Sherpa
9945000	9947000	lined like a blanket
9947000	9949000	like a cloak with a hood
9949000	9951000	with a hood awesome
9951000	9953000	but to be fair I might have thought about it
9953000	9955000	I'm not gonna promise that Snuggies are gonna go away
9955000	9957000	dude if you
9957000	9959000	if you start wearing Snuggies I know the rest
9959000	9961000	of my staff will on the benefits
9961000	9963000	side I have like 60 different
9963000	9965000	geek shirts I will be sitting here wearing
9965000	9967000	a different shirt every
9967000	9969000	week
9969000	9971000	tigerclaw on chat says do you also wear a tank top
9971000	9973000	oh no I don't have a body for a tank top
9973000	9975000	um right now I have a
9975000	9977000	RuPaul what you can
9977000	9979000	wear whatever you want I don't want
9979000	9981000	to wear a tank top until I got guns
9981000	9983000	um but right now um I have
9983000	9985000	a RuPaul shirt on maybe I'll wear it next week
9985000	9987000	too it says step your pussy up
9987000	9989000	okay
9989000	9991000	okay so just so you have an idea of the
9991000	9993000	wardrobe I'm gonna be bringing to OLR
9993000	9995000	okay okay alright alright
9995000	9997000	I know I said last thing and I'm getting out of here
9997000	9999000	but what can I say I just
9999000	10001000	I bring the comedy and I bring the pain
10001000	10003000	to the show um
10003000	10005000	in response to the whole soldier console
10005000	10007000	uh huh you can find
10007000	10009000	the same one on
10009000	10011000	AliExpress for 75
10011000	10013000	dollars oh yeah no that came up right at the end
10013000	10015000	there I don't know if you heard of it yeah
10015000	10017000	a bunch of people went digging for it
10017000	10019000	I'm just laughing I'm just like
10019000	10021000	who wants to buy that garbage
10021000	10023000	nobody's gonna buy that garbage
10023000	10025000	also by the way the retro core who does
10025000	10027000	battle of the ports also
10027000	10029000	does reviews of those knockoff multi
10029000	10031000	cart systems and
10031000	10033000	his reviews are actually pretty honest and show them
10033000	10035000	running like not emulated
10035000	10037000	he'll do some of them through um
10037000	10039000	a capture but he'll also show them on
10039000	10041000	the tv and on the screen
10041000	10043000	and what they actually look like and take them apart
10043000	10045000	I'd say before anyone buys any of the knockoffs
10045000	10047000	like that check out Retro Core's
10047000	10049000	uh YouTube
10049000	10051000	alright alright Rama I'm

10119000	10121000	they they worked on with them

10123000	10125000	so much for tuning into another week of Orange Lounge
10125000	10127000	Radio uh we'll be back to do it all again
10127000	10129000	uh in seven days although
10129000	10131000	it may have a fresh coat of paint but
10131000	10133000	uh we're really excited about that thank you guys who
10133000	10135000	stuck with us over the years through the
10135000	10137000	thick and thin and all the broccoli uh if
10137000	10139000	you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio I'm gonna tell you
10139000	10141000	the same thing uh tell a friend or two
10141000	10143000	about the show help us spread the word because we are the show
10143000	10145000	where every gamer has a voice but we can only put
10145000	10147000	those voices out there if they're actually you know here
10147000	10149000	in the studio to be able to air um
10149000	10151000	bear with us there's gonna be some changes
10151000	10153000	ahead and I know a lot of people don't like
10153000	10155000	change but I think in the long run even
10155000	10157000	though the first couple shows might be rough
10157000	10159000	um I think it's gonna be a change is inevitable I think it's gonna be
10159000	10161000	a great thing I really do I'm really excited
10161000	10163000	to welcoming more people to OLR
10163000	10165000	uh doing some more things with visibility
10165000	10167000	uh and just it kinda
10167000	10169000	and I responded to a tweet about this
10169000	10171000	today um you know was
10171000	10173000	kinda like it's a new era it's a really big change
10173000	10175000	for OLR but you know what we've been here before
10175000	10177000	uh at one point uh
10177000	10179000	we were doing a three hour show about nothing but
10179000	10181000	DDR and music games and at some
10181000	10183000	point we actually had to say you know what
10183000	10185000	that that isn't really working for us anymore let's
10185000	10187000	just discuss all games like we're doing on
10187000	10189000	our podcast uh that
10189000	10191000	has uh gone on and uh
10191000	10193000	you know that was a big change or you know
10193000	10195000	speaking of when I used the phrase all games
10195000	10197000	when we left our live 365
10197000	10199000	network to join the all games network and
10199000	10201000	then when we made that change in the all games network
10201000	10203000	to come here to to VOG those were all
10203000	10205000	big changes too and you know those were all very important
10205000	10207000	eras of the show that made this show
10207000	10209000	what it is but it was a change and anyway
10209000	10211000	my point is with all those changes
10211000	10213000	um it helps things not get stale
10213000	10215000	and so not to say that like I'm feeling
10215000	10217000	stale around here cause especially after tonight
10217000	10219000	I mean you know it was a funny fuckin
10219000	10221000	show and we had some good moments but
10221000	10223000	you know I think I think that type of stuff like
10223000	10225000	really just kinda motivates you to keep going and so
10225000	10227000	when someone asks me in the
10227000	10229000	future OL that shit
10229000	10231000	still going OLR it's still going
10231000	10233000	I can say yeah and it's
10233000	10235000	even better than you remember
10235000	10237000	so thank you guys uh so
10237000	10239000	much for supporting us uh over the years
10239000	10241000	I really appreciate it and we will see

10247000	10249000	I know I've done a lot of hype but technical issues
