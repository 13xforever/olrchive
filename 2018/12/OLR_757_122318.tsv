14000	27000	This week, Square has an ace up their sleeve against the Kingdom Hearts League. The release doesn't include the entirety of the game's content. Shock went up to the ability to patch games, maybe? This is just one story. Join us for more on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	47000	Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 757 for this, December the 23rd of 2018, our last show of the year, because we're actually not going to be here next week.
47000	48000	My bad.
48000	52000	That's okay, that's okay. Here in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, and Techmaster Loki joining me.
52000	53000	Yes, I'm here.
53000	63000	As he does every Sunday night over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, the voice geeks network, where every gamer has a voice, and we do broadcast live every Sunday night at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
63000	72000	And you can check out more great shows at VOG Network dot com, but we are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who had a great show tonight with some Sony PlayStation VR recommendations.
72000	78000	I know the news is getting a little bit slower this time of year, but we still have some things to talk about tonight.
78000	90000	It's the time of year when everyone does their year-end recaps of, like, best games of 2018 and all the other, like, I don't know, a lot of it was just very, you know, slow news week type of articles.
90000	103000	Just like, here's how I unlock these games, or here's how I got enough platinum coins in, you know, the Nintendo store to be able to unlock this game for free, because I did surveys on websites.
103000	106000	And it's like, why is that an article? That's not an article.
106000	110000	It's just, it's filler, it's clickbait, because people share that stuff on Facebook and all that.
110000	112000	It's like, you need the right something, there's nothing going on!
112000	113000	Yeah.
113000	114000	Okay, fine.
114000	118000	Yeah, so I guess I'm looking in chat, and they're saying that the intro did not have audio tonight.
118000	123000	You'll hear it on the podcast, because I can easily fix it there, but we're learning some new things about video.
123000	132000	Jason actually did a wonderful video, he actually did the video introduction tonight, and for whatever reason, I must have made a boo-boo on my end and kept the audio muted on it.
132000	143000	So, that's why we started the Twitch thing in 2018, so that we could have a few test episodes, and then in 2019, we'd be like, good to go, and we could really start promoting and all that stuff.
143000	145000	But, hey, the date's correct.
145000	150000	The date is correct tonight, you know I have my eyes out for that this time, absolutely.
150000	153000	And lots of great feedback from you guys last week, thanks so much.
153000	158000	I'm already up to just about 100 followers over on the VOG Network channel, and that's so amazing.
158000	162000	Although I did notice that the ticker on the bottom had the episode number for last week.
162000	163000	Oh, did it?
163000	164000	What? Thank you.
164000	168000	That's weird. I don't even, I don't think the episode number is in the ticker bar.
168000	170000	That said something. Maybe that was just reading one of the articles.
170000	173000	I don't know, I don't know. Yeah, it's easy to get distracted with all this video.
173000	174000	So many things.
174000	181000	Yeah, and over in our chat, over at Twitch TV, Act F says Palindrome episode 2. Yes, that's right, 7570s.
181000	186000	It's the same, forward and backwards. How do you celebrate a Palindrome episode? I'm not sure.
186000	192000	Let's see, going to Run, Jump, Stomp over at Twitch says it's an article because they get paid by the word.
192000	197000	Well, you know what, I mean, people are still using Facebook and social media and all that stuff.
197000	200000	Twitter is not going to slow down just because it's Christmas Day.
200000	203000	I mean, for one, not everybody celebrates Christmas, we know that.
203000	207000	But even that, you know, people work on Christmas, but it's just, you know, I think there's a lot of people too.
207000	210000	I don't know about your family traditions, but I know in my family on Christmas.
210000	215000	So we would do, you know, and this was when I was younger, we would do the presents, we would open the gifts,
215000	220000	we would do all that exchange. And then it was kind of like after the morning, it's like, all right,
220000	224000	Christmas is kind of done. Hang out till three o'clock for dinner.
224000	228000	And for me, that would be a great time to go play whatever video game I probably got for Christmas.
228000	232000	But, you know, it was it's kind of like, oh, well, the holidays are over at that point.
232000	237000	And sometimes we would go to the movies. That's something we started doing later when I was more in my 20s.
237000	243000	I would love to do that, except that it's going to be crazy at the movie theaters.
243000	249000	Yeah. And I know we're doing food, though. So like Christmas Day, we're doing at my house.
249000	256000	Christmas Eve, we're going to my mom's house to go open stuff there, which I just talked to her in the car.
256000	267000	So apparently my my niece is going to be opening some gifts earlier on because she's not going to be able to wait until the evening because the gifts are all going to be there.
267000	276000	So she's going to open her gifts and then she'll have to wait and we'll open our gifts and the kids will open their gifts on Tuesday.
276000	283000	And they have a lot of stuff. They have a lot of stuff. Any any games that you might benefit from, too, that you actually got your kids?
283000	286000	Well, this is a bold strategy that I tried in order to get the switch.
286000	294000	So so we have so my thought originally, because I had get the wife a personal Blu-ray player so she can watch your Grey's Anatomy.
294000	304000	No, no, no, no, no. Not like that. So originally my idea was I'm going to get the kids some games for the switch so they could play some new games that they were looking for.
304000	310000	But then I realized that's games and two, they're going to have games, but they're only going to have one console.
310000	313000	They're fighting over it. And that's not going to make for a good day for me.
313000	322000	So whereas most people like, well, just they'll get over it. My thought process was, OK, let's buy them each game systems.
322000	327000	And so they're going to be getting a 2DS and for the Soulja Boy console.
327000	333000	No, no. And and four games each.
333000	339000	OK, that's pretty nice. Yes, because apparently, you know, those GameStop cards.
339000	342000	Dad's got money. No, I don't.
342000	349000	You know, those GameStop cards that you pay for stuff and you get that stupid magazine each month and stuff.
349000	355000	Well, apparently you accumulate points with that that I was completely unaware of until this week.
355000	364000	And I had like a ton of points that I could redeem for gift cards in the store, which then paid for a bunch of used copies of stuff and no complaints.
364000	371000	Yes. And plus the 2D 2DS systems, not the 2DS XL, because those are one hundred fifty dollars versus seventy dollars in the game.
371000	377000	They're very reasonable. And that's and that's what the DS is really like meant to be at this point, is that the DS is really intended to be like that baby's first.
377000	382000	Not baby, but, you know, like tween slash kid first console.
382000	387000	So they're going to get it comes preloaded with New Super Mario Brothers 2.
387000	395000	So they got that Mario Kart 7, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Super Mario Maker for the 3DS.
395000	400000	And then the one game that they'll fight over because they have different games each.
400000	405000	Josh is getting Super Mario 3D Land because he used to play 3D World.
405000	408000	Oh, sure. He was disappointed when we got rid of the Wii U because he couldn't play that anymore.
408000	415000	And it's basically the same game. And then Mario Party top one hundred for Danny because he likes playing Mario Party.
415000	422000	Speaking of Mario, and this is a random tangent, but since you brought it up and we are a video game show, after all, we do we are going to talk.
422000	427000	If you're new, because we just had our first show on Twitch, even though we've been doing this show for 16 and a half years, since 2002.
427000	432000	I don't expect that a lot of people necessarily knew what Shoutcast is or was listening to stuff within that.
432000	436000	So I know this whole Twitch thing is still a little bit newer for us. So we're adjusting to it too.
436000	440000	Hence why we have some bugs like the audio and the intro and things like that.
440000	445000	But otherwise, we do talk about games, of course, over the next few hours.
445000	450000	And since you brought up Mario, the Mario, the game that was on the Wii U.
450000	454000	So what New Super Mario Brothers U gets at Switchport like next month.
454000	458000	And I totally forgot that that was going to be a thing until I saw some random article.
458000	461000	The deluxe one has like that in the new Luigi U.
461000	467000	Well, that game is the fault of where Bowsette came from and why we have all that crap.
467000	474000	I mean, fan art. Because that was the one where you have, what was it, like Toadette or she gets the...
474000	478000	I can't even remember what it is now, but I know it's where Bowsette started.
478000	480000	Was it in Peachette or something like that?
480000	484000	Yes, it's Peachette. I think it's like Toadette meets Peach and then there's the whole thing.
484000	491000	Maybe somebody in our chat remembers what all that is about over at our Twitch TV channel at VOG Network.
491000	496000	And yeah, something else. So a lot of the feedback from Twitch last week was very positive.
496000	499000	But I do have a good friend that will always kind of like tell me like,
499000	503000	your tag's sticking out, you know, the nitpicky things that are going on and so forth.
503000	509000	So was kind of giving me the feedback on OLR and saying that like at some points I was like on my phone.
509000	513000	Like I got, oh my God, I got caught because remember you guys couldn't see us before.
513000	515000	So that was like totally normal.
515000	518000	Is that, yeah, they'll be reading a story and I'd be like checking the headlines, you know,
518000	521000	what else going on, what's going on with my Twitter and all this other stuff and...
521000	522000	Catching a Pokemon.
522000	525000	What Facebook gave me, Pokemon outside. Oh crap, you guys can see that.
525000	527000	And it does look really weird when I do that.
527000	530000	And also probably looks weird when I'm like turning back and forth.
530000	535000	Yeah, because I'm not looking, it's hard to look at the camera and the chat room and the screen and you.
535000	537000	And it's like, where do I look?
537000	541000	But I got like, I totally, I'm not like complaining because they're probably watching and like,
541000	544000	are you really complaining about that on air? But no, I actually thought like, oh crap,
544000	547000	that is like really good feedback and something like I'm not thinking of with this whole Twitch thing.
547000	552000	So we are trying to make like small baby steps where I've tried to look at Loki more tonight.
552000	556000	And but yeah, if you guys wonder like, why do I keep turning away over here?
556000	559000	It's because you guys' chat is over here and the stories and things I do.
559000	562000	But as we move into next year and get a little more used to this
562000	566000	and get that USB cable that will allow our camera to be further back,
566000	570000	we'll probably rearrange the studio a little bit so it's not so weird.
570000	574000	But remember, we said that when we were going to first go to Twitch,
574000	577000	the goal was do the same show, but do it on Twitch.
577000	580000	And there'll just kind of be video there, but you know, we're going to try to,
580000	584000	I mean the camera's not bad where it's at. I don't know really how much further back are we going to get.
584000	588000	Well, and I still don't know how when Jamie's back from her break,
588000	592000	because of course Dark Soccer, she's not here tonight. She's still on her extended work break.
592000	595000	But when she comes back, I'm not sure to what extent she's going to want to be involved.
595000	599000	I still really love the idea of a Dr. Claw type thing where you can like see your hand.
599000	602000	And that whole thing, so I'll talk to her about that.
602000	606000	So we'll figure out how we'll set all that up, and I'm sure Alan, my husband,
606000	609000	will be thrilled at rearranging this room completely yet again.
609000	611000	So there you go.
611000	616000	Run Jump Stomp in chat says, that chair looks really uncomfortable.
616000	621000	It's fine. You actually, I don't know if it's Loki or me, but Loki, you prefer this to the couch.
621000	625000	Like I was like, you could just sit on the couch, but you kind of like something with the back on that, right?
626000	629000	Yeah, this is fine. It's just the couch is really, you sink into it a bit.
629000	635000	And it was hard to have like the laptop, you know, on a TV tray and be able to do that.
635000	637000	It's a lot easier with this.
637000	642000	Yeah, and Bobby Black Wolf calls out from the last show when I walked away.
642000	645000	And it's like, you know, again, you guys could catch me doing that before,
645000	648000	but at some point, this little cup of water, I drink a lot of water while doing the show,
648000	653000	it runs out and I got to go fill up, but I'm going to try my best to hold it till the break tonight.
653000	656000	But like if there's a potty emergency or something, I'm just going to go.
656000	659000	That's what you got to do. I'm just going to get up and go.
659000	662000	Or Mr. Smush starts screaming. It is what it is.
662000	664000	Although he's a little more well behaved now.
664000	668000	He was losing his crap earlier, but I think he's under control now.
668000	670000	Yeah. All right, we're good. All right, well, let's get into news.
670000	672000	We got some news going on this week.
672000	675000	I know it's a little bit lighter, but we do have some things going on in the news.
675000	676000	So let's get into it.
676000	681000	A big thing people are talking about on social media involving the most popular game right now in the world,
682000	687000	even if I don't play it as much, but I know tons of people do, it's Fortnite, right?
687000	689000	Yeah, my son plays it a lot now.
689000	692000	Although he doesn't play with people, he just plays the creative mode now.
692000	693000	Yeah, yeah.
693000	695000	Because it's just fun for him to mess around with it.
695000	701000	So apparently there's been some lawsuits regarding the dancing emotes that are in the game.
701000	706000	So one of the things that Fortnite's known for is these famous dances within the game.
706000	712000	And of course, apparently now we have Alfonso Ribero.
714000	715000	What is up with your cat?
715000	719000	Anyways, smoosh is up on the table where I got it. I'll be back.
719000	722000	Okay. I heard him just like sneezing and whatever.
722000	725000	Right after that whole talk about leaving.
726000	727000	What are you going to do?
727000	733000	So anyways, so with the whole thing being popular in the game, of course,
733000	740000	now Alfonso Ribero is basically saying that, hey, you guys stole my dance without even asking.
740000	743000	And there's definitely been no compensation for it.
743000	747000	So he filed a lawsuit against Epic Games regarding that.
747000	754000	But then again, there's also, you know, video out there that TMZ provided saying that,
754000	757000	oh, hey, you know, he stole the dance from somebody else.
757000	762000	But I think when he says steal, it's more like he took this part and this part from two other people,
762000	765000	something that they did, and then he mixed in some other stuff.
765000	769000	And that's more just like creating your own thing that's not just straight up, right.
769000	776000	You know, taking something and using it without any sort of permission or whatever.
776000	782000	But basically saying, you know, hey, Epic has earned record profits off of downloadable content in the game,
782000	785000	including emotes like Fresh, which is the dance that they're referring to.
785000	789000	Yet Epic has failed to compensate or even ask for permission for Mr. Ribero
789000	793000	or use of his likeness and iconic intellectual property.
795000	800000	I mean, definitely the dances. You could tell where it's from, obviously, in Fresh.
800000	802000	Definitely alluding to Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
802000	806000	But he's not the only one, though, that's also had issue with it.
806000	812000	So apparently, and I'm not sure who this kid is, but they call him Backpack Kid.
812000	816000	Basically, he was part of a performance that Katy Perry did.
816000	818000	Wait, you don't know Backpack Kid?
818000	819000	I don't know Backpack Kid.
819000	821000	Y'all are gonna regret this Twitch thing.
821000	825000	No, no, you're not flossing. Fucking sit down right now. Sit down.
825000	829000	We're not doing this shit. This shit is not happening on our show.
830000	834000	Enough. The line, we're drawing the line there. We're not doing...
834000	837000	You look fucking dumb. Just don't do that.
839000	843000	Eventually when my kid comes to the show again, yes, he'll fucking do that.
843000	846000	But no. We are too damn old to be doing that shit.
846000	849000	And if we raise $50, we'll go back to Shoutcast.
851000	856000	So anyways, Backpack Kid, who, you know, of course, made famous flossing.
856000	858000	You know, the dance of the children.
859000	862000	So he is, of course, joining the lawsuit as well.
862000	865000	I thought there was another artist, too, that was basically saying,
865000	866000	Hey, what the fuck?
867000	869000	But, I mean, let's be honest here, though.
869000	871000	Like, the Carlton Dance has been a ton of fucking shit.
871000	875000	I mean, they had that emote, and I can remember Saints Row had that shit in there.
875000	881000	But I guess it's just maybe because they're selling it as a separate thing instead of it being included.
881000	884000	And then, who knows, maybe they'd ask for permission in that game.
886000	889000	But maybe it's just because they're specifically selling it,
889000	895000	and because it's the most popular game right now that it's caught the attention versus Saints Row, who...
896000	899000	I think that's key, what you're talking about, is how they're selling it.
899000	903000	Because I think, when I think of, like, pop culture dances and games,
903000	905000	the first thing I remember is World of Warcraft.
905000	908000	Well, yeah, and they have that in World of Warcraft.
908000	910000	Yeah, like how the Draenei, I think, did the Toonok Dance.
910000	913000	Like, they did a lot of meme stuff that they did.
913000	917000	And I think the Blood Elf female does Britney Toxic.
917000	920000	And, you know, they're very mainstream type of stuff.
920000	924000	And, you know, well, what's funny now is that, you know, because World of Warcraft is, you know,
924000	926000	over, like, what, like 14 years old at this point,
926000	931000	like, a lot of the stuff that's in it is referencing things that were memes, like, 14 years ago.
931000	936000	But still, you're right, like, dances have been in games for a long time, but in WoW, it was kind of built in.
936000	942000	So what's the point between, like, parody and, like, making a profit off it?
942000	945000	Is that really parody when it's just, like, lifting the dance?
945000	950000	I think it's just how identical the dance is, maybe.
950000	957000	Because you can copyright a dance, but I don't know why this would be liable for, you know,
957000	959000	some sort of restitution versus something else.
959000	962000	Also, I should mention, though, that they're not just suing Epic Games as well,
962000	968000	they're also suing 2K games over NBA 2K, which also apparently has emotes in that game as well.
968000	970000	I thought that was a fucking basketball game.
970000	973000	Why you're doing the Carlton is...
973000	975000	No, why? Where's that coming from?
975000	977000	I thought that was, like, a sportsy thing.
977000	981000	Like, I have to admit, I'm not the biggest sports, but I know, like, in football,
981000	984000	when they get to the end zone and they do a touchdown, like, wasn't there, like, I remember,
984000	989000	like, wasn't there the guy, the Tebow or whatever his name was that would always, like,
989000	992000	pray, take a knee and do that whole thing?
992000	993000	We don't talk about that now either.
993000	998000	Yeah, I know. Now we can't talk about taking a knee in the NFL, but I'm gonna say that for another day.
998000	1000000	So, but anyway, so yeah, I mean, what...
1000000	1002000	Or in Destiny. Destiny is another one.
1002000	1003000	Destiny has that too.
1003000	1004000	Yeah.
1004000	1006000	So, are they, I mean, a lot of questions...
1006000	1012000	I think what it is is because nowadays, games, whether it be a free-to-play game,
1012000	1017000	like, you know, Epic's Fortnite, which, that's fine if they're selling shit like that in the game,
1017000	1026000	because it's free-to-play, or Destiny and 2K, you know, NBA 2K, which are full $60 games,
1026000	1031000	that you also are paying for microtransaction bullshit as well on top of it,
1031000	1035000	because some of the money is not all of the money, and they need all of the money,
1035000	1037000	and that's why they're doing this shit.
1037000	1040000	It is gonna raise this, I mean, we've been talking for a long time about how, like,
1040000	1043000	you know, intellectual property rights and trademarks and a lot of that stuff
1043000	1049000	really needs to be reevaluated in this digital era,
1049000	1053000	because so much, you know, we have so much homegrown stuff even,
1053000	1054000	like the stuff we're doing on Twitch.
1054000	1058000	We still don't even, like, really have a question or an answer,
1058000	1060000	and we have a question, we don't have an answer to, like,
1060000	1065000	what really is the legality when, like, you play a game and you're talking over it?
1065000	1066000	Like, who really owns that?
1066000	1069000	Do you really own that or does the game maker have a say in that?
1069000	1072000	And, like, sure, a lot of us, because we do stream on Twitch,
1072000	1075000	we like to feel like we own it, but I've always said, you know,
1075000	1078000	if the game makers wanted to take a cut of some of the biddies,
1078000	1082000	I wouldn't be opposed to it, but there needs to be an established rule,
1082000	1086000	a consistent rule, and something that's kind of like the accepted standard
1086000	1090000	of who owns what, because I also don't think the game company should own everything.
1090000	1093000	You know, if we're making jokes and things like that, you know,
1093000	1096000	like, how does that all play out?
1096000	1099000	I think a lot of the DMCA stuff needs to stop anyways,
1099000	1101000	just because of how it's being abused.
1101000	1105000	I mean, there was a thing this week about a channel that got taken down
1105000	1111000	because a developer didn't like what they were saying about their game,
1111000	1114000	and so they filed copyright strikes against their channel, which...
1114000	1116000	That's a YouTube problem. That's why we're on Twitch.
1116000	1120000	Just not to be shady, but a little shady, but because, you know,
1120000	1123000	it's just, like, YouTube does not stick up for their content creators.
1123000	1124000	Oh, no, not at all.
1124000	1128000	Never ever. They always err on the side of ruling against them,
1128000	1131000	whereas I feel like, and maybe this is just my perception,
1131000	1134000	but I do feel Twitch, and I'm not just kissing butt because we're here now,
1134000	1137000	but I do feel Twitch does a better job of kind of sticking up
1137000	1140000	and being a little more proactive for its user base
1140000	1142000	in some of the things that they do, if that makes sense,
1142000	1145000	especially when it comes to things like their muting policy.
1145000	1148000	I think, you know, it's fair. Like, they have to do what they have to do to be legal,
1148000	1151000	and I think what they're doing is kind of fair, and if you, you know, challenge it,
1151000	1153000	they have a process to look at it and all that stuff,
1153000	1157000	whereas I feel like YouTube just never errs on the side of the content creators,
1157000	1159000	so why would I want to create content for YouTube?
1159000	1162000	I'm really not motivated to do that.
1162000	1164000	So, all right.
1164000	1167000	Going to our chat, Run Jump Stomp reminds us,
1167000	1170000	Nintendo recently backed off about content creation.
1170000	1171000	What's that?
1171000	1172000	See what you did?
1172000	1173000	Oh, yeah.
1173000	1174000	Now they clip that shit.
1174000	1176000	Yes, I know. I need to be thinking about that. That's going to happen.
1176000	1177000	That's going to happen.
1177000	1181000	If the broccoli thing from our last radio-only show had been on this,
1181000	1183000	that would have gotten clipped like 5,000 times.
1183000	1185000	That actually got me thinking earlier this week, so...
1185000	1187000	Clips help spread the show, whatever.
1187000	1192000	I don't think... I wanted to tell the kids where they're actually going.
1192000	1194000	No, you can't do it till the holidays.
1194000	1197000	So, yeah, I think we're not doing that.
1197000	1198000	I got it. I got it.
1198000	1201000	Put a bunch of broccoli in a bowl, and then when they eat all the broccoli,
1201000	1203000	there's a Disney logo at the bottom.
1203000	1204000	Well, they're never going to eat all the broccoli.
1204000	1206000	Well, then they're not going to Disneyland.
1207000	1214000	So, my thought was, though, it would be cool to do a mock Disney logo shirt,
1214000	1217000	but just have, let's say, Broccoli Farm in the Disney font,
1217000	1222000	and then we can sell them to our listeners, because they want merch anyways.
1222000	1224000	Would Disney sue, though?
1224000	1225000	It's a parody.
1225000	1228000	Okay. All right. We'll see what we can do.
1228000	1231000	If we... It's the Mickey head, is the hard part.
1231000	1233000	No, we wouldn't put the Mickey head. It's just broccoli.
1233000	1234000	Oh, okay.
1234000	1237000	Broccoli in an actual farm, and then it just looks like...
1237000	1240000	All right. Leave that joke two weeks ago.
1240000	1242000	Back to the Fortnite dances, Loki.
1242000	1244000	So, how do you see this ending?
1244000	1248000	I see it going to court, and we'll see if it actually...
1248000	1249000	If they have a case or not.
1249000	1250000	I say settlement.
1250000	1252000	These things always end in a settlement.
1252000	1255000	Fortnite is pooping out the dollars,
1255000	1258000	and they're just going to pay it off to shut these guys down,
1258000	1261000	but then what's that going to do for the future,
1261000	1263000	and other games incorporating dances,
1263000	1268000	which I think, again, I can see where it's a little bit of a problem
1268000	1271000	when you're selling it in the stores as an enhancement,
1271000	1274000	or you're getting in the loot box as an enhancement,
1274000	1277000	but in World of Warcraft, it was just kind of there.
1277000	1279000	It was a little bonus thing. It was a cute thing that they did.
1279000	1281000	Saints Row, similar thing, right?
1281000	1283000	Yeah. It was just a silly thing.
1283000	1284000	Exactly. It was a silly thing.
1284000	1287000	Or maybe if they want to have the dance,
1287000	1289000	maybe they should at least license the song,
1289000	1292000	which I know for the Carlton, there's no real...
1292000	1294000	I mean, we all know it goes with Tom Jones.
1294000	1296000	It's not, watch out, or I'll do that dance too,
1296000	1298000	but it's the whole Tom Jones, it's not unusual to be loved by you,
1298000	1300000	which isn't really... but you know what I mean.
1300000	1301000	I know what you mean.
1301000	1305000	A lot of times, the dances go with a song,
1305000	1308000	so if you pay the money to get the song in your game,
1308000	1310000	maybe you could use the dance too,
1310000	1313000	but I think it's the whole fact that they are selling the dance
1313000	1316000	as a separate thing, and it's not just incorporated into the game
1316000	1318000	as a pop culture reference,
1318000	1321000	which could probably be sold a little more as parody, I guess.
1321000	1324000	I think that's where ultimately the legal law lines
1324000	1326000	are kind of drawn a little bit.
1326000	1328000	And Fortnite, we'll just have to think of other things to sell,
1328000	1331000	either original dances, but we know that's not...
1331000	1334000	People aren't really going to buy original dances.
1334000	1336000	They have merch already.
1336000	1339000	I just bought my Sunday Fortnite 2019 calendar,
1339000	1343000	and apparently they have characters or skins or something like that
1343000	1346000	that were actual... because I was asking them,
1346000	1348000	so do they actually have characters in this game?
1348000	1350000	Because I see this one's named Leviathan,
1350000	1352000	and he's like, no, that's a skin.
1352000	1354000	I'm like, okay.
1354000	1356000	Loki, they're yelling at me in chat,
1356000	1358000	because I won't do the Carlton.
1358000	1359000	You're yelling at me in chat.
1359000	1362000	You don't have enough room. You're going to injure yourself.
1364000	1366000	That is not even...
1366000	1369000	That's what I could do with the space I was given.
1369000	1371000	That's not even...
1371000	1373000	Oh God, I'm having to watch it back.
1373000	1376000	Exactly. Witness the horror that is.
1377000	1379000	All right, anyway.
1380000	1383000	Let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks.
1383000	1386000	I want to talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
1386000	1388000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1388000	1390000	I didn't play a whole ton.
1390000	1392000	I think I've been busy shopping this week.
1392000	1394000	I was actually trying to reflect back to what I played,
1394000	1398000	and it's mainly just Pokemon Go.
1398000	1400000	I've just been playing a little bit of that.
1400000	1404000	I even forgot to do my stupid mystery box thing to get melted,
1404000	1407000	which sucks because it was the double candy event thing,
1407000	1411000	and that would have been really helpful if I had remembered to do it.
1413000	1415000	So yeah, I didn't end up doing that,
1415000	1417000	and I don't...
1417000	1419000	DDR, I don't think I played too much.
1419000	1421000	It just had to...
1421000	1423000	A lot of plans kept changing.
1423000	1426000	I had to go places, and so I wasn't able to do that.
1426000	1429000	I did try to stream on Friday,
1429000	1433000	and it ended up being an issue where I wanted to load a new mix on there,
1433000	1437000	and I have a drive that's supposed to read that disk fine,
1437000	1442000	and it did, but then when I went to actually load the game after I installed it,
1442000	1444000	it just wouldn't read the disk again.
1444000	1448000	So then I swapped drives out again to the one that I bought,
1448000	1451000	a replacement drive that was supposed to be the most compatible with the disk,
1451000	1453000	and it won't read anything now,
1453000	1456000	so I had to put the old drive back in there,
1456000	1458000	and at that point I was like,
1458000	1460000	fuck it, it's too late, I'm just not doing it right now.
1460000	1466000	So I have all the parts to build the StepMania PC.
1466000	1469000	I have everything now, so I just need to do it.
1469000	1471000	I may end up doing that tomorrow.
1471000	1473000	And then I also found out,
1473000	1477000	I was trying to figure out what theme I wanted to put on there,
1477000	1481000	and my problem was that the menus were too laggy,
1481000	1486000	and then I ended up finding out by trying to move my StepMania install to my SSD drive.
1486000	1490000	Not laggy on an official mix, but laggy on your StepMania setup, right?
1490000	1492000	Laggy on my laptop.
1492000	1494000	So it was laggy.
1494000	1498000	I mean, it should be fine altogether, because StepMania runs on a toaster.
1498000	1504000	It was laggy in the sense that the menus were kind of lagging as I'm moving stuff around,
1504000	1508000	like there was a little bit of jitter with loading images or something,
1508000	1510000	and I couldn't tell why that was,
1510000	1512000	and I was trying to find a mix that was pretty smooth
1512000	1515000	because I wanted to build off of it to do a custom theme.
1515000	1519000	And so then I was like, hey, you know what, I wonder if it's this hard drive,
1519000	1524000	because I have a 5 terabyte 5400 RPM drive in there and then I have an SSD.
1524000	1527000	I was like, well, let me put it on my SSD and see if that makes a difference,
1527000	1530000	and oh, yep, that was the issue.
1530000	1539000	So I have a 256 gigabyte NVMe drive, so that's about six times faster than an SSD.
1539000	1544000	I mean, it's still technically an SSD, but it's 32 gigabytes per second,
1544000	1548000	so it'll be able to handle, it should be able to handle anything.
1548000	1551000	So I'm thinking now I don't have to worry about the lag.
1551000	1555000	I just will just pick something and go with that.
1555000	1557000	But I don't know.
1557000	1559000	I still need to come over and play DDR.
1559000	1560000	I know I keep promising it.
1560000	1564000	I did one of those dumb things I keep saying I'm never going to do again.
1564000	1567000	I played one of those online Big Brother type games,
1567000	1571000	but this time there were 32 people in it, and I got to the end.
1571000	1573000	I'm in the final three.
1573000	1576000	So finally, a little bit of payoff, but I'm not going to win.
1576000	1577000	I already know I'm not going to win.
1577000	1579000	They're actually announcing the winner in an hour.
1579000	1580000	It's not going to be me.
1580000	1584000	But yeah, so that's been taking up a lot of my time
1584000	1587000	because I try to do a lot of chatting in the evening.
1587000	1588000	It would be around a line.
1588000	1592000	Apparently I didn't do enough, which is why I'm not going to win, but whatever.
1592000	1596000	But I do definitely want to come by at some point and play on your machine
1596000	1598000	because I need to get thin again.
1598000	1599000	Well, me too.
1599000	1602000	I've been kind of slacking this week,
1602000	1606000	and also eating 12 breadsticks is not going to be helping me any,
1606000	1607000	but I don't care.
1607000	1610000	I want them.
1610000	1614000	So I really do need to get back into it after the year,
1614000	1615000	the start of the year again.
1615000	1618000	But I haven't really gained that much.
1618000	1621000	I'm just kind of hovering in the same spot, like low 200s.
1621000	1624000	So that's good.
1624000	1628000	I'm not bouncing back up to 220 or something like that.
1628000	1635000	So I just need to keep everything consistent and get back into DDR again.
1635000	1638000	So not to derail you too much, but Loki, it's literally been three minutes,
1638000	1643000	and look, there's a GIF of what just happened.
1643000	1647000	The oil army works fast, and I am kind of embarrassed watching that,
1647000	1649000	but whatever, what can you do?
1649000	1655000	Now all we need to do is turn that into an emoji or whatever.
1656000	1659000	Oh, one of the Twitch emojis or whatever?
1659000	1661000	When we get biddies.
1661000	1664000	I don't want to get sued, though. Isn't that like paying for a dance?
1664000	1665000	Well, let me put it this way.
1665000	1672000	That Carlton dance was so not the Carlton dance that we'll be fine.
1672000	1674000	I couldn't remember the whole thing.
1674000	1675000	I just know he does that thing with his arm.
1675000	1676000	It'll be fine.
1676000	1677000	Forget it. Forget it.
1677000	1678000	You didn't really want to see it anyway.
1678000	1680000	All right, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1680000	1682000	That was pretty much it.
1682000	1684000	I didn't play Katamari, sadly, even though I have it.
1685000	1689000	I did download my free copy of Lego Lord of the Rings,
1689000	1693000	but I didn't play anything on PC.
1693000	1695000	I probably will, though.
1695000	1696000	All right.
1696000	1698000	Let me talk about my gaming week then.
1698000	1702000	I did play Katamari because Loki, good old friend buddy pal,
1702000	1705000	bought me a Katamari Damacy reroll on PC,
1705000	1708000	so I was kind of trying to decide, do I want it on PC so I can mod it?
1708000	1711000	Do I want it on Switch so I can take it on the go?
1711000	1713000	And Loki made the decision for me, so thank you.
1713000	1714000	I appreciate that.
1714000	1715000	You can always buy it again.
1715000	1717000	That's true. I could always buy it again.
1717000	1719000	Actually, we're already going to buy it twice,
1719000	1722000	because the minute I was like, oh, Loki,
1722000	1725000	I kind of exclaimed, oh, Loki got me Katamari Damacy.
1725000	1728000	And Alan on the other side of the green screen is like,
1728000	1729000	wait a minute, that's on PC?
1729000	1731000	I thought that was only on Switch.
1731000	1732000	And I was like, no, it's on PC.
1732000	1734000	And he's like, I'm opening Steam.
1736000	1739000	So we already ended up buying two copies.
1739000	1741000	Well, yeah, I don't think it was on sale this week.
1741000	1743000	Well, no, it's too soon with the sale.
1743000	1745000	Yeah, I've been trying to watch the Steam sales
1745000	1747000	to see if there's anything interesting on there,
1747000	1750000	but I've been not buying anything.
1750000	1754000	Anything I buy, it's like, I'm not going to play that.
1754000	1758000	It's like, yeah, I could buy Earth Defense Force 5,
1758000	1761000	but am I really going to play that anytime soon?
1761000	1762000	Probably not.
1762000	1766000	So I just have to hold off and get set mania done.
1766000	1769000	So then when set mania is done,
1769000	1771000	and if I have any extra free time,
1771000	1774000	I can go to actually doing game development again
1774000	1779000	instead of trying to develop a theme for set mania.
1779000	1782000	Let me quickly talk about Katamari Damacy reroll, though.
1782000	1783000	I didn't get to play a ton of it,
1783000	1785000	but I did open it up, play through the tutorial,
1785000	1787000	first couple stages.
1787000	1789000	So it's the PlayStation 2 game,
1789000	1791000	but now all redone and widescreen,
1791000	1793000	I guess would probably be the biggest change
1793000	1796000	because the original game was, what, 2002, 2003?
1796000	1797000	It was right around when this show started,
1797000	1799000	when that game first came out for the PlayStation 2.
1799000	1802000	It is funny, and a lot of people are razzing it for this,
1802000	1804000	is that it was a $20 budget game
1804000	1806000	when it first came out for the PlayStation 2,
1806000	1809000	but now they want, what, 40 bucks for it, right?
1809000	1810000	30.
1810000	1812000	Oh, 30. Well, still, it's more than 20.
1812000	1813000	Yeah.
1813000	1816000	But it is HD, it is all that stuff.
1816000	1819000	So honestly, if you played the original,
1819000	1821000	then you know exactly what you're going to get.
1821000	1824000	They rebuilt the engine, so they rebuilt it in Unity.
1824000	1825000	Low-key, it's the same game.
1825000	1826000	It's the same game.
1826000	1828000	They didn't really add a lot to it or anything.
1828000	1830000	It's the same game, which isn't a bad thing.
1830000	1834000	And I realize, since it's been, what, a good 13 years at least,
1834000	1835000	I don't know, probably longer,
1835000	1838000	since Katamari Damacy originally came out,
1838000	1841000	there's probably a lot of people maybe in their 20s or so
1841000	1843000	that didn't discover it when they were younger,
1843000	1845000	and so now have a chance to discover it again.
1845000	1848000	So if you've never played any Katamari whatsoever,
1848000	1849000	I think it's definitely worth checking out.
1849000	1852000	And for somebody like me who hasn't had a chance
1852000	1854000	to play it in a long time, I'm really into it.
1854000	1856000	I have one minor bitch, though, about it,
1856000	1859000	because this was like, what are they smoking type of thing?
1859000	1861000	Okay, so you haven't opened yours on PC, right?
1861000	1862000	No, I haven't.
1862000	1864000	So here's the gag about the whole thing.
1864000	1868000	So when you launch it, it comes up in a window that's 720p,
1868000	1871000	which, okay, whatever, like, where are my options to resize it
1871000	1872000	or anything like that?
1872000	1874000	You have to play through the tutorial,
1874000	1877000	which includes the 5 centimeter to 10 centimeter,
1877000	1879000	like the first introductory stage,
1879000	1882000	before you get to that menu area
1882000	1885000	where the game brings up a special splash screen that says,
1885000	1888000	you really need to save your game right now,
1888000	1890000	or you're gonna have to do what you just did all over again
1890000	1891000	next time you open the game.
1891000	1893000	And I'm like, what?
1893000	1894000	But all right.
1894000	1895000	Why?
1895000	1898000	Weird ass design choices.
1898000	1899000	I don't have a good explanation.
1899000	1901000	But then once you finally do that,
1901000	1904000	you can go in and finally change the display settings.
1904000	1905000	Absolutely.
1905000	1907000	So you can play in 2K and, you know, all that.
1907000	1909000	It will render in 4K.
1909000	1912000	I don't know if that necessarily means it's using 4K textures,
1912000	1915000	but the game will play in a 4K window.
1915000	1918000	I think all the textures are pretty low res, aren't they?
1918000	1919000	It's Katamari Damacy, you guys.
1919000	1923000	It's not frickin' like, you know, Madden 4K sport event of the summer.
1923000	1928000	I keep seeing, like, you keep browsing the Steam forums for that game,
1928000	1931000	and I see people running it on the GPD,
1931000	1935000	the GPD, like, portable little computer thing
1935000	1937000	that looks like a little handheld device.
1937000	1940000	So that thing could run on a pretty low-end PC.
1940000	1941000	Yeah, no.
1941000	1943000	But, well, you know, of course they beefed it up and everything.
1943000	1947000	But it runs, I mean, I like to play a lot of my games in 2K
1947000	1949000	because my graphics card is still a little, eh, you know,
1949000	1951000	I just do really 4K video and things like that.
1951000	1954000	But, I mean, it looks really good.
1954000	1957000	Once you get past the tutorial and all that, it looks good.
1957000	1960000	But it's one of those design choices where you're like,
1960000	1962000	Namco, what are you thinking?
1962000	1966000	Like, that should have been, like, the first menu that comes up.
1966000	1969000	Or, I mean, some games just have a separate little application,
1969000	1974000	like Final Fantasy XIII, I think, has a separate app you run
1974000	1976000	to configure it all, and then when you go in the game it's all there.
1976000	1977000	But I was like, what?
1977000	1980000	A lot of Unity games will have you just pop up the screen
1980000	1982000	that actually shows, you know, here's some settings,
1982000	1985000	and then you go into the game and stuff,
1985000	1988000	but maybe they just didn't want people to know it was running in Unity?
1988000	1992000	Or it's something to do with the lazy fucking port from the Switch.
1992000	1994000	Oh, yeah, or it could be that.
1994000	1997000	Because on the Switch, you wouldn't have to do any of that.
1997000	2000000	The Switch has one mode to play that's probably 720.
2000000	2002000	So that's probably, honestly, what it is.
2002000	2004000	It's just lazy fucking porting from the Switch.
2004000	2008000	So that's why I kind of have to read it a little bit.
2008000	2010000	I mean, don't get me wrong, the game's great,
2010000	2012000	and you're only stuck in that mode for five minutes,
2012000	2014000	but it's still one of those things that makes you go,
2014000	2020000	guys, what a freaking, like, lazy thing that you could have done better, right?
2020000	2022000	So it was just weird.
2022000	2024000	But otherwise, I love Katamari.
2024000	2026000	Other games that I've been playing this week include
2026000	2028000	same old, same old, wow, World of Warcraft,
2028000	2031000	because they had the new, they put out the new patch not that long ago,
2031000	2035000	so the Warlock I had now can do stuff in Darkshore,
2035000	2037000	which is like another, this means nothing to you,
2037000	2041000	another zone where you can do more, like, daily quests and things like that.
2041000	2045000	Look, it's one of those things where I'm starting to get a little better at,
2045000	2048000	I'll do that on screen A, and then on screen B,
2048000	2050000	I'm watching this week's Drag Race.
2050000	2052000	Or I'm watching something I don't really need to watch,
2052000	2057000	I just kind of listen to, like, maybe a talk show on cable or something.
2057000	2060000	So I kind of just zone out and play wow
2060000	2063000	while I kind of absorb the information from whatever I'm watching.
2063000	2066000	So I've been playing a little World of Warcraft like that,
2066000	2068000	and a little bit of Final Fantasy as well,
2068000	2070000	Shane and I were messing around in that game the other night,
2070000	2074000	because they have a winter event that I need to do.
2074000	2076000	We got sidetracked, he was farming sheep.
2076000	2078000	Don't they have, like, the blue mages coming soon?
2078000	2085000	Blue mage, they dated blue mage June, or June, January 13th, I think.
2085000	2087000	Don't quote me on that. I think the patch was January 6th,
2087000	2090000	and blue mage unlocks one week later on the 13th.
2090000	2093000	So they're, because they just did their live letter for, like,
2093000	2095000	explaining everything about this next patch,
2095000	2098000	and everything leading up to the next expansion.
2098000	2102000	But what I was going to say is the winter event is supposed to be a music game thing.
2102000	2105000	So I haven't, yeah, I haven't really explored it yet,
2105000	2107000	but they've done some really cute events,
2107000	2109000	like, they had one where you went into a dungeon,
2109000	2111000	but it was, like, a holiday dungeon.
2111000	2112000	I think it was, like, Halloween or something,
2112000	2113000	you went into one of the scary dungeons,
2113000	2115000	you had to avoid ghosts or something.
2115000	2117000	And then I know they had one that was, like,
2117000	2120000	the old school dungeon crawler,
2120000	2123000	meaning, like, think, like, Fantasy Star,
2123000	2125000	when you're in the first person dungeon,
2125000	2127000	but it's those really rudimentary walls,
2127000	2128000	because, you know what I mean, like,
2128000	2131000	Ultima III had them, I'm trying to think of other games that had them back in the day,
2131000	2133000	but Fantasy Star is probably the best example of it.
2133000	2134000	But they had one like that,
2134000	2136000	but it was really easy to play, because you would see that,
2136000	2138000	but you would see, like, a map right next to it.
2138000	2141000	It's just like you were navigating a maze with your arrow keys, basically.
2141000	2142000	So they did something like that,
2142000	2144000	but I like it when they do, like, super cute things like that.
2144000	2146000	My favorite, not to get too off base,
2146000	2149000	my favorite holiday thing they've ever done in Final Fantasy XIV
2149000	2152000	was, I think it was the third anniversary of the game.
2152000	2154000	They did an anniversary event,
2154000	2157000	and as part of the event, you would transport to this,
2157000	2159000	or teleport to this magical place
2159000	2161000	that was basically a workshop
2161000	2164000	where you interacted with the developers of the game.
2164000	2167000	And they kind of, you know, there was a lot of tongue-in-cheek type of stuff,
2167000	2171000	but there was one, you talk to a character that basically represents it,
2171000	2173000	and it's called, like, Yoshi P or something like that,
2173000	2177000	which is Yoshida, who's the director, producer of the game.
2177000	2181000	And basically he says, like, the character says something like,
2181000	2182000	I'm kind of paraphrasing here,
2182000	2187000	but, uh, we know that it was a rough road the first couple years,
2187000	2189000	and we want to thank you so much for sticking with us,
2189000	2192000	and, you know, we're gonna tell all these new stories,
2192000	2194000	and you're here to, and I was like,
2194000	2197000	that was, like, it's just like a really nice thing,
2197000	2199000	it was a very humble type of move, because, you know,
2199000	2202000	I think a lot of, there's a lot of awareness around Square Enix
2202000	2206000	about how bad the first version of Final Fantasy XIV bombed.
2206000	2207000	But that was, like, so long ago.
2207000	2209000	And that's where my head's at, is I'm like,
2209000	2211000	that was so long ago at this point, like,
2211000	2214000	forgiven, forgotten, because the game is, like, way better now.
2214000	2215000	Wasn't it, like, 2014?
2215000	2218000	Before that, like, I, no, maybe you're right,
2218000	2219000	maybe it was 2014.
2219000	2222000	I mean, we're on our, let's see, Shadowbringers is 29th,
2222000	2224000	no, Shadowbringers is 2019,
2224000	2227000	uh, Stormblood was 2017, Heavensward 15,
2227000	2229000	so Realm Reborn was 2013.
2229000	2231000	So the original Final Fantasy XIV was around 2011,
2231000	2233000	I think, when that first came out.
2233000	2235000	So, um, so, yeah.
2235000	2237000	I think we could just give them a break now,
2237000	2239000	considering it's like, you know,
2239000	2241000	look at how some of these other games have launched.
2241000	2242000	I think you have a pass.
2242000	2243000	Yeah, yeah, I think they have a pass.
2243000	2245000	And right now, I mean, I don't know, like,
2245000	2248000	you gotta read everything on Reddit with a grain of salt,
2248000	2251000	but I do look at the Final Fantasy XIV Reddit once in a while,
2251000	2253000	and there's a lot of people that are posting, like,
2253000	2256000	hi, I'm really pissed off at Blizzard right now,
2256000	2258000	so I'm coming over to Final Fantasy XIV from WoW,
2258000	2260000	and oh my god, I love this game,
2260000	2262000	I've been sleeping on it so long, and all this stuff.
2262000	2265000	And to be fair, I mean, I'm not trying to, like, bash World of Warcraft,
2265000	2267000	because here I am, where I'm like,
2267000	2269000	I've been playing XIV for so long, like, I just,
2269000	2271000	I need to see other people for a little bit,
2271000	2274000	so I'm like, I remember this game I used to flirt with,
2274000	2276000	so I went back to World of Warcraft,
2276000	2279000	and since I haven't played it seriously in so long,
2279000	2282000	I'm like, I'm kind of, I'm kind of into this right now,
2282000	2285000	like, this is, this is something I haven't seen in a long time,
2285000	2288000	you know, and yeah, so I feel like,
2288000	2290000	I don't want to say I'm on the opposite side of the fence,
2290000	2294000	because I truly, truly appreciate what both games bring to the table.
2294000	2298000	But to bring it back to something you said earlier in the show,
2298000	2301000	in the beginning, about, like, articles that fill this time of year,
2301000	2302000	and all the clickbait stuff,
2302000	2307000	a lot of, like, what is happening at Blizzard type of articles going up.
2307000	2310000	Has Activision killed Blizzard?
2310000	2312000	Has Activision hurt Blizzard?
2312000	2314000	And, like, you know, outlining, like, all of the weird things
2314000	2317000	that Blizzard has done this year, obviously Diablo Immortal,
2317000	2319000	but now this Heroes of the Storm thing we got into last week
2319000	2321000	has a lot of people feeling raw,
2321000	2323000	apparently it's already affecting the game,
2323000	2325000	you try to go in there and look for matches,
2325000	2328000	and it's taking longer and longer, because people are just like,
2328000	2331000	well, if they're done, so am I, peace out, you know, type of thing.
2331000	2335000	And then World of Warcraft, not everybody's really happy with the expansion,
2335000	2339000	I mean, I don't, maybe it's because I kind of didn't really play a lot of last one,
2339000	2341000	but I'm like, I'm into this expansion, whatever,
2341000	2344000	like, I'm not interested in raiding or endgame stuff,
2344000	2348000	but as a dirty, filthy casual, it's cool, you know what I mean?
2348000	2350000	There's a lot of people that are like,
2350000	2353000	has Activision, like, fucked Blizzard beyond repair?
2353000	2357000	And a lot of that talk going on, so it's kind of interesting, I suppose.
2357000	2362000	So, going to chat at Twitch TV and VOG Network,
2362000	2364000	Renji221 over there says,
2364000	2367000	you talk about games coming back from a bad launch,
2367000	2371000	I think No Man's Sky is another good example. Oh, absolutely.
2371000	2375000	You know, it joins a club with Diablo 3, in my opinion,
2375000	2378000	I mean, even though we talk about Diablo Immortal,
2378000	2381000	part of the reason why Blizzard wanted to take that template for Diablo 3
2381000	2384000	and make it a mobile game is because Diablo 3 was saved.
2384000	2387000	But remember, when Diablo 3 first came out, ooh,
2387000	2390000	but Final Fantasy XIV, you know, is another great example of that.
2390000	2393000	So, yeah, we do live in this really interesting era
2393000	2395000	where video games can be saved.
2395000	2398000	Some people would argue Destiny 2 is in this club as well.
2398000	2400000	Is that when Destiny 2 kind of first launched?
2400000	2403000	Yeah, there's some problems, but it's come a long way.
2403000	2408000	Yeah, but a lot of that has to do with just being non-transparent
2408000	2412000	with your users that are just changing shit and,
2412000	2416000	oh, oh, now that you discovered it, I guess we should tell you about it.
2416000	2418000	And it's like, fuck it, fuck that shit, you know?
2418000	2422000	Oh, I don't know. They're trying, I guess.
2422000	2426000	But Destiny, I've never been able to get on board with that game.
2426000	2428000	And it sounded cool, but I was like, eh.
2428000	2431000	I should probably revisit it. I mean, I do own Destiny 2.
2431000	2433000	I bought it when it first came out.
2433000	2434000	It got free, so.
2434000	2436000	Well, yeah, because they gave it away not that long ago,
2436000	2438000	so hopefully you all pick that up because that's done now.
2438000	2441000	But even if you didn't, you can still get the base game super cheap
2441000	2443000	because they really want to sell you the expansion.
2443000	2445000	They don't really want to sell you the base game anymore.
2445000	2447000	They want to make their money off the expansion.
2447000	2449000	They want to sell you the in-game currency.
2449000	2451000	And all that stuff, too. And Carlton dances, or whatever.
2451000	2455000	Anyway, also in our Twitch chat,
2455000	2458000	DJ Rama S says, Blizzard has become complacent.
2458000	2461000	Some people are arguing that a little bit, too.
2461000	2464000	Some people are saying that that's the pressure Activision is putting on them,
2464000	2466000	is that Blizzard is not putting out games fast enough.
2466000	2471000	But, I mean, the Blizzard formula has worked with them for so long.
2471000	2475000	When they do put things out, most of the time it's really, really good.
2475000	2477000	Diablo 3 was an exception.
2477000	2479000	I mean, I don't know. I don't know.
2479000	2482000	We'll have to see what the next big thing is.
2482000	2484000	I still think Blizzard does better than a lot of people.
2484000	2486000	But look at Overwatch.
2486000	2490000	Like, Overwatch is a game changer in so many ways.
2490000	2493000	And people forget, like, Blizzard also made Overwatch.
2493000	2495000	That is a game that's been out for quite some time.
2495000	2497000	People still talk about it.
2497000	2500000	It is changing the landscape of esports as we know it, right?
2500000	2504000	So you can't say that Blizzard is just doing nothing but fucking up.
2504000	2506000	There's a lot they're getting right, too.
2506000	2509000	And I think Overwatch is the best example of that in a lot of ways.
2509000	2511000	But that's just my opinion.
2511000	2513000	Which, by the way, is something else I played this week. Overwatch.
2513000	2515000	I saw so many friends of mine streaming Overwatch that I was like,
2515000	2518000	I need to get in there and play some Overwatch.
2518000	2519000	And I've been missing out.
2519000	2521000	And I haven't done any of the holiday event. Well, now I have.
2521000	2524000	But I hadn't at that point done, like, any of the holiday event.
2524000	2526000	I need to get some of the loot boxes and all that good stuff.
2526000	2532000	And I love every match right now has that new Ashe in it.
2532000	2534000	The one that Jennifer Hale voices, the cowgirl.
2534000	2537000	And just, like, every minute or so you just hear,
2537000	2540000	Baa! Because that's her ultimate.
2540000	2541000	That's what she calls Bob in.
2541000	2543000	So you just hear, like, you'll hear it from across the map.
2543000	2545000	Baa! And it sounds like...
2545000	2549000	This is obscure, but have you ever seen the YouTube clip
2549000	2553000	of, like, the husband calling contest at the state fair
2553000	2555000	where the old ladies get on stage and they're calling their husbands?
2555000	2557000	That's what it sounds like.
2557000	2559000	Somebody out there has got to know what I'm talking about.
2559000	2561000	But that's what it sounds like to me when Ashe calls Bob
2561000	2564000	from down the hallway or whatever.
2564000	2568000	Act F says, Overwatch is kind of screwing up too with some things.
2568000	2571000	I'd love for you to elaborate on that, Act F.
2571000	2574000	Bobby Blackwolf says, what can't join this club?
2574000	2579000	Mass Effect Andromeda. Wow. Way to kill my mood.
2579000	2582000	Thanks a lot for that. Jerk.
2582000	2585000	Alright, anyway. Spyro says, I played Overwatch last night.
2585000	2588000	It's pretty fun. Yeah, I'm still a fan.
2588000	2591000	Bobby Blackwolf says, I watched the holiday event.
2591000	2593000	It was a lot of Yetis falling off cliffs.
2593000	2594000	I haven't really played...
2594000	2596000	Like, there's a whole thing with Mei and Winston and all that stuff.
2596000	2598000	I haven't really got into that or played that, really.
2598000	2601000	So, yeah. I don't know.
2601000	2602000	Anyway. Alright, let's move on.
2602000	2604000	I'll try to get... If I can work it in later,
2604000	2606000	I'll get Act F's follow up on the Overwatch thoughts.
2606000	2609000	But I want to get into the news, so let's get to it.
2609000	2612000	Loki. Not a lot of news this week.
2612000	2614000	This is in a normal week. I'm gonna be honest.
2614000	2618000	In a normal week, I don't think I'd want to give this side any attention,
2618000	2620000	to be quite honest. I think it's...
2620000	2623000	We know this side is shady, right? This side is shady.
2623000	2626000	And so, now we're hearing some other shady stuff.
2626000	2633000	Yeah, so apparently G2A, who wasn't very legit to begin with.
2633000	2637000	I mean, a lot of people dealing with stolen keys
2637000	2639000	or just all sorts of thievery and stuff.
2639000	2645000	Well now, apparently they said that they are charging users for 180 days of inactivity.
2645000	2647000	So if you haven't logged into your G2A account,
2647000	2653000	for 180 days, you'll be charged one pound.
2653000	2656000	And it'll be taken from the G2A wallet.
2656000	2657000	A dollar, essentially.
2657000	2658000	Yeah, one dollar.
2658000	2660000	If you want to convert it into, you know, our money.
2660000	2662000	And apparently they said, you know,
2662000	2665000	there's gonna be an email sent three days before the charge
2665000	2668000	to remind users to log in to void the fee.
2668000	2675000	And if there's no funds in the wallet, then they won't charge anything.
2675000	2677000	That just...
2677000	2682000	It's just, it's basically their reasoning for this.
2682000	2685000	They said, it costs money to upkeep accounts.
2685000	2686000	Bullshit.
2686000	2689000	This includes server maintenance, IT infrastructure.
2689000	2691000	Come on, you guys. It's data in a fucking table.
2691000	2693000	It's bullshit.
2694000	2698000	As a supervised financial institution, we must meet many requirements
2698000	2701000	related to the monitoring service of each account.
2701000	2703000	Really? There's monitoring?
2703000	2704000	See, that's the thing.
2704000	2708000	I've heard of banks charging this kind of thing.
2708000	2711000	Like, if you don't have enough money and savings,
2711000	2714000	or checking, or you're not having enough deposited,
2714000	2717000	that's when they charge you like that monthly service fee or whatever, right?
2717000	2719000	But that's a bank.
2719000	2722000	That's not some shady website that's stolen you,
2722000	2727000	or allegedly stolen you keys from other places or whatever,
2727000	2730000	and turning around and reselling them and that sort of thing.
2730000	2732000	It's not a bank.
2732000	2734000	It's a very different type of thing.
2734000	2736000	Just don't do business with them.
2736000	2738000	Just make it easy.
2738000	2740000	Shitty company is still shitty.
2740000	2744000	I was gonna ask, how would you feel if somebody like Steam
2744000	2747000	enacted a rule like this, but they're not gonna.
2747000	2750000	That won't be a problem, because I'm always logged into Steam.
2750000	2754000	I can't think of anybody that would have to charge me that.
2758000	2761000	Yeah, I know. I still try to log into Steam once a week
2761000	2764000	to just maintain my trading card eligibility.
2764000	2767000	I couldn't tell you the last time I've had a pack of trading cards drop.
2767000	2769000	Do people even still do the trading card thing on Steam anymore?
2769000	2770000	I got a pack.
2770000	2772000	It was in my box.
2772000	2775000	I just sold off a bunch of the cards that you get
2775000	2777000	doing your Game of the Year awards or whatever.
2777000	2778000	Three cents!
2778000	2780000	You vote. Yeah, so you get that.
2780000	2781000	Woo! Three cents!
2781000	2784000	So yeah, I've been getting a ton of email notifications
2784000	2786000	because I've been selling cards.
2786000	2788000	Because I'm like, I don't give a shit about these cards.
2788000	2790000	I'm not doing anything with them.
2790000	2792000	I'm just gonna sell them because people are dumb enough to buy them.
2792000	2794000	And so, you know, I like a dollar.
2794000	2797000	RunJumpStomp in their chat over at VOG Network on Twitch says,
2797000	2799000	How is this legal?
2799000	2803000	When I first read it, I was like, wait a minute, isn't that illegal?
2803000	2805000	But I'm thinking of the gift card thing.
2805000	2807000	So I don't know if this is true in every state,
2807000	2814000	but like, gift cards in California cannot decrease in value if they're inactive.
2814000	2815000	And they can't expire.
2815000	2817000	And they can't expire or anything like that.
2817000	2821000	The only way you can get screwed on those is if the company goes under.
2821000	2823000	Like if you have a Kohl's card or something.
2823000	2824000	Borders.
2824000	2826000	RadioShack. You have a RadioShack gift card?
2826000	2827000	Twice or us!
2827000	2829000	You're fucked at this point. There's nothing you can do.
2829000	2832000	You can try and take it to the bankruptcy quarters, honestly.
2832000	2836000	Like usually there's a period of time that you can use it with the liquidator,
2836000	2837000	and then that's it. It's done.
2837000	2841000	So that's really the only way you can kind of get screwed out of those gift cards
2841000	2842000	that the company goes under.
2842000	2848000	But otherwise, like if you find a Best Buy gift card in your couch from like 2004,
2848000	2852000	and it's got 15 bucks on it, Best Buy has to honor it.
2852000	2854000	So that's, at least in California.
2854000	2856000	I don't know about other states and all their laws.
2856000	2857000	I know there's other states that have similar laws.
2857000	2860000	But unfortunately, this isn't exactly a gift card, I guess.
2860000	2865000	And G2A, I'm sure, can't even be based in the states as it is, hence why it's one euro.
2865000	2870000	We all know it's a little bit shady, because they're probably not running in the US.
2870000	2874000	They're probably running in a more friendly country to some of the things they do.
2874000	2875000	Yeah.
2875000	2878000	But yeah, so sadly that law wouldn't apply over there,
2878000	2881000	and you're kind of dealing with international issues anyway.
2881000	2882000	Yeah.
2882000	2884000	Also, then Run Jump Stop says,
2884000	2887000	I don't get how companies can change the terms of service after the fact.
2887000	2889000	Unfortunately, they do it all the time.
2889000	2891000	It's in their terms of service that they can change the terms of service.
2891000	2894000	It is that, but sometimes you launch Steam.
2894000	2898000	Just watch, next time you launch Steam, after a couple weeks, it might say,
2898000	2902000	you need to accept our newest update before we can get into it,
2902000	2904000	and you have to scroll through and agree again.
2904000	2908000	And a lot of games with persistent online worlds and things like that will do that.
2908000	2913000	Some of them will be nice and tell you in very plain words.
2913000	2915000	Here's what we changed.
2915000	2917000	I want to say Discord.
2917000	2918000	I talk good about them a lot.
2918000	2920000	They do something like this.
2920000	2922000	Because they phrase it in a funny way, like,
2922000	2926000	here, for a normal human being, here is what we have changed in the thing,
2926000	2929000	and then you get the full legal language underneath it.
2929000	2930000	You know what I mean?
2930000	2934000	But companies, I guess, don't always do that kind of thing.
2934000	2938000	So, you know, technically, when you scroll down and agree,
2938000	2940000	technically, technically you're accepting it.
2940000	2944000	But I've still seen class action lawsuits and all that stuff happen anyway.
2944000	2945000	Yeah.
2945000	2947000	Like when PlayStation had a class action lawsuit,
2947000	2949000	even though I believe it is in their terms of service,
2949000	2951000	you agreed to arbitrate or something like that.
2951000	2954000	Like, it doesn't stop a lot of that stuff from happening.
2954000	2955000	Yeah.
2955000	2957000	If a lawyer wants to take the case, they'll try it.
2957000	2959000	So, let's see.
2959000	2961000	Going to chat for some more comments.
2961000	2963000	Bobby Blackwell says it needs to get up to the courts,
2963000	2967000	and unfortunately nobody has the money to keep fighting all the way up to the Supreme Court.
2967000	2971000	The Supreme Court has never heard a case involving a software terms of service.
2971000	2972000	Very interesting.
2972000	2973000	I guess that's true.
2973000	2976000	The last big Supreme Court case I can think of involving games,
2976000	2977000	I'm sure there's been others.
2977000	2981000	The one that comes to mind is the one here in California where it was Schwarzenegger,
2981000	2984000	the governor at the time, versus, I forget the name,
2984000	2987000	but it was that whole thing about the mature games being sold at GameStop.
2987000	2988000	Right.
2988000	2990000	They had to check the ID, and the Supreme Court struck it down
2990000	2996000	because there was no consistent measure about what made a mature game, basically.
2996000	2999000	It was turning into a matter of opinion.
2999000	3000000	Are nipples being shown? Yes.
3000000	3001000	Mature game.
3001000	3002000	Yeah, exactly.
3002000	3007000	And it brings that whole thing into who's to say what's mature for you versus what's mature for me.
3007000	3011000	Like, some people might allow their kids to hear the F word and the S word,
3011000	3014000	but would never want them to see a boob.
3014000	3016000	But some of it is complete vice versa.
3016000	3020000	Like, a boob's a boob, but I don't want you using the F word.
3020000	3022000	And that's really up to a parent to decide.
3022000	3025000	Run Jump Stomp says that Mario has nipples.
3025000	3026000	Yes.
3026000	3028000	And he is very mature.
3028000	3030000	Mamma mia.
3030000	3032000	Alright, anyway.
3032000	3035000	So, yeah.
3035000	3037000	I won't be using G2A anytime soon.
3037000	3041000	I hope this is the type of thing that just kind of stays with them
3041000	3043000	and their weird kind of business practices.
3043000	3048000	But, yeah, I'm not going to be exactly going over there to use their services anytime soon.
3048000	3052000	And I imagine you guys probably won't either, so let's move on to our next story
3052000	3056000	that has to do with Microsoft and their All Access offer.
3056000	3062000	The All Access offer was the subsidized Xbox One bundle that was available at certain Microsoft stores.
3062000	3065000	Of course we don't have any nearby, unfortunately.
3065000	3068000	No. Well, I mean, there's one in the Bay Area, which I've been to a few times.
3068000	3070000	It looked kind of cool. I wanted to...
3070000	3072000	They're nice stores.
3072000	3075000	I haven't been in the one, but I did want to actually...
3075000	3077000	You know what's funny about those stores, though?
3077000	3079000	I swear to God, the last time I was in the one in San Francisco
3079000	3083000	was in that super nice mall, like, Kitty Corner from the Metreon.
3083000	3084000	Yeah.
3084000	3085000	It's where the movie theater is. It's in there.
3085000	3086000	It's on the third floor.
3086000	3090000	The last time I was in there, I swear to God, every computer, everything, it was Fortnite.
3090000	3092000	Everybody was playing fucking Fortnite.
3092000	3093000	What?
3093000	3094000	On the Xboxes, on the laptops.
3094000	3095000	Fortnite?
3095000	3096000	Fortnite, Fortnite, Fortnite.
3096000	3097000	They were probably playing each other.
3097000	3099000	No Forza, no Minecraft?
3099000	3104000	Well, they would have a computer up front that was running Forza that nobody was playing,
3104000	3106000	which is a crime because Forza's great.
3106000	3107000	Yeah.
3107000	3108000	But, yeah, no, Fortnite, Fortnite, Fortnite.
3108000	3110000	That's all they were demoing on all those computers.
3110000	3112000	But anyway, I do...
3112000	3116000	The Microsoft store, obviously, there's a lot in common with the Apple store, a little
3116000	3117000	competition head to head there.
3117000	3121000	It's very well lit, very, you know, lots of people.
3121000	3122000	It's the hangout.
3122000	3123000	Everyone goes to the hangout there.
3123000	3124000	It is.
3124000	3128000	But anyway, so you could get this all access deal at these stores.
3128000	3133000	You would be in a two year agreement and you could get an Xbox One or an Xbox One X for
3133000	3135000	kind of like a lower or cheaper price.
3135000	3139000	And then you get Xbox Live Gold and the Game Pass.
3139000	3145000	And that's a big deal because the Game Pass is the like Netflix of Xbox games, basically,
3145000	3149000	which, you know, is one of those things that I think is just going to get bigger and bigger
3149000	3150000	as we move into 2019.
3150000	3151000	It's a great service.
3151000	3152000	And 2020.
3152000	3153000	I mean, it is.
3153000	3154000	And I'm really curious.
3154000	3161000	I really suspect when we start talking about PlayStation 5 and Nintendo, I feel like they
3161000	3163000	won't get on the bandwagon until later.
3163000	3168000	They're like kind of with the Switch online, the classic libraries, like you tried that
3168000	3169000	whole type of thing.
3169000	3172000	But I would be very curious to see what Sony is going to do to respond to this, like with
3172000	3175000	PlayStation 5, because I think it's gonna be something that's built into PlayStation
3175000	3176000	5.
3176000	3177000	Yeah.
3177000	3178000	Like I looked at the classic library.
3178000	3183000	In fact, I was going through there and it's like, here's the new games.
3183000	3186000	I'm like, yeah, that's nice, I guess.
3186000	3187000	Yeah.
3187000	3192000	So anyway, the point is, Microsoft is ending this program on December 31st, 2018.
3192000	3196000	So the all access bundle will be seized at the Microsoft retail location.
3196000	3198000	So you still have a little bit of time for this.
3198000	3203000	But what's interesting about this, Microsoft isn't saying that this is going away forever.
3203000	3207000	It's just going away for now, because this whole thing was a test to see if this whole
3207000	3209000	thing was going to be viable in the first place.
3209000	3212000	So, but they're already kind of hinting it's coming back.
3212000	3214000	So I would assume, yes, it's viable.
3214000	3217000	You seem to offer it more places other than the Microsoft store.
3217000	3218000	Well, there's that.
3218000	3223000	And I wonder if Microsoft isn't going to let it go to sleep and hibernate for a little
3223000	3225000	while and then bring it back.
3225000	3227000	When, Loki, when did they bring it back?
3227000	3232000	E3, because the floor is virtually theirs and theirs alone at E3 this next year.
3232000	3235000	So they could unveil the new pass.
3235000	3239000	And wouldn't it be great if they had a diskless console or something?
3239000	3245000	I'm fan wanking here, but wouldn't it be something if Microsoft had some type of new console
3245000	3246000	to go with this whole thing?
3246000	3247000	You know what I mean?
3247000	3248000	Yeah.
3248000	3249000	Yeah.
3249000	3250000	Diskless console.
3250000	3251000	We'll see.
3251000	3252000	We'll see.
3252000	3253000	Or their new console.
3253000	3254000	Maybe they're going to do something with that.
3254000	3255000	I don't know.
3255000	3259000	And this whole thing, because I think Microsoft really wants to push this game pass thing,
3259000	3260000	but I don't know.
3260000	3261000	I mean, we'll see.
3261000	3264000	I think E3 would be really the time to see about that.
3264000	3270000	So anyway, I mean, it was a contract plan, but it wasn't like, it wasn't shady.
3270000	3275000	Like I do think overall it was a decent deal if it's what you wanted, if it worked for you.
3275000	3277000	I mean, yeah, I think, you know, it's a decent deal.
3277000	3282000	Looking in chat over at VOG Network on Twitch TV, Runchum Stomp suggests that Nintendo will
3282000	3284000	do it sometime in 2030.
3284000	3285000	Yes.
3285000	3289000	Maybe for the Switch 2, Switch U or whatever they end up doing next.
3289000	3293000	I gotta tell you, like, their stuff, that is the hardest thing about Nintendo consoles
3293000	3298000	is their stuff does not depreciate in value, according to them.
3298000	3303000	They don't drop the prices of anything because like, Mario Kart 7, I remember purchasing
3303000	3305000	that when that first came out.
3305000	3306000	It's still full price.
3306000	3312000	You know, Wii U games in particular are now getting more expensive because Nintendo is
3312000	3317000	essentially like, just put them all on a boat, set it out to sea and set the boat on fire,
3317000	3318000	metaphorically.
3318000	3321000	Nintendo is like, has cut ties with the U at this point.
3321000	3325000	So it's kind of driving the Wii U game prices up at this point, because now it's like they're
3325000	3329000	collector's items, because how many people really ever had the Wii U and the Wii U?
3329000	3331000	It's interesting how that's all playing out.
3331000	3335000	Because I was looking at some of the, like, I'll see the eBay ads come up online.
3335000	3338000	I'm like, why are these games selling for like $60, $65?
3338000	3340000	Oh, because Nintendo isn't making them anymore.
3340000	3343000	So if you want to get them, this is like the only way to do it.
3343000	3344000	It's ridiculous.
3344000	3345000	A little bit, a little bit.
3345000	3350000	But, you know, a lot of rare game consoles, this kind of thing tends to happen, right?
3350000	3354000	We can go all the way back to like the Sega Saturn, the Dreamcast.
3354000	3360000	I mean, heck, probably a black band Final Fantasy 7 or Suikoden 1 or 2.
3360000	3364000	Those still go for, Suikoden 2 I think still goes for a lot of money, doesn't it?
3364000	3369000	So, I mean, less than it did before it came out on the PlayStation Classics.
3369000	3373000	But I think as a collectible, those things still make a lot of money, if I'm not sure.
3373000	3374000	If I'm not mistaken.
3374000	3380000	So, Bobby says, if I didn't have a bandwidth cap, I'd be all over Xbox Game Pass.
3380000	3384000	Yeah, I mean, that is something they may have to address, maybe cut a deal with the cable providers.
3384000	3387000	I think the bandwidth caps are going to have to start to give a little bit,
3387000	3390000	as more and more people really start to push back against the cable providers.
3390000	3396000	I think just as we get more 4K streaming, I think market demand is going to force those caps up.
3396000	3398000	I do think that'll have to happen.
3398000	3404000	They'll just put laws in place that'll eliminate bandwidth caps and then they'll still throttle instead.
3404000	3409000	Well, I don't think they can now because like certain states kind of danced around the net neutrality thing
3409000	3416000	and like California passed a stronger thing and it's going to be interesting now that the house is going back to blue.
3416000	3420000	I don't know politically if that can be countered now at this point or what the deal is going to happen.
3420000	3422000	It's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.
3422000	3430000	I don't know. I'm not going to get into politics that much, but it will be interesting to see how the net neutrality thing keeps going.
3430000	3435000	Yeah, and a few folks in chat talking about the net neutrality thing, but remember now states,
3435000	3439000	because California is like, oh, hell no to what, you know, the FCC did and all this.
3439000	3441000	So now there's going to be that fight.
3441000	3446000	And y'all know this being the good old U.S. S.A., it ain't going to be solved overnight.
3446000	3450000	There's going to be a new president no matter which team it is.
3450000	3452000	There's going to be a new president before this thing is solved.
3452000	3454000	You know what I mean? Yeah, it's going to go on for years.
3454000	3469000	So we'll see. I, I really feel like what's ultimately going to happen is probably like some other FCC guys going to come in there and strike the whole thing before the legal courts and all this like ends up ultimately figuring it out because that's that's the way things tend to run in my opinion.
3470000	3473000	So anyway, let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.
3473000	3479000	So there's this indie game Celeste that's actually been selling very well. They've sold 500,000 copies.
3479000	3485000	It's been, I think it got like Indie Game of the Year or something like that during the game awards.
3485000	3488000	Yeah, game awards got some good stuff. I have friends that really love that game.
3489000	3500000	But anyways, what with that, though, Matt Torsen, the creator of the game, basically said, you know, hey, we're working on some farewell levels that are going to be ready in 2019.
3500000	3506000	They're very hard and we'll be announcing what's going to be next for us in the years as well.
3506000	3516000	Also with that, they're saying that they're the soundtrack has sold 6000 copies across all platforms, been streamed on Spotify four million times.
3516000	3519000	And I didn't even know it was on Spotify.
3519000	3523000	Yeah. And if you haven't picked up a copy of Celeste yet, well, guess what?
3523000	3530000	If you happen to have Xbox Live Gold, then you're going to be getting that as one of your free games with gold in January.
3530000	3535000	So it's going to be Celeste for the month of January for Xbox One.
3535000	3540000	And then for the the 16th through February 15th will be WRC.
3541000	3546000	And then on Xbox 360, you're getting Lara Croft, Guardian of Light and Far Cry 2.
3546000	3548000	Those are some good picks, too.
3548000	3549000	Yeah.
3549000	3552000	Guardian of Light. It's a little bit old at this point, but that was a good game.
3552000	3554000	That was a good co-op puzzler thing.
3554000	3561000	But yeah, I'm now and now I'm from a from a consumer standpoint, I'm kind of happy I slept on Celeste now that I get the free copy on Xbox.
3561000	3565000	But I know I know the developer doesn't make as much money when you do it that way.
3565000	3567000	But they have sold a half a million copies.
3567000	3569000	You know, it's Celeste is on like a million different platforms.
3569000	3571000	If I like it that much, I'll probably end up double dipping.
3571000	3574000	It'll probably come out on Sony's platforms as well.
3574000	3577000	So I thought Celeste already was on Sony's platform as a game.
3577000	3579000	Oh, no, not as a free game.
3579000	3582000	No, I think, you know, usually when it's free and one, it becomes free on the other eventually.
3582000	3584000	Yeah, you're right. You're right. That's that's very true.
3584000	3586000	So, yeah, I need to check out Celeste.
3586000	3589000	It's one of those games that's like supposed to be like bang your head on the wall hard, but it's a lot of fun.
3589000	3592000	So, yeah, I need to it's just one of those games.
3592000	3597000	There's only so many hours in the day to play games, especially when it's not the job you get paid to do all day long.
3597000	3600000	So, yeah, I got to have to pick that up at some point.
3600000	3606000	So anyhow, and some folks in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network absolutely agree.
3606000	3613000	And Run Jump Stomp says, if these are very hard, I wonder how you would classify the other levels as far as difficulty goes.
3613000	3617000	Ain't that the truth? Because my understanding is the game is kind of hard to begin with anyway.
3617000	3622000	So anyhow, let's move on and talk about another thing that's been circulating the blogs.
3622000	3627000	And that is this whole update to Spider-Man on the PlayStation 4, which is a game a lot of people are enjoying.
3627000	3630000	And people were saying, hey, what are we going to get?
3630000	3636000	What are we going to get the Spider-Man suit from the Tobey Maguire starred movies with Sam Raimi, if you will, movies from what?
3636000	3644000	What was the first one of those, like 2002, 2003, when the old trilogy started somewhere in the aughts, the early aughts somewhere when that series started.
3644000	3657000	And people really wanted that Spider-Man suit to the extent that they were like doing social media campaigns and Reddit posts and all this crap online to like,
3657000	3665000	I don't want to say bully Insomniac Games into doing it, but it kind of was like, I mean, like back off. Jesus. You know what I mean?
3665000	3667000	Well, it's like we've given you all the other suits.
3667000	3672000	I know. Well, first off, the game is pretty fucking good. Isn't that the most important thing?
3672000	3680000	Like, do you really like, I can't believe a bunch of mostly boys are complaining about dress up online.
3680000	3687000	I mean, really? Jesus. Anyway, but the Sam Raimi suit, it did end up coming out.
3687000	3692000	Now, before we, because I'm sure I'm not looking at chat at the moment, but I'm sure it's going to light up with this before then.
3692000	3702000	I don't see this as them giving in to demands because to get an agreement like this takes time and agreements and paper and somebody had to design that suit for the game.
3702000	3711000	So this was a weeks, if not months long process that was probably on some original design document a long time ago about post launch follow up thing.
3711000	3714000	Like this was in the works for a long time.
3714000	3723000	But unfortunately now people have the perception of, yay, we won. We complained, we bitched, we cyber bullied and we got what we wanted.
3723000	3729000	We changed Mass Effect's ending and then we changed, we added a suit to Spider-Man.
3729000	3741000	So it's kind of unfortunate that there is the perception that this type of behavior works because Loki, I don't understand, why do, and it is kind of an issue with gamers.
3741000	3744000	I mean, I don't know, do film buffs do this too? I don't know.
3744000	3746000	I don't even know why it matters.
3746000	3752000	It's an issue with gamers that they bitch and bitch and bitch because games have DLC and because games can be changed after the fact.
3752000	3754000	To be honest with this game, I don't even know why.
3754000	3756000	Why is it gamer culture that fucking does this?
3756000	3762000	Because they have the comic book suit in there that's pretty awesome because it's all done in like the comic book print style and everything.
3762000	3768000	And it looks like, you know, it makes everything kind of like hyper real because it's so, you know, comic book-y.
3768000	3773000	But I don't know. I don't know why people are bitching about the one specific suit.
3773000	3778000	If you showed me like a bunch of Spider-Man suits, I wouldn't be able to point out which one is the Sam Raimi suit.
3778000	3781000	So maybe I'm not the, I am not the target demographic.
3781000	3785000	I still haven't played the game and it looks awesome, but I haven't played it.
3785000	3791000	Yeah, and I'm with you there. Like, am I really going to figure out the subtleties of the Spider-Man suit and all that stuff?
3791000	3792000	Probably not. I don't know.
3792000	3800000	It could be worse. It could be like the, you know, Joel Schumacher Spider-Man suit where giant nipples are on it instead, you know, but...
3800000	3809000	Uh, TigerKalonChat says, yeah, Sonic fans are complaining about the silhouette of that Sonic the Hedgehog movie poster and want Paramount to fix the design.
3809000	3810000	Yeah, but it's...
3810000	3811000	That's a little different.
3811000	3812000	It's a...
3812000	3815000	Here's why. Here's why it's different. Here's why it's different.
3815000	3826000	Because it's not a game. It's, it's a game's representation in film when games do not have the best track record of moving to film.
3826000	3832000	Some have been okay, like the original Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider's done alright, you know, both the Angelina Jolie movie one.
3832000	3836000	I think, like, the Pokemon Detective Pikachu looks awesome.
3836000	3844000	Yeah, I mean, I love Silent Hill, but Resident Evil, I mean, was a huge, I mean, even though the game's influence is not, I mean, what?
3844000	3845000	It's a garbage movie.
3845000	3847000	But it's, it's a popcorn movie.
3847000	3848000	It's a fun popcorn movie.
3848000	3851000	A lot of gore fans really like that type of stuff. It's a scary movie. People love that stuff.
3851000	3857000	I think I saw one, I didn't really watch any of those movies. I saw one in the middle. I don't even remember which one it is. It literally didn't matter, but...
3857000	3865000	Like, it was just entertaining. It was stupid. I knew nothing. I mean, it's like, there's all these, okay, I see the tie, oh, and there's Wesker, okay, cool.
3865000	3869000	It's just, it's just group of humans that get picked off one by one in hideous ways.
3869000	3873000	And somehow we're the Matrix now. I don't know.
3874000	3875000	It's weird.
3875000	3881000	But, I mean, but there's a lot of, okay, but we know there's a lot of bad movies, too, right? Like, I got two words for you.
3881000	3885000	Uwe Boll. Okay? Remember that guy's name? Right?
3885000	3887000	Or even more recent, Rampage.
3889000	3898000	That was a choice. But, anyway, with that whole thing, so what my point is, we don't often see games represented very well in film.
3898000	3908000	So now it's like you're taking this fucking icon. Sonic the Hedgehog is a icon, not just of video gaming, but, like, of our youth, especially in your 30s and 40s.
3908000	3912000	Heck, even your 20s, you still know who Sonic is? That was a character that's always been around.
3912000	3914000	Think about the Mario Brothers movie.
3914000	3919000	Well, think about how that turned out. Imagine that now.
3919000	3927000	I mean, that is just like, what the fuck is that? Where did you get that from this?
3927000	3931000	I mean, I don't understand that, but in the Sonic thing, it's like...
3934000	3945000	So it's different, and I'm never for, like, bullying or, you know, telling people to hurt themselves or horrible things about them and their families like that.
3945000	3953000	That type of behavior on social media is garbage. I know none of you engage in that, but if you're even thinking about it, don't.
3953000	3962000	But I'm all for sass. Just a little sass, right? Just a little constructive sass, a little tongue-in-cheek sass is fine.
3962000	3975000	And so when I do see some of these, like that poster of Sonic's legs up in the air on the Golden Gate Bridge, that whole thing, like, that needs to be sassed.
3975000	3979000	You know what I mean? Like, it looks weird. So...
3979000	3986000	It's just like, I don't know. They're complaining in chat, but also they're saying Double Dragon is the movie that gives nightmares to neighbors.
3986000	3994000	See, you have to understand, that point in the 90s when they were making, or even like I should say, the 80s, it was just like, everything is judge dread.
3994000	4001000	All of the movies that come out, they're all like this post-apocalyptic future movie. Like, that's why Mario Brothers is like that.
4001000	4010000	It's like, it's fucking judge dread. You know, even Double Dragon is post-apocalyptic. It's... I don't know. None of them, they were so...
4010000	4018000	They just wanted an excuse to make this type of movie, and so they got a property that they can kind of sort of pull in that direction, and that was it.
4018000	4026000	AJ Twist at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says, I had high hopes for Sonic after the Detective Pikachu trailer, then the poster happened.
4026000	4033000	Yeah, that Detective Pikachu trailer, that caught me off guard in a different way. Like, I was not ready to see, like, a real Jigglypuff or that whole thing.
4033000	4043000	But I'm curious. Like, that one, I'm not gonna sass that. I'm curious. I still wish it was Danny DeVito, but I gotta let it go. I'm curious about that movie for sure.
4043000	4050000	And Tigerclaw says, I hope the movie embraces the absurdity of Sonic being in the real world.
4050000	4060000	You know what? If the movie is self-aware, if it's like the Twitter account, and it's tongue-in-cheek, and like Renji221 points out, Jim Carrey is playing Eggman.
4060000	4063000	I am gonna go see it day one, just because of that.
4063000	4070000	If they let Jim Carrey be Jim Carrey, then maybe it'll be like Showgirls funny. You know what I mean?
4070000	4073000	So bad it's kind of a John Waters film.
4073000	4075000	A John Waters Sonic movie.
4076000	4080000	Things I never knew I needed. Oh my god. That would be the best.
4080000	4082000	That would be so fucking weird.
4082000	4088000	Oh, man. Anyway, if you don't know who John Waters is, like, just cinematic trash masterpiece.
4088000	4096000	His most mainline thing was Hairspray. Like, the original one in the 80s with Divine, not after they made it a musical.
4096000	4101000	And we're not gonna talk about John Travolta. That was hideous. But the musical is still pretty good.
4101000	4105000	And I think they did a live one on NBC or one of those networks a couple years ago, and it was alright, too.
4105000	4112000	So, anyway. Yeah. And some folks in chat are saying, I'll wait for a trailer for Sonic.
4112000	4118000	And I'm, we'll wait, but you gotta sass those posters just a little bit, I think. Just a little bit.
4118000	4122000	Alright, anyway, let's do a couple more stories, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.
4122000	4127000	So, unfortunately, with some of these older systems, they're just not getting updates anymore.
4127000	4132000	I know Grand Theft Auto 5 was doing that with the Xbox 360 as three versions.
4132000	4139000	Now, the same thing's gonna happen to Minecraft. Unfortunately, Minecraft on PlayStation 3, Vita, and Wii U are getting their final updates.
4139000	4149000	I didn't see Xbox 360 mentioned there, so I don't know if they quit that earlier or if they're still gonna be updating the 360 version, but I know it's basically the same thing.
4149000	4157000	So, the final console update, apparently, is coming and says, well, actually, it's already out.
4157000	4164000	So, they updated that on December 19th, and it's adding a Nightmare Before Christmas mashup pack.
4164000	4169000	And that's it. You're done. You wanna play Minecraft now? You can go play the Java.
4169000	4171000	But now you can beat Jack Skellington. Yay.
4171000	4178000	You can play it on Windows 10. Honestly, though, if you really wanna keep up with current stuff, Windows 10 and the Java versions aren't bad.
4178000	4181000	Like, surprised how good it is. No 4K pack, though.
4181000	4183000	Tons of people playing it on Switch, too.
4183000	4184000	Switch 2, yeah.
4184000	4189000	Obviously, with the portability and just the success that the Switch has been, it's a huge console for Minecraft, for sure.
4189000	4190000	Yeah.
4190000	4196000	So, yeah, I mean, how many people... I mean, well, I'm sure there's, like, kids and, you know, not every home can upgrade.
4196000	4200000	Not everybody's in this, you know, financial place where they can just willy-nilly upgrade.
4200000	4204000	And you don't really need to, though. I mean, it's nice to have the new stuff, but, like, it's also...
4204000	4211000	I mean, I remember playing Minecraft 1. They didn't have all the new stuff in there, and it was just fine the way it was.
4211000	4212000	Yeah.
4212000	4215000	I wanna go back and play it. It gets so boring.
4215000	4216000	Yeah.
4216000	4222000	Because there's nothing really to do in the game. I mean, you can survive and stuff, but then it just, like, it gets boring.
4222000	4229000	I still wanna do the VoG network server, but then we got sidetracked with this whole move to Twitch and my knack of getting sucked into MMOs.
4229000	4236000	And it wasn't just the OLR move to Twitch, but I think we just started, like, streaming more on Twitch in general, and it was kind of like that thing kind of...
4236000	4241000	And then you got your machine, and that whole Minecraft thing fell on the back burner. But maybe that's a 2019 thing we need to bring back.
4241000	4248000	You know what? We'll do a VoG Minecraft when Microsoft puts out the frickin' 4K pack. Finally.
4248000	4251000	That'll give me a reason to go back and check it out, that's for sure.
4251000	4263000	Or even just, like, with mods now, like, I finally figured out how to do Forge, Minecraft Forge, which is their modded client that you can use for the Java version.
4263000	4274000	It makes, like, loading mods with, like, visual changes easier. I just, setting up the servers and stuff and keeping that stuff running was really hard. That's all.
4274000	4281000	Runjan Stomp in chat points out, I'd love it if they brought modded stuff to consoles. Well, that would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?
4281000	4282000	But then they can't sell it.
4282000	4290000	No, they can, and they are. So they are doing, like, mods, sort of, with the console versions. You can buy these different updates.
4290000	4303000	But it's not changing much within, like, the console space. It's not like, you know, adding, like, guns. I mean, you can sort of do that, but it's very basic, is what I'm trying to say.
4303000	4315000	But if you go in any of the modern Minecraft versions, they have a storefront where you buy skins that people make, or you can buy mods to the game that changes, like, just how stuff sort of behaves.
4315000	4327000	And you can even create your own, but it's not as robust as, like, what you can do on the PC where you can just kind of keep adding shit to it and you can put Pokémon in there and all this crazy shit.
4327000	4334000	Yeah. It's more of like, oh, I can change the creeper to, you know, look like this, and now it acts like this, you know, give a different AI behavior.
4334000	4340000	You think they'll ever do a Minecraft 2, or you think they're just gonna stick on the original forever and ever and ever?
4340000	4342000	Yeah, I think they'll eventually update it. It's money.
4342000	4344000	It's money. It is money.
4344000	4350000	Alright, speaking of money, there's one game that's making a lot of it, that's for sure. It's Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. I mean, duh, right?
4350000	4358000	Like, I'm about to tell you the Super Smash Brothers broke sales record. It's, like, most obvious news story of the year, I'm sure, but let's talk about it anyway.
4358000	4363000	Three million units in eleven days. That's a big deal.
4363000	4364000	That's pretty good.
4364000	4370000	Like, I remember back in the day when, like, a million sold was, like, a runaway, like, hit.
4370000	4378000	Now, granted, a game like, I think, like Wii Sports, but I don't know how you count that, because that was bundled in with the Wii, but even something like Tetris,
4378000	4384000	I think those games sold, like, forty million. Like, it's up and up, but still, eleven days, three million, that's a really good start.
4384000	4389000	In fact, it makes it the fastest selling Switch game so far.
4389000	4399000	And, of course, Nintendo put out a press release to brag about this whole thing, that the Switch sold 8.7 million consoles between the launch in March 2017 and November 2018.
4399000	4403000	So, it is now the fastest selling console of the generation. That's what Nintendo's saying.
4403000	4408000	And they're also saying Nintendo is the top selling publisher of fiscal 2018.
4408000	4415000	Digital eShop sales are up 105% in 2017 over 2018. And, yeah, lots of good statistics, too.
4415000	4418000	Pokemon Let's Go, also a million seller.
4418000	4421000	Super Mario Party, also a million seller.
4421000	4425000	So, they're doing pretty well over there at the Switch.
4425000	4431000	But I don't think that news really surprises anybody, but it is kind of neat just to hear, like, how much that is.
4431000	4435000	That game, Super Smash, sold fast.
4435000	4440000	And do you think it's really going to be the last one they ever make?
4440000	4441000	No.
4441000	4451000	No, they got it. But I wonder if they're gonna, you know, allow the director of the game to go make new stuff, you know what I mean?
4451000	4453000	Just have someone else put...
4453000	4459000	You can't tell me that one person can only make a fighting game. I mean, just have other people do it.
4459000	4462000	I want Sakurai to do another Kid Icarus game. I want that franchise to come out.
4462000	4465000	I want him to do whatever the fuck he wants. He's earned it.
4465000	4468000	Honestly, I wish PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale would come back.
4468000	4472000	I didn't think it was that bad of a game. They didn't play it, though, so I could be wrong.
4472000	4475000	But I have it free. It's in my library somewhere.
4475000	4483000	I would love that on PlayStation 4 because I like the idea of mixing two different stages together and having them battle it out and stuff in there.
4484000	4491000	Like, really obscure stuff. You know, like, Patapon versus, like, God of War creatures or some ridiculous crap.
4491000	4493000	I think they could have made it work, but...
4495000	4502000	But Smash Brothers is so, so, so, so good. I actually played that, too, this week. I forgot to talk about it in my gaming week.
4502000	4506000	But, I mean, that's just a given. Making a little progress in the worlds and spirits and all that stuff.
4506000	4513000	So, it's just a fantastic game. It's really a must-have if you're a Switch owner unless you just know it is not your type of game.
4513000	4516000	Like, otherwise, I really can't recommend that game enough.
4516000	4521000	RunJumpStomp says Sakurai said no new Kid Icarus for, like, 25 years. Well, that's a bummer because I love that series.
4521000	4524000	Well, from him, maybe somebody else can do one. I don't know.
4524000	4529000	Well, the Kid Icarus game that he released last time, was that very good?
4529000	4537000	It was... I liked it, but it was a departure. It just didn't feel the same as the original. You know what I mean?
4537000	4540000	It wasn't, like, Kid Icarus, like...
4540000	4547000	Like, I would like something that's Kid Icarus, but, like, that 3D Metroid they made that was a remake of the second game.
4547000	4548000	But it was, like, totally different.
4548000	4549000	Oh, yeah, the 3DS?
4549000	4551000	Yeah, like, I would like that with Kid Icarus.
4551000	4555000	Like, especially if Nintendo is going to insist on the 3DS still being around.
4555000	4562000	I would like to see, like, a 2D Kid Icarus there with, like, some of the difficulty, maybe some ways to cheese it when it gets really hard.
4562000	4568000	You know, and the dungeon exploring, I really loved in Kid Icarus. The music was always fabulous.
4568000	4572000	I just love the Greek mythology, cute, you know, the way they do that.
4572000	4578000	And the Eggplant Wizard is a great character that needs to shine again, right? So, there you go.
4578000	4581000	Is he an assist trophy in the game?
4581000	4588000	I'm sure he's got to be. He's not a character, that's the sad thing, but Palutena is, and Pit and Dark Pit.
4588000	4592000	And I'm almost positive, most positive Eggplant Wizard is a spirit, if nothing else.
4592000	4595000	Because those trophy things are kind of gone, it's all the spirit stuff now.
4595000	4597000	So, I'm almost positive Eggplant Wizard is one of those.
4597000	4605000	So, anyway, I love Kid Icarus, but every week here on the show we talk about other types of classic games.
4605000	4609000	I'm pretty sure Kid Icarus has been a classic game of the week, so if not, it better be soon.
4609000	4615000	So, we're going to get into the classic game of the week and check out in the gaming vault what is the classic game that has been picked for us this week.
4615000	4617000	So, let's get into it.
4619000	4626000	And so we take a step back through space and time and this magical time machine to cover the classic game of the week.
4626000	4632000	But this week it's going to be something a little bit different, because Dark Sakura, unfortunately, she's been a little bit ill,
4632000	4639000	and she is actually on mandated voice rest right now due to laryngitis-adjacent issues without getting too much into it.
4639000	4644000	Because that's her business, but unfortunately she can't even help us out this week with the classic game of the week.
4644000	4649000	So, I thought, even though it's awesome when I fill in and get to do my picks and Loki gets to fill in and do his picks,
4649000	4655000	I thought, you know, we should try to have guests here more often, even if we have to kind of fire up Skype or get folks here in person
4655000	4659000	to do some of these picks when Dark Sakura is not available for whatever reason.
4659000	4663000	So, please welcome back to the show. I know it's been a little bit, but Alan is here.
4663000	4664000	Hello.
4664000	4665000	Hi, Alan. How are you doing?
4665000	4666000	I'm pretty good. How are you?
4666000	4668000	Good. It's been a little while since we've had you here.
4668000	4674000	I know even though we live together, which makes you a very easy guest to have on the show, we have a very close relationship.
4674000	4676000	Let's just don't know.
4676000	4680000	But you have other commitments on Sunday nights, so you can't always be here during the show.
4680000	4686000	Yes. Or when I was working, Sunday was like my Saturday, so I just wanted to be off work.
4686000	4687000	Yeah, I hear you.
4687000	4691000	Now, before we get into the Classic Game of the Week, what do you think about, since you live here,
4691000	4695000	what do you think about all that's changed with the video transition and all that stuff?
4695000	4699000	You did a really good job of hiding how messy our house is.
4701000	4707000	See, I've talked a lot on this show about radio magic, but now that, my dear, is television magic.
4707000	4712000	Yeah, know your angles, both for pictures of yourself and of your studio.
4712000	4717000	That's right. If I could mount that camera higher so it's more like, you know, camera up, chin, you know,
4717000	4720000	get rid of that double chin, I would, but I've only got so much to work with.
4720000	4726000	All right. So anyway, Alan, you're here to give us your pick for the Classic Game of the Week.
4726000	4728000	It's got to be something 10 years older or more.
4728000	4729000	Yes.
4729000	4733000	And I know you've played a lot of different stuff than Dark Soccer or even myself,
4733000	4736000	so I think you've picked something kind of a little different, right?
4736000	4738000	So what is your pick for Classic Game of the Week?
4738000	4746000	My pick for Classic Game of the Week is a PC title that came out in 2003 by Microsoft Studios,
4746000	4752000	designed by Digital Anvil, and its name is Freelancer, the universe of possibility.
4752000	4758000	Freelancer was directed by Chris Roberts of Wing Commander fame.
4758000	4765000	The game was announced by Roberts in 1999, but of course, Microsoft likes to eat up game studios.
4766000	4772000	Digital Anvil was purchased by them, which really kind of put some kinks in the development of it,
4772000	4776000	but it did come out a couple of years after it was originally intended.
4776000	4779000	Now, I assume you were a big Wing Commander fan back in the day, too.
4779000	4782000	Well, yes. I really liked the...
4782000	4785000	Well, like the first two games. I don't know. They kind of...
4785000	4790000	Once they got into the full motion video, then it was kind of like, is this really Mark Hamill? What?
4790000	4792000	And especially that movie was not great.
4792000	4794000	Which I did not see.
4794000	4797000	I mean, you should keep it that way. But the first two were great.
4797000	4801000	The problem with Wing Commander is that I just was never any good at it.
4801000	4806000	The controls were too, I don't want to say realistic, but I just had a hard time steering the ship.
4806000	4810000	And when I could steer the ship, I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with my missiles.
4810000	4813000	And it was one of those games that really did not take well to newer PCs,
4813000	4816000	because it didn't have like the slowdown built in or whatever. Like it didn't have a way to...
4816000	4818000	Oh, yeah.
4818000	4821000	I'm sure there's ways to play it now. I just haven't explored it in a long time.
4821000	4823000	I don't know if it's on one of those like, you know, old...
4823000	4827000	I imagine if you ran Wing Commander on DOSBox, you could just enter a code that says like,
4827000	4830000	suppress the CPU cycles by XML, and that would slow it down.
4830000	4833000	Anyway, sorry, it's not about Wing Commander, but same guy.
4833000	4844000	Same guy. And what he wanted to create with Freelancer is he wanted a way to play,
4844000	4850000	like have a multiplayer experience, which in 2003 was a very lofty goal,
4850000	4855000	because WoW was not out yet. And I think the real only the big MMO that was out.
4855000	4861000	And this is not an MMO. It's a single player campaign game with a multiplayer element.
4861000	4869000	The only thing really was like, you know, land party games like Command & Conquer or whatever,
4869000	4872000	or Starcraft. But then, of course, yes, EverQuest was the big MMO.
4872000	4873000	Ultima Online, probably.
4873000	4875000	Ultima Online, yeah.
4875000	4880000	So also, one thing that I noticed is that this game has some weird...
4880000	4886000	I don't want to say that BioWare or Mass Effect stole from this, but like, for example,
4886000	4890000	there are nodes like the Mass Relays where you jump to a system.
4890000	4894000	Something similar is in this game, where if you want to go from one star system to another,
4894000	4897000	you have to go to a jump point, and you go through like this thing,
4897000	4901000	and you get spit out into a different star system.
4901000	4907000	And Jennifer Hale, who is very prolific in the video game Voice Over World,
4907000	4911000	plays Junco Zane, who is basically your main...
4911000	4916000	Like, you play Trent, who's voiced by Ian Zierling, I think, from 90210.
4916000	4917000	Oh god, the 90210 guy, okay.
4917000	4921000	Yes, yeah. So he's the voice... Yeah, actually, George Takei is in it as well.
4921000	4922000	Oh my.
4922000	4927000	So yes, it does have some pretty big names in there.
4928000	4932000	So yeah, I just noticed like, oh, there are some weird sort of...
4932000	4935000	If you want to reach a little bit, Mass Effect connections.
4935000	4939000	Does it play like Wing Commander? I mean, I know it's still like a space game.
4939000	4947000	That's the thing. It was the first space sim combat game where I found it very easy to pick up,
4947000	4952000	very easy to learn how to play and be good at it very quickly.
4952000	4960000	I believe you can do a first person cockpit view, but your ship is kind of like...
4960000	4965000	Basically, you can see the thrusters of the ship. So it's like a third person.
4965000	4968000	Kind of like the camera sitting on the butt of the ship.
4968000	4975000	And you pretty much do everything. You steer and you also target the enemy spaceships with the mouse.
4975000	4979000	It's all mouse driven. Most of it is.
4979000	4985000	And you know how in games like that where you have to shoot where the ship is going to go?
4985000	4990000	So if the enemy ship is halfway across the screen, you want to shoot a little bit to the left of that
4990000	4992000	so that it will fly into your bullets?
4992000	4993000	Yeah.
4993000	4998000	The reticle that it gives you makes it very easy to figure out how that works.
4998000	5004000	Because in Wing Commander, I always had a huge problem with how the predictive targeting worked.
5005000	5008000	Even though the graphics, I believe, were a bit stunted,
5008000	5013000	it didn't necessarily have what would be considered 2003 graphics for the PC,
5013000	5016000	it did get a lot of acclaim for how pretty it was.
5016000	5023000	Some of the star systems, when you've got a planet sort of over a nebula, it's a really gorgeous game.
5023000	5027000	And we can see that now on Twitch, at least. That part of it.
5027000	5032000	It does look a little... I think it's a little more ahead of where a lot of games were in 2003.
5032000	5036000	2003 was more like the PlayStation 2 era, right? So yeah, it's a little bit ahead of that.
5036000	5043000	The NPCs, aside from three or four core NPCs like Jennifer Hill's character,
5043000	5050000	all have the same sort of flat, square mush face, kind of like the family in Katamari Damacy.
5052000	5057000	If you look in the video that's playing right now of the gameplay,
5057000	5062000	you'll notice that some of the people kind of look the same.
5062000	5067000	But the really big, ambitious thing that I was saying earlier that Chris Roberts wanted to create with this
5067000	5071000	was a persistent online state with a real economy.
5071000	5078000	So that up to 128 players could log into basically a game server, like one that you hosted yourself,
5078000	5082000	and if you logged out and logged back in, you could resume your career,
5082000	5087000	but the universe would have kept on even though you personally were not there.
5087000	5093000	And basically the plot of it, the first player or single player campaign mode is
5093000	5097000	you are a freelancer, which means you buy and sell ore from different star systems.
5097000	5100000	You know, buy low, sell high, blah, blah, blah.
5100000	5104000	But then you discover that you were used to smuggle alien artifacts,
5104000	5107000	and you discover the secret alien race that's going to kill humanity,
5107000	5110000	which is also kind of like a Mass Effect thing.
5110000	5115000	So you start as, you know, just like a Han Solo type character pretty much,
5115000	5117000	and then you end up saving the universe.
5117000	5118000	Spoilers.
5118000	5119000	Yeah, I know.
5119000	5120000	Just kidding.
5120000	5124000	Isn't it kind of like those Mass Effect-y connections that make you kind of think of that game fondly now,
5124000	5128000	or what is it about this game that made you think it's worthy of a classic?
5128000	5131000	It's been probably 10 years since I last played it,
5131000	5135000	but I know I've played it from start to finish at least twice.
5136000	5141000	Just because visually how pretty the outer space looks and how fun.
5141000	5147000	Like the combat is genuinely really fun because of how easy it is to play.
5147000	5151000	And I believe there are multiple difficulty settings.
5151000	5153000	Don't quote me on that, though.
5153000	5159000	But yeah, you can take breaks from the story if you want, except for at certain set points.
5159000	5164000	So if you really want to do more of the economy thing, you can do so.
5165000	5172000	What Chris Roberts was picturing in his mind when he pitched Freelancer was really EVE Online.
5172000	5177000	EVE Online is sort of what he really would have liked,
5177000	5181000	which was way too ambitious for Anvil or Microsoft to have done at the time.
5181000	5189000	But when he was trying to describe it, ultimately I feel EVE Online is sort of the actual execution of what he wanted it to be
5189000	5198000	because in multiplayer mode, all you really did is you could fight enemies and pirates and buy and sell different commodities.
5198000	5203000	But that was really it. And once you got over that, once you made money, there wasn't shit to do.
5203000	5207000	Quickly before we wrap up, how did you find this game? Was it because you followed Wing Commander?
5207000	5212000	I probably saw it at Electronics Boutique.
5212000	5220000	I bought, even before PC games had download codes at GameStop. You can't get PC games at GameStop anymore now at all.
5220000	5222000	Well, you pretty much are buying a card with a code on it.
5222000	5224000	Yeah, but I don't even see those anymore.
5224000	5231000	But yeah, no, I was just PC gaming and came across this game probably within a year or so after it came out, maybe 2004, 2005.
5231000	5236000	Saw that it was by Chris Roberts and really enjoyed the purchase.
5236000	5240000	Awesome. Well, there it is. If there's nothing else left to say, your classic game of the week.
5240000	5254000	Freelancer for the PC by Microsoft Studios. Awesome pick. One that I didn't know a lot about really until today, even though I was probably more focused on console gaming at the time. I don't know. Maybe my PC wasn't good enough.
5254000	5266000	The last thing that I'll make that was kind of neat is that the end game for the single player campaign is once you save the galaxy, blah, blah, blah, you're then sort of put back into the universe and you can do whatever you want.
5267000	5279000	But again, that gets very boring because it's just you in this huge universe buying and selling the same commodities. So it's kind of like the end game is kind of really fall short.
5279000	5284000	Is this something people can still play? I mean, you said it was the servers were on your end, right?
5284000	5286000	Yeah, I think you can host the server yourself.
5286000	5287000	Oh, that's pretty cool.
5287000	5304000	Also, I should have said at the beginning, it was the Freelancer is technically the sequel to a game called Star Lancer, which I want to say Star Lancer was available on the Dreamcast. Freelancer was PC only and Star Lancer flopped really bad.
5304000	5312000	And Freelancer actually sort of elevated the legacy of that series because Freelancer was a very good game where Star Lancer was not.
5312000	5313000	Gotcha. Well, great.
5313000	5314000	So now I'm done.
5314000	5323000	All right. Well, thanks, Ellen. That was a great pick. Quickly, I know we got to get back to the show, but just like in general, how's your gaming, like your present gaming world going?
5323000	5330000	I'm playing Overwatch ranked mode again because I took like, I don't know, five or six months off. I missed.
5330000	5331000	How do you like Ash?
5331000	5335000	She's fun. I'm not particularly good as her because I'm not good at snipers.
5335000	5336000	Stop!
5336000	5337000	Yeah.
5337000	5339000	We'll quote Jennifer Hale again.
5339000	5341000	True, yeah. Legend, icon.
5341000	5344000	Yes, because, yeah, we did meet her at GamerX. We have a picture with her.
5344000	5348000	Here's the part where Bobby in chat goes, Jennifer Hale was on my show.
5348000	5349000	Yeah.
5349000	5350000	Yeah, I know.
5350000	5360000	And but her voice is so recognizable to me now that even when she's putting on a Southern twang like Ash, I'm like, Jennifer, I know it's you.
5360000	5363000	So the Dark Souls thing finally ran out for you?
5363000	5367000	Yeah, I was playing the hell out of Dark Souls 2.
5368000	5373000	But after a couple hundred hours, I basically got, this is not relevant to the classic game of the week, but...
5373000	5374000	That's okay.
5374000	5385000	In Dark Souls 2, you can get a ring where if you equip it, you get a strength bonus on your bare fist so you can punch the shit out of monsters rather than the big giant Buster swords that normally Dark Souls is associated with.
5385000	5393000	You have to go through this really tedious mess to get that ring. So I did a playthrough just punching the shit out of monsters.
5393000	5394000	Nice. All right.
5394000	5398000	Just like Boxer Girl, like a fight, like kung fu.
5398000	5401000	But even if you put Dark Souls away for now, you'll probably come back to it in a few months time.
5401000	5403000	I still have not played Dark Souls 3.
5403000	5407000	And we do have to give a quick shout out to Akuma JP who fixed that situation.
5407000	5410000	Yes, my son, my handsome boy.
5410000	5412000	Not Akuma JP, but the Solaria Mibo.
5412000	5413000	Yeah.
5413000	5415000	I thought Mr. Smoosh was your son.
5415000	5417000	Yeah, I have many sons.
5417000	5418000	Okay.
5419000	5426000	Solaire of Astora is an iconic NPC from the first Dark Souls.
5426000	5428000	It's hard to describe the fixation with him.
5428000	5437000	He doesn't make any appearances in Dark Souls 2 or 3, which is a shame, but he is an iconic part of the Dark Souls or Demon's Souls legacy.
5437000	5438000	And you were able to get the amiibo.
5438000	5439000	And I was able to get the amiibo.
5439000	5440000	No thanks to Gamestop.
5440000	5441000	Yeah, no thanks to Gamestop.
5441000	5444000	Apparently they had all sold out by like May.
5444000	5445000	So dumb.
5445000	5450000	Because remember, Dark Souls Remastered for Switch was supposed to come out then.
5450000	5451000	Yeah.
5451000	5452000	But it came out in like October.
5452000	5453000	Yep.
5453000	5458000	So yeah, Akuma JP was like, I can just go there everywhere here.
5458000	5459000	What do you?
5459000	5460000	Yeah.
5460000	5463000	So he mailed me one and also some candy, which is now all gone.
5463000	5464000	So thank you for the candy.
5464000	5465000	Thank you.
5465000	5466000	All right.
5466000	5467000	We do need to get back to the show.
5467000	5468000	What can I say?
5468000	5469000	I'm a little partial to you, Alan.
5469000	5472000	I'm always going to let you have a little more time maybe than the average guest.
5472000	5474000	Well, this is played during the break, so you're probably eating right now.
5475000	5476000	That's awesome.
5476000	5478000	Yes, I'm hiding my time trying to shove an entire pizza.
5478000	5480000	And making coffee and going to the bathroom.
5480000	5482000	Yes, as one does during a three hour radio program.
5482000	5484000	But we do need to get back.
5484000	5485000	Alan, thank you so much for being here.
5485000	5488000	Any last parting thoughts for our listeners this week?
5488000	5492000	Constructive criticism about the studio video quality.
5492000	5495000	Please no like rude comments.
5495000	5496000	Okay.
5496000	5497000	Yeah.
5497000	5498000	No rude.
5498000	5499000	Everyone's been really cool so far.
5499000	5500000	Okay.
5500000	5501000	Right.
5501000	5502000	Bye.
5502000	5507000	So we're back here live in studio episode number 757 of our show in progress for this
5507000	5512000	December 23rd of 2018, or as my sister used to call it, Christmas Eve Eve.
5512000	5514000	So I don't know if you've ever heard that term before.
5514000	5515000	Is that just me?
5515000	5516000	No, I've heard it.
5516000	5517000	It was trending on Twitter earlier.
5517000	5518000	Was it?
5518000	5521000	Oh, well now it's well now it's not cool to say anymore than if it's something all the
5521000	5523000	kids are saying, I suppose now.
5523000	5526000	Anyway, so thanks to Alan for filling in for the classic of the week.
5526000	5528000	I thought that was a good choice, a game I didn't know a lot about.
5528000	5529000	So I learned something.
5529000	5531000	So I think that's something we'll kind of continue to do in 2019.
5531000	5534000	I mean, we love it when dark soccer is here and able to do stuff, but you know, things
5534000	5537000	happen and sometimes you can't always be here to do the classic game of the week.
5537000	5538000	So I'd like to do more.
5538000	5542000	I mean, you've, we've done a ton of games by now, so we should get more guests in to
5542000	5543000	do stuff.
5543000	5544000	It'll be fun.
5544000	5545000	So we'll try to do more of that in the future.
5545000	5549000	Anyway, of course we are live at twitch.tv slash vog network and we hope some of you
5549000	5552000	listening out there on the podcast feed will join us for a live show some night.
5552000	5556000	For those of you that are finding us through twitch TV, we hope you will check out our
5556000	5557000	podcast.
5557000	5560000	We are of course taping a live audio podcast that we've been running for 16 and a half
5560000	5561000	plus years.
5561000	5566000	Uh, that's available over on iTunes, Google play podcasts, pretty much all the favorite
5566000	5569000	places to get podcasts except, except not yet Spotify.
5569000	5574000	Uh, that's a 2019 thing cause we are going to kind of be moving hosts behind the scenes.
5574000	5578000	So, um, I got to get all that taken care of and then we'll end up going to a Spotify,
5578000	5581000	but none of that, none of that's going to affect like you guys downloading and all that
5581000	5582000	stuff.
5582000	5584000	So, all right, let's get back, I suppose, into some news.
5584000	5587000	We need to do some rapid fire news for you guys here.
5587000	5588000	All right.
5588000	5593000	So you may remember that the whole clusterfuck of, uh, fallout 76, well Bethesda is trying
5593000	5597000	to make good with, uh, people that have stayed with the game.
5597000	5602000	So now they basically announced on Twitter that anybody that has launched, logged into
5602000	5608000	fallout 76 during 2018 will receive a copy of fallout classic collection on PC, which
5608000	5612000	is fallout, fallout two and fallout tactics.
5612000	5617000	And so, uh, no word on how you'll be able to get those, but I'm sure code within their
5617000	5619000	Bethesda launcher or something like that.
5619000	5620000	Who knows?
5620000	5623000	Um, so stay tuned for that if you're playing the game.
5623000	5629000	And then of course, um, some unfortunate news for the uncharted movie.
5629000	5636000	It's apparently speaking of movies, I have concerns about apparently, um, they had, uh,
5636000	5638000	lost their director.
5638000	5645000	So, um, right now they are, uh, without a director on that, you basically said that
5645000	5650000	the closest to the starting line is uncharted and it's, that's a massive title.
5650000	5652000	Uh, we have a very good strip.
5652000	5658000	We have our star Tom Holland, and now that is subject to schedule and additional casting.
5658000	5665000	But as I say right now, it seems that most, um, be most near the horizon, but I don't
5665000	5668000	know what they're going to do now without, I guess I'll have to get a new director and
5668000	5669000	see how that goes.
5669000	5672000	But yeah, I'm not a hundred percent on this movie either.
5672000	5676000	It's just, I'm very skeptical with movies do change their directors a ton.
5676000	5680000	I mean, we know there's the very controversial guardians of the galaxy three and all everything
5680000	5684000	that's gone through, but you know that it's not uncommon for movies to lose directors.
5684000	5685000	Yeah.
5685000	5689000	So I mean, but let's just hope it's not a sign of abandoned shit.
5689000	5692000	It's probably just one of those, this project's taking too long to get off the ground.
5692000	5693000	I want to go do something else here.
5693000	5701000	He's doing the, um, I thought they said James Gunn's doing the, um, the second, um, suicide
5701000	5702000	squad.
5702000	5703000	No, no, no, no, no.
5703000	5704000	Wasn't the suicide squad.
5704000	5708000	It was the other one with, it's like an all female on.
5708000	5709000	Oh yeah.
5709000	5711000	I don't remember what it's called, but I know what you're talking about.
5711000	5712000	Yeah.
5712000	5713000	Yeah.
5713000	5714000	DC picked him up.
5714000	5717000	That's which is the obvious solution to that whole thing is that if Marvel doesn't want
5717000	5719000	him here, Aquaman's apparently pretty good.
5719000	5720000	Is it?
5720000	5721000	That's fine.
5721000	5722000	I never get to the movies.
5722000	5725000	It's that we actually, we were looking at going to see a movie last night, but there
5725000	5728000	was like nothing where we were like, ah, we were, well, the wreck it Ralph sequel.
5728000	5729000	We almost spider man.
5730000	5732000	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
5732000	5733000	I don't follow the comics.
5733000	5734000	You don't have to.
5734000	5735000	It's so good.
5735000	5736000	Okay.
5736000	5738000	I'll have to consider checking that out.
5738000	5743000	Alan really wanted to see the widows, that movie, but it's already gone from theaters.
5743000	5745000	I want to see also immortal engines by here.
5745000	5748000	It's not very good, but I just want to see it cause it looks interesting.
5748000	5749000	Okay.
5749000	5752000	But I would actually, if I had the choice between immortal engines and spider, I go
5752000	5753000	see spider man again.
5753000	5756000	I want to go see wreck it Ralph still the new it's it's good.
5756000	5757000	It'll be there for awhile.
5757000	5758000	It's good.
5758000	5763000	I could probably even wait to see it on video and the spider man is really good.
5763000	5764000	All right.
5764000	5765000	Oh, you're not the only one that's saying that.
5765000	5768000	A lot of people are saying that new spider man movie is pretty amazing.
5768000	5772000	I mean, I've seen wrecking Ralph to wreck Ralph too was, it was a cute movie, but spider
5772000	5775000	man was just like, after you see it, you're like, damn, I need to go see that again.
5775000	5776000	We get it.
5776000	5777000	Damn.
5777000	5778000	All right.
5778000	5781000	I'm just saying, I'm just saying, all right, let's talk about the NES switch online.
5781000	5784000	Of course, you know, you can play classic Nintendo games on switch online.
5784000	5785000	Still curious.
5785000	5789000	So they're going to bring us in January, but we had some new games in this December.
5789000	5792000	Uh, we had Ninja Gaiden or excuse me, Ninja Gaiden.
5792000	5794000	Uh, we had, uh, adventures of Lolo.
5794000	5799000	Uh, we had, uh, they, they did a couple of those, like I'd forget the column with the,
5799000	5801000	like the modest SP.
5801000	5807000	So they did one for Metroid and then they did one for, um, dr Mario.
5807000	5812000	But anyway, um, apparently, and I didn't know this, if you actually use the NES controllers,
5812000	5813000	cause those are out now.
5813000	5814000	Yeah.
5814000	5817000	If you actually use the NES controllers with this, you actually get different color scheme
5817000	5820000	and you get different sound effects that actually sound eight bit.
5820000	5822000	So it's just like this little Easter egg.
5822000	5825000	If you are actually using those old controllers, I guess that's neat.
5825000	5826000	Kind of neat.
5826000	5830000	Now this is what I think is more neat is that it was also discovered that with the new super
5830000	5835000	Mario brothers, you on switch, that whole thing that's coming out, that game is going
5835000	5837000	to support the classic controllers.
5837000	5843000	So even though Nintendo made no promises beyond the switch online, you know, because of course,
5843000	5847000	with that, those classic controllers are only having so many buttons.
5847000	5849000	Not every game is going to want to natively support that.
5849000	5853000	But I guess because Mario games are generally pretty much the same, right?
5853000	5855000	So you only need the two buttons.
5855000	5859000	So they actually made it so that the new super Mario brothers, you on switch is going to
5859000	5861000	use those classic controllers if you want.
5861000	5862000	That's kind of neat.
5862000	5863000	But what's that new super Mario brother?
5863000	5867000	Well, I was going to say a new super Mario brothers that originated on the DS.
5867000	5871000	So I was going to say, uh, yes, I was trying to think if it was DS and there was a Wii
5871000	5872000	version in the Wii U.
5872000	5875000	Because if it was on the Wii and they used the Wii remotes and those only had two buttons
5875000	5876000	as well.
5876000	5877000	So then that makes sense.
5877000	5878000	Yes.
5878000	5881000	But technically this is a Wii U port, but yes, I mean for sure what you're saying there.
5881000	5884000	I'm more curious because I remember on the Wii U version, the second player could like
5884000	5886000	draw on the screen and do something.
5886000	5890000	I'm just assuming that's just gone or maybe you could do it in portable mode and touch
5890000	5891000	the screen.
5891000	5893000	But I, it's probably not really a thing anymore.
5893000	5894000	I don't think it's a thing.
5894000	5895000	I think they just probably took it out.
5895000	5897000	It was like, ah, it's just one of those things that's going to go.
5897000	5900000	And instead you get things that inspired Bowsette memes.
5900000	5901000	So enjoy it.
5901000	5906000	Uh, speaking of things to enjoy in Nintendo products, uh, Firewatch is on the Switch.
5906000	5909000	I don't know how many of you have checked out Firewatch finally on the Switch because
5909000	5912000	it was on a ton of other, it was on PC, it was on PlayStation 4.
5912000	5918000	I loved Firewatch, but you know, I love the walking simulators, which I still don't like
5918000	5920000	that title, but if that's what they're going to call it, fine.
5920000	5924000	Um, I just recommended today, everybody's gone to the rapture to somebody who hadn't
5924000	5925000	played it yet.
5925000	5926000	I was like, oh, you got to play that game.
5926000	5928000	But anyway, Firewatch is really good too.
5929000	5935000	And it's on the Switch and apparently they've actually hidden away a Nintendo 64 controller.
5935000	5940000	There's actually a little Nintendo game called forest 64 and you can find this like it's
5940000	5944000	a little Easter egg and uh, yeah, I think it's just like cute little things to find
5944000	5945000	in the game.
5945000	5947000	So, um, yeah, neat.
5947000	5948000	I like those little things.
5948000	5950000	They did that same thing in a gone home.
5950000	5953000	Another one of those kinds of games that finally came out on the Switch.
5953000	5957000	They did almost like the super Nintendo games that were hidden in the sister's room or
5957000	5958000	something like that.
5958000	5959000	Right.
5959000	5960000	Yeah.
5960000	5963000	So yeah, not, not unheard of to see these types of callbacks.
5963000	5964000	So anyway, there you go.
5964000	5969000	Uh, there's some rapid fire news for you in what is otherwise kind of a slower news week,
5969000	5974000	but we still got some things to cover, including release dates, question mark.
5974000	5979000	I really see is this, this is Christmas week.
5979000	5983000	I just don't know if anything at all is coming out this week, but it's worth checking in
5983000	5984000	anyway.
5984000	5986000	There, there's nothing.
5986000	5988000	There's nothing that's coming out.
5988000	5993000	Um, console wise as far as like, um, an actual physical release or anything.
5993000	5994000	Sure.
5994000	5999000	I'm sure there'll still be some indie titles, but yeah, we don't get a list of those.
5999000	6002000	We got nothing on both fronts unfortunately.
6002000	6006000	So, all right, well there's one release in Japan, actually a couple.
6006000	6009000	There's one major release in Japan and a few minor ones.
6009000	6014000	Uh, but the major release in Japan this week on December the 27th Diablo three eternal
6014000	6017000	collection gets its Japanese release this week.
6017000	6020000	So that's not something a little something cause you know, Christmas is kind of different
6020000	6021000	in Japan.
6021000	6023000	It's not necessarily the hysteria it is over here.
6023000	6029000	Uh, but there's also on the switch, they have go vacation and Shin Sengoku Musou seven with
6029000	6031000	Moshu then DX.
6031000	6033000	So you have that to look forward to on the switch.
6033000	6037000	It is still a slow week, but at least it's not completely barren.
6037000	6038000	I don't know about the UK Loki.
6038000	6040000	Imagine it's pretty slow over there too though.
6040000	6041000	Nothing there.
6041000	6042000	Nothing there.
6042000	6044000	Yeah, nothing coming out until the 10th.
6044000	6049000	Uh, black Mamba in our chat says, I heard Final Fantasy seven is coming to switch in
6049000	6050000	2019.
6050000	6051000	Is this true?
6051000	6054000	I don't think they dated it, but it was in their last direct.
6054000	6055000	They did.
6055000	6056000	It was all the fun things.
6056000	6057000	Yeah.
6057000	6058000	10, 12, seven.
6058000	6060000	No, cause they skipped eight.
6060000	6065000	So not all the file fantasies cause remember everybody was like, where's eight though?
6065000	6070400	But the eight, cause let's be real, they're all ported PC releases pretty much right.
6070400	6073480	Or they're ports of versions that have already come out.
6073480	6077160	Now even though seven had a really old PC release, it had a somewhat newer PC release
6077160	6081540	and it had more importantly that PlayStation four release.
6081540	6086440	Remember when, um, at the PlayStation expo one year they announced it was before they
6086440	6088320	announced the fantasy seven remake.
6088320	6091860	They announced fantasy sevens come to PlayStation four and everybody loses their shit.
6091860	6093860	And they're like, yes, it's the classic final fantasy.
6093860	6097360	And like they go back to the audience, everybody's just like complete stone face.
6097360	6098360	Like really?
6098360	6099360	Bitch.
6099400	6100400	Do you remember that?
6100400	6101400	When they unveiled that?
6101400	6102400	Yeah, it was funny.
6102400	6104880	So anyway, that's the version I think they're probably doing on the switch.
6104880	6105880	And so there's what?
6105880	6111600	Seven, nine, 10, not 11, 12, and probably some other stuff too.
6111600	6112600	I'm forgetting in the moment.
6112600	6114360	Why not 11?
6114360	6118320	I know because I don't, I don't know if square knows where I feel like file fantasy 11 is
6118320	6122680	that thing that just kind of exists in a dark room somewhere and nobody's really checking
6122680	6123680	on it.
6123680	6128360	The mobile version is supposed to be coming out mobile version or like I check it out
6128360	6133320	on like, you know, cause switch can't run, you know, 14 we'll just get a remastered
6133320	6135800	11 and I'm fine with that.
6135800	6139680	Uh, Dr. Studio says, I thought I heard eight issue was licensing the music.
6139680	6140680	Well, that would be weird.
6140680	6143880	Wasn't all the music in an original, except unless maybe there was some weird agreement
6143880	6145600	with Faye Wong eyes on me.
6145600	6148040	Like I don't, would that really be a thing?
6148040	6149160	I don't know.
6149160	6151560	So I guess I could be surprised.
6151560	6155400	Maybe they had a guest artist or something, uh, that, Oh, dark to see it says it's the
6155400	6157320	one song eyes on me.
6157320	6160280	So maybe, you know, you could do the Konami thing.
6160280	6165280	No, you could do the Konami thing and get someone new to sing it.
6165280	6167480	I'm down.
6167480	6170360	Act Def says maybe it explains why there's only two songs in smash.
6170360	6173360	Cause you know, the final fantasy stuff in smash is pretty thin.
6173360	6176840	They really didn't go out of their way to add new fall fancy stuff where it's like everything
6176840	6179040	else kind of like has like new fancy stuff.
6179040	6181960	It's just really bother with this cloud.
6181960	6182960	It's fine.
6182960	6183960	All right.
6184600	6187720	This is the part of the show where we would usually get it in the mailbag.
6187720	6191560	However, there were no emails this week.
6191560	6195160	If you want to send us emails, you can send those emails to participate at orange launch
6195160	6199920	radio.com but unfortunately when I opened up the mailbag at participate at orange launch
6199920	6201920	radio.com there were no emails there.
6201920	6203480	So you know what that means?
6203480	6208080	I get to spend some time talking about RuPaul's drag race, all stars for hooray.
6208080	6209560	So did you see this week's episode?
6209560	6210560	Nope.
6210560	6211560	I didn't.
6211640	6216520	The lip sync with the lip syncs this season have been on point.
6216520	6219560	The one, this, I'm not going to spoil everything cause I probably, everybody's not watched
6219560	6223280	it, but the lip sync this last episode was so good.
6223280	6224280	So good.
6224280	6225280	I, it was, it was good.
6225280	6227920	I can't wait for the next episode of reading is fundamental, cheap plug to talk about it.
6227920	6228920	It was good.
6228920	6232240	But here's, I'll tell you this, this has got a lot of people talking in the community.
6232240	6238040	The next episode, the one that airs this Friday leaked because wow.
6238040	6239920	Cause everybody has to have their own Netflix thing.
6239920	6245080	So RuPaul's production company, wow presents world of wonder on their plus service where
6245080	6250120	they do like uncensored drag race and other, you know, uh, specials and things like that.
6250120	6251120	Wow.
6251120	6254800	Plus or whatever overseas accidentally posted the third episode early.
6254800	6259360	Oh, but you know what happens once it's on the internet is always on the internet.
6259360	6262880	So it's over on Reddit and you know, they're trying to hide it.
6262880	6267400	You kind of have to know like what corners to look and where, but if you really dig for
6267400	6268400	it, you can find it.
6268400	6272280	And so I already saw this Friday's episode because if I didn't watch it now, I was going
6272280	6273280	to get spoiled.
6273280	6275560	So I had to watch it before somebody else could spoil me.
6275560	6280320	So obviously I would never spoil for those that are keeping themselves away from it.
6280320	6282720	But this week's episode is pretty darn good too.
6282720	6285760	That's all I'm really going to say, but I'm still rooting for Monique Hart.
6285760	6287320	Do you know who Monique Hart is?
6287320	6288320	No.
6288320	6289320	Okay.
6289320	6290320	All right.
6290320	6294440	I don't know anything about three words, Loki Brown cow stunning.
6294440	6297120	That's all I need to know.
6297120	6298120	Okay.
6298120	6302160	It's really must like their, their dairy products.
6302160	6305760	Um, looking at, uh, it, Oh, Bobby Blackwell.
6305760	6306760	Okay.
6306760	6308040	You can ask this about an email segment.
6308040	6312480	Bobby Blackwell asks, so what happened on survivor?
6312480	6315660	So I can tell this little side story has nothing to do with gaming, but if you're not going
6315660	6318100	to send emails and I get a tangent time.
6318100	6320080	So I don't know if you knew about this trip I took.
6320080	6322280	So I took a trip in the middle of the week.
6322280	6325080	We drove down on Wednesday and drove back on Thursday.
6325080	6327800	We went to LA and here's why.
6327800	6332920	We were trying to get into the survivor finale in LA that they do at CBS studios.
6332920	6336400	And one of my friends, Kami, she got in through the seat filler.
6336400	6341040	All our female friends got in, all the males did not get in.
6341040	6342040	Hmm.
6342040	6344200	I wonder what that's all about, but maybe it was just a coincidence.
6344200	6348200	But anyway, um, actually this girl that I met while I was down there, that's kind of
6348200	6349780	hangs in the same kind of group.
6349780	6351520	She was right in the front and center at the very beginning.
6351520	6352520	You could not miss her.
6352520	6353520	So that was pretty cool.
6353520	6356480	We were watching it since we didn't get in, we went to watch an East coast feed at somebody
6356480	6361040	else's place and we got to, uh, you know, um, uh, kind of watch there.
6361040	6364920	And when we saw this girl in the front row that we knew it was like, Oh my God, we know
6364920	6365920	her.
6365920	6366920	So that was, that was kind of fun.
6366920	6368040	And so here's the thing though.
6368040	6370920	So I didn't just drive all the way to LA to like do nothing and end up watching an East
6370920	6371920	coast feed.
6371920	6372920	I mean, I met new friends, new people.
6372920	6378780	That's always fun, but we knew the place cause you know, people talk, we knew the place where
6378780	6382600	all the people that were on the show that felt like doing after partying, we're going
6382600	6384440	to go, we knew what bar they were going to.
6384440	6388360	So like some dumb survivor groupies, which is funny cause you know, I used to be obsessed
6388360	6389360	with the show, right?
6389360	6390360	Like I used to watch it all the time.
6390360	6394360	And I kinda like when I started doing more podcasts like on Wednesdays and stuff, I kind
6394360	6395680	of fell out of the habit of watching.
6395680	6399580	So I haven't watched religiously, but I've caught like two or three episodes this season
6399580	6401400	and this, this last season was pretty good.
6401400	6405340	So we went to the place in LA where all the people were going to show up and they did.
6405340	6409900	So we got to meet a lot of the people and a lot of, you know, the people that were on
6409900	6411920	it previously all showed up too.
6411920	6413360	So that was kind of fun.
6413360	6417600	You know, I didn't, I didn't recognize any everybody and I don't like to do the picture
6417600	6420960	thing an awful lot because I feel like then it's like you're asking somebody, you're going
6420960	6422480	up to somebody and going, can I get a picture?
6422480	6423480	Can I get a picture?
6423480	6425440	And then like, you know, you take that picture and they're like, okay, thanks.
6425440	6426440	Have a good one.
6426440	6430500	And I'm like, I think that's so like, I don't know, like I would rather like talk for like
6430500	6432260	two minutes to somebody.
6432260	6435760	So I didn't really get a lot of selfies, even though we got to talk to like, uh, Gabby was
6435760	6438600	one I know for sure that we ran into Allison was out front.
6438600	6441080	If you don't watch survivor, these names mean nothing to you.
6441080	6445040	Uh, but anyway, yeah, so, and, and the guy who won was there too.
6445040	6446200	So it was, it was a lot of fun.
6446200	6451200	So um, but I, the person I did run into that I had to get a selfie with and you have no
6451200	6457800	clue who this person is, but if I like survivor, I really like big brother, which is the really
6457800	6459480	trashy one right in the house.
6459480	6460480	Yeah.
6460480	6464540	I met Arisa Cox and I wouldn't expect you would know her, but anybody up north might
6464540	6467280	know her cause she's the host of big brother Canada.
6467280	6471880	So she was there at the survivor thing because I think ET Canada was covering it because
6471880	6474480	there's a lot of people in Canada, they don't have their own survivor in Canada.
6474480	6475480	They have their own big brother.
6475480	6476480	They don't have their own survivors.
6476480	6477480	They watch ours.
6477480	6479180	So I think she's kind of the bridge.
6479180	6484220	Like she does the little like correspondence for survivor in Canada.
6484220	6485220	So that was my moment.
6485220	6488840	That was my little celebrity encounter for the Canadians that listen, that might know
6488840	6489840	who I'm talking about.
6489840	6490840	She was really nice.
6490840	6491880	She was really patient.
6491880	6495320	This drunk guy offered to take a picture of us and he was just being really awkward and
6495320	6496880	it was like a really super awkward moment.
6496880	6497880	I was like, Oh, it's okay.
6497880	6498880	I'll get a selfie.
6498880	6501680	And I was kind of like, I'm like looking at her, I'm like, I'm so sorry.
6501680	6502680	You know?
6502680	6503680	She's like, Oh no, it's funny.
6503680	6504680	You know, type of thing.
6504680	6507400	She was really like humble and she's, you know, asking me some questions about like,
6507400	6509080	how do you, how do you watch it down here?
6509080	6513140	And I was like, girl, you know, there's places on the internet and she's like, you know,
6513140	6515140	so it was, it was cool.
6515140	6516140	It was cool.
6516140	6517140	Anyway.
6517140	6518140	Um, I love this.
6518140	6521640	Bobby in chat says I robbed as one show on Twitch and then he immediately goes to Hollywood.
6521640	6524560	Oh, you know, but now, now they did, it was fun.
6524560	6525600	I met, met some friends.
6525600	6529520	I've known online for a long time and that was, that meant more to me than people on
6529520	6530520	a TV show.
6530520	6532040	I watched twice there.
6532040	6533040	They're all normal people.
6533040	6536080	You guys, it's just, it's just Hollywood.
6536080	6537080	It's just a show.
6537080	6538080	Just like this.
6538080	6539080	All right.
6539080	6540080	Anyway, that's enough.
6540080	6541080	That's enough about weird, crazy.
6541080	6544560	I can't believe I did that, but it was one of those things where my friends were like,
6544560	6545560	do it, do it.
6545560	6546560	Why not?
6546560	6547560	And I was like, you know what?
6547560	6548560	Good point.
6548560	6549720	Like I could use just a random trip.
6549720	6550720	Why not?
6550720	6551720	Let's do it.
6551720	6552720	So it was fun.
6552720	6553720	Anyway.
6553720	6554720	All right.
6554840	6558520	So we're getting into some actual video gaming news now that I've told my little midweek
6558520	6564000	a trip story and let's get into, uh, what's going on with, uh, trophies and what they're
6564000	6565000	telling us, right?
6565000	6566000	Yeah.
6566000	6572120	So there's this, um, feature that they've launched, I guess, called, uh, my PS4 life.
6572120	6577440	It's some sort of marketing campaign that is like a highlight video of a player's individual
6577440	6579440	stats and milestones.
6579440	6585060	So based on that, um, I guess with the game they're talking about, like how many of like
6585060	6589720	a certain trophy out of how many people played the game, you know, what percentage you had
6589720	6596900	and based on that information, you're going to extrapolate how many copies of a game sold.
6596900	6599160	So people used math.
6599160	6601240	People use math to reverse engineer.
6601240	6602920	People math this week.
6602920	6604600	And that is the headline on Kotaku.
6604600	6605600	Yes.
6605600	6607520	So they, they have, I have to give a little crap.
6607520	6608520	Come on.
6608600	6611360	They, uh, figured out like some of the player counts for certain games.
6611360	6614920	So for example, Doom has 3.9 million people playing the game.
6614920	6620040	The Last Guardian, 1.94 million, um, people playing that.
6620040	6623840	Uncharted Lost Legacy, 3.9 million.
6623840	6626520	Wolfenstein, uh, 1.4.
6626520	6628760	Detroit Become Human, 2.4.
6628760	6631800	Red Dead Redemption, 6.1 and so on.
6631800	6635680	Fallout 76, only 407,000.
6635680	6638480	To be fair, I bet that game hasn't been out as long as the others and you have to
6638520	6639520	earn those trophies.
6639520	6640520	Well, I mean, okay.
6640520	6641520	They're still, they're using the math.
6641520	6642520	Nevermind.
6642520	6646560	Cause even if only 0.1% of people have a trophy, you can still kind of figure some things out
6646560	6647560	that way.
6647560	6648560	That's interesting.
6648560	6649560	Yeah.
6649560	6655320	But, I mean, there's room for error too, because there's only so many decimal points
6655320	6656400	in those percentages.
6656400	6660720	So obviously, I mean, we know these are just like estimates and they, there may be some
6660720	6664880	gray area cause some people buy games and then never unlock any trophies.
6664880	6669800	Some people bought the game, returned it, or so, so, and it went a second hand sale
6669800	6670800	basically.
6670800	6673240	So they still have the trophies on their account, but now somebody else bought the same copy
6673240	6674800	and has their own trophies.
6674800	6678640	So it's, it's not quite, it's not proof proof math.
6678640	6680040	No, for sure.
6680040	6682640	But it's interesting when we don't necessarily always get the sales number.
6682640	6683640	Yeah.
6683640	6685320	They haven't been releasing a lot of sales numbers anymore.
6685320	6687200	They don't break it down like the MPD used to.
6687200	6690640	Um, now it's a lot of that's private unless they want to brag about, oh, look at how well
6690640	6691640	our console sold.
6691640	6694160	Hence the Smash Brothers story from before the break.
6694160	6695160	Yeah.
6695160	6696160	Yeah.
6696160	6700280	Uh, going in chat at live or see that live.vognetwork.com will still work, but at, uh, at a Twitch TV
6700280	6704560	vog network, uh, active says people did math and obtained results more at 11.
6704560	6705560	Yep.
6705560	6706560	Pretty much.
6706560	6710280	But that, that's the kind of stories you get on Christmas and new year's week when everybody's
6710280	6712800	finally on vacation, I think at this point of the year.
6712800	6716720	So let's move on to something else overseas that might be a little more serious.
6716720	6722920	Uh, in Germany, legal action is being pursued against Nintendo for their no cancellation
6722960	6724640	eShop preorder policy.
6724640	6725640	Uh, yeah.
6725640	6730080	If you didn't know that, if you try to preorder something on Nintendo, uh, you cannot take
6730080	6731080	back seas.
6731080	6734360	Uh, you can't have it built in that they can do that.
6734360	6738880	So, uh, they say, uh, when you go, it can't be, they, so they tell you, it's not like
6738880	6739880	you're surprised.
6739880	6743700	It is, it's in that little print that a lot of you probably don't read, but people will
6743700	6747480	try to call customer service and it's not something that they really do.
6747480	6752800	So, uh, the Norwegian consumer council initially kind of started to try to change this policy
6752800	6758340	but now the German consumer protection authority has collaborated with the Norwegian consumer
6758340	6763220	council and is now going to take legal action against Nintendo Europe because Nintendo Europe
6763220	6765020	is based in Germany.
6765020	6768320	Now if you think our courts are slow, so are theirs.
6768320	6772400	So it's not something that's going to happen overnight, but, uh, there's some, uh, further
6772400	6774320	details about what's going on here.
6774320	6780560	Um, Nintendo did cite the article 16 of the European consumer law directive in their defense
6780560	6785280	and it says it doesn't have to allow cancellation if quote, the performance has begun with the
6785280	6790040	consumer's prior express consent, which they're doing with the pop-up and with the acknowledgement
6790040	6793660	that he will lose his right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed
6793660	6794800	by the trader.
6794800	6798840	But in the retort, the Norwegian consumer council said the company plainly states that
6798840	6800360	all purchases are final.
6800360	6804180	According to the right of withdrawal laid out in the consumer rights directive, such
6804180	6808640	terms are illegal until the game can be downloaded and launched.
6808640	6813280	The seller cannot prohibit the consumer from canceling their preorder, which makes sense.
6813280	6817120	They really shouldn't be able to do that yet is a little weird because I mean, unless you've
6817120	6822800	actually downloaded the game, I mean, I don't understand you haven't downloaded anything
6822800	6823800	yet.
6823800	6824800	Well, who cares?
6824800	6825800	Let's, let's ask this question too.
6825800	6829200	Why is anyone preordering anything anymore?
6829200	6833100	Because people preorder stuff because they're either really excited about, they want to
6833100	6837000	actually buy something because they know that they want it or they're doing it because of
6837000	6840280	some sort of bonus that they're throwing in.
6840280	6842680	And that's really, that's the whole preorder culture.
6842680	6843680	I understand.
6843680	6845440	It's got to be the bonus.
6845440	6851280	It makes sense in the sense of like physical copies because you have to know what to, you
6851280	6853680	have to know what to bring in as far as inventory.
6853680	6857720	And so you need to have those preorders that gauge a number of like, here's how many copies
6857720	6860240	we need to bring in at this location type of thing.
6860240	6864920	But it's just, I buy a lot of stuff online and so I want to lock in that release day
6864920	6868460	shipping from a major online retailer that I use.
6868460	6872520	And so, uh, you know, that might be as, but that's about as far out as I preorder.
6872520	6879240	Usually I've had a copy of Kingdom Hearts three on preorder since like 2013 because
6879240	6884160	said major online retailer accidentally listed it for like $40 at one point.
6884160	6887760	And so like I preordered it then and so now they have to honor that price.
6887760	6888840	They don't have to do shit.
6888840	6891800	They can cancel your order and then I guess they could, but they better not.
6891800	6892800	That's not a nice thing to do.
6892800	6895280	I'll cancel my prime.
6895280	6896280	I won't.
6896280	6898040	But anyway, I don't think they're going to do it.
6898040	6902760	I think they are still on re because if you think about it, when the, uh, they were, um,
6902760	6907560	giving you the 15% discounts or 20%, whatever the hell it was anyway, that was about the
6907560	6908560	equivalent of that.
6908560	6909560	Anyway.
6909560	6913380	Now, yes, they got rid of that, but they're probably just writing it off for this one.
6913380	6917520	You know, how many people got what I got and are still locked into it?
6917520	6922360	Probably not very many, probably also in related news, Kingdom Hearts three is like actually
6922360	6924660	a real thing that's going to happen.
6924660	6927660	I kind of can't believe it.
6927660	6928660	You know what I mean?
6928660	6931560	Like, I feel like this game has been like a non-existent thing for so long and now it's
6931560	6937600	like actually going to happen and it's really weird, but anyway, um, Bobby Black Wolf points
6937600	6941800	out in our chat that he got the same detail, uh, but, uh, he wishes he was getting it on
6941800	6946000	Xbox one X probably because of the four K stuff and you know, the things his, his theater
6946000	6947000	can do.
6947000	6948240	But for that price, he'll deal with it.
6948240	6952880	He says, uh, and then act F says, I can only imagine dark soccer's ears burning right now
6952880	6955280	with everyone using the word preorder.
6955280	6960700	Well, unfortunately, whether it's gram grammatically correct or not, that is the term that everybody
6960700	6961700	kind of runs with.
6961700	6963400	So that's what we're using here too for now.
6963400	6968560	And really you shouldn't preorder games because agreed just in the like nowadays, like a lot
6968560	6974920	of stuff gets released, even if it's like a well known, like a quality Bethesda, most
6974920	6978040	of the, okay, but that's the games where the most of them come out.
6978040	6979040	They're functional.
6979040	6982640	I mean, and they, they're not terrible.
6982640	6986120	They granted kind of said that with a question mark, they're functional.
6986120	6987120	Yeah.
6987120	6992720	They're, they're, I mean like Skyrim and oblivion and like, and you'll follow three
6992720	6993720	and stuff like that.
6993720	6995800	I mean, they were functional.
6995800	6996800	You would be satisfied.
6996800	6997800	Okay.
6997800	6998800	This is a full game.
6998800	6999800	You know, whatever.
6999800	7003320	It's not completely broken out of the gate like it is with like the fallout 76 or a lot
7003320	7007040	of these games are releasing kind of in a broken state because, Oh, we need to get
7007040	7008320	it out right away.
7008320	7012160	So that's kind of one reason why you don't want to necessarily preorder because it could
7012160	7014000	be a broken mess for a very long time.
7014000	7020120	And if they're more interested in selling those emotes and DLC than fixing the game,
7020120	7022540	you're going to be stuck with a broken game for a long time.
7022540	7027640	Why should you have to give them money upfront to be a beta tester for their fucking product?
7027640	7031400	I think there'll probably be less and less people preordering in 2019.
7031400	7034520	I just, you know, especially now that you know that if you do it with Nintendo, you
7034520	7035520	can't cancel it.
7035520	7038800	I mean, I don't know how many people are really like, like, you know, if you want super smash
7038800	7041240	brothers, like you're not canceling that shit.
7041240	7042240	You know what I mean?
7042240	7045980	Like it's very rare, but I can also see people's personal life circumstance.
7045980	7050660	Like what if you preordered a bunch of games and then heaven forbid you lose your job or
7050660	7054220	you have a huge financial emergency of some other sort and you're like, all right, something's
7054220	7055220	got to go.
7055220	7056360	I better cut back all these games.
7056360	7060720	But if you did that with Nintendo, you can't, we'll just don't do it through their eShop.
7060720	7066000	You can do it at like a game store and because you're only putting $5 down there and you
7066000	7068740	can go in and cancel your game.
7068740	7074440	And they'll invest your $5 and then give you just the $5 back and keep whatever got invested.
7074440	7075440	Yeah.
7075440	7076440	Cause that's how it works.
7076440	7077440	Some of these games.
7077440	7078440	So like, I don't understand.
7078440	7079440	I get it.
7079440	7081600	Like the, you need to know how many copies of something and that's more of like for obscure
7081600	7085680	games, like, like, Oh, if I wanted to get earth defense force, you know, the day it
7085680	7090640	comes out, I might want to preorder that because if I want a physical copy, they might not
7090640	7093840	order a lot of those because they're not expecting a lot of people want it.
7093840	7097880	So that would be something I would need to go in there and actually order a copy of.
7097880	7102480	But if it's like Red Dead Redemption 2, they're ordering all the fucking copies they can get
7102480	7106480	and you're not going to have a problem getting that in, you know, getting that day one.
7106480	7111200	Um, of course they'll tell you that it's going to be a problem, but you know, Bobby Blackwolf
7111200	7116480	in chat says I preorder hardware like rock band stuff, but that that's different because
7116480	7119960	you know, there'll be limited supply and some companies have real problems keeping
7119960	7120960	them in stock.
7120960	7121960	Right?
7121960	7122960	Nintendo.
7122960	7124360	You know what I mean?
7124360	7127320	So anyhow, it'll be interesting to see what comes of this.
7127320	7131160	If Nintendo is going to be forced to change their policy in Europe anyway, remember there's
7131160	7135600	no reason why it would just be Europe that changes, but uh, it is interesting as we're
7135600	7141120	starting to elect more and more people from, you know, the generation X and millennial
7141120	7148640	generation into, um, Congress and into elected offices, you get more and more people that
7148640	7149640	are familiar with it.
7149640	7156560	God, I fucking cannot wait for some computer literate people to be in the fucking Congress
7156560	7157560	and Senate.
7157560	7159280	I already caught house in the Senate.
7159280	7163520	It's happening slowly, but it's not fucking like I know everybody's watched the clips
7163520	7170060	online of like people trying to explain to senators, you know, here's what an I or here's
7170060	7171340	what Android is.
7171340	7172340	Here's what Google is.
7172340	7173340	You know?
7173340	7174340	Oh, my iPhone's not working.
7174340	7175340	Well, I'm sorry, sir.
7175340	7176340	We don't make that phone.
7176340	7182100	You know, we talking about, it's the same thing is it's like, I just want like somebody
7182100	7185300	that knows what the fuck they're doing to be voting on it.
7185300	7188540	Like you can't vote on the internet if you don't know what the fucking internet is.
7188540	7189540	Grandpa.
7189540	7196420	I mean, seriously, just fucking like if you're that incompetent and stupid with it, you shouldn't
7196420	7197820	be voting on anything.
7197820	7198820	You should be out.
7198820	7201180	What's his whining term limits?
7201180	7202380	What's what's her name?
7202380	7205100	I don't want to get too political, but I do crack again.
7205100	7209020	This person I know is super controversial because she's she's really, really left.
7209020	7213380	Alessandra Cortez, I know you're talking about, right?
7213380	7214380	Sorry, guy.
7214380	7215380	I'm so sorry.
7215380	7218260	I just don't have the news articles in front of me and I forget the name in the moment,
7218260	7219860	but I'm actually complimenting her.
7219860	7221020	I think it's cool.
7221020	7224060	Like politics aside, I don't want to bring that up right now, but like just the fact
7224060	7228780	that if you go to her Twitter, she posts pictures of herself on Friday nights watching Drag
7228780	7230340	Race, holding a glass of wine.
7230340	7233680	And I'm like, politicians can be just like us.
7233680	7234680	It's amazing.
7234680	7235680	You know what I mean?
7235680	7236680	It's like, it's like that.
7236680	7239780	Now that feels like a representation of me.
7239780	7240780	You know what I mean?
7240780	7247700	You didn't feel represented by the guy that spent all that campaign money on Steam games.
7247700	7248700	Maybe a little bit.
7248700	7250900	Maybe a little work of gold or whatever the hell it was.
7250900	7251900	Thank you.
7251900	7252900	The chat room.
7252900	7253900	Uh, saving me there.
7253900	7254900	Ocasio Cortez.
7254900	7255900	That's her name.
7255900	7256900	That sounds, that sounds right.
7256900	7257900	I don't know.
7258020	7259020	Michael pointing out.
7259020	7262860	Ted Lou has a computer BS in computer science and a BA in political science.
7262860	7264280	So there you go.
7264280	7269620	And DJ Rama S says she's being nerfed in the Senate as we speak, but she's in the house.
7269620	7270620	Isn't she?
7270620	7273260	Anyway, I don't want to do, I don't want to do blog, but I couldn't help but think of
7273260	7277660	that when we talk about, you know, more and more game aware people like, you know, we'll
7277660	7278660	never forget.
7278660	7283140	I just brought this up in the show recently in that Supreme court ruling where like one
7283140	7286880	of the Supreme court justices offices, like all the staff knew mortal combat.
7286880	7287880	They all played it growing up.
7287880	7288880	You know what I mean?
7288880	7289880	Exactly.
7289880	7295320	It's a very different way of looking at it than when it was 1992 and you had what Alan
7295320	7299300	Tipper Gore, whoever it was up there going like, you know, kids today are playing this
7299300	7304000	filth and you know, holding up a copy of night trap, which is the most ridiculous fucking
7304000	7305000	game in retrospect.
7305000	7308800	If you just can't keep up with what's going on out in the world, then it's going to be
7308800	7310600	hard to be able to make rules about it.
7310600	7316260	It means, I don't know, then didn't you re you know, you have to rely on lobbyists to
7316260	7320220	tell you what's going on and they're like, well, you see this, you know, free open internet's
7320220	7321220	bad.
7321220	7322220	You need to do this.
7322220	7323220	Oh, okay.
7323220	7325460	Cause you don't know the fucking going on.
7325460	7328780	I mean, it's, it's just dumb, but anyways, enough politics, enough politics.
7328780	7329780	Next story.
7329780	7330780	Anyway.
7330780	7336460	So speaking of things that aren't so great, I see now I used to be a huge fan of the lemmings
7336460	7344660	and you know, back when geo cities was a thing, I used to do drawings of back when it was
7344660	7345660	what spectrum?
7345660	7347540	Holobyte was the company that made it right away.
7347540	7348540	Yeah.
7348540	7349540	Psychosis.
7349540	7350540	Oh, okay.
7350540	7353380	Um, which, you know, originally it's right.
7353380	7354380	You're right.
7354380	7355380	You're right.
7355380	7357820	DMA done designs, you know, did, uh, grand theft auto and stuff.
7357820	7359460	So lemmings lemmings too.
7359460	7361620	You know, I used to, that'd be doing my jam.
7361620	7368500	Um, well now they have lemmings coming out, uh, mobile platforms and if you've never played
7368500	7373300	lemmings, just say it was these little, you know, cause lemmings, they just follow blindly.
7373300	7374300	Like that's what a lemming is.
7374300	7375300	Right.
7375300	7377940	But they actually made a little character out of it and they would be, they would March
7377940	7379700	in a line and like it was a puzzler game.
7379700	7380700	Right.
7380700	7383260	Like you had to get the lemmings to the exit without letting them die.
7383260	7386300	But you had to make like builder lemmings, you had to build a wall.
7386300	7388700	So the lemming would like turn around, go the other way.
7388700	7390240	Like it was a puzzle game basically.
7390240	7396020	So, um, here's the only thing about this because it is a mobile game.
7396020	7400380	You know, there's the mobile tax, which is the tax on your patients and on your wallet
7400380	7405860	because, um, in the game, of course, you know, because you have the different types of lemmings
7405860	7407660	that you can create moves and stuff like that.
7407660	7411980	Apparently, according to some of the chat comments here, each costs one in game currency
7411980	7413100	to do a move.
7413100	7418980	And if you run out of moves, then you have to wait two hours or for 20 more of said currency.
7418980	7425700	And otherwise you're going to buy like gold to do a move, I guess.
7425700	7428380	I would have thought maybe to unlock new boards or to get it.
7428380	7429380	I don't know.
7429380	7432300	That's what I'm reading, but you know what, here's the thing.
7432300	7436180	So if you want to check it out, it's pro it's free to play.
7436180	7437180	So check it out.
7437180	7438180	You don't like it.
7438180	7441420	Or if it's just bullshit with the fucking microtransactions, delete, delete.
7441420	7445140	I mean, it's, that's the easiest thing I could recommend.
7445140	7447540	Comments from our chat over at a Twitch TV vog network.
7447540	7450180	Uh, DJ Rama S says, I fucking love lemmings.
7450180	7451540	Pretty, pretty simple comment there.
7451540	7452980	But I mean, it looks like lemmings.
7452980	7453980	It looks pretty cool.
7453980	7458380	It's just, I, I, uh, what's that wheel?
7458380	7462420	I just saw it spin a wheel and like you get like super lemmings or different things, but
7462420	7463420	character lemmings.
7463420	7464420	Oh Lord.
7464420	7465420	Anyway.
7465420	7469340	Uh, Brack, the man has played this a little bit, a comment here saying I'm a pretty hardcore
7469340	7474940	lemmings fan and I've been playing a bunch of this mobile game and what a bummer.
7474940	7475940	I'm sorry.
7475940	7476940	That's fine.
7476940	7479180	I've been playing a bunch of it and I hate it.
7479180	7483100	I don't know why, but I can't stop playing it.
7483100	7484100	I hear that.
7484100	7486660	Uh, Dr. C says I did like lemmings on super Nintendo.
7486660	7488780	I think we rented it once or twice back then.
7488780	7489780	Yeah.
7489780	7492980	That was around the time that it was, you know, really at its peak on PC was like lemmings
7492980	7498020	and lemmings too, you know, with all the music on the ad lib card and all that stuff back
7498020	7499020	in the day.
7499020	7500020	So yeah.
7500020	7501020	The originals were great.
7501020	7503380	I had lemmings two on PC and lemmings one on NES.
7503380	7505400	They did a PlayStation version, didn't they?
7505400	7506400	They had to.
7506400	7507400	They probably did.
7507400	7508400	Super lemmings.
7508400	7513900	Funny enough, the last lemmings game that came out was a PlayStation mobile title.
7513900	7519780	So I think it was also a mobile port as well, but it was also on a PSP and Vita.
7519780	7520780	So they have that.
7520780	7525300	Um, but I mean, it's all right.
7525300	7526300	All right.
7526300	7529500	Well, uh, this is, you know, we were talking about Kingdom Hearts three a little bit ago
7529500	7534220	and some people are getting an even better deal than, uh, the, uh, pre-order at a cheap
7534220	7535220	price.
7535220	7537300	Some people are already playing it.
7537300	7538380	That's right.
7538380	7542540	Even though the game is not supposed to come out until January 29th, some people already
7542540	7543540	have it.
7543580	7545260	Six weeks in advance.
7545260	7550340	Uh, and this was confirmed, uh, developer, uh, Nomura confirmed copies of Kingdom Hearts
7550340	7552260	three are out there six weeks ahead of schedule.
7552260	7554220	Of course, they didn't say how it happened.
7554220	7559980	If you want to believe rumors, there's some indie retailer in Mexico that put one on the
7559980	7560980	street.
7560980	7561980	I don't know.
7561980	7564200	But my question is how the hell did they have it that far out?
7564200	7569140	That's I really thought it's the, it's the distributor or whoever's, well, it's, it's
7569140	7573860	really, it comes down to Sony's fault because Sony doesn't know any of these distributors
7573860	7578700	shouldn't or companies shouldn't be shipping that product to these distributors that early
7578700	7581860	and they shouldn't be shipping it out to the stores that early and the source shouldn't
7581860	7583220	be putting it out that early.
7583220	7589100	So it's just somehow maybe copies fell off of a truck out of a duplicator or something
7589100	7590100	like that.
7590100	7592660	I don't know, but it shouldn't be out that early.
7592660	7596420	Now here's the interesting thing in the statement from Nomura over on Twitter on the official
7596420	7602740	Kingdom Hearts Twitter is that he's telling people to avoid clips, avoid spoilers, obviously,
7602740	7604420	you know, that's the type of thing he wants to do.
7604420	7607780	I'm sure Twitch is shutting that down as is YouTube.
7607780	7612480	You know, it's, I, I believe it's against Twitch terms of service to stream a game before
7612480	7616980	it's officially out unless of course you have permission, you know, you have a, you're a
7616980	7621740	media outlet or something, but that's, that's special circumstance.
7621740	7628540	But anyway, apparently Nomura confirmed the epilogue and a secret movie, which apparently
7628540	7630860	is some of the biggest spoilers out there.
7630860	7632620	They're not on the disc.
7632620	7635660	They will be released later just in case.
7635660	7637220	And this was the case.
7637220	7642220	So the biggest spoiler, I mean, some spoilers will leak, but the biggest ones can't.
7642220	7645140	They are locked or they're, they're not on the disc.
7645140	7648180	So you have to actually download a day one patch to get it.
7648180	7652020	Uh, yeah, it's released at a later date just in case, so they will not be shown before
7652020	7653500	the game's release.
7653500	7657140	And Nomura continues, we want everybody to equally experience the full game after its
7657140	7658140	release.
7658140	7660340	So we ask for your continued support on its matter.
7660340	7664260	We're grateful that fans have been warning each other already about the spoilers and
7664260	7665380	so on and so on.
7665380	7667340	Do they finally kill Donald Duck?
7667340	7673660	That would be a great, I told you, bitch, if you don't heal me this time, it's over.
7673660	7676980	Heal please.
7677020	7680860	So anyway, I, and I may, maybe that is the, no, I made it up, I made that up, but I know,
7680860	7682180	and they're not going to kill a Disney character.
7682180	7683180	Give me a break.
7683180	7684700	Um, well maybe they do.
7684700	7685700	Maybe that's the gag.
7685700	7686700	Maybe they do.
7686700	7687700	I don't know.
7687700	7689700	They might kill one of the square characters, but they're not going to kill a Disney character.
7689700	7690700	So I don't know.
7690700	7695060	So I don't know if it's those kinds of spoilers or, you know, so and so was X, Y, Z all along
7695060	7698580	or what it is, but just be careful surfing the internet.
7698580	7701420	There's a lot of people that are very sensitive about spoiler stuff.
7701420	7705740	So, um, you know, but, but like on the, the Kingdom Hearts, Reddit and stuff, they're
7705740	7709760	not letting people talk about it and those sorts of things.
7709760	7713460	So just keep it in your pants till January 29th when everybody can play it.
7713460	7718820	But it is, it's fascinating that it did leak this soon.
7718820	7720820	You know what I mean?
7720820	7721820	Yes.
7721820	7722820	Yeah.
7722820	7728220	Um, what happens though, if you are somebody perhaps in Mexico or in another country or
7728220	7732620	in a remote area, like in Alaska where you don't have a strong internet connection to
7732620	7735400	download this stuff on a day one patch.
7735400	7737400	Now what do you do?
7737400	7740500	I think that's a good question too, is it's like, well, this move kind of screws those
7740500	7741620	people.
7741620	7744460	It's gotta be a day one patch that they're doing that and they can't like, what if I
7744460	7746140	can't connect to the internet and do it?
7746140	7751020	So is it, are we just at the point where it's like, if you don't have internet, you shouldn't
7751020	7752820	have a piece PlayStation four.
7752820	7755220	Is that just where we're, is that where game companies are at?
7755220	7757100	Yeah, that's interesting.
7757100	7762420	I really feel like that is just kind of like the unspoken, like nobody wants to say that.
7762420	7765220	And I'm not saying that, but the industry, the industry is saying that with what these
7765220	7768580	actions here is their basis to say, if you don't have internet, maybe PlayStation four
7768580	7774220	isn't for you or, or Xbox one or you know, anything that is, is really online a lot.
7774220	7778780	And I think this may be especially so with PlayStation five and what we get to for the
7778780	7784340	next generation and act Efton point act Efton chat says it is what it is, Robin, that there's
7784340	7785340	really nothing.
7785340	7788300	Not going to make anybody not buy the game because they're going to have to download
7788300	7789300	a huge day.
7789300	7790300	One patch.
7790300	7793300	It's not, that's not going to change anybody's mind.
7793300	7797540	No, you might have one or two Twitter, crazy people that are like, this is an outrage,
7797540	7800820	but it's just, it's just not, it's not going to change people's mind.
7800820	7806500	I mean, it's, it's the day and age where like, you know, of course you have internet.
7806500	7808660	What don't you have internet?
7808660	7809660	Don't you have phones?
7809660	7812740	Don't you have a phone?
7812740	7816060	Just a few more stories before we try to get to the Skype line tonight, and then we'll
7816060	7817060	wrap up.
7817060	7819860	I don't know if Skype is going to work tonight, you guys though, but we'll try.
7819860	7825980	It's going to be so long story short, um, the Skype thing on the old, the old thing,
7825980	7827820	like finally died.
7827820	7830820	And so I have to get Alan to do, since we're going to be off next week, I have to get Alan
7830820	7834940	to do the upgrade on this computer so that way I can run the new stuff and then we'll
7834940	7836140	be able to do that again.
7836140	7838940	Or I've got to be able to do it over here, but long story short, I got to run it off
7838940	7839980	my phone.
7839980	7841700	But I think in this period, we're going to be gone.
7841700	7845140	I can get Alan to do those upgrades in this PC and then I'll be, I'll be all good and
7845140	7849940	can run the new Skype and have this on windows 10 and all that stuff and, and be set.
7849940	7850940	So that'll be nice.
7850940	7855220	But yeah, they finally killed Skype on the old windows, which we knew was coming in like
7855220	7856380	November or something like that.
7856380	7860300	So Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, filthy animal.
7860300	7863940	So all right, anyhow, uh, let's get to a few more stories.
7863940	7864940	Loki.
7864940	7871400	So Blizzard is going to be, if you are going to be cheating in Overwatch or breaking rules,
7871400	7873660	it's going to go on your permanent record.
7873660	7877260	They're going to have this, I'm going to note this in your file, the, yes, they're this
7877260	7878560	Overwatch league.
7878560	7884520	Uh, they've got a discipline tracker that's basically going to log any sort of infractions
7884520	7889360	that players have, um, in different events and you'll be able to actually view those
7889360	7890360	infractions.
7890360	7896680	Um, they said that the tracker is, uh, seven players have already been penalized according
7896680	7897680	to the tracker.
7897680	7905160	Um, and of course, league play doesn't start until February 14th, but, um, they're going
7905160	7911440	to be conducting, I guess, full reviews of players conduct in history and, um, gamers
7911440	7912440	as well.
7912440	7918100	Um, when they're picked up by teams and just going to be, it's, um, apparently players
7918100	7923040	who are not in an Overwatch league team could face suspensions or fines if they returned
7923040	7924600	to league play.
7924600	7931520	Um, but yeah, it's, it's interesting that they're really keeping track of all that stuff.
7931520	7935360	Uh, of course, you know, they've been punishing them for other things other than breaking
7935360	7940120	rules, but like making, you know, racist, shitty things on their Twitch streams and
7940120	7941120	stuff.
7941120	7942120	Yeah.
7942120	7943120	Yeah.
7943120	7944120	We know about that.
7944120	7945560	So I was, I was, I was, when we brought this up, I was fascinated, like how many people
7945560	7952600	were already on it and it seems like the most major infraction is some type of like bot,
7952600	7956280	bot botting, um, like power leveling and a low B account.
7956280	7957280	What do they call it?
7957280	7958280	Thank you.
7958280	7961000	So it's been count boosting for two account boost account boosting.
7961000	7962000	That's what it is.
7962000	7966040	And that's when you get like a high level player who plays something low, like a throwaway
7966040	7968960	account or something to play against like lower level players.
7968960	7973600	Or, uh, I want to say it has something to do with like helping people get up into the
7973600	7975340	big ranks fast.
7975340	7979120	Like basically you go play on a low account, you play really, really, really well and you
7979120	7981840	kind of like boost the skill level of that account.
7981840	7985440	So whoever really wants to play it can play with higher level people, if that makes sense.
7985440	7988400	I don't know why you would do this, but people probably play pay money for this.
7988400	7989400	Yeah.
7989400	7992120	They have had one person that's been a find a thousand dollars for account sharing.
7992120	7997760	Uh, one person that was suspended three games for selling an account and obstructing league
7997760	7998760	off.
7998760	8000960	Is it official, official investigation?
8000960	8001960	Then try to hide it.
8001960	8004120	Uh, act F says it's called smurfing as well.
8004120	8005880	I knew there was another term for that.
8005880	8006880	Yeah.
8006880	8007880	So interesting.
8007880	8010520	Uh, when the new, the new season of the league hasn't even started.
8010520	8012560	Um, and I know they unveiled all the new teams.
8012560	8014200	There's a lot of new teams out there.
8014200	8019200	Uh, I did not see if there were any more women maybe with all these expansion teams.
8019200	8023000	Cause you know, I was kind of like, where are the women at?
8023000	8026560	And uh, the two I looked at didn't have any, but to be fair, I haven't looked at all the
8026560	8028460	new teams, so I don't know.
8028460	8033240	But I'm, I'm preparing myself to be extremely disappointed that we're not progressing much
8033240	8034240	in that.
8034240	8037980	But is it because they're just not allowing women to play or is it just because women
8037980	8039400	just don't want to do it?
8039960	8042940	I think they aren't trying hard enough to find women.
8042940	8044120	That's kind of what it is.
8044120	8047480	Or, you know, recruit, train, build up women.
8047480	8048480	You know what I mean?
8048480	8052320	I think there's, there's, there's tons of women out there who love Overwatch.
8052320	8055880	Like go to any anime convention and people that are dressing up and a lot of people posting
8055880	8060440	online, there's tons of women that love Overwatch and I'm, I'm sure just like there's plenty
8060440	8062640	of boys who want to get good at it.
8062640	8065920	There's plenty of girls who want to get good at it and are trying to get good at it too.
8065960	8072040	But for whatever reason, we're just, because gaming has typically been a very bro culture,
8072040	8075680	and I've kind of addressed this before, I don't want to retry the wheel too much, but
8075680	8080840	you know, we're just not making those kinds of opportunities and we're not, you know,
8080840	8081840	it's great.
8081840	8085040	We have at least one, but I don't want just a token.
8085040	8090520	You know, there should be several women in the league for folks to look up to and aspire
8090520	8091520	to be.
8091520	8093640	But again, I have not looked at all the new teams.
8093640	8098560	If somebody wants to correct me and let me know there's, there's more folks joining Aguirre,
8098560	8099560	that would be fantastic.
8099560	8104800	But, oh yeah, and Act F points out, there's a lot of Overwatch girl streamers and they're
8104800	8105800	pretty good.
8105800	8107200	Don't know if they're pro level players.
8107200	8111660	Well, you know, it's, you have to kind of open, you start at the local level with the
8111660	8113300	tournaments and things like that.
8113300	8117520	But if the tournament culture is toxic to women and not accepting women and women get
8117520	8121760	in there and they just get like awkwardly hit on and you know, and I'm probably not
8121760	8122880	the right person to talk about this.
8122880	8127280	You know, maybe Dar Sakura or other women out there can talk about some of the experiences
8127280	8130480	of weirdos at these events or not feeling welcomed.
8130480	8135520	And I think what we can do as dudes is just welcome everybody.
8135520	8136520	That's all we have to do.
8136520	8138320	Make sure everybody feels welcome.
8138320	8144000	It seems that a lot of people that are like focused on being very good in like video games
8144000	8149360	tend to be a bit more introverted and socially awkward and don't necessarily know how to
8149360	8153200	conduct themselves normally around people in general.
8153200	8156200	We can correct that appropriately too.
8156200	8161280	We can call that out and say, Hey, like you really shouldn't say that to somebody.
8161280	8163040	You know, we can do that too.
8163040	8164040	You know what I mean?
8164040	8166040	And that's probably missing to be fair.
8166040	8167040	That's probably a big part of it.
8167040	8169400	So anyway, I didn't mean to retread that whole ground.
8169400	8171420	Sorry, but I had to come up and I do.
8171420	8173560	So it's, it's something I feel strongly about.
8173560	8174560	All right.
8174560	8178200	Anyway, uh, we do have one more story for you guys tonight and it is about the, this
8178200	8180160	brand new toy for kids.
8180160	8182840	I don't know if it's something your kids are probably too old for this at this point because
8182840	8187280	it's a new Fisher Price toy and it looks like, it looks like an Xbox controller.
8187280	8188960	So it's like something for like babies.
8188960	8192400	It looks like an Xbox controller with little like numbers and letters all over it.
8192400	8198840	But here's the hilarious thing is that apparently somebody at Fisher Price actually programmed
8198840	8201640	up up, down, down, left, right, left, right.
8201640	8205520	Be a start into this controller.
8205560	8210560	So when you do it, it actually like will like flash and play a special sound and all this
8210560	8211560	stuff.
8211560	8214560	So it's kind of like, it's really one of those funny things that they did there.
8214560	8215560	So it's awesome.
8215560	8216560	Yeah.
8216560	8219280	So it actually will like, you know, call out all the letters and shapes and all that stuff.
8219280	8220280	It's kind of fun.
8220280	8222720	So a little, a little hidden secret thing that they did there.
8222720	8228240	So um, cute is the type of thing you'd buy for a new kid.
8228240	8229240	New baby.
8229240	8230240	Yeah.
8230240	8231240	Yeah.
8231240	8232240	New baby.
8232240	8233240	Probably more so, but something that the adult, cause you know, sometimes you can't help it.
8233240	8234240	You can't play with your baby's toys.
8234240	8235680	You're like, you kind of play with it a little bit.
8235680	8236680	You're going to try.
8236680	8239440	Well, somebody did clearly.
8239440	8241440	Clearly it's like, Oh, Hey.
8241440	8242440	Yeah.
8242440	8243440	All right.
8243440	8247560	So anyhow, um, I'm going to try to get Skype open here in a moment.
8247560	8250800	I needed to do this on my cell phone, but I got to sign out of my other account to do
8250800	8251800	that.
8251800	8254160	So while I'm switching that over on my phone, uh, Loki, I don't know if you have any last
8254160	8255400	minute stories.
8255400	8261480	Um, if our Skype line is kind of flopping tonight as well, you can also feel free to,
8261480	8267240	uh, send us questions in our chat room, uh, over at Twitch TV and we'll get to some of
8267240	8270700	those, um, questions in chat as well.
8270700	8272600	So we'll get to that here shortly.
8272600	8276520	I just have to switch over cause I'm signed into my personal account right now and I'm
8276520	8278580	going to switch over to the orange launch radio account and then we can start taking
8278580	8279580	some calls.
8279580	8282920	So while we wait for that, I don't know if we have any, uh, last minute stories, last
8282920	8283920	minute stories.
8283920	8287640	We can talk a little bit about the Soulja boy game console and I mean, okay, I'll be
8287640	8288640	fast.
8288640	8289640	Long story short.
8289640	8296160	Um, he is drop shipping these like retro game consoles that you see like in like mall kiosks
8296160	8297160	and stuff like that.
8297160	8303000	Basically these consoles that emulate other systems and have like all these illegal roms
8303000	8304000	thrown on there.
8304000	8309400	Um, and then he's calling them the Soulja boy game consoles and stuff and it's like,
8309400	8314160	that's bad enough at as it is, that's these really shitty Chinese knockoff consoles that
8314160	8315440	have stolen roms in there.
8315440	8319240	But then he's just doubling down on that shit basically when people are calling him out
8319240	8323280	on it and saying, Hey Nintendo, I, you might want to take a look at this because there's
8323280	8327680	fucking NES roms on this shit and then Ted has come after people for a lot less.
8327680	8332240	Uh, so now he's just like, you know, fuck all you guys, I don't give a fuck of what
8332240	8333240	Nintendo does.
8333240	8335720	You know, come at me bro type of shit.
8335720	8341700	And so, you know, he's been posting stuff on Twitter and that's been not so necessarily
8341700	8347780	nice and um, to which people have basically said like myself, that's not going to end
8347780	8352620	well for you sir, but it'll be interesting to see how that goes.
8352620	8353860	All right, let's see if this works.
8353860	8354860	I'm going to try to do it live.
8354860	8356060	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
8356060	8358060	Who's this?
8358060	8360580	Oh, I'm not hearing it.
8360580	8361580	Hold on.
8361580	8362580	Rage nator.
8362580	8364180	Uh, it might be cause my volume is all the way down.
8364180	8365180	Try again.
8365180	8366180	Rage nator.
8366180	8371740	Oh, I was worried about, wait, maybe, maybe the issues over here.
8371740	8372740	Hold on.
8372740	8374740	I'm going to try to fix one thing over here real quick.
8374740	8375740	I don't know.
8375740	8376740	Live radio folks.
8376740	8377740	I know.
8377740	8378740	That's television.
8378740	8379740	Oh, you know what?
8379740	8380740	No.
8380740	8381740	I had this knob all the way down, so I bet that's why we couldn't hear him.
8381740	8382740	Try again.
8382740	8383740	Rage nator.
8383740	8384740	Are you there?
8384740	8385740	Can you hear me now?
8385740	8386740	Yes, we can.
8386740	8387740	Good.
8387740	8388740	I just needed to touch the knob.
8388740	8389740	All right.
8389740	8390740	Anyway.
8390740	8392740	Um, I can link that very well.
8392740	8393740	Thank you.
8393740	8394740	What's on your mind tonight?
8394740	8395740	Rage nator.
8395740	8401740	Uh, well since I already asked the question to Bobby, I can't, I didn't ask you now, especially
8402740	8405740	since this will be your last show for the year.
8405740	8412900	Um, what would you say is, uh, your game of the year or games?
8412900	8414400	Game of the year or games.
8414400	8418260	We're going to address this a little bit on our first episode back to give us a little
8418260	8421520	time to play more games, but give us an early preview.
8421520	8424340	What do you think is in contention for your game of the year?
8424340	8426740	Loki, what do you think is in contention for your game of the year?
8426740	8430500	Um, contention, I would say probably Super Mario Odyssey because I picked up my Switch
8430500	8431580	in April.
8431580	8435100	So I mean for me that was kind of, you know, it was a really good game.
8435100	8439300	So um, yeah, I'd probably be one of them.
8439300	8443460	I really like, I didn't play a ton of games this year, at least I don't remember.
8443460	8448340	I have to go back and think about it, but I would say absolutely expect to hear Tetris
8448340	8449900	Effect in my list somewhere.
8449900	8453260	I just haven't decided where it's going to be yet.
8454260	8464380	Yeah, um, now, uh, you know, I'm not totally sure if I guessed this last week or not, uh,
8464380	8471660	but just in case I did not, um, seeing as Steam is having their Christmas sale right
8471660	8474540	now, did you pick up anything?
8474540	8478340	Not yet, but I'll probably go through my wish list later because I did see some games were
8478340	8480940	down to like $5 or something like that.
8480940	8485100	Look guys, I have Rage Nator trapped in the box, just like I had Bot Culture last week.
8485100	8488980	Get me out, get me out!
8488980	8493820	But not yet because thankfully Loki already bought me the Katamari Damacy, that wasn't
8493820	8498620	technically a sale though, but that was a Steam wish list purchase of sorts.
8498620	8505340	So that's kind of where my holiday playtime has been, at least so far.
8505340	8508620	Oh, excellent choice.
8508620	8509620	I agree.
8509620	8510620	What about you?
8510660	8511660	Do you have anything?
8511660	8513180	Like, tell us one game real quick.
8513180	8523380	Uh, well, um, I only got one thing, a piece of DLC, it's the Deluxe, uh, Edition Upgrade
8523380	8532820	to, um, what was the game, uh, Shadow Warrior 2, uh, that DLC is normally like $10, it was
8532820	8538620	75% off, um, I already had the game for free.
8538660	8546460	I only got the DLC because, for the soundtrack and to a lesser degree, the diary book, but,
8546460	8550860	um, that was really the only thing I could have before, I just barely scraped together
8550860	8553380	the $250 for that, so.
8553380	8558260	Well, there's also still a lot of time, because the sale goes on until what, like June, or
8558260	8559260	June?
8559260	8560260	June.
8560260	8561260	Until June!
8561260	8562260	I don't like it.
8562260	8566900	January 3rd, yeah, there it is, and it's January 3rd at 10am, so, um, you know, early in the
8566900	8570060	morning on January 3rd, but it's going through January 3rd, and I'm sure there's gonna be
8570060	8574380	a lot of people that will get, like, gift cards and things that they get over the holiday
8574380	8577900	that they'll want to spend on the store, and it seems like Steam no longer, like, I remember
8577900	8581680	they used to do this whole, it's on sale for this much, for these four hours, they kind
8581680	8583020	of just stopped doing that, because they really-
8583020	8584740	They do different things each day.
8584740	8589860	It switches up, I like to, I tend to go to the Game Deals subreddit, and I watch stuff
8589860	8592580	through there, because they'll tell you, like, all these different sites that things are
8592580	8597060	on sale, and you may even see, like, free games, like Humble was offering, like, a free
8597060	8599380	LEGO game last week, and a free LEGO game this week, so.
8599380	8600380	Oh, cool.
8600380	8601380	I've been adding stuff-
8601380	8603180	Oh, is it, doesn't the Epic store start giving away games?
8603180	8608020	Yeah, Epic Store is doing Subnautica right now, so you can pick that up, um, so you may
8608020	8611580	want to do that, I think I already have that, though, so I haven't really picked it up yet,
8611580	8613060	I may do it anyways, but.
8613060	8617140	Your gaming backlog isn't big enough, oh, I did see that, and it's on Loki's screen,
8617140	8618140	right now, so Caliber-
8618140	8619900	Hey, and look how many games I have right now!
8619900	8621700	No, 573, no Konami!
8621700	8622700	Yeah.
8622700	8627340	Uh, Soul Caliber 6 is 33% off, so I may, that may be the one that finally gets me.
8627340	8632380	Alright, well, Rage Nator, I'm gonna let you go to try to see if we get any more calls
8632380	8633380	in, okay, buddy?
8633380	8634380	Yeah, sure.
8634380	8639980	Uh, one thing, uh, before I, uh, do let you go, uh, just in case, you know, just in case,
8639980	8646140	there's, uh, some people that, uh, listen to this show, but don't necessarily listen
8646140	8649620	to Bobby's show, um, right now-
8649660	8653100	Which isn't a good life choice, by the way, but, that's fair, there's only so many hours
8653100	8654100	in a day, fine.
8654100	8659940	Yeah, um, I mentioned, at least mentioned in Bobby's show, if you happen to have, uh,
8659940	8667340	Xbox 360 or, uh, Xbox One, if you go onto their video store, they're having something
8667340	8673220	going on, uh, where they're giving away free first seasons, a lot, a lot of anime series,
8673220	8679380	so if you happen to like anime, or just looking for something to watch, anything to watch?
8680100	8682300	Free entertainment, might as well grab it.
8682300	8686140	Makes sense, give away the first season to get people to buy season two and three, makes
8686140	8687140	sense, makes sense.
8687140	8689220	All right, buddy, thanks for the tip, have a good one, okay?
8689220	8690740	Yeah, all right, have a good one, bye.
8690740	8691740	Yep, you too, bye-bye now.
8691740	8696940	I swear to God, I don't remember half of these games that I purchased these.
8696940	8701580	I need to, like, seriously, well, first off, I need to find a place to do streaming in
8701580	8705860	my house, aside from my garage, I wish it wasn't all in my garage, the house is just
8705860	8709900	not that big, but then I need to go back and play all of these games, just randomly
8709900	8716580	pick a game off my Steam list every day, and just do a stream of stuff, cause I have, like,
8716580	8728300	I don't even know where I got half of this stuff, this is ridiculous, um, let's see.
8728300	8731420	That was, okay, now I can, that was weird, because somebody called, and then it like
8731420	8735820	disconnected, it wouldn't connect the call, so I had to call them, isn't that weird?
8735820	8739340	Yeah, Skype is all sorts of broken.
8739340	8744220	Well, let's be real, the way I got it set up right now is like super crazy, but it works,
8744220	8746260	so who are we gonna trap in our box now?
8746260	8749580	Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio, who's this?
8749580	8754860	You can't say I'm trapped in a box, because I'm used to living in a box, I'm currently
8754860	8758060	living in a box as we speak, okay?
8758060	8762740	Cause you live in New York City, and how much are you paying for that shoebox?
8762740	8767580	I can't even joke, we're not that far from San Francisco, and it's worse in San Francisco
8767580	8769020	if you can believe it.
8769020	8774880	Oh, I believe it, but it's like I tell people, you walk into my apartment, I have a galley
8774880	8775880	kitchen, okay?
8775880	8780980	And the galley kitchen is like six feet, and then you turn around, and that's the boiler
8780980	8787380	room, once you come out, it turns into this square, where, if I drop a piece of paper
8787380	8792180	my place is a mess, but on the plus side, you can't see it, but the diagonal across
8792180	8797460	from me is the coffee pot, the toaster oven, the air fryer, the popcorn machine, and the
8797460	8801060	microwave, and the fridge, so I'm good.
8801060	8805660	I love it, I love it, you know what, and you live in New York City, one of the most fabulous
8805660	8812020	places in the world, so you know what, it's awesome, but I bet it's great when you bring
8812020	8813020	the ladies over.
8813020	8819620	See, there's a reason why I got rid of the bed and put a futon in, I'm like, I get it.
8819620	8822020	They're all living in shoeboxes too, Rama.
8822020	8829500	Some of them, some of them, I'm just saying, I like to entertain my ladies, but I don't,
8829500	8833780	they understand I'm in a small shoebox, I just don't want them to get, well, you know,
8833780	8838580	like that's why I got rid of the bed, and put in a futon so it looks like a friggin'
8838580	8839580	couch.
8839580	8844080	Nice, hold on, I'm trying to see if I can, wait, how do I do this, how do I show you
8844080	8845080	my video?
8845080	8846320	Are you seeing our video?
8846320	8849060	I'm seeing your video.
8849660	8850660	Are you seeing me?
8850660	8855020	Yes, I see you, I see the Final Fantasy IX poster behind you, the Borderlands 2 poster
8855020	8856020	behind you.
8856020	8861620	I want you to see this guy, down here, I'm showing you Mr. Smoosh is like down on the
8861620	8865740	ground right here, so sorry, I can't change the whole camera setup right now, but anyway,
8865740	8869820	sorry, completely derailed the show to show off Mr. Smoosh to one individual, but worth
8869820	8870820	it, okay?
8870820	8873460	Alright, anyway, Rama, what do you want to talk to us about tonight?
8873460	8877180	I'm gonna cover that real quick, and I'm gonna tell you something geeky I just did.
8877380	8882940	In response to you, Mr. Smoosh being on camera from time to time, that gave Mako-chan the
8882940	8890020	best idea, so what we're doing when we go live, she is gonna position her camera on
8890020	8891660	our staff cat, Damian.
8891660	8892660	Perfect!
8892660	8897540	And they'll see how long he'll stay there, you know, but you'll hear him purring at least
8897540	8900300	80% of the time because he's a loud son of a bitch.
8900300	8904380	Genius, I love it, no, that's a fantastic idea, why not, why not?
8904380	8908140	And if the other, if the first cat leaves, that's just gonna have to be where Patty's
8908140	8911420	gonna have to be like, oh, I gotta get a second cat.
8911420	8912700	There is a second cat.
8912700	8914700	A third cat.
8914700	8918420	Don't give her any ideas!
8918420	8920900	I can't help it, I can't help it.
8920900	8926140	Oh, you are such a designated enabler, and I cannot wait till the two of you meet.
8926140	8929300	She is going to collect you like Pokemon!
8929300	8930740	Did you hear that, Mr. Smoosh?
8930740	8932620	You're inspiring others.
8932620	8935460	You're inspiring people, he's licking his paws, he doesn't give a shit what I'm telling
8935460	8936460	him.
8936460	8937460	Alright.
8937460	8941180	You didn't have anything gaming to ask us this week?
8941180	8943780	No, I wanted to share something pretty cool.
8943780	8948700	Now, I don't know if you've seen lately, if a lot of people are geeking out their Christmas
8948700	8955180	trees and stuff like that, I got friends who have Funko Pops on theirs, I actually got
8955180	8960980	off my lazy tuchus, did a live stream yesterday, and put together my geeky little tree, and
8960980	8964860	I'm going to see if I can get a little vision of it over here.
8964860	8969180	Which unfortunately is not going to come through on our own Twitch feed, but yes, I do see
8969180	8974380	a silvery tree with the giant ball ornaments that are very standard, and some Christmas
8974380	8976100	lights there.
8976100	8979180	I do see that coming through on this.
8979180	8981860	Yep, we sort of see the tree, yes.
8981860	8986820	And I'm slowly turning it, and if you look carefully, there is a Luigi ornament on the
8986820	8987820	tree.
8987820	8989580	Oh, there sure is.
8989580	8990580	How about that?
8990580	8997680	Yeah, so I wanted to share that off, but I also wanted to know, are y'all geeking up
8997680	8999180	your holiday trees this year?
8999180	9000180	I'm just curious about that.
9000180	9005220	So we didn't set up a tree this year because of the cat, actually, because the place where
9005220	9008940	we would usually set up the tree, Smush is not going to allow that to happen.
9008940	9013100	So he would knock that shit over so fast, it would make your head spin.
9013100	9017980	But when we do set it up, somebody got us an ornament set that actually has a Playstation
9017980	9019540	controller, a Nintendo controller.
9019540	9023500	I mean, they're not official, they kind of look like knockoffs, but they're close enough.
9023500	9027700	So little knockoff controller ornaments, and it's really cute and nerdy.
9027700	9032460	I like that, but I don't know if you've seen, but there's actually people who have posted
9032460	9038600	pictures of their Christmas trees where it's halfway decorated, and the rest is just bare
9038600	9044340	so the cat can't reach it, or they put up a clear plastic border around it where the
9044340	9046500	cat can't get past it.
9046500	9051300	I have seen that, and it's something to definitely consider for a future year.
9051300	9054820	But the thing is, we like to put it in the window so you can see our tiny little tree
9054820	9059260	from the street, but that is the exact spot where Mr. Smush goes every day.
9059260	9060260	That's his TV.
9060260	9063300	He goes to perch in the window and look at all the other cats that run out in the street
9063300	9066020	and wonder, why can't I be outside playing with them?
9066020	9068700	And it's like, you're not built for that, kitty.
9068700	9070900	Somebody wanted you to be a show kitty.
9070900	9074740	Oh, he just looked at me like, what do you mean?
9075340	9076340	Alright.
9076340	9077340	That's precious.
9077340	9079900	Alright, Rahm, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up, but thank you so much for the
9079900	9080900	call.
9080900	9081900	Hey, no problem.
9081900	9084500	I also had to represent my quote unquote ugly Christmas shirt.
9084500	9085860	Hey, I loved it.
9085860	9089940	It's Fra-gee-lay with the leg lamp for those obviously that can't see this call.
9089940	9090940	Love it.
9090940	9091940	Alright, take care, buddy.
9091940	9092940	Alright, take care.
9092940	9093940	Alright, bye bye.
9093940	9094940	Bye.
9094940	9095980	Alright, there you go.
9095980	9097260	That's gonna do it for our Skype line tonight.
9097260	9100620	I'm not gonna take any more calls on that for right now.
9100620	9103180	Let me see though, I wanted to see if there were any questions in chat, and then also
9103180	9105980	just check in one more time to see if there's any last minute stories.
9105980	9109320	I mean, I know it's been a very slow news week, but I also I've seen you prodding over
9109320	9112900	there, Loki, while I've been trying to look at all this stuff.
9112900	9116860	I'm just looking for something and not finding anything.
9116860	9123260	I am noticing in chat, they're talking about their own nerdy trees here is that let's see.
9123260	9126580	Black Mamba says I'm gonna get a doggy crate for my tree.
9126580	9130060	I think I saw a post on Facebook earlier that was something like, why aren't my presence
9130060	9132940	barking yet?
9132940	9133940	Let's see.
9133940	9136780	Brack the man says we have a regular tree and then a Harry Potter tree.
9136780	9139340	Well, that sounds like fun.
9139340	9140940	So very cool.
9140940	9141940	All right.
9141940	9143500	Well, I guess that's it.
9143500	9147260	I guess we're about to wrap things up and get to our final thoughts tonight.
9147260	9148540	We will not be back next week.
9148540	9151140	We're gonna take next week off the 30th for the holidays.
9151140	9153540	I know Loki has some family stuff going on.
9153540	9155220	Dark soccer will still be out.
9155220	9159740	So I may do something on my personal channel, but it won't be anything like OLR, but just
9159740	9161780	play a game with listeners or something.
9161780	9164940	Or I might, I might just take a night off myself and go out, do something I don't usually
9164940	9165940	get to do Sunday night.
9165940	9166940	So we'll see.
9166940	9171180	But I hope everybody has a wonderful Christmas for those that celebrate a fantastic new year
9171180	9173020	and anything else you might celebrate this time of year.
9173020	9175060	I hope it goes very, very well for you.
9175060	9177680	And we are so looking forward to continuing this in 2019.
9177680	9181100	You know, this last week and this week, these are the first two episodes on Twitch and now
9181100	9183940	it's like, you know, we get to do next next time, huh?
9183940	9184940	Get the audio in the intro.
9184940	9185940	That was my fault.
9185940	9186940	We get to open that.
9186940	9188940	Oh, the time capsule.
9188940	9189940	Yes.
9189940	9190940	Yeah.
9191100	9195300	We showed this on Twitch now, sorry, podcast listeners, but now we actually get to, you're
9195300	9196300	right.
9196300	9197300	This is something to look forward to.
9197300	9198300	Sorry.
9198300	9200940	You're gonna have to look at my behind a little bit there, but look, you can actually see
9200940	9203820	that we're going to open this guy in the new year.
9203820	9207600	That's our little Vader time capsule that we made and I'm trying not to show my butt
9207600	9213900	on stream or my, my naked rear end or something there.
9213900	9215620	So trying to move around carefully there.
9215620	9216660	There you go.
9216660	9218180	So that is something.
9218180	9219180	Yeah.
9219220	9220540	That Spyro says, Oh yeah.
9220540	9221540	Don't forget about the time capsule.
9221540	9222540	Dark to see.
9222540	9223540	Oh yeah.
9223540	9224540	Glad Loki remembered.
9224540	9225540	So good job.
9225540	9226540	So there it is.
9226540	9228700	You have the time capsule is, uh, gonna, gonna happen there.
9228700	9232100	So all right.
9232100	9233100	That's it.
9233100	9234380	We're going to wrap up here.
9234380	9236740	Another, uh, another day here at orange launch radio.
9236740	9239300	Thanks so much for tuning into the show and listening to us.
9239300	9241880	If you like what you heard here at orange laundry, no, please tell a friend or five
9241880	9243420	about this feed.
9243420	9246680	Please feel free to follow and all that stuff here on Twitch.
9246680	9250600	We're still making our way to a affiliate, hopefully soon, and we'll be able to do the
9250600	9252640	subscriptions and all that fun stuff as well.
9252640	9258640	Uh, loving the clips you guys, uh, made, don't clip that last thing, Jesus, uh, for the most
9258640	9262040	part, loving the clips you guys made and, uh, all the other stuff too.
9262040	9263040	This is great.
9263040	9265440	I'm loving Twitch and we're just going to build on it in 2019.
9265440	9270680	My whole goal is to improve one thing every show, and then, uh, we'll, we'll get it.
9270680	9275480	We'll get in a really good place, uh, you know, by the time mid 2019 rolls around, but
9275480	9277520	we definitely need, uh, to build up our following here.
9277520	9280840	So tell a friend or two about the show, a nice five star review on a place like iTunes
9280840	9281840	goes a long way as well.
9281840	9284280	For those of you that are still listening on the podcast feed, Hey, we're doing it for
9284280	9285280	you guys too.
9285280	9287020	And, uh, thanks for listening that way.
9287020	9291360	And we appreciate a nice review wherever you may, uh, consume your podcast.
9291360	9295040	So with that, uh, we're going to wrap up for the night with any final thoughts.
9295040	9297240	Uh, Loki, any final thoughts you have for us tonight?
9297240	9301160	I'm hoping to start streaming again, um, this next week.
9301160	9306940	I really been, it schedule's been just kind of crazy with just like stuff changing last
9306940	9312100	minute, like having to pick up kids and stuff and, um, you know, running out of time plus
9312100	9319660	fighting with my stupid goddamn DVD drive and reading my not so legit disc in the drive
9319660	9321440	to load different mixes on there.
9321440	9325040	So I may have to go back to extreme and just leave it there until I put step mania on the
9325040	9328760	machine, but I'm hoping to put step mania on the machine sooner than later, cause I
9328760	9332800	have all the parts and I just need the, I'm probably gonna build a PC tomorrow cause it's
9332800	9333800	pretty fast.
9333800	9340160	Um, and I got a little windows 10 on there, but I do want to get a, a, a custom theme
9340160	9341560	done for step mania.
9341560	9346400	So hopefully it won't take months to do, but we'll get some working because I want to do
9346400	9349840	a lot of fun stuff and step mania is really going to kind of energize me in the plane
9349840	9353200	more because it'll be not the same set of songs all the time.
9353200	9355400	It'll be like hundreds of songs to play.
9355400	9358440	So it'll be a lot of variety and fun stuff.
9358440	9359440	Awesome.
9359440	9360440	All right.
9360440	9364400	Um, my final thought is, um, looking forward to playing more Katamari and Rossi more stuff
9364400	9365400	in my backlog.
9365400	9368280	Yeah, I haven't really played like any ingress lately.
9368280	9369660	I've kind of like fallen off on that.
9369660	9372120	So hopefully get back on some of that stuff as well.
9372120	9376960	And um, yeah, I'm just, uh, I'm excited to, uh, do more gaming and streaming and focus
9376960	9381540	on a lot of that in 2019 and continue our relationship here on Twitch.
9381540	9384560	And thank you guys so much for joining us and listening to the show tonight.
9384560	9386400	Um, I think that's it.
