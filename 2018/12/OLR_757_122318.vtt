With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
This week, Square has an ace up their sleeve against the Kingdom Hearts League. The release doesn't include the entirety of the game's content. Shock went up to the ability to patch games, maybe? This is just one story. Join us for more on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 757 for this, December the 23rd of 2018, our last show of the year, because we're actually not going to be here next week.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
My bad.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
That's okay, that's okay. Here in studio, myself, Rob Roberts, and Techmaster Loki joining me.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yes, I'm here.

00:53.000 --> 01:03.000
As he does every Sunday night over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, the voice geeks network, where every gamer has a voice, and we do broadcast live every Sunday night at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
And you can check out more great shows at VOG Network dot com, but we are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who had a great show tonight with some Sony PlayStation VR recommendations.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
I know the news is getting a little bit slower this time of year, but we still have some things to talk about tonight.

01:18.000 --> 01:30.000
It's the time of year when everyone does their year-end recaps of, like, best games of 2018 and all the other, like, I don't know, a lot of it was just very, you know, slow news week type of articles.

01:30.000 --> 01:43.000
Just like, here's how I unlock these games, or here's how I got enough platinum coins in, you know, the Nintendo store to be able to unlock this game for free, because I did surveys on websites.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And it's like, why is that an article? That's not an article.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
It's just, it's filler, it's clickbait, because people share that stuff on Facebook and all that.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
It's like, you need the right something, there's nothing going on!

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Okay, fine.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, so I guess I'm looking in chat, and they're saying that the intro did not have audio tonight.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
You'll hear it on the podcast, because I can easily fix it there, but we're learning some new things about video.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
Jason actually did a wonderful video, he actually did the video introduction tonight, and for whatever reason, I must have made a boo-boo on my end and kept the audio muted on it.

02:12.000 --> 02:23.000
So, that's why we started the Twitch thing in 2018, so that we could have a few test episodes, and then in 2019, we'd be like, good to go, and we could really start promoting and all that stuff.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
But, hey, the date's correct.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
The date is correct tonight, you know I have my eyes out for that this time, absolutely.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And lots of great feedback from you guys last week, thanks so much.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm already up to just about 100 followers over on the VOG Network channel, and that's so amazing.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Although I did notice that the ticker on the bottom had the episode number for last week.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh, did it?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
What? Thank you.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
That's weird. I don't even, I don't think the episode number is in the ticker bar.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
That said something. Maybe that was just reading one of the articles.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I don't know, I don't know. Yeah, it's easy to get distracted with all this video.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
So many things.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah, and over in our chat, over at Twitch TV, Act F says Palindrome episode 2. Yes, that's right, 7570s.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
It's the same, forward and backwards. How do you celebrate a Palindrome episode? I'm not sure.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Let's see, going to Run, Jump, Stomp over at Twitch says it's an article because they get paid by the word.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, you know what, I mean, people are still using Facebook and social media and all that stuff.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Twitter is not going to slow down just because it's Christmas Day.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
I mean, for one, not everybody celebrates Christmas, we know that.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
But even that, you know, people work on Christmas, but it's just, you know, I think there's a lot of people too.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't know about your family traditions, but I know in my family on Christmas.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
So we would do, you know, and this was when I was younger, we would do the presents, we would open the gifts,

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
we would do all that exchange. And then it was kind of like after the morning, it's like, all right,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Christmas is kind of done. Hang out till three o'clock for dinner.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
And for me, that would be a great time to go play whatever video game I probably got for Christmas.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
But, you know, it was it's kind of like, oh, well, the holidays are over at that point.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
And sometimes we would go to the movies. That's something we started doing later when I was more in my 20s.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
I would love to do that, except that it's going to be crazy at the movie theaters.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah. And I know we're doing food, though. So like Christmas Day, we're doing at my house.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
Christmas Eve, we're going to my mom's house to go open stuff there, which I just talked to her in the car.

04:16.000 --> 04:27.000
So apparently my my niece is going to be opening some gifts earlier on because she's not going to be able to wait until the evening because the gifts are all going to be there.

04:27.000 --> 04:36.000
So she's going to open her gifts and then she'll have to wait and we'll open our gifts and the kids will open their gifts on Tuesday.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
And they have a lot of stuff. They have a lot of stuff. Any any games that you might benefit from, too, that you actually got your kids?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, this is a bold strategy that I tried in order to get the switch.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
So so we have so my thought originally, because I had get the wife a personal Blu-ray player so she can watch your Grey's Anatomy.

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
No, no, no, no, no. Not like that. So originally my idea was I'm going to get the kids some games for the switch so they could play some new games that they were looking for.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
But then I realized that's games and two, they're going to have games, but they're only going to have one console.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
They're fighting over it. And that's not going to make for a good day for me.

05:13.000 --> 05:22.000
So whereas most people like, well, just they'll get over it. My thought process was, OK, let's buy them each game systems.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
And so they're going to be getting a 2DS and for the Soulja Boy console.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
No, no. And and four games each.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
OK, that's pretty nice. Yes, because apparently, you know, those GameStop cards.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Dad's got money. No, I don't.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
You know, those GameStop cards that you pay for stuff and you get that stupid magazine each month and stuff.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
Well, apparently you accumulate points with that that I was completely unaware of until this week.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.000
And I had like a ton of points that I could redeem for gift cards in the store, which then paid for a bunch of used copies of stuff and no complaints.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
Yes. And plus the 2D 2DS systems, not the 2DS XL, because those are one hundred fifty dollars versus seventy dollars in the game.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
They're very reasonable. And that's and that's what the DS is really like meant to be at this point, is that the DS is really intended to be like that baby's first.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
Not baby, but, you know, like tween slash kid first console.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
So they're going to get it comes preloaded with New Super Mario Brothers 2.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
So they got that Mario Kart 7, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Super Mario Maker for the 3DS.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
And then the one game that they'll fight over because they have different games each.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Josh is getting Super Mario 3D Land because he used to play 3D World.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Oh, sure. He was disappointed when we got rid of the Wii U because he couldn't play that anymore.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
And it's basically the same game. And then Mario Party top one hundred for Danny because he likes playing Mario Party.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
Speaking of Mario, and this is a random tangent, but since you brought it up and we are a video game show, after all, we do we are going to talk.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
If you're new, because we just had our first show on Twitch, even though we've been doing this show for 16 and a half years, since 2002.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
I don't expect that a lot of people necessarily knew what Shoutcast is or was listening to stuff within that.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
So I know this whole Twitch thing is still a little bit newer for us. So we're adjusting to it too.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Hence why we have some bugs like the audio and the intro and things like that.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
But otherwise, we do talk about games, of course, over the next few hours.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
And since you brought up Mario, the Mario, the game that was on the Wii U.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
So what New Super Mario Brothers U gets at Switchport like next month.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
And I totally forgot that that was going to be a thing until I saw some random article.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
The deluxe one has like that in the new Luigi U.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Well, that game is the fault of where Bowsette came from and why we have all that crap.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
I mean, fan art. Because that was the one where you have, what was it, like Toadette or she gets the...

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I can't even remember what it is now, but I know it's where Bowsette started.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Was it in Peachette or something like that?

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Yes, it's Peachette. I think it's like Toadette meets Peach and then there's the whole thing.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
Maybe somebody in our chat remembers what all that is about over at our Twitch TV channel at VOG Network.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
And yeah, something else. So a lot of the feedback from Twitch last week was very positive.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
But I do have a good friend that will always kind of like tell me like,

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
your tag's sticking out, you know, the nitpicky things that are going on and so forth.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
So was kind of giving me the feedback on OLR and saying that like at some points I was like on my phone.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Like I got, oh my God, I got caught because remember you guys couldn't see us before.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
So that was like totally normal.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Is that, yeah, they'll be reading a story and I'd be like checking the headlines, you know,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
what else going on, what's going on with my Twitter and all this other stuff and...

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Catching a Pokemon.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
What Facebook gave me, Pokemon outside. Oh crap, you guys can see that.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And it does look really weird when I do that.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And also probably looks weird when I'm like turning back and forth.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah, because I'm not looking, it's hard to look at the camera and the chat room and the screen and you.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And it's like, where do I look?

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
But I got like, I totally, I'm not like complaining because they're probably watching and like,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
are you really complaining about that on air? But no, I actually thought like, oh crap,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
that is like really good feedback and something like I'm not thinking of with this whole Twitch thing.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
So we are trying to make like small baby steps where I've tried to look at Loki more tonight.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
And but yeah, if you guys wonder like, why do I keep turning away over here?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
It's because you guys' chat is over here and the stories and things I do.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
But as we move into next year and get a little more used to this

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
and get that USB cable that will allow our camera to be further back,

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
we'll probably rearrange the studio a little bit so it's not so weird.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
But remember, we said that when we were going to first go to Twitch,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
the goal was do the same show, but do it on Twitch.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
And there'll just kind of be video there, but you know, we're going to try to,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
I mean the camera's not bad where it's at. I don't know really how much further back are we going to get.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, and I still don't know how when Jamie's back from her break,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
because of course Dark Soccer, she's not here tonight. She's still on her extended work break.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
But when she comes back, I'm not sure to what extent she's going to want to be involved.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
I still really love the idea of a Dr. Claw type thing where you can like see your hand.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
And that whole thing, so I'll talk to her about that.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
So we'll figure out how we'll set all that up, and I'm sure Alan, my husband,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
will be thrilled at rearranging this room completely yet again.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
So there you go.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Run Jump Stomp in chat says, that chair looks really uncomfortable.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
It's fine. You actually, I don't know if it's Loki or me, but Loki, you prefer this to the couch.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Like I was like, you could just sit on the couch, but you kind of like something with the back on that, right?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, this is fine. It's just the couch is really, you sink into it a bit.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
And it was hard to have like the laptop, you know, on a TV tray and be able to do that.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It's a lot easier with this.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, and Bobby Black Wolf calls out from the last show when I walked away.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
And it's like, you know, again, you guys could catch me doing that before,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
but at some point, this little cup of water, I drink a lot of water while doing the show,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
it runs out and I got to go fill up, but I'm going to try my best to hold it till the break tonight.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
But like if there's a potty emergency or something, I'm just going to go.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
That's what you got to do. I'm just going to get up and go.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Or Mr. Smush starts screaming. It is what it is.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Although he's a little more well behaved now.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
He was losing his crap earlier, but I think he's under control now.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah. All right, we're good. All right, well, let's get into news.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
We got some news going on this week.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I know it's a little bit lighter, but we do have some things going on in the news.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
So let's get into it.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
A big thing people are talking about on social media involving the most popular game right now in the world,

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
even if I don't play it as much, but I know tons of people do, it's Fortnite, right?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah, my son plays it a lot now.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Although he doesn't play with people, he just plays the creative mode now.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Because it's just fun for him to mess around with it.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
So apparently there's been some lawsuits regarding the dancing emotes that are in the game.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
So one of the things that Fortnite's known for is these famous dances within the game.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
And of course, apparently now we have Alfonso Ribero.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
What is up with your cat?

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Anyways, smoosh is up on the table where I got it. I'll be back.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Okay. I heard him just like sneezing and whatever.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Right after that whole talk about leaving.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
What are you going to do?

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
So anyways, so with the whole thing being popular in the game, of course,

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
now Alfonso Ribero is basically saying that, hey, you guys stole my dance without even asking.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
And there's definitely been no compensation for it.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
So he filed a lawsuit against Epic Games regarding that.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
But then again, there's also, you know, video out there that TMZ provided saying that,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
oh, hey, you know, he stole the dance from somebody else.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
But I think when he says steal, it's more like he took this part and this part from two other people,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
something that they did, and then he mixed in some other stuff.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
And that's more just like creating your own thing that's not just straight up, right.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
You know, taking something and using it without any sort of permission or whatever.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
But basically saying, you know, hey, Epic has earned record profits off of downloadable content in the game,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
including emotes like Fresh, which is the dance that they're referring to.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Yet Epic has failed to compensate or even ask for permission for Mr. Ribero

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
or use of his likeness and iconic intellectual property.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
I mean, definitely the dances. You could tell where it's from, obviously, in Fresh.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Definitely alluding to Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
But he's not the only one, though, that's also had issue with it.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
So apparently, and I'm not sure who this kid is, but they call him Backpack Kid.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Basically, he was part of a performance that Katy Perry did.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Wait, you don't know Backpack Kid?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I don't know Backpack Kid.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Y'all are gonna regret this Twitch thing.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
No, no, you're not flossing. Fucking sit down right now. Sit down.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
We're not doing this shit. This shit is not happening on our show.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Enough. The line, we're drawing the line there. We're not doing...

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
You look fucking dumb. Just don't do that.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Eventually when my kid comes to the show again, yes, he'll fucking do that.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
But no. We are too damn old to be doing that shit.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
And if we raise $50, we'll go back to Shoutcast.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
So anyways, Backpack Kid, who, you know, of course, made famous flossing.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
You know, the dance of the children.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
So he is, of course, joining the lawsuit as well.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
I thought there was another artist, too, that was basically saying,

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Hey, what the fuck?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
But, I mean, let's be honest here, though.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Like, the Carlton Dance has been a ton of fucking shit.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I mean, they had that emote, and I can remember Saints Row had that shit in there.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
But I guess it's just maybe because they're selling it as a separate thing instead of it being included.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And then, who knows, maybe they'd ask for permission in that game.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
But maybe it's just because they're specifically selling it,

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
and because it's the most popular game right now that it's caught the attention versus Saints Row, who...

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I think that's key, what you're talking about, is how they're selling it.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Because I think, when I think of, like, pop culture dances and games,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
the first thing I remember is World of Warcraft.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, yeah, and they have that in World of Warcraft.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah, like how the Draenei, I think, did the Toonok Dance.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Like, they did a lot of meme stuff that they did.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
And I think the Blood Elf female does Britney Toxic.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
And, you know, they're very mainstream type of stuff.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
And, you know, well, what's funny now is that, you know, because World of Warcraft is, you know,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
over, like, what, like 14 years old at this point,

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
like, a lot of the stuff that's in it is referencing things that were memes, like, 14 years ago.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
But still, you're right, like, dances have been in games for a long time, but in WoW, it was kind of built in.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
So what's the point between, like, parody and, like, making a profit off it?

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Is that really parody when it's just, like, lifting the dance?

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
I think it's just how identical the dance is, maybe.

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
Because you can copyright a dance, but I don't know why this would be liable for, you know,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
some sort of restitution versus something else.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Also, I should mention, though, that they're not just suing Epic Games as well,

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
they're also suing 2K games over NBA 2K, which also apparently has emotes in that game as well.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I thought that was a fucking basketball game.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Why you're doing the Carlton is...

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
No, why? Where's that coming from?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I thought that was, like, a sportsy thing.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Like, I have to admit, I'm not the biggest sports, but I know, like, in football,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
when they get to the end zone and they do a touchdown, like, wasn't there, like, I remember,

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
like, wasn't there the guy, the Tebow or whatever his name was that would always, like,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
pray, take a knee and do that whole thing?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
We don't talk about that now either.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, I know. Now we can't talk about taking a knee in the NFL, but I'm gonna say that for another day.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
So, but anyway, so yeah, I mean, what...

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Or in Destiny. Destiny is another one.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Destiny has that too.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
So, are they, I mean, a lot of questions...

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
I think what it is is because nowadays, games, whether it be a free-to-play game,

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
like, you know, Epic's Fortnite, which, that's fine if they're selling shit like that in the game,

16:57.000 --> 17:06.000
because it's free-to-play, or Destiny and 2K, you know, NBA 2K, which are full $60 games,

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
that you also are paying for microtransaction bullshit as well on top of it,

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
because some of the money is not all of the money, and they need all of the money,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
and that's why they're doing this shit.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
It is gonna raise this, I mean, we've been talking for a long time about how, like,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
you know, intellectual property rights and trademarks and a lot of that stuff

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
really needs to be reevaluated in this digital era,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
because so much, you know, we have so much homegrown stuff even,

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
like the stuff we're doing on Twitch.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
We still don't even, like, really have a question or an answer,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
and we have a question, we don't have an answer to, like,

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
what really is the legality when, like, you play a game and you're talking over it?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Like, who really owns that?

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Do you really own that or does the game maker have a say in that?

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
And, like, sure, a lot of us, because we do stream on Twitch,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
we like to feel like we own it, but I've always said, you know,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
if the game makers wanted to take a cut of some of the biddies,

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
I wouldn't be opposed to it, but there needs to be an established rule,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
a consistent rule, and something that's kind of like the accepted standard

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
of who owns what, because I also don't think the game company should own everything.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
You know, if we're making jokes and things like that, you know,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
like, how does that all play out?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
I think a lot of the DMCA stuff needs to stop anyways,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
just because of how it's being abused.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
I mean, there was a thing this week about a channel that got taken down

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
because a developer didn't like what they were saying about their game,

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
and so they filed copyright strikes against their channel, which...

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That's a YouTube problem. That's why we're on Twitch.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
Just not to be shady, but a little shady, but because, you know,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
it's just, like, YouTube does not stick up for their content creators.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Oh, no, not at all.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Never ever. They always err on the side of ruling against them,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
whereas I feel like, and maybe this is just my perception,

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
but I do feel Twitch, and I'm not just kissing butt because we're here now,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
but I do feel Twitch does a better job of kind of sticking up

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
and being a little more proactive for its user base

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
in some of the things that they do, if that makes sense,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
especially when it comes to things like their muting policy.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I think, you know, it's fair. Like, they have to do what they have to do to be legal,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
and I think what they're doing is kind of fair, and if you, you know, challenge it,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
they have a process to look at it and all that stuff,

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
whereas I feel like YouTube just never errs on the side of the content creators,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
so why would I want to create content for YouTube?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I'm really not motivated to do that.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So, all right.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Going to our chat, Run Jump Stomp reminds us,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Nintendo recently backed off about content creation.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
What's that?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
See what you did?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Oh, yeah.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Now they clip that shit.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Yes, I know. I need to be thinking about that. That's going to happen.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
That's going to happen.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
If the broccoli thing from our last radio-only show had been on this,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
that would have gotten clipped like 5,000 times.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
That actually got me thinking earlier this week, so...

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Clips help spread the show, whatever.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
I don't think... I wanted to tell the kids where they're actually going.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
No, you can't do it till the holidays.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
So, yeah, I think we're not doing that.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I got it. I got it.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Put a bunch of broccoli in a bowl, and then when they eat all the broccoli,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
there's a Disney logo at the bottom.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Well, they're never going to eat all the broccoli.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Well, then they're not going to Disneyland.

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
So, my thought was, though, it would be cool to do a mock Disney logo shirt,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
but just have, let's say, Broccoli Farm in the Disney font,

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
and then we can sell them to our listeners, because they want merch anyways.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Would Disney sue, though?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
It's a parody.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Okay. All right. We'll see what we can do.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
If we... It's the Mickey head, is the hard part.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
No, we wouldn't put the Mickey head. It's just broccoli.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh, okay.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Broccoli in an actual farm, and then it just looks like...

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
All right. Leave that joke two weeks ago.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Back to the Fortnite dances, Loki.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
So, how do you see this ending?

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
I see it going to court, and we'll see if it actually...

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
If they have a case or not.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I say settlement.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
These things always end in a settlement.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Fortnite is pooping out the dollars,

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
and they're just going to pay it off to shut these guys down,

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
but then what's that going to do for the future,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
and other games incorporating dances,

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
which I think, again, I can see where it's a little bit of a problem

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
when you're selling it in the stores as an enhancement,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
or you're getting in the loot box as an enhancement,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
but in World of Warcraft, it was just kind of there.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
It was a little bonus thing. It was a cute thing that they did.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Saints Row, similar thing, right?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah. It was just a silly thing.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Exactly. It was a silly thing.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Or maybe if they want to have the dance,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
maybe they should at least license the song,

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
which I know for the Carlton, there's no real...

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I mean, we all know it goes with Tom Jones.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It's not, watch out, or I'll do that dance too,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
but it's the whole Tom Jones, it's not unusual to be loved by you,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
which isn't really... but you know what I mean.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I know what you mean.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
A lot of times, the dances go with a song,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
so if you pay the money to get the song in your game,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
maybe you could use the dance too,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
but I think it's the whole fact that they are selling the dance

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
as a separate thing, and it's not just incorporated into the game

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
as a pop culture reference,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
which could probably be sold a little more as parody, I guess.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
I think that's where ultimately the legal law lines

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
are kind of drawn a little bit.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
And Fortnite, we'll just have to think of other things to sell,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
either original dances, but we know that's not...

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
People aren't really going to buy original dances.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
They have merch already.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I just bought my Sunday Fortnite 2019 calendar,

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
and apparently they have characters or skins or something like that

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
that were actual... because I was asking them,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
so do they actually have characters in this game?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Because I see this one's named Leviathan,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and he's like, no, that's a skin.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I'm like, okay.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Loki, they're yelling at me in chat,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
because I won't do the Carlton.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
You're yelling at me in chat.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
You don't have enough room. You're going to injure yourself.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
That is not even...

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
That's what I could do with the space I was given.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
That's not even...

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Oh God, I'm having to watch it back.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Exactly. Witness the horror that is.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
All right, anyway.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I want to talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I didn't play a whole ton.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I think I've been busy shopping this week.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I was actually trying to reflect back to what I played,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
and it's mainly just Pokemon Go.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I've just been playing a little bit of that.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
I even forgot to do my stupid mystery box thing to get melted,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
which sucks because it was the double candy event thing,

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
and that would have been really helpful if I had remembered to do it.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
So yeah, I didn't end up doing that,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
and I don't...

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
DDR, I don't think I played too much.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
It just had to...

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
A lot of plans kept changing.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
I had to go places, and so I wasn't able to do that.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
I did try to stream on Friday,

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
and it ended up being an issue where I wanted to load a new mix on there,

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
and I have a drive that's supposed to read that disk fine,

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
and it did, but then when I went to actually load the game after I installed it,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
it just wouldn't read the disk again.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
So then I swapped drives out again to the one that I bought,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
a replacement drive that was supposed to be the most compatible with the disk,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and it won't read anything now,

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
so I had to put the old drive back in there,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
and at that point I was like,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
fuck it, it's too late, I'm just not doing it right now.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
So I have all the parts to build the StepMania PC.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
I have everything now, so I just need to do it.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I may end up doing that tomorrow.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And then I also found out,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
I was trying to figure out what theme I wanted to put on there,

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
and my problem was that the menus were too laggy,

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
and then I ended up finding out by trying to move my StepMania install to my SSD drive.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Not laggy on an official mix, but laggy on your StepMania setup, right?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Laggy on my laptop.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
So it was laggy.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
I mean, it should be fine altogether, because StepMania runs on a toaster.

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
It was laggy in the sense that the menus were kind of lagging as I'm moving stuff around,

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
like there was a little bit of jitter with loading images or something,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
and I couldn't tell why that was,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
and I was trying to find a mix that was pretty smooth

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
because I wanted to build off of it to do a custom theme.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
And so then I was like, hey, you know what, I wonder if it's this hard drive,

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
because I have a 5 terabyte 5400 RPM drive in there and then I have an SSD.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I was like, well, let me put it on my SSD and see if that makes a difference,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
and oh, yep, that was the issue.

25:30.000 --> 25:39.000
So I have a 256 gigabyte NVMe drive, so that's about six times faster than an SSD.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
I mean, it's still technically an SSD, but it's 32 gigabytes per second,

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
so it'll be able to handle, it should be able to handle anything.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
So I'm thinking now I don't have to worry about the lag.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
I just will just pick something and go with that.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
But I don't know.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
I still need to come over and play DDR.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I know I keep promising it.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
I did one of those dumb things I keep saying I'm never going to do again.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
I played one of those online Big Brother type games,

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
but this time there were 32 people in it, and I got to the end.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I'm in the final three.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
So finally, a little bit of payoff, but I'm not going to win.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
I already know I'm not going to win.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
They're actually announcing the winner in an hour.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
It's not going to be me.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
But yeah, so that's been taking up a lot of my time

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
because I try to do a lot of chatting in the evening.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
It would be around a line.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
Apparently I didn't do enough, which is why I'm not going to win, but whatever.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
But I do definitely want to come by at some point and play on your machine

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
because I need to get thin again.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Well, me too.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I've been kind of slacking this week,

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
and also eating 12 breadsticks is not going to be helping me any,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
but I don't care.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I want them.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
So I really do need to get back into it after the year,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
the start of the year again.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
But I haven't really gained that much.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I'm just kind of hovering in the same spot, like low 200s.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
So that's good.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
I'm not bouncing back up to 220 or something like that.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
So I just need to keep everything consistent and get back into DDR again.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
So not to derail you too much, but Loki, it's literally been three minutes,

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
and look, there's a GIF of what just happened.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
The oil army works fast, and I am kind of embarrassed watching that,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
but whatever, what can you do?

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
Now all we need to do is turn that into an emoji or whatever.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Oh, one of the Twitch emojis or whatever?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
When we get biddies.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
I don't want to get sued, though. Isn't that like paying for a dance?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Well, let me put it this way.

27:45.000 --> 27:52.000
That Carlton dance was so not the Carlton dance that we'll be fine.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I couldn't remember the whole thing.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
I just know he does that thing with his arm.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
It'll be fine.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Forget it. Forget it.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
You didn't really want to see it anyway.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
All right, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
That was pretty much it.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I didn't play Katamari, sadly, even though I have it.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
I did download my free copy of Lego Lord of the Rings,

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
but I didn't play anything on PC.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I probably will, though.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
All right.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Let me talk about my gaming week then.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
I did play Katamari because Loki, good old friend buddy pal,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
bought me a Katamari Damacy reroll on PC,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
so I was kind of trying to decide, do I want it on PC so I can mod it?

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Do I want it on Switch so I can take it on the go?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
And Loki made the decision for me, so thank you.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
I appreciate that.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
You can always buy it again.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
That's true. I could always buy it again.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Actually, we're already going to buy it twice,

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
because the minute I was like, oh, Loki,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
I kind of exclaimed, oh, Loki got me Katamari Damacy.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
And Alan on the other side of the green screen is like,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
wait a minute, that's on PC?

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I thought that was only on Switch.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
And I was like, no, it's on PC.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And he's like, I'm opening Steam.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
So we already ended up buying two copies.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Well, yeah, I don't think it was on sale this week.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Well, no, it's too soon with the sale.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah, I've been trying to watch the Steam sales

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
to see if there's anything interesting on there,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
but I've been not buying anything.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Anything I buy, it's like, I'm not going to play that.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
It's like, yeah, I could buy Earth Defense Force 5,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
but am I really going to play that anytime soon?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Probably not.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
So I just have to hold off and get set mania done.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
So then when set mania is done,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
and if I have any extra free time,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I can go to actually doing game development again

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
instead of trying to develop a theme for set mania.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Let me quickly talk about Katamari Damacy reroll, though.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
I didn't get to play a ton of it,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
but I did open it up, play through the tutorial,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
first couple stages.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
So it's the PlayStation 2 game,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
but now all redone and widescreen,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I guess would probably be the biggest change

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
because the original game was, what, 2002, 2003?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
It was right around when this show started,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
when that game first came out for the PlayStation 2.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
It is funny, and a lot of people are razzing it for this,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
is that it was a $20 budget game

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
when it first came out for the PlayStation 2,

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
but now they want, what, 40 bucks for it, right?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
30.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Oh, 30. Well, still, it's more than 20.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Yeah.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
But it is HD, it is all that stuff.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
So honestly, if you played the original,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
then you know exactly what you're going to get.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
They rebuilt the engine, so they rebuilt it in Unity.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Low-key, it's the same game.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
It's the same game.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
They didn't really add a lot to it or anything.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
It's the same game, which isn't a bad thing.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
And I realize, since it's been, what, a good 13 years at least,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I don't know, probably longer,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
since Katamari Damacy originally came out,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
there's probably a lot of people maybe in their 20s or so

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
that didn't discover it when they were younger,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and so now have a chance to discover it again.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
So if you've never played any Katamari whatsoever,

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
I think it's definitely worth checking out.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
And for somebody like me who hasn't had a chance

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
to play it in a long time, I'm really into it.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I have one minor bitch, though, about it,

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
because this was like, what are they smoking type of thing?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Okay, so you haven't opened yours on PC, right?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
No, I haven't.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
So here's the gag about the whole thing.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
So when you launch it, it comes up in a window that's 720p,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
which, okay, whatever, like, where are my options to resize it

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
or anything like that?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
You have to play through the tutorial,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
which includes the 5 centimeter to 10 centimeter,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
like the first introductory stage,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
before you get to that menu area

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
where the game brings up a special splash screen that says,

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
you really need to save your game right now,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
or you're gonna have to do what you just did all over again

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
next time you open the game.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And I'm like, what?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
But all right.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Why?

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Weird ass design choices.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
I don't have a good explanation.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
But then once you finally do that,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
you can go in and finally change the display settings.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Absolutely.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
So you can play in 2K and, you know, all that.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It will render in 4K.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
I don't know if that necessarily means it's using 4K textures,

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
but the game will play in a 4K window.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
I think all the textures are pretty low res, aren't they?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
It's Katamari Damacy, you guys.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
It's not frickin' like, you know, Madden 4K sport event of the summer.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
I keep seeing, like, you keep browsing the Steam forums for that game,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
and I see people running it on the GPD,

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
the GPD, like, portable little computer thing

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
that looks like a little handheld device.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
So that thing could run on a pretty low-end PC.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Yeah, no.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
But, well, you know, of course they beefed it up and everything.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
But it runs, I mean, I like to play a lot of my games in 2K

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
because my graphics card is still a little, eh, you know,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I just do really 4K video and things like that.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
But, I mean, it looks really good.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Once you get past the tutorial and all that, it looks good.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
But it's one of those design choices where you're like,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Namco, what are you thinking?

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
Like, that should have been, like, the first menu that comes up.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Or, I mean, some games just have a separate little application,

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
like Final Fantasy XIII, I think, has a separate app you run

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
to configure it all, and then when you go in the game it's all there.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
But I was like, what?

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
A lot of Unity games will have you just pop up the screen

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
that actually shows, you know, here's some settings,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
and then you go into the game and stuff,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
but maybe they just didn't want people to know it was running in Unity?

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Or it's something to do with the lazy fucking port from the Switch.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Oh, yeah, or it could be that.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Because on the Switch, you wouldn't have to do any of that.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
The Switch has one mode to play that's probably 720.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So that's probably, honestly, what it is.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
It's just lazy fucking porting from the Switch.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
So that's why I kind of have to read it a little bit.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, the game's great,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
and you're only stuck in that mode for five minutes,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
but it's still one of those things that makes you go,

33:34.000 --> 33:40.000
guys, what a freaking, like, lazy thing that you could have done better, right?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
So it was just weird.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
But otherwise, I love Katamari.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Other games that I've been playing this week include

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
same old, same old, wow, World of Warcraft,

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
because they had the new, they put out the new patch not that long ago,

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
so the Warlock I had now can do stuff in Darkshore,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
which is like another, this means nothing to you,

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
another zone where you can do more, like, daily quests and things like that.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
Look, it's one of those things where I'm starting to get a little better at,

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
I'll do that on screen A, and then on screen B,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I'm watching this week's Drag Race.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Or I'm watching something I don't really need to watch,

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
I just kind of listen to, like, maybe a talk show on cable or something.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
So I kind of just zone out and play wow

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
while I kind of absorb the information from whatever I'm watching.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
So I've been playing a little World of Warcraft like that,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and a little bit of Final Fantasy as well,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Shane and I were messing around in that game the other night,

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
because they have a winter event that I need to do.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
We got sidetracked, he was farming sheep.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Don't they have, like, the blue mages coming soon?

34:38.000 --> 34:45.000
Blue mage, they dated blue mage June, or June, January 13th, I think.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Don't quote me on that. I think the patch was January 6th,

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
and blue mage unlocks one week later on the 13th.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
So they're, because they just did their live letter for, like,

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
explaining everything about this next patch,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
and everything leading up to the next expansion.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
But what I was going to say is the winter event is supposed to be a music game thing.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
So I haven't, yeah, I haven't really explored it yet,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
but they've done some really cute events,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
like, they had one where you went into a dungeon,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
but it was, like, a holiday dungeon.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
I think it was, like, Halloween or something,

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
you went into one of the scary dungeons,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
you had to avoid ghosts or something.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And then I know they had one that was, like,

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
the old school dungeon crawler,

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
meaning, like, think, like, Fantasy Star,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
when you're in the first person dungeon,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
but it's those really rudimentary walls,

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
because, you know what I mean, like,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Ultima III had them, I'm trying to think of other games that had them back in the day,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
but Fantasy Star is probably the best example of it.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
But they had one like that,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
but it was really easy to play, because you would see that,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
but you would see, like, a map right next to it.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
It's just like you were navigating a maze with your arrow keys, basically.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
So they did something like that,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
but I like it when they do, like, super cute things like that.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
My favorite, not to get too off base,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
my favorite holiday thing they've ever done in Final Fantasy XIV

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
was, I think it was the third anniversary of the game.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
They did an anniversary event,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
and as part of the event, you would transport to this,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
or teleport to this magical place

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
that was basically a workshop

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
where you interacted with the developers of the game.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
And they kind of, you know, there was a lot of tongue-in-cheek type of stuff,

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
but there was one, you talk to a character that basically represents it,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and it's called, like, Yoshi P or something like that,

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
which is Yoshida, who's the director, producer of the game.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
And basically he says, like, the character says something like,

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
I'm kind of paraphrasing here,

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
but, uh, we know that it was a rough road the first couple years,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
and we want to thank you so much for sticking with us,

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
and, you know, we're gonna tell all these new stories,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and you're here to, and I was like,

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
that was, like, it's just like a really nice thing,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
it was a very humble type of move, because, you know,

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
I think a lot of, there's a lot of awareness around Square Enix

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
about how bad the first version of Final Fantasy XIV bombed.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
But that was, like, so long ago.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
And that's where my head's at, is I'm like,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
that was so long ago at this point, like,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
forgiven, forgotten, because the game is, like, way better now.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Wasn't it, like, 2014?

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
Before that, like, I, no, maybe you're right,

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
maybe it was 2014.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
I mean, we're on our, let's see, Shadowbringers is 29th,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
no, Shadowbringers is 2019,

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
uh, Stormblood was 2017, Heavensward 15,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
so Realm Reborn was 2013.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
So the original Final Fantasy XIV was around 2011,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I think, when that first came out.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
So, um, so, yeah.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I think we could just give them a break now,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
considering it's like, you know,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
look at how some of these other games have launched.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
I think you have a pass.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Yeah, yeah, I think they have a pass.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
And right now, I mean, I don't know, like,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
you gotta read everything on Reddit with a grain of salt,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
but I do look at the Final Fantasy XIV Reddit once in a while,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
and there's a lot of people that are posting, like,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
hi, I'm really pissed off at Blizzard right now,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
so I'm coming over to Final Fantasy XIV from WoW,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
and oh my god, I love this game,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I've been sleeping on it so long, and all this stuff.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
And to be fair, I mean, I'm not trying to, like, bash World of Warcraft,

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
because here I am, where I'm like,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I've been playing XIV for so long, like, I just,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I need to see other people for a little bit,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
so I'm like, I remember this game I used to flirt with,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
so I went back to World of Warcraft,

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
and since I haven't played it seriously in so long,

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
I'm like, I'm kind of, I'm kind of into this right now,

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
like, this is, this is something I haven't seen in a long time,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
you know, and yeah, so I feel like,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I don't want to say I'm on the opposite side of the fence,

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
because I truly, truly appreciate what both games bring to the table.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
But to bring it back to something you said earlier in the show,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
in the beginning, about, like, articles that fill this time of year,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
and all the clickbait stuff,

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
a lot of, like, what is happening at Blizzard type of articles going up.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Has Activision killed Blizzard?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Has Activision hurt Blizzard?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And, like, you know, outlining, like, all of the weird things

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
that Blizzard has done this year, obviously Diablo Immortal,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
but now this Heroes of the Storm thing we got into last week

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
has a lot of people feeling raw,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
apparently it's already affecting the game,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
you try to go in there and look for matches,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
and it's taking longer and longer, because people are just like,

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
well, if they're done, so am I, peace out, you know, type of thing.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
And then World of Warcraft, not everybody's really happy with the expansion,

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
I mean, I don't, maybe it's because I kind of didn't really play a lot of last one,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
but I'm like, I'm into this expansion, whatever,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
like, I'm not interested in raiding or endgame stuff,

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
but as a dirty, filthy casual, it's cool, you know what I mean?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
There's a lot of people that are like,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
has Activision, like, fucked Blizzard beyond repair?

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
And a lot of that talk going on, so it's kind of interesting, I suppose.

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
So, going to chat at Twitch TV and VOG Network,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Renji221 over there says,

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
you talk about games coming back from a bad launch,

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
I think No Man's Sky is another good example. Oh, absolutely.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
You know, it joins a club with Diablo 3, in my opinion,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I mean, even though we talk about Diablo Immortal,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
part of the reason why Blizzard wanted to take that template for Diablo 3

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
and make it a mobile game is because Diablo 3 was saved.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
But remember, when Diablo 3 first came out, ooh,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
but Final Fantasy XIV, you know, is another great example of that.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
So, yeah, we do live in this really interesting era

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
where video games can be saved.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
Some people would argue Destiny 2 is in this club as well.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Is that when Destiny 2 kind of first launched?

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
Yeah, there's some problems, but it's come a long way.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
Yeah, but a lot of that has to do with just being non-transparent

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
with your users that are just changing shit and,

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
oh, oh, now that you discovered it, I guess we should tell you about it.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And it's like, fuck it, fuck that shit, you know?

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
Oh, I don't know. They're trying, I guess.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
But Destiny, I've never been able to get on board with that game.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And it sounded cool, but I was like, eh.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
I should probably revisit it. I mean, I do own Destiny 2.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I bought it when it first came out.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
It got free, so.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Well, yeah, because they gave it away not that long ago,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
so hopefully you all pick that up because that's done now.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
But even if you didn't, you can still get the base game super cheap

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
because they really want to sell you the expansion.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
They don't really want to sell you the base game anymore.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
They want to make their money off the expansion.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
They want to sell you the in-game currency.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
And all that stuff, too. And Carlton dances, or whatever.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Anyway, also in our Twitch chat,

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
DJ Rama S says, Blizzard has become complacent.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Some people are arguing that a little bit, too.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Some people are saying that that's the pressure Activision is putting on them,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
is that Blizzard is not putting out games fast enough.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
But, I mean, the Blizzard formula has worked with them for so long.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
When they do put things out, most of the time it's really, really good.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Diablo 3 was an exception.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I mean, I don't know. I don't know.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
We'll have to see what the next big thing is.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I still think Blizzard does better than a lot of people.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
But look at Overwatch.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
Like, Overwatch is a game changer in so many ways.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
And people forget, like, Blizzard also made Overwatch.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
That is a game that's been out for quite some time.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
People still talk about it.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
It is changing the landscape of esports as we know it, right?

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
So you can't say that Blizzard is just doing nothing but fucking up.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
There's a lot they're getting right, too.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
And I think Overwatch is the best example of that in a lot of ways.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
But that's just my opinion.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Which, by the way, is something else I played this week. Overwatch.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I saw so many friends of mine streaming Overwatch that I was like,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
I need to get in there and play some Overwatch.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
And I've been missing out.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And I haven't done any of the holiday event. Well, now I have.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
But I hadn't at that point done, like, any of the holiday event.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I need to get some of the loot boxes and all that good stuff.

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
And I love every match right now has that new Ashe in it.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
The one that Jennifer Hale voices, the cowgirl.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
And just, like, every minute or so you just hear,

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Baa! Because that's her ultimate.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
That's what she calls Bob in.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
So you just hear, like, you'll hear it from across the map.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Baa! And it sounds like...

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
This is obscure, but have you ever seen the YouTube clip

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
of, like, the husband calling contest at the state fair

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
where the old ladies get on stage and they're calling their husbands?

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
That's what it sounds like.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Somebody out there has got to know what I'm talking about.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
But that's what it sounds like to me when Ashe calls Bob

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
from down the hallway or whatever.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
Act F says, Overwatch is kind of screwing up too with some things.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
I'd love for you to elaborate on that, Act F.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, what can't join this club?

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
Mass Effect Andromeda. Wow. Way to kill my mood.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Thanks a lot for that. Jerk.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Alright, anyway. Spyro says, I played Overwatch last night.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
It's pretty fun. Yeah, I'm still a fan.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I watched the holiday event.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
It was a lot of Yetis falling off cliffs.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
I haven't really played...

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Like, there's a whole thing with Mei and Winston and all that stuff.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I haven't really got into that or played that, really.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
So, yeah. I don't know.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Anyway. Alright, let's move on.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I'll try to get... If I can work it in later,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I'll get Act F's follow up on the Overwatch thoughts.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
But I want to get into the news, so let's get to it.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
Loki. Not a lot of news this week.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
This is in a normal week. I'm gonna be honest.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
In a normal week, I don't think I'd want to give this side any attention,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
to be quite honest. I think it's...

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
We know this side is shady, right? This side is shady.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
And so, now we're hearing some other shady stuff.

43:46.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah, so apparently G2A, who wasn't very legit to begin with.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
I mean, a lot of people dealing with stolen keys

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
or just all sorts of thievery and stuff.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
Well now, apparently they said that they are charging users for 180 days of inactivity.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
So if you haven't logged into your G2A account,

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
for 180 days, you'll be charged one pound.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
And it'll be taken from the G2A wallet.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
A dollar, essentially.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah, one dollar.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
If you want to convert it into, you know, our money.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
And apparently they said, you know,

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
there's gonna be an email sent three days before the charge

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
to remind users to log in to void the fee.

44:28.000 --> 44:35.000
And if there's no funds in the wallet, then they won't charge anything.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
That just...

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
It's just, it's basically their reasoning for this.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
They said, it costs money to upkeep accounts.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Bullshit.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
This includes server maintenance, IT infrastructure.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Come on, you guys. It's data in a fucking table.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
It's bullshit.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
As a supervised financial institution, we must meet many requirements

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
related to the monitoring service of each account.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Really? There's monitoring?

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
See, that's the thing.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
I've heard of banks charging this kind of thing.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
Like, if you don't have enough money and savings,

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
or checking, or you're not having enough deposited,

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
that's when they charge you like that monthly service fee or whatever, right?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
But that's a bank.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
That's not some shady website that's stolen you,

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
or allegedly stolen you keys from other places or whatever,

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
and turning around and reselling them and that sort of thing.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
It's not a bank.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
It's a very different type of thing.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Just don't do business with them.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Just make it easy.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Shitty company is still shitty.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
I was gonna ask, how would you feel if somebody like Steam

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
enacted a rule like this, but they're not gonna.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
That won't be a problem, because I'm always logged into Steam.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
I can't think of anybody that would have to charge me that.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Yeah, I know. I still try to log into Steam once a week

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
to just maintain my trading card eligibility.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
I couldn't tell you the last time I've had a pack of trading cards drop.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Do people even still do the trading card thing on Steam anymore?

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
I got a pack.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
It was in my box.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
I just sold off a bunch of the cards that you get

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
doing your Game of the Year awards or whatever.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Three cents!

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
You vote. Yeah, so you get that.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Woo! Three cents!

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
So yeah, I've been getting a ton of email notifications

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
because I've been selling cards.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Because I'm like, I don't give a shit about these cards.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I'm not doing anything with them.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I'm just gonna sell them because people are dumb enough to buy them.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
And so, you know, I like a dollar.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
RunJumpStomp in their chat over at VOG Network on Twitch says,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
How is this legal?

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
When I first read it, I was like, wait a minute, isn't that illegal?

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
But I'm thinking of the gift card thing.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
So I don't know if this is true in every state,

46:47.000 --> 46:54.000
but like, gift cards in California cannot decrease in value if they're inactive.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
And they can't expire.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
And they can't expire or anything like that.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
The only way you can get screwed on those is if the company goes under.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Like if you have a Kohl's card or something.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Borders.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
RadioShack. You have a RadioShack gift card?

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Twice or us!

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
You're fucked at this point. There's nothing you can do.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
You can try and take it to the bankruptcy quarters, honestly.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
Like usually there's a period of time that you can use it with the liquidator,

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
and then that's it. It's done.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
So that's really the only way you can kind of get screwed out of those gift cards

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
that the company goes under.

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
But otherwise, like if you find a Best Buy gift card in your couch from like 2004,

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
and it's got 15 bucks on it, Best Buy has to honor it.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
So that's, at least in California.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I don't know about other states and all their laws.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
I know there's other states that have similar laws.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
But unfortunately, this isn't exactly a gift card, I guess.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
And G2A, I'm sure, can't even be based in the states as it is, hence why it's one euro.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
We all know it's a little bit shady, because they're probably not running in the US.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
They're probably running in a more friendly country to some of the things they do.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Yeah.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
But yeah, so sadly that law wouldn't apply over there,

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
and you're kind of dealing with international issues anyway.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Yeah.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Also, then Run Jump Stop says,

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
I don't get how companies can change the terms of service after the fact.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Unfortunately, they do it all the time.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
It's in their terms of service that they can change the terms of service.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
It is that, but sometimes you launch Steam.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
Just watch, next time you launch Steam, after a couple weeks, it might say,

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
you need to accept our newest update before we can get into it,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
and you have to scroll through and agree again.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
And a lot of games with persistent online worlds and things like that will do that.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
Some of them will be nice and tell you in very plain words.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Here's what we changed.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I want to say Discord.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
I talk good about them a lot.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
They do something like this.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Because they phrase it in a funny way, like,

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
here, for a normal human being, here is what we have changed in the thing,

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
and then you get the full legal language underneath it.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
You know what I mean?

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
But companies, I guess, don't always do that kind of thing.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
So, you know, technically, when you scroll down and agree,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
technically, technically you're accepting it.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
But I've still seen class action lawsuits and all that stuff happen anyway.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Yeah.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Like when PlayStation had a class action lawsuit,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
even though I believe it is in their terms of service,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
you agreed to arbitrate or something like that.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Like, it doesn't stop a lot of that stuff from happening.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Yeah.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
If a lawyer wants to take the case, they'll try it.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
So, let's see.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Going to chat for some more comments.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Bobby Blackwell says it needs to get up to the courts,

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
and unfortunately nobody has the money to keep fighting all the way up to the Supreme Court.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
The Supreme Court has never heard a case involving a software terms of service.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Very interesting.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
I guess that's true.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
The last big Supreme Court case I can think of involving games,

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
I'm sure there's been others.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
The one that comes to mind is the one here in California where it was Schwarzenegger,

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
the governor at the time, versus, I forget the name,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
but it was that whole thing about the mature games being sold at GameStop.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Right.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
They had to check the ID, and the Supreme Court struck it down

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
because there was no consistent measure about what made a mature game, basically.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
It was turning into a matter of opinion.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Are nipples being shown? Yes.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Mature game.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Yeah, exactly.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
And it brings that whole thing into who's to say what's mature for you versus what's mature for me.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
Like, some people might allow their kids to hear the F word and the S word,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
but would never want them to see a boob.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
But some of it is complete vice versa.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
Like, a boob's a boob, but I don't want you using the F word.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
And that's really up to a parent to decide.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
Run Jump Stomp says that Mario has nipples.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Yes.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
And he is very mature.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Mamma mia.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Alright, anyway.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
So, yeah.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I won't be using G2A anytime soon.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
I hope this is the type of thing that just kind of stays with them

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
and their weird kind of business practices.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
But, yeah, I'm not going to be exactly going over there to use their services anytime soon.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
And I imagine you guys probably won't either, so let's move on to our next story

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
that has to do with Microsoft and their All Access offer.

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
The All Access offer was the subsidized Xbox One bundle that was available at certain Microsoft stores.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
Of course we don't have any nearby, unfortunately.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
No. Well, I mean, there's one in the Bay Area, which I've been to a few times.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
It looked kind of cool. I wanted to...

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
They're nice stores.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
I haven't been in the one, but I did want to actually...

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
You know what's funny about those stores, though?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I swear to God, the last time I was in the one in San Francisco

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
was in that super nice mall, like, Kitty Corner from the Metreon.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Yeah.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
It's where the movie theater is. It's in there.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
It's on the third floor.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
The last time I was in there, I swear to God, every computer, everything, it was Fortnite.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Everybody was playing fucking Fortnite.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
What?

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
On the Xboxes, on the laptops.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Fortnite?

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Fortnite, Fortnite, Fortnite.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
They were probably playing each other.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
No Forza, no Minecraft?

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
Well, they would have a computer up front that was running Forza that nobody was playing,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
which is a crime because Forza's great.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Yeah.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
But, yeah, no, Fortnite, Fortnite, Fortnite.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
That's all they were demoing on all those computers.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
But anyway, I do...

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
The Microsoft store, obviously, there's a lot in common with the Apple store, a little

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
competition head to head there.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
It's very well lit, very, you know, lots of people.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
It's the hangout.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Everyone goes to the hangout there.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
It is.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
But anyway, so you could get this all access deal at these stores.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
You would be in a two year agreement and you could get an Xbox One or an Xbox One X for

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
kind of like a lower or cheaper price.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
And then you get Xbox Live Gold and the Game Pass.

52:19.000 --> 52:25.000
And that's a big deal because the Game Pass is the like Netflix of Xbox games, basically,

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
which, you know, is one of those things that I think is just going to get bigger and bigger

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
as we move into 2019.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
It's a great service.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
And 2020.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
I mean, it is.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
And I'm really curious.

52:34.000 --> 52:41.000
I really suspect when we start talking about PlayStation 5 and Nintendo, I feel like they

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
won't get on the bandwagon until later.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.000
They're like kind of with the Switch online, the classic libraries, like you tried that

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
whole type of thing.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
But I would be very curious to see what Sony is going to do to respond to this, like with

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
PlayStation 5, because I think it's gonna be something that's built into PlayStation

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
5.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Yeah.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Like I looked at the classic library.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.000
In fact, I was going through there and it's like, here's the new games.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
I'm like, yeah, that's nice, I guess.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Yeah.

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
So anyway, the point is, Microsoft is ending this program on December 31st, 2018.

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
So the all access bundle will be seized at the Microsoft retail location.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
So you still have a little bit of time for this.

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
But what's interesting about this, Microsoft isn't saying that this is going away forever.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
It's just going away for now, because this whole thing was a test to see if this whole

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
thing was going to be viable in the first place.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
So, but they're already kind of hinting it's coming back.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
So I would assume, yes, it's viable.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
You seem to offer it more places other than the Microsoft store.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Well, there's that.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.000
And I wonder if Microsoft isn't going to let it go to sleep and hibernate for a little

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
while and then bring it back.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
When, Loki, when did they bring it back?

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
E3, because the floor is virtually theirs and theirs alone at E3 this next year.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
So they could unveil the new pass.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
And wouldn't it be great if they had a diskless console or something?

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
I'm fan wanking here, but wouldn't it be something if Microsoft had some type of new console

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
to go with this whole thing?

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
You know what I mean?

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Yeah.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Yeah.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Diskless console.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
We'll see.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
We'll see.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Or their new console.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Maybe they're going to do something with that.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
I don't know.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
And this whole thing, because I think Microsoft really wants to push this game pass thing,

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
but I don't know.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
I mean, we'll see.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
I think E3 would be really the time to see about that.

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
So anyway, I mean, it was a contract plan, but it wasn't like, it wasn't shady.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
Like I do think overall it was a decent deal if it's what you wanted, if it worked for you.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
I mean, yeah, I think, you know, it's a decent deal.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
Looking in chat over at VOG Network on Twitch TV, Runchum Stomp suggests that Nintendo will

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
do it sometime in 2030.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Yes.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
Maybe for the Switch 2, Switch U or whatever they end up doing next.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
I gotta tell you, like, their stuff, that is the hardest thing about Nintendo consoles

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
is their stuff does not depreciate in value, according to them.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
They don't drop the prices of anything because like, Mario Kart 7, I remember purchasing

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
that when that first came out.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
It's still full price.

55:06.000 --> 55:12.000
You know, Wii U games in particular are now getting more expensive because Nintendo is

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
essentially like, just put them all on a boat, set it out to sea and set the boat on fire,

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
metaphorically.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
Nintendo is like, has cut ties with the U at this point.

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
So it's kind of driving the Wii U game prices up at this point, because now it's like they're

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
collector's items, because how many people really ever had the Wii U and the Wii U?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
It's interesting how that's all playing out.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Because I was looking at some of the, like, I'll see the eBay ads come up online.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
I'm like, why are these games selling for like $60, $65?

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Oh, because Nintendo isn't making them anymore.

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
So if you want to get them, this is like the only way to do it.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
It's ridiculous.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
A little bit, a little bit.

55:45.000 --> 55:50.000
But, you know, a lot of rare game consoles, this kind of thing tends to happen, right?

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
We can go all the way back to like the Sega Saturn, the Dreamcast.

55:54.000 --> 56:00.000
I mean, heck, probably a black band Final Fantasy 7 or Suikoden 1 or 2.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
Those still go for, Suikoden 2 I think still goes for a lot of money, doesn't it?

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
So, I mean, less than it did before it came out on the PlayStation Classics.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
But I think as a collectible, those things still make a lot of money, if I'm not sure.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
If I'm not mistaken.

56:14.000 --> 56:20.000
So, Bobby says, if I didn't have a bandwidth cap, I'd be all over Xbox Game Pass.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
Yeah, I mean, that is something they may have to address, maybe cut a deal with the cable providers.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
I think the bandwidth caps are going to have to start to give a little bit,

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
as more and more people really start to push back against the cable providers.

56:30.000 --> 56:36.000
I think just as we get more 4K streaming, I think market demand is going to force those caps up.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I do think that'll have to happen.

56:38.000 --> 56:44.000
They'll just put laws in place that'll eliminate bandwidth caps and then they'll still throttle instead.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
Well, I don't think they can now because like certain states kind of danced around the net neutrality thing

56:49.000 --> 56:56.000
and like California passed a stronger thing and it's going to be interesting now that the house is going back to blue.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
I don't know politically if that can be countered now at this point or what the deal is going to happen.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
It's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.

57:02.000 --> 57:10.000
I don't know. I'm not going to get into politics that much, but it will be interesting to see how the net neutrality thing keeps going.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
Yeah, and a few folks in chat talking about the net neutrality thing, but remember now states,

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
because California is like, oh, hell no to what, you know, the FCC did and all this.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
So now there's going to be that fight.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
And y'all know this being the good old U.S. S.A., it ain't going to be solved overnight.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
There's going to be a new president no matter which team it is.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
There's going to be a new president before this thing is solved.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
You know what I mean? Yeah, it's going to go on for years.

57:34.000 --> 57:49.000
So we'll see. I, I really feel like what's ultimately going to happen is probably like some other FCC guys going to come in there and strike the whole thing before the legal courts and all this like ends up ultimately figuring it out because that's that's the way things tend to run in my opinion.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
So anyway, let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.

57:53.000 --> 57:59.000
So there's this indie game Celeste that's actually been selling very well. They've sold 500,000 copies.

57:59.000 --> 58:05.000
It's been, I think it got like Indie Game of the Year or something like that during the game awards.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
Yeah, game awards got some good stuff. I have friends that really love that game.

58:09.000 --> 58:20.000
But anyways, what with that, though, Matt Torsen, the creator of the game, basically said, you know, hey, we're working on some farewell levels that are going to be ready in 2019.

58:20.000 --> 58:26.000
They're very hard and we'll be announcing what's going to be next for us in the years as well.

58:26.000 --> 58:36.000
Also with that, they're saying that they're the soundtrack has sold 6000 copies across all platforms, been streamed on Spotify four million times.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
And I didn't even know it was on Spotify.

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
Yeah. And if you haven't picked up a copy of Celeste yet, well, guess what?

58:43.000 --> 58:50.000
If you happen to have Xbox Live Gold, then you're going to be getting that as one of your free games with gold in January.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
So it's going to be Celeste for the month of January for Xbox One.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
And then for the the 16th through February 15th will be WRC.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
And then on Xbox 360, you're getting Lara Croft, Guardian of Light and Far Cry 2.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Those are some good picks, too.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Yeah.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
Guardian of Light. It's a little bit old at this point, but that was a good game.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
That was a good co-op puzzler thing.

59:14.000 --> 59:21.000
But yeah, I'm now and now I'm from a from a consumer standpoint, I'm kind of happy I slept on Celeste now that I get the free copy on Xbox.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
But I know I know the developer doesn't make as much money when you do it that way.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
But they have sold a half a million copies.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
You know, it's Celeste is on like a million different platforms.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
If I like it that much, I'll probably end up double dipping.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
It'll probably come out on Sony's platforms as well.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
So I thought Celeste already was on Sony's platform as a game.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Oh, no, not as a free game.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
No, I think, you know, usually when it's free and one, it becomes free on the other eventually.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Yeah, you're right. You're right. That's that's very true.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
So, yeah, I need to check out Celeste.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
It's one of those games that's like supposed to be like bang your head on the wall hard, but it's a lot of fun.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
So, yeah, I need to it's just one of those games.

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
There's only so many hours in the day to play games, especially when it's not the job you get paid to do all day long.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
So, yeah, I got to have to pick that up at some point.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So anyhow, and some folks in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network absolutely agree.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And Run Jump Stomp says, if these are very hard, I wonder how you would classify the other levels as far as difficulty goes.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Ain't that the truth? Because my understanding is the game is kind of hard to begin with anyway.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
So anyhow, let's move on and talk about another thing that's been circulating the blogs.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And that is this whole update to Spider-Man on the PlayStation 4, which is a game a lot of people are enjoying.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And people were saying, hey, what are we going to get?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000
What are we going to get the Spider-Man suit from the Tobey Maguire starred movies with Sam Raimi, if you will, movies from what?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:44.000
What was the first one of those, like 2002, 2003, when the old trilogy started somewhere in the aughts, the early aughts somewhere when that series started.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And people really wanted that Spider-Man suit to the extent that they were like doing social media campaigns and Reddit posts and all this crap online to like,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I don't want to say bully Insomniac Games into doing it, but it kind of was like, I mean, like back off. Jesus. You know what I mean?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Well, it's like we've given you all the other suits.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I know. Well, first off, the game is pretty fucking good. Isn't that the most important thing?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Like, do you really like, I can't believe a bunch of mostly boys are complaining about dress up online.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I mean, really? Jesus. Anyway, but the Sam Raimi suit, it did end up coming out.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Now, before we, because I'm sure I'm not looking at chat at the moment, but I'm sure it's going to light up with this before then.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I don't see this as them giving in to demands because to get an agreement like this takes time and agreements and paper and somebody had to design that suit for the game.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So this was a weeks, if not months long process that was probably on some original design document a long time ago about post launch follow up thing.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Like this was in the works for a long time.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:03.000
But unfortunately now people have the perception of, yay, we won. We complained, we bitched, we cyber bullied and we got what we wanted.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
We changed Mass Effect's ending and then we changed, we added a suit to Spider-Man.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:21.000
So it's kind of unfortunate that there is the perception that this type of behavior works because Loki, I don't understand, why do, and it is kind of an issue with gamers.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I mean, I don't know, do film buffs do this too? I don't know.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I don't even know why it matters.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's an issue with gamers that they bitch and bitch and bitch because games have DLC and because games can be changed after the fact.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
To be honest with this game, I don't even know why.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Why is it gamer culture that fucking does this?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Because they have the comic book suit in there that's pretty awesome because it's all done in like the comic book print style and everything.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And it looks like, you know, it makes everything kind of like hyper real because it's so, you know, comic book-y.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
But I don't know. I don't know why people are bitching about the one specific suit.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
If you showed me like a bunch of Spider-Man suits, I wouldn't be able to point out which one is the Sam Raimi suit.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
So maybe I'm not the, I am not the target demographic.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I still haven't played the game and it looks awesome, but I haven't played it.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Yeah, and I'm with you there. Like, am I really going to figure out the subtleties of the Spider-Man suit and all that stuff?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Probably not. I don't know.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:20.000
It could be worse. It could be like the, you know, Joel Schumacher Spider-Man suit where giant nipples are on it instead, you know, but...

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Uh, TigerKalonChat says, yeah, Sonic fans are complaining about the silhouette of that Sonic the Hedgehog movie poster and want Paramount to fix the design.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Yeah, but it's...

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
That's a little different.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It's a...

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Here's why. Here's why it's different. Here's why it's different.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Because it's not a game. It's, it's a game's representation in film when games do not have the best track record of moving to film.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Some have been okay, like the original Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider's done alright, you know, both the Angelina Jolie movie one.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I think, like, the Pokemon Detective Pikachu looks awesome.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Yeah, I mean, I love Silent Hill, but Resident Evil, I mean, was a huge, I mean, even though the game's influence is not, I mean, what?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
It's a garbage movie.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But it's, it's a popcorn movie.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
It's a fun popcorn movie.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
A lot of gore fans really like that type of stuff. It's a scary movie. People love that stuff.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I think I saw one, I didn't really watch any of those movies. I saw one in the middle. I don't even remember which one it is. It literally didn't matter, but...

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Like, it was just entertaining. It was stupid. I knew nothing. I mean, it's like, there's all these, okay, I see the tie, oh, and there's Wesker, okay, cool.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It's just, it's just group of humans that get picked off one by one in hideous ways.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And somehow we're the Matrix now. I don't know.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
It's weird.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But, I mean, but there's a lot of, okay, but we know there's a lot of bad movies, too, right? Like, I got two words for you.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Uwe Boll. Okay? Remember that guy's name? Right?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Or even more recent, Rampage.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:58.000
That was a choice. But, anyway, with that whole thing, so what my point is, we don't often see games represented very well in film.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So now it's like you're taking this fucking icon. Sonic the Hedgehog is a icon, not just of video gaming, but, like, of our youth, especially in your 30s and 40s.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Heck, even your 20s, you still know who Sonic is? That was a character that's always been around.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Think about the Mario Brothers movie.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Well, think about how that turned out. Imagine that now.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I mean, that is just like, what the fuck is that? Where did you get that from this?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I mean, I don't understand that, but in the Sonic thing, it's like...

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So it's different, and I'm never for, like, bullying or, you know, telling people to hurt themselves or horrible things about them and their families like that.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:53.000
That type of behavior on social media is garbage. I know none of you engage in that, but if you're even thinking about it, don't.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:02.000
But I'm all for sass. Just a little sass, right? Just a little constructive sass, a little tongue-in-cheek sass is fine.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And so when I do see some of these, like that poster of Sonic's legs up in the air on the Golden Gate Bridge, that whole thing, like, that needs to be sassed.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
You know what I mean? Like, it looks weird. So...

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000
It's just like, I don't know. They're complaining in chat, but also they're saying Double Dragon is the movie that gives nightmares to neighbors.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:34.000
See, you have to understand, that point in the 90s when they were making, or even like I should say, the 80s, it was just like, everything is judge dread.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000
All of the movies that come out, they're all like this post-apocalyptic future movie. Like, that's why Mario Brothers is like that.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It's like, it's fucking judge dread. You know, even Double Dragon is post-apocalyptic. It's... I don't know. None of them, they were so...

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:58.000
They just wanted an excuse to make this type of movie, and so they got a property that they can kind of sort of pull in that direction, and that was it.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.000
AJ Twist at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says, I had high hopes for Sonic after the Detective Pikachu trailer, then the poster happened.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Yeah, that Detective Pikachu trailer, that caught me off guard in a different way. Like, I was not ready to see, like, a real Jigglypuff or that whole thing.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:23.000
But I'm curious. Like, that one, I'm not gonna sass that. I'm curious. I still wish it was Danny DeVito, but I gotta let it go. I'm curious about that movie for sure.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.000
And Tigerclaw says, I hope the movie embraces the absurdity of Sonic being in the real world.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:40.000
You know what? If the movie is self-aware, if it's like the Twitter account, and it's tongue-in-cheek, and like Renji221 points out, Jim Carrey is playing Eggman.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I am gonna go see it day one, just because of that.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000
If they let Jim Carrey be Jim Carrey, then maybe it'll be like Showgirls funny. You know what I mean?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
So bad it's kind of a John Waters film.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
A John Waters Sonic movie.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Things I never knew I needed. Oh my god. That would be the best.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
That would be so fucking weird.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Oh, man. Anyway, if you don't know who John Waters is, like, just cinematic trash masterpiece.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:16.000
His most mainline thing was Hairspray. Like, the original one in the 80s with Divine, not after they made it a musical.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And we're not gonna talk about John Travolta. That was hideous. But the musical is still pretty good.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And I think they did a live one on NBC or one of those networks a couple years ago, and it was alright, too.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So, anyway. Yeah. And some folks in chat are saying, I'll wait for a trailer for Sonic.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And I'm, we'll wait, but you gotta sass those posters just a little bit, I think. Just a little bit.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Alright, anyway, let's do a couple more stories, then we'll get to the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So, unfortunately, with some of these older systems, they're just not getting updates anymore.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I know Grand Theft Auto 5 was doing that with the Xbox 360 as three versions.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Now, the same thing's gonna happen to Minecraft. Unfortunately, Minecraft on PlayStation 3, Vita, and Wii U are getting their final updates.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I didn't see Xbox 360 mentioned there, so I don't know if they quit that earlier or if they're still gonna be updating the 360 version, but I know it's basically the same thing.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:17.000
So, the final console update, apparently, is coming and says, well, actually, it's already out.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:24.000
So, they updated that on December 19th, and it's adding a Nightmare Before Christmas mashup pack.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And that's it. You're done. You wanna play Minecraft now? You can go play the Java.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
But now you can beat Jack Skellington. Yay.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:38.000
You can play it on Windows 10. Honestly, though, if you really wanna keep up with current stuff, Windows 10 and the Java versions aren't bad.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Like, surprised how good it is. No 4K pack, though.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Tons of people playing it on Switch, too.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Switch 2, yeah.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Obviously, with the portability and just the success that the Switch has been, it's a huge console for Minecraft, for sure.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Yeah.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So, yeah, I mean, how many people... I mean, well, I'm sure there's, like, kids and, you know, not every home can upgrade.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Not everybody's in this, you know, financial place where they can just willy-nilly upgrade.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And you don't really need to, though. I mean, it's nice to have the new stuff, but, like, it's also...

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I mean, I remember playing Minecraft 1. They didn't have all the new stuff in there, and it was just fine the way it was.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Yeah.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I wanna go back and play it. It gets so boring.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Yeah.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Because there's nothing really to do in the game. I mean, you can survive and stuff, but then it just, like, it gets boring.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I still wanna do the VoG network server, but then we got sidetracked with this whole move to Twitch and my knack of getting sucked into MMOs.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And it wasn't just the OLR move to Twitch, but I think we just started, like, streaming more on Twitch in general, and it was kind of like that thing kind of...

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And then you got your machine, and that whole Minecraft thing fell on the back burner. But maybe that's a 2019 thing we need to bring back.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:48.000
You know what? We'll do a VoG Minecraft when Microsoft puts out the frickin' 4K pack. Finally.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
That'll give me a reason to go back and check it out, that's for sure.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Or even just, like, with mods now, like, I finally figured out how to do Forge, Minecraft Forge, which is their modded client that you can use for the Java version.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It makes, like, loading mods with, like, visual changes easier. I just, setting up the servers and stuff and keeping that stuff running was really hard. That's all.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Runjan Stomp in chat points out, I'd love it if they brought modded stuff to consoles. Well, that would be pretty cool, wouldn't it?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
But then they can't sell it.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:30.000
No, they can, and they are. So they are doing, like, mods, sort of, with the console versions. You can buy these different updates.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:43.000
But it's not changing much within, like, the console space. It's not like, you know, adding, like, guns. I mean, you can sort of do that, but it's very basic, is what I'm trying to say.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:55.000
But if you go in any of the modern Minecraft versions, they have a storefront where you buy skins that people make, or you can buy mods to the game that changes, like, just how stuff sort of behaves.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And you can even create your own, but it's not as robust as, like, what you can do on the PC where you can just kind of keep adding shit to it and you can put Pokémon in there and all this crazy shit.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Yeah. It's more of like, oh, I can change the creeper to, you know, look like this, and now it acts like this, you know, give a different AI behavior.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.000
You think they'll ever do a Minecraft 2, or you think they're just gonna stick on the original forever and ever and ever?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Yeah, I think they'll eventually update it. It's money.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It's money. It is money.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Alright, speaking of money, there's one game that's making a lot of it, that's for sure. It's Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. I mean, duh, right?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Like, I'm about to tell you the Super Smash Brothers broke sales record. It's, like, most obvious news story of the year, I'm sure, but let's talk about it anyway.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Three million units in eleven days. That's a big deal.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
That's pretty good.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Like, I remember back in the day when, like, a million sold was, like, a runaway, like, hit.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Now, granted, a game like, I think, like Wii Sports, but I don't know how you count that, because that was bundled in with the Wii, but even something like Tetris,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I think those games sold, like, forty million. Like, it's up and up, but still, eleven days, three million, that's a really good start.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
In fact, it makes it the fastest selling Switch game so far.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:19.000
And, of course, Nintendo put out a press release to brag about this whole thing, that the Switch sold 8.7 million consoles between the launch in March 2017 and November 2018.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
So, it is now the fastest selling console of the generation. That's what Nintendo's saying.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
And they're also saying Nintendo is the top selling publisher of fiscal 2018.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Digital eShop sales are up 105% in 2017 over 2018. And, yeah, lots of good statistics, too.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Pokemon Let's Go, also a million seller.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Super Mario Party, also a million seller.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
So, they're doing pretty well over there at the Switch.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000
But I don't think that news really surprises anybody, but it is kind of neat just to hear, like, how much that is.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
That game, Super Smash, sold fast.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And do you think it's really going to be the last one they ever make?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
No.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:11.000
No, they got it. But I wonder if they're gonna, you know, allow the director of the game to go make new stuff, you know what I mean?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Just have someone else put...

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
You can't tell me that one person can only make a fighting game. I mean, just have other people do it.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I want Sakurai to do another Kid Icarus game. I want that franchise to come out.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I want him to do whatever the fuck he wants. He's earned it.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Honestly, I wish PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale would come back.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I didn't think it was that bad of a game. They didn't play it, though, so I could be wrong.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
But I have it free. It's in my library somewhere.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I would love that on PlayStation 4 because I like the idea of mixing two different stages together and having them battle it out and stuff in there.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Like, really obscure stuff. You know, like, Patapon versus, like, God of War creatures or some ridiculous crap.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I think they could have made it work, but...

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000
But Smash Brothers is so, so, so, so good. I actually played that, too, this week. I forgot to talk about it in my gaming week.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
But, I mean, that's just a given. Making a little progress in the worlds and spirits and all that stuff.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So, it's just a fantastic game. It's really a must-have if you're a Switch owner unless you just know it is not your type of game.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Like, otherwise, I really can't recommend that game enough.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000
RunJumpStomp says Sakurai said no new Kid Icarus for, like, 25 years. Well, that's a bummer because I love that series.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Well, from him, maybe somebody else can do one. I don't know.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Well, the Kid Icarus game that he released last time, was that very good?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It was... I liked it, but it was a departure. It just didn't feel the same as the original. You know what I mean?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
It wasn't, like, Kid Icarus, like...

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Like, I would like something that's Kid Icarus, but, like, that 3D Metroid they made that was a remake of the second game.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
But it was, like, totally different.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Oh, yeah, the 3DS?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Yeah, like, I would like that with Kid Icarus.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Like, especially if Nintendo is going to insist on the 3DS still being around.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I would like to see, like, a 2D Kid Icarus there with, like, some of the difficulty, maybe some ways to cheese it when it gets really hard.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
You know, and the dungeon exploring, I really loved in Kid Icarus. The music was always fabulous.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I just love the Greek mythology, cute, you know, the way they do that.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And the Eggplant Wizard is a great character that needs to shine again, right? So, there you go.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Is he an assist trophy in the game?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I'm sure he's got to be. He's not a character, that's the sad thing, but Palutena is, and Pit and Dark Pit.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And I'm almost positive, most positive Eggplant Wizard is a spirit, if nothing else.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Because those trophy things are kind of gone, it's all the spirit stuff now.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
So, I'm almost positive Eggplant Wizard is one of those.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:45.000
So, anyway, I love Kid Icarus, but every week here on the show we talk about other types of classic games.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I'm pretty sure Kid Icarus has been a classic game of the week, so if not, it better be soon.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000
So, we're going to get into the classic game of the week and check out in the gaming vault what is the classic game that has been picked for us this week.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So, let's get into it.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And so we take a step back through space and time and this magical time machine to cover the classic game of the week.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000
But this week it's going to be something a little bit different, because Dark Sakura, unfortunately, she's been a little bit ill,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:19.000
and she is actually on mandated voice rest right now due to laryngitis-adjacent issues without getting too much into it.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Because that's her business, but unfortunately she can't even help us out this week with the classic game of the week.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So, I thought, even though it's awesome when I fill in and get to do my picks and Loki gets to fill in and do his picks,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I thought, you know, we should try to have guests here more often, even if we have to kind of fire up Skype or get folks here in person

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
to do some of these picks when Dark Sakura is not available for whatever reason.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
So, please welcome back to the show. I know it's been a little bit, but Alan is here.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Hello.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Hi, Alan. How are you doing?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I'm pretty good. How are you?

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Good. It's been a little while since we've had you here.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I know even though we live together, which makes you a very easy guest to have on the show, we have a very close relationship.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Let's just don't know.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But you have other commitments on Sunday nights, so you can't always be here during the show.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Yes. Or when I was working, Sunday was like my Saturday, so I just wanted to be off work.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Yeah, I hear you.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Now, before we get into the Classic Game of the Week, what do you think about, since you live here,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
what do you think about all that's changed with the video transition and all that stuff?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
You did a really good job of hiding how messy our house is.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000
See, I've talked a lot on this show about radio magic, but now that, my dear, is television magic.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Yeah, know your angles, both for pictures of yourself and of your studio.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
That's right. If I could mount that camera higher so it's more like, you know, camera up, chin, you know,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
get rid of that double chin, I would, but I've only got so much to work with.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.000
All right. So anyway, Alan, you're here to give us your pick for the Classic Game of the Week.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
It's got to be something 10 years older or more.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yes.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And I know you've played a lot of different stuff than Dark Soccer or even myself,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
so I think you've picked something kind of a little different, right?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
So what is your pick for Classic Game of the Week?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:06.000
My pick for Classic Game of the Week is a PC title that came out in 2003 by Microsoft Studios,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000
designed by Digital Anvil, and its name is Freelancer, the universe of possibility.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Freelancer was directed by Chris Roberts of Wing Commander fame.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000
The game was announced by Roberts in 1999, but of course, Microsoft likes to eat up game studios.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Digital Anvil was purchased by them, which really kind of put some kinks in the development of it,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
but it did come out a couple of years after it was originally intended.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Now, I assume you were a big Wing Commander fan back in the day, too.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Well, yes. I really liked the...

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Well, like the first two games. I don't know. They kind of...

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Once they got into the full motion video, then it was kind of like, is this really Mark Hamill? What?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And especially that movie was not great.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Which I did not see.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I mean, you should keep it that way. But the first two were great.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
The problem with Wing Commander is that I just was never any good at it.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
The controls were too, I don't want to say realistic, but I just had a hard time steering the ship.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And when I could steer the ship, I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with my missiles.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And it was one of those games that really did not take well to newer PCs,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
because it didn't have like the slowdown built in or whatever. Like it didn't have a way to...

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Oh, yeah.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I'm sure there's ways to play it now. I just haven't explored it in a long time.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I don't know if it's on one of those like, you know, old...

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I imagine if you ran Wing Commander on DOSBox, you could just enter a code that says like,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
suppress the CPU cycles by XML, and that would slow it down.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Anyway, sorry, it's not about Wing Commander, but same guy.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Same guy. And what he wanted to create with Freelancer is he wanted a way to play,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000
like have a multiplayer experience, which in 2003 was a very lofty goal,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
because WoW was not out yet. And I think the real only the big MMO that was out.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And this is not an MMO. It's a single player campaign game with a multiplayer element.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.000
The only thing really was like, you know, land party games like Command & Conquer or whatever,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
or Starcraft. But then, of course, yes, EverQuest was the big MMO.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Ultima Online, probably.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Ultima Online, yeah.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
So also, one thing that I noticed is that this game has some weird...

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I don't want to say that BioWare or Mass Effect stole from this, but like, for example,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
there are nodes like the Mass Relays where you jump to a system.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Something similar is in this game, where if you want to go from one star system to another,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
you have to go to a jump point, and you go through like this thing,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
and you get spit out into a different star system.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.000
And Jennifer Hale, who is very prolific in the video game Voice Over World,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
plays Junco Zane, who is basically your main...

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Like, you play Trent, who's voiced by Ian Zierling, I think, from 90210.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Oh god, the 90210 guy, okay.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Yes, yeah. So he's the voice... Yeah, actually, George Takei is in it as well.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Oh my.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000
So yes, it does have some pretty big names in there.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
So yeah, I just noticed like, oh, there are some weird sort of...

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
If you want to reach a little bit, Mass Effect connections.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Does it play like Wing Commander? I mean, I know it's still like a space game.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:27.000
That's the thing. It was the first space sim combat game where I found it very easy to pick up,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:32.000
very easy to learn how to play and be good at it very quickly.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I believe you can do a first person cockpit view, but your ship is kind of like...

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Basically, you can see the thrusters of the ship. So it's like a third person.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Kind of like the camera sitting on the butt of the ship.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:55.000
And you pretty much do everything. You steer and you also target the enemy spaceships with the mouse.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
It's all mouse driven. Most of it is.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And you know how in games like that where you have to shoot where the ship is going to go?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
So if the enemy ship is halfway across the screen, you want to shoot a little bit to the left of that

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
so that it will fly into your bullets?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Yeah.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
The reticle that it gives you makes it very easy to figure out how that works.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Because in Wing Commander, I always had a huge problem with how the predictive targeting worked.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Even though the graphics, I believe, were a bit stunted,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.000
it didn't necessarily have what would be considered 2003 graphics for the PC,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
it did get a lot of acclaim for how pretty it was.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Some of the star systems, when you've got a planet sort of over a nebula, it's a really gorgeous game.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And we can see that now on Twitch, at least. That part of it.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
It does look a little... I think it's a little more ahead of where a lot of games were in 2003.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
2003 was more like the PlayStation 2 era, right? So yeah, it's a little bit ahead of that.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:03.000
The NPCs, aside from three or four core NPCs like Jennifer Hill's character,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000
all have the same sort of flat, square mush face, kind of like the family in Katamari Damacy.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
If you look in the video that's playing right now of the gameplay,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
you'll notice that some of the people kind of look the same.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
But the really big, ambitious thing that I was saying earlier that Chris Roberts wanted to create with this

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
was a persistent online state with a real economy.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So that up to 128 players could log into basically a game server, like one that you hosted yourself,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
and if you logged out and logged back in, you could resume your career,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
but the universe would have kept on even though you personally were not there.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And basically the plot of it, the first player or single player campaign mode is

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
you are a freelancer, which means you buy and sell ore from different star systems.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
You know, buy low, sell high, blah, blah, blah.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
But then you discover that you were used to smuggle alien artifacts,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
and you discover the secret alien race that's going to kill humanity,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
which is also kind of like a Mass Effect thing.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So you start as, you know, just like a Han Solo type character pretty much,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and then you end up saving the universe.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Spoilers.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Yeah, I know.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Just kidding.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Isn't it kind of like those Mass Effect-y connections that make you kind of think of that game fondly now,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
or what is it about this game that made you think it's worthy of a classic?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It's been probably 10 years since I last played it,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
but I know I've played it from start to finish at least twice.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Just because visually how pretty the outer space looks and how fun.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Like the combat is genuinely really fun because of how easy it is to play.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And I believe there are multiple difficulty settings.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Don't quote me on that, though.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000
But yeah, you can take breaks from the story if you want, except for at certain set points.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
So if you really want to do more of the economy thing, you can do so.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:12.000
What Chris Roberts was picturing in his mind when he pitched Freelancer was really EVE Online.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
EVE Online is sort of what he really would have liked,

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
which was way too ambitious for Anvil or Microsoft to have done at the time.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:29.000
But when he was trying to describe it, ultimately I feel EVE Online is sort of the actual execution of what he wanted it to be

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:38.000
because in multiplayer mode, all you really did is you could fight enemies and pirates and buy and sell different commodities.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
But that was really it. And once you got over that, once you made money, there wasn't shit to do.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Quickly before we wrap up, how did you find this game? Was it because you followed Wing Commander?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I probably saw it at Electronics Boutique.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:00.000
I bought, even before PC games had download codes at GameStop. You can't get PC games at GameStop anymore now at all.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Well, you pretty much are buying a card with a code on it.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Yeah, but I don't even see those anymore.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But yeah, no, I was just PC gaming and came across this game probably within a year or so after it came out, maybe 2004, 2005.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Saw that it was by Chris Roberts and really enjoyed the purchase.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Awesome. Well, there it is. If there's nothing else left to say, your classic game of the week.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Freelancer for the PC by Microsoft Studios. Awesome pick. One that I didn't know a lot about really until today, even though I was probably more focused on console gaming at the time. I don't know. Maybe my PC wasn't good enough.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:46.000
The last thing that I'll make that was kind of neat is that the end game for the single player campaign is once you save the galaxy, blah, blah, blah, you're then sort of put back into the universe and you can do whatever you want.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:59.000
But again, that gets very boring because it's just you in this huge universe buying and selling the same commodities. So it's kind of like the end game is kind of really fall short.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Is this something people can still play? I mean, you said it was the servers were on your end, right?

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Yeah, I think you can host the server yourself.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Also, I should have said at the beginning, it was the Freelancer is technically the sequel to a game called Star Lancer, which I want to say Star Lancer was available on the Dreamcast. Freelancer was PC only and Star Lancer flopped really bad.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And Freelancer actually sort of elevated the legacy of that series because Freelancer was a very good game where Star Lancer was not.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Gotcha. Well, great.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
So now I'm done.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:43.000
All right. Well, thanks, Ellen. That was a great pick. Quickly, I know we got to get back to the show, but just like in general, how's your gaming, like your present gaming world going?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I'm playing Overwatch ranked mode again because I took like, I don't know, five or six months off. I missed.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
How do you like Ash?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
She's fun. I'm not particularly good as her because I'm not good at snipers.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Stop!

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Yeah.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
We'll quote Jennifer Hale again.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
True, yeah. Legend, icon.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Yes, because, yeah, we did meet her at GamerX. We have a picture with her.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Here's the part where Bobby in chat goes, Jennifer Hale was on my show.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Yeah.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Yeah, I know.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And but her voice is so recognizable to me now that even when she's putting on a Southern twang like Ash, I'm like, Jennifer, I know it's you.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So the Dark Souls thing finally ran out for you?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Yeah, I was playing the hell out of Dark Souls 2.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
But after a couple hundred hours, I basically got, this is not relevant to the classic game of the week, but...

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
That's okay.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:45.000
In Dark Souls 2, you can get a ring where if you equip it, you get a strength bonus on your bare fist so you can punch the shit out of monsters rather than the big giant Buster swords that normally Dark Souls is associated with.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:53.000
You have to go through this really tedious mess to get that ring. So I did a playthrough just punching the shit out of monsters.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Nice. All right.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Just like Boxer Girl, like a fight, like kung fu.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
But even if you put Dark Souls away for now, you'll probably come back to it in a few months time.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I still have not played Dark Souls 3.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And we do have to give a quick shout out to Akuma JP who fixed that situation.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Yes, my son, my handsome boy.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Not Akuma JP, but the Solaria Mibo.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Yeah.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I thought Mr. Smoosh was your son.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Yeah, I have many sons.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Okay.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Solaire of Astora is an iconic NPC from the first Dark Souls.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
It's hard to describe the fixation with him.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:37.000
He doesn't make any appearances in Dark Souls 2 or 3, which is a shame, but he is an iconic part of the Dark Souls or Demon's Souls legacy.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And you were able to get the amiibo.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And I was able to get the amiibo.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
No thanks to Gamestop.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Yeah, no thanks to Gamestop.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Apparently they had all sold out by like May.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
So dumb.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Because remember, Dark Souls Remastered for Switch was supposed to come out then.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Yeah.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
But it came out in like October.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Yep.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:58.000
So yeah, Akuma JP was like, I can just go there everywhere here.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
What do you?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Yeah.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So he mailed me one and also some candy, which is now all gone.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
So thank you for the candy.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Thank you.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
All right.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
We do need to get back to the show.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
What can I say?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I'm a little partial to you, Alan.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I'm always going to let you have a little more time maybe than the average guest.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Well, this is played during the break, so you're probably eating right now.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
That's awesome.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Yes, I'm hiding my time trying to shove an entire pizza.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And making coffee and going to the bathroom.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Yes, as one does during a three hour radio program.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
But we do need to get back.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Alan, thank you so much for being here.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Any last parting thoughts for our listeners this week?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Constructive criticism about the studio video quality.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Please no like rude comments.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Okay.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Yeah.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
No rude.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Everyone's been really cool so far.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Okay.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Right.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Bye.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.000
So we're back here live in studio episode number 757 of our show in progress for this

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.000
December 23rd of 2018, or as my sister used to call it, Christmas Eve Eve.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
So I don't know if you've ever heard that term before.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Is that just me?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
No, I've heard it.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
It was trending on Twitter earlier.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Was it?

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Oh, well now it's well now it's not cool to say anymore than if it's something all the

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
kids are saying, I suppose now.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Anyway, so thanks to Alan for filling in for the classic of the week.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I thought that was a good choice, a game I didn't know a lot about.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
So I learned something.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So I think that's something we'll kind of continue to do in 2019.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I mean, we love it when dark soccer is here and able to do stuff, but you know, things

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
happen and sometimes you can't always be here to do the classic game of the week.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
So I'd like to do more.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I mean, you've, we've done a ton of games by now, so we should get more guests in to

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
do stuff.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
It'll be fun.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
So we'll try to do more of that in the future.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Anyway, of course we are live at twitch.tv slash vog network and we hope some of you

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
listening out there on the podcast feed will join us for a live show some night.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
For those of you that are finding us through twitch TV, we hope you will check out our

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
podcast.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
We are of course taping a live audio podcast that we've been running for 16 and a half

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
plus years.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Uh, that's available over on iTunes, Google play podcasts, pretty much all the favorite

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
places to get podcasts except, except not yet Spotify.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Uh, that's a 2019 thing cause we are going to kind of be moving hosts behind the scenes.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000
So, um, I got to get all that taken care of and then we'll end up going to a Spotify,

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
but none of that, none of that's going to affect like you guys downloading and all that

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
stuff.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
So, all right, let's get back, I suppose, into some news.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
We need to do some rapid fire news for you guys here.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
All right.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
So you may remember that the whole clusterfuck of, uh, fallout 76, well Bethesda is trying

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
to make good with, uh, people that have stayed with the game.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.000
So now they basically announced on Twitter that anybody that has launched, logged into

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000
fallout 76 during 2018 will receive a copy of fallout classic collection on PC, which

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
is fallout, fallout two and fallout tactics.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And so, uh, no word on how you'll be able to get those, but I'm sure code within their

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Bethesda launcher or something like that.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Who knows?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Um, so stay tuned for that if you're playing the game.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And then of course, um, some unfortunate news for the uncharted movie.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:56.000
It's apparently speaking of movies, I have concerns about apparently, um, they had, uh,

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
lost their director.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So, um, right now they are, uh, without a director on that, you basically said that

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000
the closest to the starting line is uncharted and it's, that's a massive title.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Uh, we have a very good strip.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.000
We have our star Tom Holland, and now that is subject to schedule and additional casting.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:25.000
But as I say right now, it seems that most, um, be most near the horizon, but I don't

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
know what they're going to do now without, I guess I'll have to get a new director and

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
see how that goes.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
But yeah, I'm not a hundred percent on this movie either.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
It's just, I'm very skeptical with movies do change their directors a ton.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I mean, we know there's the very controversial guardians of the galaxy three and all everything

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
that's gone through, but you know that it's not uncommon for movies to lose directors.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Yeah.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
So I mean, but let's just hope it's not a sign of abandoned shit.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
It's probably just one of those, this project's taking too long to get off the ground.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I want to go do something else here.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:01.000
He's doing the, um, I thought they said James Gunn's doing the, um, the second, um, suicide

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
squad.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
No, no, no, no, no.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Wasn't the suicide squad.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
It was the other one with, it's like an all female on.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Oh yeah.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I don't remember what it's called, but I know what you're talking about.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Yeah.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Yeah.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
DC picked him up.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
That's which is the obvious solution to that whole thing is that if Marvel doesn't want

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
him here, Aquaman's apparently pretty good.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Is it?

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
That's fine.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I never get to the movies.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
It's that we actually, we were looking at going to see a movie last night, but there

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
was like nothing where we were like, ah, we were, well, the wreck it Ralph sequel.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
We almost spider man.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I don't follow the comics.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You don't have to.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
It's so good.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Okay.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I'll have to consider checking that out.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Alan really wanted to see the widows, that movie, but it's already gone from theaters.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I want to see also immortal engines by here.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
It's not very good, but I just want to see it cause it looks interesting.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Okay.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
But I would actually, if I had the choice between immortal engines and spider, I go

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
see spider man again.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I want to go see wreck it Ralph still the new it's it's good.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It'll be there for awhile.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
It's good.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I could probably even wait to see it on video and the spider man is really good.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
All right.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Oh, you're not the only one that's saying that.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
A lot of people are saying that new spider man movie is pretty amazing.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I mean, I've seen wrecking Ralph to wreck Ralph too was, it was a cute movie, but spider

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
man was just like, after you see it, you're like, damn, I need to go see that again.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
We get it.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Damn.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
All right.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, all right, let's talk about the NES switch online.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Of course, you know, you can play classic Nintendo games on switch online.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Still curious.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
So they're going to bring us in January, but we had some new games in this December.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Uh, we had Ninja Gaiden or excuse me, Ninja Gaiden.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Uh, we had, uh, adventures of Lolo.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Uh, we had, uh, they, they did a couple of those, like I'd forget the column with the,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
like the modest SP.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.000
So they did one for Metroid and then they did one for, um, dr Mario.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
But anyway, um, apparently, and I didn't know this, if you actually use the NES controllers,

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
cause those are out now.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Yeah.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
If you actually use the NES controllers with this, you actually get different color scheme

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and you get different sound effects that actually sound eight bit.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
So it's just like this little Easter egg.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
If you are actually using those old controllers, I guess that's neat.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Kind of neat.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Now this is what I think is more neat is that it was also discovered that with the new super

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Mario brothers, you on switch, that whole thing that's coming out, that game is going

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
to support the classic controllers.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000
So even though Nintendo made no promises beyond the switch online, you know, because of course,

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000
with that, those classic controllers are only having so many buttons.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Not every game is going to want to natively support that.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
But I guess because Mario games are generally pretty much the same, right?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
So you only need the two buttons.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
So they actually made it so that the new super Mario brothers, you on switch is going to

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
use those classic controllers if you want.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
That's kind of neat.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
But what's that new super Mario brother?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Well, I was going to say a new super Mario brothers that originated on the DS.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
So I was going to say, uh, yes, I was trying to think if it was DS and there was a Wii

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
version in the Wii U.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Because if it was on the Wii and they used the Wii remotes and those only had two buttons

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
as well.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
So then that makes sense.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Yes.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
But technically this is a Wii U port, but yes, I mean for sure what you're saying there.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I'm more curious because I remember on the Wii U version, the second player could like

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
draw on the screen and do something.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I'm just assuming that's just gone or maybe you could do it in portable mode and touch

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
the screen.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
But I, it's probably not really a thing anymore.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I don't think it's a thing.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I think they just probably took it out.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
It was like, ah, it's just one of those things that's going to go.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
And instead you get things that inspired Bowsette memes.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So enjoy it.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Uh, speaking of things to enjoy in Nintendo products, uh, Firewatch is on the Switch.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I don't know how many of you have checked out Firewatch finally on the Switch because

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
it was on a ton of other, it was on PC, it was on PlayStation 4.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I loved Firewatch, but you know, I love the walking simulators, which I still don't like

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
that title, but if that's what they're going to call it, fine.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Um, I just recommended today, everybody's gone to the rapture to somebody who hadn't

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
played it yet.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I was like, oh, you got to play that game.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
But anyway, Firewatch is really good too.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And it's on the Switch and apparently they've actually hidden away a Nintendo 64 controller.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
There's actually a little Nintendo game called forest 64 and you can find this like it's

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
a little Easter egg and uh, yeah, I think it's just like cute little things to find

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
in the game.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
So, um, yeah, neat.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I like those little things.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
They did that same thing in a gone home.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Another one of those kinds of games that finally came out on the Switch.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
They did almost like the super Nintendo games that were hidden in the sister's room or

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
something like that.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Right.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Yeah.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
So yeah, not, not unheard of to see these types of callbacks.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So anyway, there you go.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Uh, there's some rapid fire news for you in what is otherwise kind of a slower news week,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000
but we still got some things to cover, including release dates, question mark.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.000
I really see is this, this is Christmas week.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I just don't know if anything at all is coming out this week, but it's worth checking in

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
anyway.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
There, there's nothing.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
There's nothing that's coming out.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Um, console wise as far as like, um, an actual physical release or anything.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Sure.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I'm sure there'll still be some indie titles, but yeah, we don't get a list of those.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
We got nothing on both fronts unfortunately.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
So, all right, well there's one release in Japan, actually a couple.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
There's one major release in Japan and a few minor ones.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Uh, but the major release in Japan this week on December the 27th Diablo three eternal

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
collection gets its Japanese release this week.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
So that's not something a little something cause you know, Christmas is kind of different

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
in Japan.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
It's not necessarily the hysteria it is over here.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Uh, but there's also on the switch, they have go vacation and Shin Sengoku Musou seven with

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Moshu then DX.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
So you have that to look forward to on the switch.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
It is still a slow week, but at least it's not completely barren.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I don't know about the UK Loki.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Imagine it's pretty slow over there too though.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Nothing there.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Nothing there.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Yeah, nothing coming out until the 10th.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Uh, black Mamba in our chat says, I heard Final Fantasy seven is coming to switch in

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
2019.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Is this true?

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I don't think they dated it, but it was in their last direct.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
They did.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
It was all the fun things.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Yeah.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
10, 12, seven.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
No, cause they skipped eight.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000
So not all the file fantasies cause remember everybody was like, where's eight though?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.400
But the eight, cause let's be real, they're all ported PC releases pretty much right.

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:13.480
Or they're ports of versions that have already come out.

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.160
Now even though seven had a really old PC release, it had a somewhat newer PC release

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:21.540
and it had more importantly that PlayStation four release.

01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:26.440
Remember when, um, at the PlayStation expo one year they announced it was before they

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.320
announced the fantasy seven remake.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.860
They announced fantasy sevens come to PlayStation four and everybody loses their shit.

01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:33.860
And they're like, yes, it's the classic final fantasy.

01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:37.360
And like they go back to the audience, everybody's just like complete stone face.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:38.360
Like really?

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.360
Bitch.

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:40.400
Do you remember that?

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:41.400
When they unveiled that?

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:42.400
Yeah, it was funny.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.880
So anyway, that's the version I think they're probably doing on the switch.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:45.880
And so there's what?

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:51.600
Seven, nine, 10, not 11, 12, and probably some other stuff too.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.600
I'm forgetting in the moment.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.360
Why not 11?

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.320
I know because I don't, I don't know if square knows where I feel like file fantasy 11 is

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:02.680
that thing that just kind of exists in a dark room somewhere and nobody's really checking

01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:03.680
on it.

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.360
The mobile version is supposed to be coming out mobile version or like I check it out

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:13.320
on like, you know, cause switch can't run, you know, 14 we'll just get a remastered

01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:15.800
11 and I'm fine with that.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.680
Uh, Dr. Studio says, I thought I heard eight issue was licensing the music.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:20.680
Well, that would be weird.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.880
Wasn't all the music in an original, except unless maybe there was some weird agreement

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.600
with Faye Wong eyes on me.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.040
Like I don't, would that really be a thing?

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:29.160
I don't know.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.560
So I guess I could be surprised.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:35.400
Maybe they had a guest artist or something, uh, that, Oh, dark to see it says it's the

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.320
one song eyes on me.

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:40.280
So maybe, you know, you could do the Konami thing.

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:45.280
No, you could do the Konami thing and get someone new to sing it.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.480
I'm down.

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:50.360
Act Def says maybe it explains why there's only two songs in smash.

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:53.360
Cause you know, the final fantasy stuff in smash is pretty thin.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.840
They really didn't go out of their way to add new fall fancy stuff where it's like everything

01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:59.040
else kind of like has like new fancy stuff.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.960
It's just really bother with this cloud.

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:02.960
It's fine.

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:03.960
All right.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.720
This is the part of the show where we would usually get it in the mailbag.

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.560
However, there were no emails this week.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:15.160
If you want to send us emails, you can send those emails to participate at orange launch

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.920
radio.com but unfortunately when I opened up the mailbag at participate at orange launch

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.920
radio.com there were no emails there.

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.480
So you know what that means?

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:28.080
I get to spend some time talking about RuPaul's drag race, all stars for hooray.

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.560
So did you see this week's episode?

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.560
Nope.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.560
I didn't.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:36.520
The lip sync with the lip syncs this season have been on point.

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:39.560
The one, this, I'm not going to spoil everything cause I probably, everybody's not watched

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.280
it, but the lip sync this last episode was so good.

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.280
So good.

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.280
I, it was, it was good.

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.920
I can't wait for the next episode of reading is fundamental, cheap plug to talk about it.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.920
It was good.

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:52.240
But here's, I'll tell you this, this has got a lot of people talking in the community.

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:58.040
The next episode, the one that airs this Friday leaked because wow.

01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.920
Cause everybody has to have their own Netflix thing.

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.080
So RuPaul's production company, wow presents world of wonder on their plus service where

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:10.120
they do like uncensored drag race and other, you know, uh, specials and things like that.

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.120
Wow.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.800
Plus or whatever overseas accidentally posted the third episode early.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.360
Oh, but you know what happens once it's on the internet is always on the internet.

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.880
So it's over on Reddit and you know, they're trying to hide it.

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:27.400
You kind of have to know like what corners to look and where, but if you really dig for

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.400
it, you can find it.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:32.280
And so I already saw this Friday's episode because if I didn't watch it now, I was going

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:33.280
to get spoiled.

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.560
So I had to watch it before somebody else could spoil me.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.320
So obviously I would never spoil for those that are keeping themselves away from it.

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.720
But this week's episode is pretty darn good too.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.760
That's all I'm really going to say, but I'm still rooting for Monique Hart.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.320
Do you know who Monique Hart is?

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.320
No.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.320
Okay.

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:50.320
All right.

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.440
I don't know anything about three words, Loki Brown cow stunning.

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.120
That's all I need to know.

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.120
Okay.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:02.160
It's really must like their, their dairy products.

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:05.760
Um, looking at, uh, it, Oh, Bobby Blackwell.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.760
Okay.

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.040
You can ask this about an email segment.

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.480
Bobby Blackwell asks, so what happened on survivor?

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:15.660
So I can tell this little side story has nothing to do with gaming, but if you're not going

01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:18.100
to send emails and I get a tangent time.

01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:20.080
So I don't know if you knew about this trip I took.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.280
So I took a trip in the middle of the week.

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:25.080
We drove down on Wednesday and drove back on Thursday.

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.800
We went to LA and here's why.

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:32.920
We were trying to get into the survivor finale in LA that they do at CBS studios.

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.400
And one of my friends, Kami, she got in through the seat filler.

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:41.040
All our female friends got in, all the males did not get in.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.040
Hmm.

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.200
I wonder what that's all about, but maybe it was just a coincidence.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.200
But anyway, um, actually this girl that I met while I was down there, that's kind of

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.780
hangs in the same kind of group.

01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:51.520
She was right in the front and center at the very beginning.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:52.520
You could not miss her.

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.520
So that was pretty cool.

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.480
We were watching it since we didn't get in, we went to watch an East coast feed at somebody

01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.040
else's place and we got to, uh, you know, um, uh, kind of watch there.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:04.920
And when we saw this girl in the front row that we knew it was like, Oh my God, we know

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:05.920
her.

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.920
So that was, that was kind of fun.

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.040
And so here's the thing though.

01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.920
So I didn't just drive all the way to LA to like do nothing and end up watching an East

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:11.920
coast feed.

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:12.920
I mean, I met new friends, new people.

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.780
That's always fun, but we knew the place cause you know, people talk, we knew the place where

01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:22.600
all the people that were on the show that felt like doing after partying, we're going

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.440
to go, we knew what bar they were going to.

01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:28.360
So like some dumb survivor groupies, which is funny cause you know, I used to be obsessed

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.360
with the show, right?

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360
Like I used to watch it all the time.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:34.360
And I kinda like when I started doing more podcasts like on Wednesdays and stuff, I kind

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.680
of fell out of the habit of watching.

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:39.580
So I haven't watched religiously, but I've caught like two or three episodes this season

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:41.400
and this, this last season was pretty good.

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:45.340
So we went to the place in LA where all the people were going to show up and they did.

01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:49.900
So we got to meet a lot of the people and a lot of, you know, the people that were on

01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:51.920
it previously all showed up too.

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.360
So that was kind of fun.

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:57.600
You know, I didn't, I didn't recognize any everybody and I don't like to do the picture

01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:00.960
thing an awful lot because I feel like then it's like you're asking somebody, you're going

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.480
up to somebody and going, can I get a picture?

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.480
Can I get a picture?

01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.440
And then like, you know, you take that picture and they're like, okay, thanks.

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.440
Have a good one.

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:10.500
And I'm like, I think that's so like, I don't know, like I would rather like talk for like

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.260
two minutes to somebody.

01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:15.760
So I didn't really get a lot of selfies, even though we got to talk to like, uh, Gabby was

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:18.600
one I know for sure that we ran into Allison was out front.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:21.080
If you don't watch survivor, these names mean nothing to you.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:25.040
Uh, but anyway, yeah, so, and, and the guy who won was there too.

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.200
So it was, it was a lot of fun.

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:31.200
So um, but I, the person I did run into that I had to get a selfie with and you have no

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:37.800
clue who this person is, but if I like survivor, I really like big brother, which is the really

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.480
trashy one right in the house.

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:40.480
Yeah.

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.540
I met Arisa Cox and I wouldn't expect you would know her, but anybody up north might

01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:47.280
know her cause she's the host of big brother Canada.

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.880
So she was there at the survivor thing because I think ET Canada was covering it because

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.480
there's a lot of people in Canada, they don't have their own survivor in Canada.

01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.480
They have their own big brother.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.480
They don't have their own survivors.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.480
They watch ours.

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.180
So I think she's kind of the bridge.

01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:04.220
Like she does the little like correspondence for survivor in Canada.

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:05.220
So that was my moment.

01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:08.840
That was my little celebrity encounter for the Canadians that listen, that might know

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:09.840
who I'm talking about.

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.840
She was really nice.

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:11.880
She was really patient.

01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:15.320
This drunk guy offered to take a picture of us and he was just being really awkward and

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:16.880
it was like a really super awkward moment.

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.880
I was like, Oh, it's okay.

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:18.880
I'll get a selfie.

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.680
And I was kind of like, I'm like looking at her, I'm like, I'm so sorry.

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.680
You know?

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:23.680
She's like, Oh no, it's funny.

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.680
You know, type of thing.

01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:27.400
She was really like humble and she's, you know, asking me some questions about like,

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.080
how do you, how do you watch it down here?

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.140
And I was like, girl, you know, there's places on the internet and she's like, you know,

01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:35.140
so it was, it was cool.

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:36.140
It was cool.

01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:37.140
Anyway.

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:38.140
Um, I love this.

01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.640
Bobby in chat says I robbed as one show on Twitch and then he immediately goes to Hollywood.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:44.560
Oh, you know, but now, now they did, it was fun.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.600
I met, met some friends.

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.520
I've known online for a long time and that was, that meant more to me than people on

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.520
a TV show.

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.040
I watched twice there.

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:53.040
They're all normal people.

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:56.080
You guys, it's just, it's just Hollywood.

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:57.080
It's just a show.

01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:58.080
Just like this.

01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.080
All right.

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:00.080
Anyway, that's enough.

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.080
That's enough about weird, crazy.

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:04.560
I can't believe I did that, but it was one of those things where my friends were like,

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:05.560
do it, do it.

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.560
Why not?

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.560
And I was like, you know what?

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:08.560
Good point.

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.720
Like I could use just a random trip.

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720
Why not?

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720
Let's do it.

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720
So it was fun.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.720
Anyway.

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:14.720
All right.

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:18.520
So we're getting into some actual video gaming news now that I've told my little midweek

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:24.000
a trip story and let's get into, uh, what's going on with, uh, trophies and what they're

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
telling us, right?

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Yeah.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:32.120
So there's this, um, feature that they've launched, I guess, called, uh, my PS4 life.

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:37.440
It's some sort of marketing campaign that is like a highlight video of a player's individual

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:39.440
stats and milestones.

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:45.060
So based on that, um, I guess with the game they're talking about, like how many of like

01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:49.720
a certain trophy out of how many people played the game, you know, what percentage you had

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:56.900
and based on that information, you're going to extrapolate how many copies of a game sold.

01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:59.160
So people used math.

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.240
People use math to reverse engineer.

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:02.920
People math this week.

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.600
And that is the headline on Kotaku.

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:05.600
Yes.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.520
So they, they have, I have to give a little crap.

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.520
Come on.

01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.360
They, uh, figured out like some of the player counts for certain games.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.920
So for example, Doom has 3.9 million people playing the game.

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:20.040
The Last Guardian, 1.94 million, um, people playing that.

01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:23.840
Uncharted Lost Legacy, 3.9 million.

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.520
Wolfenstein, uh, 1.4.

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.760
Detroit Become Human, 2.4.

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:31.800
Red Dead Redemption, 6.1 and so on.

01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.680
Fallout 76, only 407,000.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.480
To be fair, I bet that game hasn't been out as long as the others and you have to

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:39.520
earn those trophies.

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:40.520
Well, I mean, okay.

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:41.520
They're still, they're using the math.

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.520
Nevermind.

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:46.560
Cause even if only 0.1% of people have a trophy, you can still kind of figure some things out

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.560
that way.

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.560
That's interesting.

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:49.560
Yeah.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:55.320
But, I mean, there's room for error too, because there's only so many decimal points

01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:56.400
in those percentages.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.720
So obviously, I mean, we know these are just like estimates and they, there may be some

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.880
gray area cause some people buy games and then never unlock any trophies.

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:09.800
Some people bought the game, returned it, or so, so, and it went a second hand sale

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:10.800
basically.

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.240
So they still have the trophies on their account, but now somebody else bought the same copy

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:14.800
and has their own trophies.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.640
So it's, it's not quite, it's not proof proof math.

01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:20.040
No, for sure.

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:22.640
But it's interesting when we don't necessarily always get the sales number.

01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:23.640
Yeah.

01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.320
They haven't been releasing a lot of sales numbers anymore.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.200
They don't break it down like the MPD used to.

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:30.640
Um, now it's a lot of that's private unless they want to brag about, oh, look at how well

01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:31.640
our console sold.

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.160
Hence the Smash Brothers story from before the break.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.160
Yeah.

01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:36.160
Yeah.

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:40.280
Uh, going in chat at live or see that live.vognetwork.com will still work, but at, uh, at a Twitch TV

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:44.560
vog network, uh, active says people did math and obtained results more at 11.

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:45.560
Yep.

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:46.560
Pretty much.

01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:50.280
But that, that's the kind of stories you get on Christmas and new year's week when everybody's

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:52.800
finally on vacation, I think at this point of the year.

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:56.720
So let's move on to something else overseas that might be a little more serious.

01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:02.920
Uh, in Germany, legal action is being pursued against Nintendo for their no cancellation

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.640
eShop preorder policy.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:05.640
Uh, yeah.

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:10.080
If you didn't know that, if you try to preorder something on Nintendo, uh, you cannot take

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.080
back seas.

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:14.360
Uh, you can't have it built in that they can do that.

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:18.880
So, uh, they say, uh, when you go, it can't be, they, so they tell you, it's not like

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.880
you're surprised.

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:23.700
It is, it's in that little print that a lot of you probably don't read, but people will

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:27.480
try to call customer service and it's not something that they really do.

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:32.800
So, uh, the Norwegian consumer council initially kind of started to try to change this policy

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:38.340
but now the German consumer protection authority has collaborated with the Norwegian consumer

01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:43.220
council and is now going to take legal action against Nintendo Europe because Nintendo Europe

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:45.020
is based in Germany.

01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:48.320
Now if you think our courts are slow, so are theirs.

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:52.400
So it's not something that's going to happen overnight, but, uh, there's some, uh, further

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.320
details about what's going on here.

01:52:54.320 --> 01:53:00.560
Um, Nintendo did cite the article 16 of the European consumer law directive in their defense

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:05.280
and it says it doesn't have to allow cancellation if quote, the performance has begun with the

01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:10.040
consumer's prior express consent, which they're doing with the pop-up and with the acknowledgement

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:13.660
that he will lose his right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed

01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:14.800
by the trader.

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:18.840
But in the retort, the Norwegian consumer council said the company plainly states that

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:20.360
all purchases are final.

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.180
According to the right of withdrawal laid out in the consumer rights directive, such

01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:28.640
terms are illegal until the game can be downloaded and launched.

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:33.280
The seller cannot prohibit the consumer from canceling their preorder, which makes sense.

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:37.120
They really shouldn't be able to do that yet is a little weird because I mean, unless you've

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:42.800
actually downloaded the game, I mean, I don't understand you haven't downloaded anything

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.800
yet.

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:44.800
Well, who cares?

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.800
Let's, let's ask this question too.

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:49.200
Why is anyone preordering anything anymore?

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:53.100
Because people preorder stuff because they're either really excited about, they want to

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:57.000
actually buy something because they know that they want it or they're doing it because of

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.280
some sort of bonus that they're throwing in.

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.680
And that's really, that's the whole preorder culture.

01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:03.680
I understand.

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:05.440
It's got to be the bonus.

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:11.280
It makes sense in the sense of like physical copies because you have to know what to, you

01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:13.680
have to know what to bring in as far as inventory.

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.720
And so you need to have those preorders that gauge a number of like, here's how many copies

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.240
we need to bring in at this location type of thing.

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:24.920
But it's just, I buy a lot of stuff online and so I want to lock in that release day

01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:28.460
shipping from a major online retailer that I use.

01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:32.520
And so, uh, you know, that might be as, but that's about as far out as I preorder.

01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:39.240
Usually I've had a copy of Kingdom Hearts three on preorder since like 2013 because

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:44.160
said major online retailer accidentally listed it for like $40 at one point.

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:47.760
And so like I preordered it then and so now they have to honor that price.

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:48.840
They don't have to do shit.

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:51.800
They can cancel your order and then I guess they could, but they better not.

01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:52.800
That's not a nice thing to do.

01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:55.280
I'll cancel my prime.

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:56.280
I won't.

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.040
But anyway, I don't think they're going to do it.

01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:02.760
I think they are still on re because if you think about it, when the, uh, they were, um,

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.560
giving you the 15% discounts or 20%, whatever the hell it was anyway, that was about the

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:08.560
equivalent of that.

01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:09.560
Anyway.

01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:13.380
Now, yes, they got rid of that, but they're probably just writing it off for this one.

01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:17.520
You know, how many people got what I got and are still locked into it?

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:22.360
Probably not very many, probably also in related news, Kingdom Hearts three is like actually

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:24.660
a real thing that's going to happen.

01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:27.660
I kind of can't believe it.

01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:28.660
You know what I mean?

01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:31.560
Like, I feel like this game has been like a non-existent thing for so long and now it's

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:37.600
like actually going to happen and it's really weird, but anyway, um, Bobby Black Wolf points

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.800
out in our chat that he got the same detail, uh, but, uh, he wishes he was getting it on

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:46.000
Xbox one X probably because of the four K stuff and you know, the things his, his theater

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
can do.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.240
But for that price, he'll deal with it.

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:52.880
He says, uh, and then act F says, I can only imagine dark soccer's ears burning right now

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:55.280
with everyone using the word preorder.

01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:00.700
Well, unfortunately, whether it's gram grammatically correct or not, that is the term that everybody

01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:01.700
kind of runs with.

01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:03.400
So that's what we're using here too for now.

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:08.560
And really you shouldn't preorder games because agreed just in the like nowadays, like a lot

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:14.920
of stuff gets released, even if it's like a well known, like a quality Bethesda, most

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.040
of the, okay, but that's the games where the most of them come out.

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:19.040
They're functional.

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.640
I mean, and they, they're not terrible.

01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:26.120
They granted kind of said that with a question mark, they're functional.

01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.120
Yeah.

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:32.720
They're, they're, I mean like Skyrim and oblivion and like, and you'll follow three

01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:33.720
and stuff like that.

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.800
I mean, they were functional.

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:36.800
You would be satisfied.

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:37.800
Okay.

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800
This is a full game.

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:39.800
You know, whatever.

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.320
It's not completely broken out of the gate like it is with like the fallout 76 or a lot

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.040
of these games are releasing kind of in a broken state because, Oh, we need to get

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.320
it out right away.

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.160
So that's kind of one reason why you don't want to necessarily preorder because it could

01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:54.000
be a broken mess for a very long time.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.120
And if they're more interested in selling those emotes and DLC than fixing the game,

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:02.540
you're going to be stuck with a broken game for a long time.

01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:07.640
Why should you have to give them money upfront to be a beta tester for their fucking product?

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:11.400
I think there'll probably be less and less people preordering in 2019.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.520
I just, you know, especially now that you know that if you do it with Nintendo, you

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:15.520
can't cancel it.

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:18.800
I mean, I don't know how many people are really like, like, you know, if you want super smash

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:21.240
brothers, like you're not canceling that shit.

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.240
You know what I mean?

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:25.980
Like it's very rare, but I can also see people's personal life circumstance.

01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:30.660
Like what if you preordered a bunch of games and then heaven forbid you lose your job or

01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:34.220
you have a huge financial emergency of some other sort and you're like, all right, something's

01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:35.220
got to go.

01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:36.360
I better cut back all these games.

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:40.720
But if you did that with Nintendo, you can't, we'll just don't do it through their eShop.

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:46.000
You can do it at like a game store and because you're only putting $5 down there and you

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.740
can go in and cancel your game.

01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:54.440
And they'll invest your $5 and then give you just the $5 back and keep whatever got invested.

01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:55.440
Yeah.

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:56.440
Cause that's how it works.

01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:57.440
Some of these games.

01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:58.440
So like, I don't understand.

01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.440
I get it.

01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:01.600
Like the, you need to know how many copies of something and that's more of like for obscure

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:05.680
games, like, like, Oh, if I wanted to get earth defense force, you know, the day it

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:10.640
comes out, I might want to preorder that because if I want a physical copy, they might not

01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:13.840
order a lot of those because they're not expecting a lot of people want it.

01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:17.880
So that would be something I would need to go in there and actually order a copy of.

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:22.480
But if it's like Red Dead Redemption 2, they're ordering all the fucking copies they can get

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:26.480
and you're not going to have a problem getting that in, you know, getting that day one.

01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:31.200
Um, of course they'll tell you that it's going to be a problem, but you know, Bobby Blackwolf

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:36.480
in chat says I preorder hardware like rock band stuff, but that that's different because

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:39.960
you know, there'll be limited supply and some companies have real problems keeping

01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:40.960
them in stock.

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.960
Right?

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.960
Nintendo.

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.360
You know what I mean?

01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:47.320
So anyhow, it'll be interesting to see what comes of this.

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:51.160
If Nintendo is going to be forced to change their policy in Europe anyway, remember there's

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:55.600
no reason why it would just be Europe that changes, but uh, it is interesting as we're

01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:01.120
starting to elect more and more people from, you know, the generation X and millennial

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:08.640
generation into, um, Congress and into elected offices, you get more and more people that

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.640
are familiar with it.

01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:16.560
God, I fucking cannot wait for some computer literate people to be in the fucking Congress

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:17.560
and Senate.

01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.280
I already caught house in the Senate.

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:23.520
It's happening slowly, but it's not fucking like I know everybody's watched the clips

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:30.060
online of like people trying to explain to senators, you know, here's what an I or here's

01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:31.340
what Android is.

01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:32.340
Here's what Google is.

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:33.340
You know?

01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:34.340
Oh, my iPhone's not working.

01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:35.340
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:36.340
We don't make that phone.

01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:42.100
You know, we talking about, it's the same thing is it's like, I just want like somebody

01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:45.300
that knows what the fuck they're doing to be voting on it.

01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:48.540
Like you can't vote on the internet if you don't know what the fucking internet is.

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.540
Grandpa.

01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:56.420
I mean, seriously, just fucking like if you're that incompetent and stupid with it, you shouldn't

01:59:56.420 --> 01:59:57.820
be voting on anything.

01:59:57.820 --> 01:59:58.820
You should be out.

01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:01.180
What's his whining term limits?

02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:02.380
What's what's her name?

02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:05.100
I don't want to get too political, but I do crack again.

02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:09.020
This person I know is super controversial because she's she's really, really left.

02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:13.380
Alessandra Cortez, I know you're talking about, right?

02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:14.380
Sorry, guy.

02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:15.380
I'm so sorry.

02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:18.260
I just don't have the news articles in front of me and I forget the name in the moment,

02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:19.860
but I'm actually complimenting her.

02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:21.020
I think it's cool.

02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:24.060
Like politics aside, I don't want to bring that up right now, but like just the fact

02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:28.780
that if you go to her Twitter, she posts pictures of herself on Friday nights watching Drag

02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:30.340
Race, holding a glass of wine.

02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:33.680
And I'm like, politicians can be just like us.

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:34.680
It's amazing.

02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:35.680
You know what I mean?

02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:36.680
It's like, it's like that.

02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.780
Now that feels like a representation of me.

02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:40.780
You know what I mean?

02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:47.700
You didn't feel represented by the guy that spent all that campaign money on Steam games.

02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:48.700
Maybe a little bit.

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:50.900
Maybe a little work of gold or whatever the hell it was.

02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:51.900
Thank you.

02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:52.900
The chat room.

02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:53.900
Uh, saving me there.

02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:54.900
Ocasio Cortez.

02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:55.900
That's her name.

02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:56.900
That sounds, that sounds right.

02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:57.900
I don't know.

02:00:58.020 --> 02:00:59.020
Michael pointing out.

02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:02.860
Ted Lou has a computer BS in computer science and a BA in political science.

02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:04.280
So there you go.

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:09.620
And DJ Rama S says she's being nerfed in the Senate as we speak, but she's in the house.

02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:10.620
Isn't she?

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.260
Anyway, I don't want to do, I don't want to do blog, but I couldn't help but think of

02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:17.660
that when we talk about, you know, more and more game aware people like, you know, we'll

02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:18.660
never forget.

02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:23.140
I just brought this up in the show recently in that Supreme court ruling where like one

02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:26.880
of the Supreme court justices offices, like all the staff knew mortal combat.

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.880
They all played it growing up.

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:28.880
You know what I mean?

02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:29.880
Exactly.

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:35.320
It's a very different way of looking at it than when it was 1992 and you had what Alan

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:39.300
Tipper Gore, whoever it was up there going like, you know, kids today are playing this

02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:44.000
filth and you know, holding up a copy of night trap, which is the most ridiculous fucking

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.000
game in retrospect.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.800
If you just can't keep up with what's going on out in the world, then it's going to be

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.600
hard to be able to make rules about it.

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:56.260
It means, I don't know, then didn't you re you know, you have to rely on lobbyists to

02:01:56.260 --> 02:02:00.220
tell you what's going on and they're like, well, you see this, you know, free open internet's

02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:01.220
bad.

02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:02.220
You need to do this.

02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:03.220
Oh, okay.

02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:05.460
Cause you don't know the fucking going on.

02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:08.780
I mean, it's, it's just dumb, but anyways, enough politics, enough politics.

02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:09.780
Next story.

02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:10.780
Anyway.

02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:16.460
So speaking of things that aren't so great, I see now I used to be a huge fan of the lemmings

02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:24.660
and you know, back when geo cities was a thing, I used to do drawings of back when it was

02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:25.660
what spectrum?

02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:27.540
Holobyte was the company that made it right away.

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:28.540
Yeah.

02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:29.540
Psychosis.

02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:30.540
Oh, okay.

02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:33.380
Um, which, you know, originally it's right.

02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:34.380
You're right.

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:35.380
You're right.

02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:37.820
DMA done designs, you know, did, uh, grand theft auto and stuff.

02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:39.460
So lemmings lemmings too.

02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:41.620
You know, I used to, that'd be doing my jam.

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:48.500
Um, well now they have lemmings coming out, uh, mobile platforms and if you've never played

02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:53.300
lemmings, just say it was these little, you know, cause lemmings, they just follow blindly.

02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:54.300
Like that's what a lemming is.

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.300
Right.

02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:57.940
But they actually made a little character out of it and they would be, they would March

02:02:57.940 --> 02:02:59.700
in a line and like it was a puzzler game.

02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:00.700
Right.

02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:03.260
Like you had to get the lemmings to the exit without letting them die.

02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:06.300
But you had to make like builder lemmings, you had to build a wall.

02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:08.700
So the lemming would like turn around, go the other way.

02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:10.240
Like it was a puzzle game basically.

02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:16.020
So, um, here's the only thing about this because it is a mobile game.

02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:20.380
You know, there's the mobile tax, which is the tax on your patients and on your wallet

02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:25.860
because, um, in the game, of course, you know, because you have the different types of lemmings

02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:27.660
that you can create moves and stuff like that.

02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:31.980
Apparently, according to some of the chat comments here, each costs one in game currency

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:33.100
to do a move.

02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:38.980
And if you run out of moves, then you have to wait two hours or for 20 more of said currency.

02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:45.700
And otherwise you're going to buy like gold to do a move, I guess.

02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:48.380
I would have thought maybe to unlock new boards or to get it.

02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:49.380
I don't know.

02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:52.300
That's what I'm reading, but you know what, here's the thing.

02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:56.180
So if you want to check it out, it's pro it's free to play.

02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:57.180
So check it out.

02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:58.180
You don't like it.

02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:01.420
Or if it's just bullshit with the fucking microtransactions, delete, delete.

02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:05.140
I mean, it's, that's the easiest thing I could recommend.

02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:07.540
Comments from our chat over at a Twitch TV vog network.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.180
Uh, DJ Rama S says, I fucking love lemmings.

02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:11.540
Pretty, pretty simple comment there.

02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:12.980
But I mean, it looks like lemmings.

02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:13.980
It looks pretty cool.

02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:18.380
It's just, I, I, uh, what's that wheel?

02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:22.420
I just saw it spin a wheel and like you get like super lemmings or different things, but

02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:23.420
character lemmings.

02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:24.420
Oh Lord.

02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:25.420
Anyway.

02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:29.340
Uh, Brack, the man has played this a little bit, a comment here saying I'm a pretty hardcore

02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:34.940
lemmings fan and I've been playing a bunch of this mobile game and what a bummer.

02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:35.940
I'm sorry.

02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:36.940
That's fine.

02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:39.180
I've been playing a bunch of it and I hate it.

02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:43.100
I don't know why, but I can't stop playing it.

02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:44.100
I hear that.

02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:46.660
Uh, Dr. C says I did like lemmings on super Nintendo.

02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:48.780
I think we rented it once or twice back then.

02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:49.780
Yeah.

02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:52.980
That was around the time that it was, you know, really at its peak on PC was like lemmings

02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:58.020
and lemmings too, you know, with all the music on the ad lib card and all that stuff back

02:04:58.020 --> 02:04:59.020
in the day.

02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:00.020
So yeah.

02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:01.020
The originals were great.

02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:03.380
I had lemmings two on PC and lemmings one on NES.

02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:05.400
They did a PlayStation version, didn't they?

02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:06.400
They had to.

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:07.400
They probably did.

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:08.400
Super lemmings.

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:13.900
Funny enough, the last lemmings game that came out was a PlayStation mobile title.

02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:19.780
So I think it was also a mobile port as well, but it was also on a PSP and Vita.

02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:20.780
So they have that.

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:25.300
Um, but I mean, it's all right.

02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:26.300
All right.

02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:29.500
Well, uh, this is, you know, we were talking about Kingdom Hearts three a little bit ago

02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:34.220
and some people are getting an even better deal than, uh, the, uh, pre-order at a cheap

02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:35.220
price.

02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:37.300
Some people are already playing it.

02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:38.380
That's right.

02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:42.540
Even though the game is not supposed to come out until January 29th, some people already

02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:43.540
have it.

02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:45.260
Six weeks in advance.

02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:50.340
Uh, and this was confirmed, uh, developer, uh, Nomura confirmed copies of Kingdom Hearts

02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.260
three are out there six weeks ahead of schedule.

02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:54.220
Of course, they didn't say how it happened.

02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:59.980
If you want to believe rumors, there's some indie retailer in Mexico that put one on the

02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:00.980
street.

02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:01.980
I don't know.

02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:04.200
But my question is how the hell did they have it that far out?

02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:09.140
That's I really thought it's the, it's the distributor or whoever's, well, it's, it's

02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:13.860
really, it comes down to Sony's fault because Sony doesn't know any of these distributors

02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:18.700
shouldn't or companies shouldn't be shipping that product to these distributors that early

02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:21.860
and they shouldn't be shipping it out to the stores that early and the source shouldn't

02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:23.220
be putting it out that early.

02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:29.100
So it's just somehow maybe copies fell off of a truck out of a duplicator or something

02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:30.100
like that.

02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:32.660
I don't know, but it shouldn't be out that early.

02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:36.420
Now here's the interesting thing in the statement from Nomura over on Twitter on the official

02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:42.740
Kingdom Hearts Twitter is that he's telling people to avoid clips, avoid spoilers, obviously,

02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:44.420
you know, that's the type of thing he wants to do.

02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:47.780
I'm sure Twitch is shutting that down as is YouTube.

02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:52.480
You know, it's, I, I believe it's against Twitch terms of service to stream a game before

02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:56.980
it's officially out unless of course you have permission, you know, you have a, you're a

02:06:56.980 --> 02:07:01.740
media outlet or something, but that's, that's special circumstance.

02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:08.540
But anyway, apparently Nomura confirmed the epilogue and a secret movie, which apparently

02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:10.860
is some of the biggest spoilers out there.

02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:12.620
They're not on the disc.

02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:15.660
They will be released later just in case.

02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.220
And this was the case.

02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:22.220
So the biggest spoiler, I mean, some spoilers will leak, but the biggest ones can't.

02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:25.140
They are locked or they're, they're not on the disc.

02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:28.180
So you have to actually download a day one patch to get it.

02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:32.020
Uh, yeah, it's released at a later date just in case, so they will not be shown before

02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:33.500
the game's release.

02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:37.140
And Nomura continues, we want everybody to equally experience the full game after its

02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:38.140
release.

02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:40.340
So we ask for your continued support on its matter.

02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:44.260
We're grateful that fans have been warning each other already about the spoilers and

02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:45.380
so on and so on.

02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:47.340
Do they finally kill Donald Duck?

02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:53.660
That would be a great, I told you, bitch, if you don't heal me this time, it's over.

02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:56.980
Heal please.

02:07:57.020 --> 02:08:00.860
So anyway, I, and I may, maybe that is the, no, I made it up, I made that up, but I know,

02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:02.180
and they're not going to kill a Disney character.

02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:03.180
Give me a break.

02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:04.700
Um, well maybe they do.

02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:05.700
Maybe that's the gag.

02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:06.700
Maybe they do.

02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:07.700
I don't know.

02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:09.700
They might kill one of the square characters, but they're not going to kill a Disney character.

02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:10.700
So I don't know.

02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:15.060
So I don't know if it's those kinds of spoilers or, you know, so and so was X, Y, Z all along

02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:18.580
or what it is, but just be careful surfing the internet.

02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:21.420
There's a lot of people that are very sensitive about spoiler stuff.

02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:25.740
So, um, you know, but, but like on the, the Kingdom Hearts, Reddit and stuff, they're

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:29.760
not letting people talk about it and those sorts of things.

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:33.460
So just keep it in your pants till January 29th when everybody can play it.

02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:38.820
But it is, it's fascinating that it did leak this soon.

02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.820
You know what I mean?

02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:41.820
Yes.

02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:42.820
Yeah.

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:48.220
Um, what happens though, if you are somebody perhaps in Mexico or in another country or

02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:52.620
in a remote area, like in Alaska where you don't have a strong internet connection to

02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:55.400
download this stuff on a day one patch.

02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:57.400
Now what do you do?

02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.500
I think that's a good question too, is it's like, well, this move kind of screws those

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:01.620
people.

02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:04.460
It's gotta be a day one patch that they're doing that and they can't like, what if I

02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:06.140
can't connect to the internet and do it?

02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:11.020
So is it, are we just at the point where it's like, if you don't have internet, you shouldn't

02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:12.820
have a piece PlayStation four.

02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:15.220
Is that just where we're, is that where game companies are at?

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:17.100
Yeah, that's interesting.

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:22.420
I really feel like that is just kind of like the unspoken, like nobody wants to say that.

02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:25.220
And I'm not saying that, but the industry, the industry is saying that with what these

02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:28.580
actions here is their basis to say, if you don't have internet, maybe PlayStation four

02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:34.220
isn't for you or, or Xbox one or you know, anything that is, is really online a lot.

02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:38.780
And I think this may be especially so with PlayStation five and what we get to for the

02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:44.340
next generation and act Efton point act Efton chat says it is what it is, Robin, that there's

02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:45.340
really nothing.

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:48.300
Not going to make anybody not buy the game because they're going to have to download

02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:49.300
a huge day.

02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.300
One patch.

02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:53.300
It's not, that's not going to change anybody's mind.

02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.540
No, you might have one or two Twitter, crazy people that are like, this is an outrage,

02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:00.820
but it's just, it's just not, it's not going to change people's mind.

02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:06.500
I mean, it's, it's the day and age where like, you know, of course you have internet.

02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:08.660
What don't you have internet?

02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:09.660
Don't you have phones?

02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:12.740
Don't you have a phone?

02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:16.060
Just a few more stories before we try to get to the Skype line tonight, and then we'll

02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:17.060
wrap up.

02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:19.860
I don't know if Skype is going to work tonight, you guys though, but we'll try.

02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:25.980
It's going to be so long story short, um, the Skype thing on the old, the old thing,

02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:27.820
like finally died.

02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:30.820
And so I have to get Alan to do, since we're going to be off next week, I have to get Alan

02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:34.940
to do the upgrade on this computer so that way I can run the new stuff and then we'll

02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:36.140
be able to do that again.

02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:38.940
Or I've got to be able to do it over here, but long story short, I got to run it off

02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:39.980
my phone.

02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:41.700
But I think in this period, we're going to be gone.

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:45.140
I can get Alan to do those upgrades in this PC and then I'll be, I'll be all good and

02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:49.940
can run the new Skype and have this on windows 10 and all that stuff and, and be set.

02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:50.940
So that'll be nice.

02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:55.220
But yeah, they finally killed Skype on the old windows, which we knew was coming in like

02:10:55.220 --> 02:10:56.380
November or something like that.

02:10:56.380 --> 02:11:00.300
So Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, filthy animal.

02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:03.940
So all right, anyhow, uh, let's get to a few more stories.

02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:04.940
Loki.

02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:11.400
So Blizzard is going to be, if you are going to be cheating in Overwatch or breaking rules,

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.660
it's going to go on your permanent record.

02:11:13.660 --> 02:11:17.260
They're going to have this, I'm going to note this in your file, the, yes, they're this

02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:18.560
Overwatch league.

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:24.520
Uh, they've got a discipline tracker that's basically going to log any sort of infractions

02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:29.360
that players have, um, in different events and you'll be able to actually view those

02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:30.360
infractions.

02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:36.680
Um, they said that the tracker is, uh, seven players have already been penalized according

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.680
to the tracker.

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:45.160
Um, and of course, league play doesn't start until February 14th, but, um, they're going

02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:51.440
to be conducting, I guess, full reviews of players conduct in history and, um, gamers

02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:52.440
as well.

02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:58.100
Um, when they're picked up by teams and just going to be, it's, um, apparently players

02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:03.040
who are not in an Overwatch league team could face suspensions or fines if they returned

02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:04.600
to league play.

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:11.520
Um, but yeah, it's, it's interesting that they're really keeping track of all that stuff.

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:15.360
Uh, of course, you know, they've been punishing them for other things other than breaking

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:20.120
rules, but like making, you know, racist, shitty things on their Twitch streams and

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:21.120
stuff.

02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:22.120
Yeah.

02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:23.120
Yeah.

02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:24.120
We know about that.

02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:25.560
So I was, I was, I was, when we brought this up, I was fascinated, like how many people

02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:32.600
were already on it and it seems like the most major infraction is some type of like bot,

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.280
bot botting, um, like power leveling and a low B account.

02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.280
What do they call it?

02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:38.280
Thank you.

02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:41.000
So it's been count boosting for two account boost account boosting.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
That's what it is.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.040
And that's when you get like a high level player who plays something low, like a throwaway

02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:48.960
account or something to play against like lower level players.

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:53.600
Or, uh, I want to say it has something to do with like helping people get up into the

02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:55.340
big ranks fast.

02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:59.120
Like basically you go play on a low account, you play really, really, really well and you

02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:01.840
kind of like boost the skill level of that account.

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:05.440
So whoever really wants to play it can play with higher level people, if that makes sense.

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.400
I don't know why you would do this, but people probably play pay money for this.

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:09.400
Yeah.

02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:12.120
They have had one person that's been a find a thousand dollars for account sharing.

02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:17.760
Uh, one person that was suspended three games for selling an account and obstructing league

02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.760
off.

02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:20.960
Is it official, official investigation?

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:21.960
Then try to hide it.

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:24.120
Uh, act F says it's called smurfing as well.

02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:25.880
I knew there was another term for that.

02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:26.880
Yeah.

02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:27.880
So interesting.

02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:30.520
Uh, when the new, the new season of the league hasn't even started.

02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:32.560
Um, and I know they unveiled all the new teams.

02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:34.200
There's a lot of new teams out there.

02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:39.200
Uh, I did not see if there were any more women maybe with all these expansion teams.

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:43.000
Cause you know, I was kind of like, where are the women at?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.560
And uh, the two I looked at didn't have any, but to be fair, I haven't looked at all the

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.460
new teams, so I don't know.

02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:53.240
But I'm, I'm preparing myself to be extremely disappointed that we're not progressing much

02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:54.240
in that.

02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:57.980
But is it because they're just not allowing women to play or is it just because women

02:13:57.980 --> 02:13:59.400
just don't want to do it?

02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:02.940
I think they aren't trying hard enough to find women.

02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:04.120
That's kind of what it is.

02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:07.480
Or, you know, recruit, train, build up women.

02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:08.480
You know what I mean?

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:12.320
I think there's, there's, there's tons of women out there who love Overwatch.

02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:15.880
Like go to any anime convention and people that are dressing up and a lot of people posting

02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:20.440
online, there's tons of women that love Overwatch and I'm, I'm sure just like there's plenty

02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:22.640
of boys who want to get good at it.

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:25.920
There's plenty of girls who want to get good at it and are trying to get good at it too.

02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:32.040
But for whatever reason, we're just, because gaming has typically been a very bro culture,

02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:35.680
and I've kind of addressed this before, I don't want to retry the wheel too much, but

02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:40.840
you know, we're just not making those kinds of opportunities and we're not, you know,

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:41.840
it's great.

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.040
We have at least one, but I don't want just a token.

02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:50.520
You know, there should be several women in the league for folks to look up to and aspire

02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:51.520
to be.

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:53.640
But again, I have not looked at all the new teams.

02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:58.560
If somebody wants to correct me and let me know there's, there's more folks joining Aguirre,

02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:59.560
that would be fantastic.

02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:04.800
But, oh yeah, and Act F points out, there's a lot of Overwatch girl streamers and they're

02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:05.800
pretty good.

02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:07.200
Don't know if they're pro level players.

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:11.660
Well, you know, it's, you have to kind of open, you start at the local level with the

02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:13.300
tournaments and things like that.

02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:17.520
But if the tournament culture is toxic to women and not accepting women and women get

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:21.760
in there and they just get like awkwardly hit on and you know, and I'm probably not

02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:22.880
the right person to talk about this.

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:27.280
You know, maybe Dar Sakura or other women out there can talk about some of the experiences

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:30.480
of weirdos at these events or not feeling welcomed.

02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:35.520
And I think what we can do as dudes is just welcome everybody.

02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:36.520
That's all we have to do.

02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:38.320
Make sure everybody feels welcome.

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:44.000
It seems that a lot of people that are like focused on being very good in like video games

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.360
tend to be a bit more introverted and socially awkward and don't necessarily know how to

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:53.200
conduct themselves normally around people in general.

02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:56.200
We can correct that appropriately too.

02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:01.280
We can call that out and say, Hey, like you really shouldn't say that to somebody.

02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:03.040
You know, we can do that too.

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:04.040
You know what I mean?

02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:06.040
And that's probably missing to be fair.

02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:07.040
That's probably a big part of it.

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:09.400
So anyway, I didn't mean to retread that whole ground.

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:11.420
Sorry, but I had to come up and I do.

02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:13.560
So it's, it's something I feel strongly about.

02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:14.560
All right.

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:18.200
Anyway, uh, we do have one more story for you guys tonight and it is about the, this

02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:20.160
brand new toy for kids.

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.840
I don't know if it's something your kids are probably too old for this at this point because

02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:27.280
it's a new Fisher Price toy and it looks like, it looks like an Xbox controller.

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:28.960
So it's like something for like babies.

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:32.400
It looks like an Xbox controller with little like numbers and letters all over it.

02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:38.840
But here's the hilarious thing is that apparently somebody at Fisher Price actually programmed

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:41.640
up up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:45.520
Be a start into this controller.

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:50.560
So when you do it, it actually like will like flash and play a special sound and all this

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:51.560
stuff.

02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:54.560
So it's kind of like, it's really one of those funny things that they did there.

02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:55.560
So it's awesome.

02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:56.560
Yeah.

02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:59.280
So it actually will like, you know, call out all the letters and shapes and all that stuff.

02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:00.280
It's kind of fun.

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:02.720
So a little, a little hidden secret thing that they did there.

02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:08.240
So um, cute is the type of thing you'd buy for a new kid.

02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:09.240
New baby.

02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:10.240
Yeah.

02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:11.240
Yeah.

02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:12.240
New baby.

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:13.240
Probably more so, but something that the adult, cause you know, sometimes you can't help it.

02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:14.240
You can't play with your baby's toys.

02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:15.680
You're like, you kind of play with it a little bit.

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:16.680
You're going to try.

02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:19.440
Well, somebody did clearly.

02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:21.440
Clearly it's like, Oh, Hey.

02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:22.440
Yeah.

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:23.440
All right.

02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:27.560
So anyhow, um, I'm going to try to get Skype open here in a moment.

02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:30.800
I needed to do this on my cell phone, but I got to sign out of my other account to do

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:31.800
that.

02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:34.160
So while I'm switching that over on my phone, uh, Loki, I don't know if you have any last

02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:35.400
minute stories.

02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:41.480
Um, if our Skype line is kind of flopping tonight as well, you can also feel free to,

02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:47.240
uh, send us questions in our chat room, uh, over at Twitch TV and we'll get to some of

02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:50.700
those, um, questions in chat as well.

02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:52.600
So we'll get to that here shortly.

02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:56.520
I just have to switch over cause I'm signed into my personal account right now and I'm

02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:58.580
going to switch over to the orange launch radio account and then we can start taking

02:17:58.580 --> 02:17:59.580
some calls.

02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:02.920
So while we wait for that, I don't know if we have any, uh, last minute stories, last

02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:03.920
minute stories.

02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:07.640
We can talk a little bit about the Soulja boy game console and I mean, okay, I'll be

02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:08.640
fast.

02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:09.640
Long story short.

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:16.160
Um, he is drop shipping these like retro game consoles that you see like in like mall kiosks

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.160
and stuff like that.

02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:23.000
Basically these consoles that emulate other systems and have like all these illegal roms

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
thrown on there.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.400
Um, and then he's calling them the Soulja boy game consoles and stuff and it's like,

02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:34.160
that's bad enough at as it is, that's these really shitty Chinese knockoff consoles that

02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:35.440
have stolen roms in there.

02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:39.240
But then he's just doubling down on that shit basically when people are calling him out

02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:43.280
on it and saying, Hey Nintendo, I, you might want to take a look at this because there's

02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:47.680
fucking NES roms on this shit and then Ted has come after people for a lot less.

02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:52.240
Uh, so now he's just like, you know, fuck all you guys, I don't give a fuck of what

02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:53.240
Nintendo does.

02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:55.720
You know, come at me bro type of shit.

02:18:55.720 --> 02:19:01.700
And so, you know, he's been posting stuff on Twitter and that's been not so necessarily

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:07.780
nice and um, to which people have basically said like myself, that's not going to end

02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:12.620
well for you sir, but it'll be interesting to see how that goes.

02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:13.860
All right, let's see if this works.

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:14.860
I'm going to try to do it live.

02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:16.060
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:18.060
Who's this?

02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:20.580
Oh, I'm not hearing it.

02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:21.580
Hold on.

02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:22.580
Rage nator.

02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:24.180
Uh, it might be cause my volume is all the way down.

02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:25.180
Try again.

02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:26.180
Rage nator.

02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:31.740
Oh, I was worried about, wait, maybe, maybe the issues over here.

02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:32.740
Hold on.

02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:34.740
I'm going to try to fix one thing over here real quick.

02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:35.740
I don't know.

02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:36.740
Live radio folks.

02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:37.740
I know.

02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:38.740
That's television.

02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:39.740
Oh, you know what?

02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:40.740
No.

02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:41.740
I had this knob all the way down, so I bet that's why we couldn't hear him.

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:42.740
Try again.

02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:43.740
Rage nator.

02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:44.740
Are you there?

02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:45.740
Can you hear me now?

02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:46.740
Yes, we can.

02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:47.740
Good.

02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:48.740
I just needed to touch the knob.

02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:49.740
All right.

02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:50.740
Anyway.

02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:52.740
Um, I can link that very well.

02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:53.740
Thank you.

02:19:53.740 --> 02:19:54.740
What's on your mind tonight?

02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:55.740
Rage nator.

02:19:55.740 --> 02:20:01.740
Uh, well since I already asked the question to Bobby, I can't, I didn't ask you now, especially

02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:05.740
since this will be your last show for the year.

02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:12.900
Um, what would you say is, uh, your game of the year or games?

02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:14.400
Game of the year or games.

02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:18.260
We're going to address this a little bit on our first episode back to give us a little

02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:21.520
time to play more games, but give us an early preview.

02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:24.340
What do you think is in contention for your game of the year?

02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:26.740
Loki, what do you think is in contention for your game of the year?

02:20:26.740 --> 02:20:30.500
Um, contention, I would say probably Super Mario Odyssey because I picked up my Switch

02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:31.580
in April.

02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:35.100
So I mean for me that was kind of, you know, it was a really good game.

02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:39.300
So um, yeah, I'd probably be one of them.

02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:43.460
I really like, I didn't play a ton of games this year, at least I don't remember.

02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:48.340
I have to go back and think about it, but I would say absolutely expect to hear Tetris

02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:49.900
Effect in my list somewhere.

02:20:49.900 --> 02:20:53.260
I just haven't decided where it's going to be yet.

02:20:54.260 --> 02:21:04.380
Yeah, um, now, uh, you know, I'm not totally sure if I guessed this last week or not, uh,

02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:11.660
but just in case I did not, um, seeing as Steam is having their Christmas sale right

02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:14.540
now, did you pick up anything?

02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:18.340
Not yet, but I'll probably go through my wish list later because I did see some games were

02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:20.940
down to like $5 or something like that.

02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:25.100
Look guys, I have Rage Nator trapped in the box, just like I had Bot Culture last week.

02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:28.980
Get me out, get me out!

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:33.820
But not yet because thankfully Loki already bought me the Katamari Damacy, that wasn't

02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:38.620
technically a sale though, but that was a Steam wish list purchase of sorts.

02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:45.340
So that's kind of where my holiday playtime has been, at least so far.

02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:48.620
Oh, excellent choice.

02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:49.620
I agree.

02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:50.620
What about you?

02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:51.660
Do you have anything?

02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:53.180
Like, tell us one game real quick.

02:21:53.180 --> 02:22:03.380
Uh, well, um, I only got one thing, a piece of DLC, it's the Deluxe, uh, Edition Upgrade

02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:12.820
to, um, what was the game, uh, Shadow Warrior 2, uh, that DLC is normally like $10, it was

02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:18.620
75% off, um, I already had the game for free.

02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:26.460
I only got the DLC because, for the soundtrack and to a lesser degree, the diary book, but,

02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:30.860
um, that was really the only thing I could have before, I just barely scraped together

02:22:30.860 --> 02:22:33.380
the $250 for that, so.

02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:38.260
Well, there's also still a lot of time, because the sale goes on until what, like June, or

02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:39.260
June?

02:22:39.260 --> 02:22:40.260
June.

02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:41.260
Until June!

02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:42.260
I don't like it.

02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:46.900
January 3rd, yeah, there it is, and it's January 3rd at 10am, so, um, you know, early in the

02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:50.060
morning on January 3rd, but it's going through January 3rd, and I'm sure there's gonna be

02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:54.380
a lot of people that will get, like, gift cards and things that they get over the holiday

02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:57.900
that they'll want to spend on the store, and it seems like Steam no longer, like, I remember

02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:01.680
they used to do this whole, it's on sale for this much, for these four hours, they kind

02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:03.020
of just stopped doing that, because they really-

02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:04.740
They do different things each day.

02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:09.860
It switches up, I like to, I tend to go to the Game Deals subreddit, and I watch stuff

02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:12.580
through there, because they'll tell you, like, all these different sites that things are

02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:17.060
on sale, and you may even see, like, free games, like Humble was offering, like, a free

02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:19.380
LEGO game last week, and a free LEGO game this week, so.

02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:20.380
Oh, cool.

02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:21.380
I've been adding stuff-

02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:23.180
Oh, is it, doesn't the Epic store start giving away games?

02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:28.020
Yeah, Epic Store is doing Subnautica right now, so you can pick that up, um, so you may

02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:31.580
want to do that, I think I already have that, though, so I haven't really picked it up yet,

02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:33.060
I may do it anyways, but.

02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:37.140
Your gaming backlog isn't big enough, oh, I did see that, and it's on Loki's screen,

02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:38.140
right now, so Caliber-

02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:39.900
Hey, and look how many games I have right now!

02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:41.700
No, 573, no Konami!

02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:42.700
Yeah.

02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:47.340
Uh, Soul Caliber 6 is 33% off, so I may, that may be the one that finally gets me.

02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:52.380
Alright, well, Rage Nator, I'm gonna let you go to try to see if we get any more calls

02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:53.380
in, okay, buddy?

02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:54.380
Yeah, sure.

02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:59.980
Uh, one thing, uh, before I, uh, do let you go, uh, just in case, you know, just in case,

02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:06.140
there's, uh, some people that, uh, listen to this show, but don't necessarily listen

02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:09.620
to Bobby's show, um, right now-

02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:13.100
Which isn't a good life choice, by the way, but, that's fair, there's only so many hours

02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:14.100
in a day, fine.

02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:19.940
Yeah, um, I mentioned, at least mentioned in Bobby's show, if you happen to have, uh,

02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:27.340
Xbox 360 or, uh, Xbox One, if you go onto their video store, they're having something

02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:33.220
going on, uh, where they're giving away free first seasons, a lot, a lot of anime series,

02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:39.380
so if you happen to like anime, or just looking for something to watch, anything to watch?

02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:42.300
Free entertainment, might as well grab it.

02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:46.140
Makes sense, give away the first season to get people to buy season two and three, makes

02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:47.140
sense, makes sense.

02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:49.220
All right, buddy, thanks for the tip, have a good one, okay?

02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:50.740
Yeah, all right, have a good one, bye.

02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:51.740
Yep, you too, bye-bye now.

02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:56.940
I swear to God, I don't remember half of these games that I purchased these.

02:24:56.940 --> 02:25:01.580
I need to, like, seriously, well, first off, I need to find a place to do streaming in

02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:05.860
my house, aside from my garage, I wish it wasn't all in my garage, the house is just

02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:09.900
not that big, but then I need to go back and play all of these games, just randomly

02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:16.580
pick a game off my Steam list every day, and just do a stream of stuff, cause I have, like,

02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:28.300
I don't even know where I got half of this stuff, this is ridiculous, um, let's see.

02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:31.420
That was, okay, now I can, that was weird, because somebody called, and then it like

02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:35.820
disconnected, it wouldn't connect the call, so I had to call them, isn't that weird?

02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:39.340
Yeah, Skype is all sorts of broken.

02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:44.220
Well, let's be real, the way I got it set up right now is like super crazy, but it works,

02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:46.260
so who are we gonna trap in our box now?

02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:49.580
Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio, who's this?

02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:54.860
You can't say I'm trapped in a box, because I'm used to living in a box, I'm currently

02:25:54.860 --> 02:25:58.060
living in a box as we speak, okay?

02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:02.740
Cause you live in New York City, and how much are you paying for that shoebox?

02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:07.580
I can't even joke, we're not that far from San Francisco, and it's worse in San Francisco

02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:09.020
if you can believe it.

02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:14.880
Oh, I believe it, but it's like I tell people, you walk into my apartment, I have a galley

02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:15.880
kitchen, okay?

02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:20.980
And the galley kitchen is like six feet, and then you turn around, and that's the boiler

02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:27.380
room, once you come out, it turns into this square, where, if I drop a piece of paper

02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:32.180
my place is a mess, but on the plus side, you can't see it, but the diagonal across

02:26:32.180 --> 02:26:37.460
from me is the coffee pot, the toaster oven, the air fryer, the popcorn machine, and the

02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:41.060
microwave, and the fridge, so I'm good.

02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:45.660
I love it, I love it, you know what, and you live in New York City, one of the most fabulous

02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:52.020
places in the world, so you know what, it's awesome, but I bet it's great when you bring

02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:53.020
the ladies over.

02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:59.620
See, there's a reason why I got rid of the bed and put a futon in, I'm like, I get it.

02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:02.020
They're all living in shoeboxes too, Rama.

02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:09.500
Some of them, some of them, I'm just saying, I like to entertain my ladies, but I don't,

02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:13.780
they understand I'm in a small shoebox, I just don't want them to get, well, you know,

02:27:13.780 --> 02:27:18.580
like that's why I got rid of the bed, and put in a futon so it looks like a friggin'

02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:19.580
couch.

02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:24.080
Nice, hold on, I'm trying to see if I can, wait, how do I do this, how do I show you

02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:25.080
my video?

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:26.320
Are you seeing our video?

02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:29.060
I'm seeing your video.

02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:30.660
Are you seeing me?

02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:35.020
Yes, I see you, I see the Final Fantasy IX poster behind you, the Borderlands 2 poster

02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:36.020
behind you.

02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:41.620
I want you to see this guy, down here, I'm showing you Mr. Smoosh is like down on the

02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:45.740
ground right here, so sorry, I can't change the whole camera setup right now, but anyway,

02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:49.820
sorry, completely derailed the show to show off Mr. Smoosh to one individual, but worth

02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:50.820
it, okay?

02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:53.460
Alright, anyway, Rama, what do you want to talk to us about tonight?

02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:57.180
I'm gonna cover that real quick, and I'm gonna tell you something geeky I just did.

02:27:57.380 --> 02:28:02.940
In response to you, Mr. Smoosh being on camera from time to time, that gave Mako-chan the

02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:10.020
best idea, so what we're doing when we go live, she is gonna position her camera on

02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:11.660
our staff cat, Damian.

02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:12.660
Perfect!

02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:17.540
And they'll see how long he'll stay there, you know, but you'll hear him purring at least

02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:20.300
80% of the time because he's a loud son of a bitch.

02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:24.380
Genius, I love it, no, that's a fantastic idea, why not, why not?

02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:28.140
And if the other, if the first cat leaves, that's just gonna have to be where Patty's

02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:31.420
gonna have to be like, oh, I gotta get a second cat.

02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:32.700
There is a second cat.

02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:34.700
A third cat.

02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:38.420
Don't give her any ideas!

02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:40.900
I can't help it, I can't help it.

02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:46.140
Oh, you are such a designated enabler, and I cannot wait till the two of you meet.

02:28:46.140 --> 02:28:49.300
She is going to collect you like Pokemon!

02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:50.740
Did you hear that, Mr. Smoosh?

02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:52.620
You're inspiring others.

02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:55.460
You're inspiring people, he's licking his paws, he doesn't give a shit what I'm telling

02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:56.460
him.

02:28:56.460 --> 02:28:57.460
Alright.

02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:01.180
You didn't have anything gaming to ask us this week?

02:29:01.180 --> 02:29:03.780
No, I wanted to share something pretty cool.

02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:08.700
Now, I don't know if you've seen lately, if a lot of people are geeking out their Christmas

02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:15.180
trees and stuff like that, I got friends who have Funko Pops on theirs, I actually got

02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:20.980
off my lazy tuchus, did a live stream yesterday, and put together my geeky little tree, and

02:29:20.980 --> 02:29:24.860
I'm going to see if I can get a little vision of it over here.

02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:29.180
Which unfortunately is not going to come through on our own Twitch feed, but yes, I do see

02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:34.380
a silvery tree with the giant ball ornaments that are very standard, and some Christmas

02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:36.100
lights there.

02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:39.180
I do see that coming through on this.

02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:41.860
Yep, we sort of see the tree, yes.

02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:46.820
And I'm slowly turning it, and if you look carefully, there is a Luigi ornament on the

02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:47.820
tree.

02:29:47.820 --> 02:29:49.580
Oh, there sure is.

02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:50.580
How about that?

02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:57.680
Yeah, so I wanted to share that off, but I also wanted to know, are y'all geeking up

02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:59.180
your holiday trees this year?

02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:00.180
I'm just curious about that.

02:30:00.180 --> 02:30:05.220
So we didn't set up a tree this year because of the cat, actually, because the place where

02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:08.940
we would usually set up the tree, Smush is not going to allow that to happen.

02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:13.100
So he would knock that shit over so fast, it would make your head spin.

02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:17.980
But when we do set it up, somebody got us an ornament set that actually has a Playstation

02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:19.540
controller, a Nintendo controller.

02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:23.500
I mean, they're not official, they kind of look like knockoffs, but they're close enough.

02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:27.700
So little knockoff controller ornaments, and it's really cute and nerdy.

02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:32.460
I like that, but I don't know if you've seen, but there's actually people who have posted

02:30:32.460 --> 02:30:38.600
pictures of their Christmas trees where it's halfway decorated, and the rest is just bare

02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:44.340
so the cat can't reach it, or they put up a clear plastic border around it where the

02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:46.500
cat can't get past it.

02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:51.300
I have seen that, and it's something to definitely consider for a future year.

02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:54.820
But the thing is, we like to put it in the window so you can see our tiny little tree

02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:59.260
from the street, but that is the exact spot where Mr. Smush goes every day.

02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:00.260
That's his TV.

02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:03.300
He goes to perch in the window and look at all the other cats that run out in the street

02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:06.020
and wonder, why can't I be outside playing with them?

02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:08.700
And it's like, you're not built for that, kitty.

02:31:08.700 --> 02:31:10.900
Somebody wanted you to be a show kitty.

02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:14.740
Oh, he just looked at me like, what do you mean?

02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:16.340
Alright.

02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:17.340
That's precious.

02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:19.900
Alright, Rahm, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up, but thank you so much for the

02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:20.900
call.

02:31:20.900 --> 02:31:21.900
Hey, no problem.

02:31:21.900 --> 02:31:24.500
I also had to represent my quote unquote ugly Christmas shirt.

02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:25.860
Hey, I loved it.

02:31:25.860 --> 02:31:29.940
It's Fra-gee-lay with the leg lamp for those obviously that can't see this call.

02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:30.940
Love it.

02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:31.940
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:31:31.940 --> 02:31:32.940
Alright, take care.

02:31:32.940 --> 02:31:33.940
Alright, bye bye.

02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:34.940
Bye.

02:31:34.940 --> 02:31:35.980
Alright, there you go.

02:31:35.980 --> 02:31:37.260
That's gonna do it for our Skype line tonight.

02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:40.620
I'm not gonna take any more calls on that for right now.

02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:43.180
Let me see though, I wanted to see if there were any questions in chat, and then also

02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:45.980
just check in one more time to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:49.320
I mean, I know it's been a very slow news week, but I also I've seen you prodding over

02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:52.900
there, Loki, while I've been trying to look at all this stuff.

02:31:52.900 --> 02:31:56.860
I'm just looking for something and not finding anything.

02:31:56.860 --> 02:32:03.260
I am noticing in chat, they're talking about their own nerdy trees here is that let's see.

02:32:03.260 --> 02:32:06.580
Black Mamba says I'm gonna get a doggy crate for my tree.

02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:10.060
I think I saw a post on Facebook earlier that was something like, why aren't my presence

02:32:10.060 --> 02:32:12.940
barking yet?

02:32:12.940 --> 02:32:13.940
Let's see.

02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:16.780
Brack the man says we have a regular tree and then a Harry Potter tree.

02:32:16.780 --> 02:32:19.340
Well, that sounds like fun.

02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:20.940
So very cool.

02:32:20.940 --> 02:32:21.940
All right.

02:32:21.940 --> 02:32:23.500
Well, I guess that's it.

02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:27.260
I guess we're about to wrap things up and get to our final thoughts tonight.

02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:28.540
We will not be back next week.

02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:31.140
We're gonna take next week off the 30th for the holidays.

02:32:31.140 --> 02:32:33.540
I know Loki has some family stuff going on.

02:32:33.540 --> 02:32:35.220
Dark soccer will still be out.

02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:39.740
So I may do something on my personal channel, but it won't be anything like OLR, but just

02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:41.780
play a game with listeners or something.

02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:44.940
Or I might, I might just take a night off myself and go out, do something I don't usually

02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:45.940
get to do Sunday night.

02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:46.940
So we'll see.

02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:51.180
But I hope everybody has a wonderful Christmas for those that celebrate a fantastic new year

02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:53.020
and anything else you might celebrate this time of year.

02:32:53.020 --> 02:32:55.060
I hope it goes very, very well for you.

02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:57.680
And we are so looking forward to continuing this in 2019.

02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:01.100
You know, this last week and this week, these are the first two episodes on Twitch and now

02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:03.940
it's like, you know, we get to do next next time, huh?

02:33:03.940 --> 02:33:04.940
Get the audio in the intro.

02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:05.940
That was my fault.

02:33:05.940 --> 02:33:06.940
We get to open that.

02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:08.940
Oh, the time capsule.

02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:09.940
Yes.

02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:10.940
Yeah.

02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:15.300
We showed this on Twitch now, sorry, podcast listeners, but now we actually get to, you're

02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:16.300
right.

02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:17.300
This is something to look forward to.

02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:18.300
Sorry.

02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:20.940
You're gonna have to look at my behind a little bit there, but look, you can actually see

02:33:20.940 --> 02:33:23.820
that we're going to open this guy in the new year.

02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:27.600
That's our little Vader time capsule that we made and I'm trying not to show my butt

02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:33.900
on stream or my, my naked rear end or something there.

02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:35.620
So trying to move around carefully there.

02:33:35.620 --> 02:33:36.660
There you go.

02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:38.180
So that is something.

02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:39.180
Yeah.

02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:40.540
That Spyro says, Oh yeah.

02:33:40.540 --> 02:33:41.540
Don't forget about the time capsule.

02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:42.540
Dark to see.

02:33:42.540 --> 02:33:43.540
Oh yeah.

02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:44.540
Glad Loki remembered.

02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:45.540
So good job.

02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:46.540
So there it is.

02:33:46.540 --> 02:33:48.700
You have the time capsule is, uh, gonna, gonna happen there.

02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:52.100
So all right.

02:33:52.100 --> 02:33:53.100
That's it.

02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:54.380
We're going to wrap up here.

02:33:54.380 --> 02:33:56.740
Another, uh, another day here at orange launch radio.

02:33:56.740 --> 02:33:59.300
Thanks so much for tuning into the show and listening to us.

02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:01.880
If you like what you heard here at orange laundry, no, please tell a friend or five

02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:03.420
about this feed.

02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:06.680
Please feel free to follow and all that stuff here on Twitch.

02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:10.600
We're still making our way to a affiliate, hopefully soon, and we'll be able to do the

02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:12.640
subscriptions and all that fun stuff as well.

02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:18.640
Uh, loving the clips you guys, uh, made, don't clip that last thing, Jesus, uh, for the most

02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:22.040
part, loving the clips you guys made and, uh, all the other stuff too.

02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:23.040
This is great.

02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:25.440
I'm loving Twitch and we're just going to build on it in 2019.

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:30.680
My whole goal is to improve one thing every show, and then, uh, we'll, we'll get it.

02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:35.480
We'll get in a really good place, uh, you know, by the time mid 2019 rolls around, but

02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:37.520
we definitely need, uh, to build up our following here.

02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:40.840
So tell a friend or two about the show, a nice five star review on a place like iTunes

02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:41.840
goes a long way as well.

02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:44.280
For those of you that are still listening on the podcast feed, Hey, we're doing it for

02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:45.280
you guys too.

02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:47.020
And, uh, thanks for listening that way.

02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:51.360
And we appreciate a nice review wherever you may, uh, consume your podcast.

02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:55.040
So with that, uh, we're going to wrap up for the night with any final thoughts.

02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:57.240
Uh, Loki, any final thoughts you have for us tonight?

02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:01.160
I'm hoping to start streaming again, um, this next week.

02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:06.940
I really been, it schedule's been just kind of crazy with just like stuff changing last

02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:12.100
minute, like having to pick up kids and stuff and, um, you know, running out of time plus

02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:19.660
fighting with my stupid goddamn DVD drive and reading my not so legit disc in the drive

02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:21.440
to load different mixes on there.

02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:25.040
So I may have to go back to extreme and just leave it there until I put step mania on the

02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:28.760
machine, but I'm hoping to put step mania on the machine sooner than later, cause I

02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:32.800
have all the parts and I just need the, I'm probably gonna build a PC tomorrow cause it's

02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:33.800
pretty fast.

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:40.160
Um, and I got a little windows 10 on there, but I do want to get a, a, a custom theme

02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:41.560
done for step mania.

02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:46.400
So hopefully it won't take months to do, but we'll get some working because I want to do

02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:49.840
a lot of fun stuff and step mania is really going to kind of energize me in the plane

02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:53.200
more because it'll be not the same set of songs all the time.

02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.400
It'll be like hundreds of songs to play.

02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:58.440
So it'll be a lot of variety and fun stuff.

02:35:58.440 --> 02:35:59.440
Awesome.

02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:00.440
All right.

02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:04.400
Um, my final thought is, um, looking forward to playing more Katamari and Rossi more stuff

02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:05.400
in my backlog.

02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:08.280
Yeah, I haven't really played like any ingress lately.

02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:09.660
I've kind of like fallen off on that.

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:12.120
So hopefully get back on some of that stuff as well.

02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:16.960
And um, yeah, I'm just, uh, I'm excited to, uh, do more gaming and streaming and focus

02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:21.540
on a lot of that in 2019 and continue our relationship here on Twitch.

02:36:21.540 --> 02:36:24.560
And thank you guys so much for joining us and listening to the show tonight.

02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:26.400
Um, I think that's it.

02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:27.400
We're gonna wrap it up.

02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:28.400
We'll see you next year.

02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:32.920
