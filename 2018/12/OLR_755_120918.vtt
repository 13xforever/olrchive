00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week we bid a fond farewell to our telephone operator, Pete Shelley. Nese Palares and Det, but I believe he found his.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Stay tuned for more stories, happy, sad, hilarious, and facepalmy, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with our 755th episode for this December the 9th of 2018.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
For the last time tonight, before you panic, of course I'm talking about the last time on Shoutcast, allegedly, assuming all of the tech tests and all that stuff go well.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
Next week, live, we will be over on Twitch, and I'll reiterate, we've been talking about that for a few weeks now, but I'll reiterate that in a minute.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
In the meantime, joining us for this special episode of Orange Lounge Radio, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Sup bitches.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Welcome back, nice to have you here without the use of radio magic.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Happy Hanukkah.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
That's what I was going to say.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Instead tonight we have Hanukkah magic bringing DarkSakura to the studio, but Hanukkah magic is the real deal.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
She's here live.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I sure am.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
It's great to have you.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I'm trying to get back in the chat.

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
And you know what is very special about Jamie being here is that, and you know tonight is a special night because Jamie actually got in the kitchen and cooked for the show tonight.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
Now, before y'all send your hate mail, I would never make those types of jokes anymore, however.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
I did it on purpose.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
She did it on purpose because of the holiday.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
As the token Jew, I have to, you know, we have a, Loki here is our Jew adjacent.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
We needed latkes.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yes.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And I have my candles on fire right now.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yep.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
So we have.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
And they're on full blast.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Tonight's the last night.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Tonight is the last night.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
So it's every candle.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
So I have two Hanukiah with all nine candles on it because you have your Shamash and your eight candles.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Right.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
The, the, the one that lights the others.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Eighteen candles.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
That's right.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I hope the house doesn't burn down.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
You get to blow them out when they graduate high school.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Now you get to follow miss crackers recipe.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Sis degree.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Very.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Um, I actually just bought straights kosher latke mix and did it from a box.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
And dark soccer of course is reading from our live chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice geeks network.

02:42.000 --> 02:51.000
Twitch TV slash vog network and a vog network.com and a, you can actually follow us live over at live dot vog network.com.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
And again, we're trying to make everything with the change as seamless as possible.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Uh, if you go to live dot vog network.com next week, what you're going to see is instead of the regular chat room, you're just going to see the Twitch with us there and all that stuff.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
So, um, hopefully for those of you that go to live dot vog network.com out of habit and the fact that I'll probably still say it on the show because I've been saying it for years.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Um, that will still work as a portal to where we are taping live.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And if you're listening on the podcast feed, then great.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
You can keep doing that.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Uh, everything will still be as it is on the podcast feed as we've been saying for weeks and weeks.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
Um, so I don't want to dwell on it too much tonight because again, we're still waiting on the final things to arrive from a technical perspective.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And then we're going to kind of remodel this room in some ways to get it broadcast ready.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
And uh, yeah, we're aiming for next Sunday being the first show.

03:36.000 --> 03:45.000
That way it gives us kind of like gives us two or three weeks and then in 2019 we're going to go full steam ahead with the promo and about really trying to get out there about like,

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
Hey, did you know that these old assholes who've been doing this show since their mid twenties are still going and they're going now on Twitch.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Won't that be fun?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yep.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
All right, well say hello to that old asshole.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
It's tech master Loki.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
It's here every week.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Hello.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
How are you doing Loki?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
I'm fine.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
It's funny because you were talking about that you were doing your own Twitch stream playing DDR this week and you're doing a stream on Thursday night.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Right?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yes.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Were you still doing Euro mix or are you back on max now?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm on Euro mix too.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I'm still playing that.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Okay.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
And so you've been doing some DDR on your Twitch stream and then as you were like, you were like, why isn't anybody here?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Where did everybody go?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And Oh yeah, the game awards were tonight.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Right?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Well, sometimes there aren't, isn't anyone there.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
So, and it wasn't exactly the most, um, a smooth going stream.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I had a ton of drops for some reason, which I never have that issue weird.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Um, and then also the kids came out and said that the cat had gotten into our bedroom somehow.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And so I had to go fish her out of that in the middle of the stream.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
And then it took me four reboots that finally get your mix to, to boot up.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
So it was like really being a pain in the ass.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It's okay.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
It's as I mentioned on the stream several times, you're a mix too.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It's just like, it's confusing.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
It is such like this weird, ugly stepchild of the DDR series.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Not to say it's bad, but it's like max too was pretty streamlined.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
You know, you had your options menu where you put in your speed mods and difficulties and stuff like that.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And it's all makes sense.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
You're a mix too.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
When you select the song, you select the difficulty after you select the song, all of your mods,

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
including speed mods have to be done with foot panel, um, combos like you would in like fourth mix.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Oh God. All right.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
It's fucking weird.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
All right.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
It makes no sense whatsoever.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
And then like on top of that, you can't do speed mods or any other mods in nonstop.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So at least I haven't figured out a way to do that.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
And nonstop is integrated into the neural, um, song selection.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
So when you first start off, it says nonstop and you can select that and it goes in the nonstop mode.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
And for anybody that hasn't played DDR in a long time, that whole last two minutes of you ranting probably didn't make any sense either.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
It was based off of max two.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Just leave it how max two was put different songs in there.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Done.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
You don't have to do anything else.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
They said they like, let's fuck it all up.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Let me go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com for some comments.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
A dark Tetsuya says, so next Sunday is like the soft launch slash beta test slash working out the kinks.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yes.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Fallout 76 launch.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It is.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
It is absolutely that it is.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It is.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
It is a well it's vog early access starts next week.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You have to understand we're going the AAA route.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
So we're launching this.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's feature complete.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Absolutely.

06:26.000 --> 06:34.000
That's what next week bugs that are in there are complete, which is funny because next week is OLR 756.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
So it's kind of works.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Kinda sorta.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Anyway, also in our chat, see a Tiberian chat says in insert Blanche, Devereaux, the change memes here.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
That's a very, that's a very apropro comparison is that OLR is going through menopause.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Would that be correct?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Dark soccer.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
OLR is going through menopause.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I would say we're actually getting ready to graduate high school.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I would, I would say with this move to twitch, we're going to go hang out with the cool like going to college.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah, we're going to hang out.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
It's like Jerry blank.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
You know, I'm back in school from strangers, the candy.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, I never watched.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Well, how about how about Sally O'Malley from Saturday Night Live?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm 50, 50 years old.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
You know what?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
We're going to be going to college and learning how to hang out in coffee shops.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Right.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
We're going to hang out with the cool kids like Ninja and have a cool have CBV vapes.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yep.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
I'm cool like Ninja and sneak a Boone's Strawberry Hill from our older friends.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
We're not playing enough Fortnite to be cool.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
So, you know, Sonic Fox.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I got he's gay, black, furry.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I got one of those three things going for me.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
So, you know, we were cool with them.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
It is become gay and furry.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Stop it.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
All right.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Going to our chat at live dog network dot com.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Act Def says Ninja doesn't hang out with girls, though.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Well, you know, married, though.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Neither neither do I wink.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, that's a lie.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I don't count.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
No, you totally count because without girls who would go shopping for shoes with me.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I mean, you you serve a very important.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Do you know how many drag queens I know?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I can hook you up.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Let's see.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Also in chat.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
No, I I hope you all know these are just jokes because I know we live in a clip happy, you

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
know, world and that whole thing.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
So please, I hope you all know we're just having a good time here at all.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
They could bring up all my old shit on Twitter.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I don't fucking care.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
That's the problem.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
It's like, you see, I don't care.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I'm not going to resign from whatever political position I'm in.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm well, I already know.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Well, I mean, there was I I don't hold any political office.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
There was that part of me that's like I could never run for political office because of

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
the things I've done.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
But now look at who's the fucking president.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
It's like, wow, you can do the worst things in the world and still be president.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Like it's it's amazing.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Anyway, let's see.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Going to chat at live dog or dot com.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
See it to bury says, wait, so this is all ours live action, soft reboot kind of kind

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
of.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
All right.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Let's let's move on.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
We got a lot of gaming news to cover because we had a pretty big television event or technology

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
television event that happened this past week.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Loki, the game awards.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Yes.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
So you turn off your stream and you started watching the game awards a little bit.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Yes, I did.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
What do you think I did?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Because I was disappointed.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
All zero watchers of my streams.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I'm humble bragging that I got a whole zero.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
There you go.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
That's way, you know, anyways.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
So, you know, I did watch the game awards a little bit.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
So they had lots of announcements as they always do.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
It's, you know, one half the reason.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, most the reason you turn tune is probably just to see all the trailers and stuff that

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
they're going to show.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
So this is kind of run down some of the things that they announced.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
So they had a game called Sayonara Wild Hearts, which was coming to the switch and like pretty

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
awesome.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
That was the one that you were talking about.

09:52.000 --> 09:59.000
That's sort of like an album by Annapurna Interactive and it looks great.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Like music game.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
It almost looks a little bit like elite beat agents sort of.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I hope.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Let's not get our hopes up for something that amazing.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
But no, it looked pretty sweet.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
So very stylized, kind of a music game, a little bit punk.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
So that was pretty neat.

10:16.000 --> 10:25.000
And then, of course, there was a brand new game called Journey to the Savage Planet,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
which looked like some sort of survival game.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I didn't really get.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I missed this trailer, unfortunately.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
So that's supposed to be coming out next year on all major platforms.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
And then, of course, they announced the console version of the Stanley Parable.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, which is also going to have new endings and different

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
branching paths and gamepad controls.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
I think that's great and all, but it does feel a little late.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Like this is the type of thing they really should have put out one or two years ago.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Right.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I mean, well, is Switch one of the consoles?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
It's never too late to do a Switch port.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I don't remember if the Switch is one of the consoles.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Everybody wants their game on Switch at this point.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
It would be neat if they patched that stuff into the PC game, too.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
Because I have to go back and play it to get that achievement for not playing it for five years.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
So I think that's due in the next few days for me.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, and I think that also just goes to show that, like, OK, that game's been out a while.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
So it is a little weird that it took this long to go to consoles.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
But a good game is a good game, no matter what.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
You know, people are mega hyped.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Maybe perhaps the gentleman who was on before us at the voice.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I was hoping it would have been a sequel to the Stanley Parable.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Is one of the people that gets really hyped about Katamari Damacy getting re-released this week.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So you know what? Old games can still be fun.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
But I'm hyped for the PC version, which will eventually get hacked to put all sorts of fun stuff in there.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
That's what I'm hyped about.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Mission, roll up all the dildos.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
That's a good call. Which one do you buy?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
The PC one? Because you know modding's coming?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Or do you get the Switch one for the portability?

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
You buy both, because the PC version, there was a site that had it for $10 cheaper, so I got it for $18.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Look at you.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Versus $29.99, because that's way too fucking much for, you know, buying it twice.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
You buy both, so that Namco will continue to invest in the series, and hopefully make another one at some point.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, but they really half-assed put that remaster.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
They put it out the same day as kind of another big deal sort of game.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
I mean, that's one issue. That's fine. I mean, it happens.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Physical version is only available at GameStop, by the way.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
I know. That's limited. It's just like, I really hope they aren't expecting $11 billion sales of this.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
But I want that game to do well. Anyway.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
There's a game called Among Trees. It looks pretty nice.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
So that's coming out on Steam Early Access in 2019.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And that's a Survival Sandbox game.

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
This was kind of unexpected. A Switch exclusive game, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, the Black Order.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Kind of looking forward to that.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
That looks pretty awesome. I am definitely down with that.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
So that, I'm guessing, is coming out next year as well.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm wondering if it's just a timed exclusive.

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
I would assume it's timed exclusive. Or maybe the console version, or Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is getting a different type of game.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Or a little bit more expanded game. We'll see.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
But that's coming out. And that's by Team Ninja as well.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh, Nintendo's publishing it. Well, that's why it's a Switch exclusive.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Let's see. What else?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Supergiant has a new game coming out called Hades. It looks pretty sweet.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Much like all the other games. So that'll be probably next year as well.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
Oh, actually that's launching in the Epic Games Store, which we'll be talking more about later.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
So that's something that Early Access there.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
Far Cry New Dawn, which is launching February 15th for $40.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
And it's going to be a sequel to Far Cry 5 that's set kind of in this post-apocalyptic future.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Apparently that spoils the end of the game, I guess.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
I still haven't finished Far Cry 5. I don't know if I will, but it looks awesome.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
It's got saw blade guns and it looks kind of like Rage. Rage 2, I should say.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Scavengers, which is like a sci-fi co-op game.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
Let's see. They had Crash Team Racing was kind of unexpected. So there's a new Crash Racing game coming.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
Dead by Daylight is getting a new chapter.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
So they've got a chapter 10 of Darkness Among Us, which is coming out, I guess, this week.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
They have a new killer called The Legion, which... I don't know.

14:41.000 --> 14:48.000
It sounds like... I swear there was someone that had the name The Legion or something that was like a villain or something.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
And then there's a new special power called Feral Frenzy as well.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Still haven't played that game. Probably won't.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
Monster Hunter, there's a game called Dauntless that sort of looks like Monster Hunter.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
In fact, when I saw the trailer for it, that reminded me of Monster Hunter quite a bit.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
But it's coming to Switch and Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and even mobile next year.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Let's see, what else?

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
Game called The Last Campfire, which was by Hello Games.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
So that was kind of unexpected that that was going to be coming out.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
And they're calling it Hello Games Short, so I'm guessing it's not a very long game.

15:28.000 --> 15:35.000
The one that really caught my attention, though, of course, was The Outer Worlds, which is a game by Obsidian.

15:36.000 --> 15:46.000
And it looks fantastic. It's like a cross between Fallout New Vegas and Mass Effect and just Borderlands and all sorts of fucking awesome shit.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
And I actually watched some gameplay of this. I posted a link on Twitter earlier today, and it looks great.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
So I'm really looking forward to this.

15:55.000 --> 16:04.000
It's kind of something to satiate the appetite of people that were hoping for a new Fallout-type game and got disappointed with Fallout 76.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
So, yes, definitely looking forward to that quite a bit.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Other fun stuff.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
They talked about PUBG's new map, which is all wintery.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
There's a new gigantic survival MMO, Atlas, that's by the people that did Ark Survival Evolved.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
There's a thing about Wizards of the Coast and pushing Magic Arena with some esports thing.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
They made a teaser for Dragon Age 4.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Well, supposedly that game is a ways out, too.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
I expect you have questions.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah, I suppose that game is a long way out.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah, it's all soulless twerking.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Yeah, it's a very, very light teaser.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
They had another trailer for Psychonauts 2.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
They showed off a Stranger Things game that was kind of looking a little bit 16-bit.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I gotta be honest, it looked kind of crap.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Well, that's kind of the gist of the mobile phone, Stranger Things.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It's kind of like a retro style, and it's okay.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
For a mobile phone game, it's okay, but it's not something I would spend a lot of money on.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
It's kind of like garbage. I'm just not very interested in that.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Mortal Kombat 11, so that's coming out in April.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
So last week's rumors came to light, apparently.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
That was one of the trailers. I will admit, I didn't really watch the game awards.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I just forgot they were happening.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Man, they're like, hey, it's time to vote.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
And then it's like a week later, the awards happen, and I always forget.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Like, oh yeah, they're gonna be on.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
And to be honest, all the trailers just show up right there on Twitter anyway.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
They get retweeted, and somebody's following it and cutting the trailers as it goes.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
They just all show up online right away.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
So I saw that trailer for Mortal Kombat 11, of course.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm not super big on the violent.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
It's almost like too much now, but it looked, for what it is, it looked cool.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
But obviously, you were seeing a lot of pre-rendered stuff.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
But I imagine it's gonna look great.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Mortal Kombat 10 or X or whatever, it looked great.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
So I have no reason to believe 11.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
It's probably 10.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Here's the thing. They actually said, they did call it Mortal Kombat X,

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
but they completely acknowledged it was a play on, you know, 10.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
But I think it's X because that series is extra when it comes to fighting games.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It's very, very extra.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
So yeah, 11 is going to be continuing that, you know,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
rampantly violent stuff, clearly, through the trailer.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
All right, cool.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
And then, of course, they announced that Persona 5's Joker

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
is gonna be the first DLC character for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
So that got everybody excited because they're like, well, shit.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
You know, now they're really putting anybody in this game.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
So be curious to see what the other four fighters are gonna be.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Didn't pick up the game, though. Thought about it.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah, that, oh, you didn't pick up Smash?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
You're like the one person that didn't.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
Well, like, I just bought my kids, like, four Switch games for Christmas.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
The money thing is real. I understand.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
My wife an air fryer.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah, I know.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
And a robot vacuum cleaner.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Well, maybe somebody will buy that for you for Christmas.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Maybe that'll be a nice thing.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
And books and, like, all this other shit.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
So, yeah, it's been, I didn't pick it up because I didn't know if I'd get to play it.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
I didn't want to fight the kids for the Switch.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
And I know they'd play it, but, like, I don't know.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
Going back, I mean, we can get into a little more of that on our gaming week.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
But going back a little bit to the Game Awards itself.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
Obviously, the Persona Smash thing is, like, it's pretty cool.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
It's cool, but, you know, also, I'm certainly, like, but they haven't put Persona on a Nintendo platform.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
There was a 3DS game.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Oh, God, that seems so obscure.

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
I guess you're right, but that just seems like you would think, like, this is gonna motivate them to put Persona 5 on Switch.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Master Chief.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Or something you would think. I don't know.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
I don't know.

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
I don't know. But, oh, you think Master Chief in Smash? That's going a little far. I don't know about that.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
But, uh, okay. I mean, I think it's cool. Don't get me wrong.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
You know what? No, no, not Master Chief. We'll just put Terry Crews in Smash.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Just Terry Crews.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Just Terry Crews.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Why not one of the Viva Pinata? There was a 3DS game for Viva Pinata.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Fuck Viva Pinata.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Or Minecraft Steve. That would be...

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah, I think Minecraft Steve is very...

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Minecraft Steve would be way more likely than Master Chief.

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, because that would be the big Microsoft, like, oh my God, but there's a ton of people that play Minecraft on Switch.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
Or is there, like, because PUBG doesn't really have any characters.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
No. Yeah, no.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Or not PUBG. Fortnite.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
Uh, they could, but I just, yeah. I think we're going a little crazy with the Switch stuff now.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Or the Smash stuff now. I think it's just, uh, you know.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
I mean, now it's like, I think what's happened is that, wait, if they can put a Persona character in Smash, they can do literally anything.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
So now all of these, like, fan-wank obscure, because nobody was going to predict that Persona thing. Nobody was going to predict that.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
So now it's like, literally everything is on the table.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
So as much as you might be laughing at, like, come on, they're not going to put Minecraft...

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
But they did Persona. Anything is possible, y'all.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Super Meat Boy.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Why not? That'd be fun.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Well, Shovel Knight was in the first game, right?

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
No. There was always a Shovel Knight amiibo, and I think there was Shovel Knight Assist.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
But Shovel Knight was not a character, and a lot of people were pushing for indie representation in Smash, like Shovel Knight, Shantae.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Remember, there was a big campaign about that.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
Uh, so, uh, but none of that has come to light as of yet, but again, anything's possible.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
They should've just had a lot more characters in 5.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
I'm sure. Oh, there'll be more. There'll be more.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
Anyway, uh, so you actually, admittedly, I didn't really watch the Game Awards. I don't think Jamie did either.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
What did you think of the bits and pieces of the actual show that you saw?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Because I remember the last time I did see it, I was like...

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
They had, like, the orchestra stuff was really awesome.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Honestly, the last time I watched it, it was like, you could do a lot worse. It really wasn't bad.

21:48.000 --> 21:56.000
It was... it's kind of like picking up the excitement for where, like, E3 may have lacked in some places, I guess.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
I don't know. I think it was nice to have all that stuff there, and all the announcements and everything.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Uh, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf does point out Joker is in Persona Q2 for the 3DS, so he is in a Nintendo game.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
It's... still, it's pretty, uh, pretty deep cut.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Uh, Bobby also suggests the Fortnite Battle Bus in Smash.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
There is some type of car. I don't... I don't know what it was, but we were...

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
So, uh, Friday night, some friends and I got together and we were playing a little bit of Smash.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Somebody got a frickin' thing that looked like a pitobus showed up and started driving around the stage.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
And I was like, what the fuck even is that?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I was like, what's the reference?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Like, I'm trying to catch all these deep cut gaming references.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
There's some deep cut gaming references in Smash.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Nintendo Labo.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
That's my favorite part.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Uh, let's see.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
ActDeftInChats does point out Shovel Knight is an assist trophy and Shantae is a spirit.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
So they did at least do some type of nods to those games.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
I mean, I don't know.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
It's something.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
And Bobby also points out there is a Labo thing in Smash.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Of course there is.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Of course there is.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
Nintendo will stop at nothing to self-promote, I'm very sure.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Oh, it's Cap'n.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Oh, it is.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
ActDeft says Cap'n from Animal Crossing has a bus in Smash as an assist.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
You know, his spirit stage.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I just had to play that today.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I can't fucking beat it.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
It is so annoying.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
His spirit stage has a constant wind effect on it.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
And if you touch the water, pretty much you die.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Your character drowns.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
With some exceptions.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
The water is lava.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
The water is lava.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
So here's the thing.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Here's the thing though.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
I know somebody in chat is about to yell this.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
I already know if you attach the Snorlax spirit, which is a little further down the road, you

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
can avoid the wind thing.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
It doesn't push you back as bad.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
But it still pushes you.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
And then you get, god damn it, what's that big orange bird in Yoshi?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Damn it.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
But you get her up the road too and that completely negates the water thing.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
So you can actually be in the water.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
So, it helps.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
And I heard there's some characters that don't drown in the water.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Right.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
Well, if you have those certain spirit affictions, you won't.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
But here's the thing.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
Those attachments will not suggest.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Like, I was just letting the computer suggest what to use every time.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
But it was not picking those for me on a stage where I needed it.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
It kept giving me stuff where I start with a dark scythe and things like that.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And then the other thing, excuse me, you kind of have to watch for is that not only do you

24:24.000 --> 24:32.000
have the World of Light mode, but you have that other mode that will just randomly spawn

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
like six different, and then it starts to grow, like different spirit things you can

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
challenge at any time and they rotate out every five minutes.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Like, don't forget about that because if you dip in there every now and then you can

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
grab some stuff that you can then use in the World of Light mode.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
So, there's that.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Anyway.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
So, look at that.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
We're supposed to be having a conversation on the Game Awards and it all ended up on Smash.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
That's just, that's what it's going to be this week.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
I'm pretty sure any gaming show you're listening to this week is just going to lose their shit over Smash.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
And that's just how it is in the gaming industry this week, I suppose.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
So.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
Anything that you saw in the Game Award things and those trailers?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Anything that really stuck out to you?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
I know you called out a couple of those things that looked interesting to you,

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
but what would you say out of all that that they showed are you really looking forward to, Logi?

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
You know, actually the new Far Cry game, although I wonder if I'm actually going to play it

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
because I've seen them buy these Far Cry games and I get tired of them really fast.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
But, Far Cry, the new one looks pretty good.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
So, I'm interested in that.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
And then also, of course, the Outer Worlds looks awesome.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Like, I would definitely pick that up.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Just the world and everything seems really cool.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
It's very much like Fallout New Vegas.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
Like, the vibe is just like, this is totally how we should.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
And what's great is they have dialogue trees like you would in the other games.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
And you can pick a dumb dialogue tree so that you're an idiot.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
And it's hilarious.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Just the response is like, not everybody is...

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
I forget.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Just go watch the clip they posted online because it's hilarious.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Just the different dialogue trees that they have there and picking the dumb option each time.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
It's just the sarcastic option that they had in Fallout 4 or whatever.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I forget what it was, but it looks awesome.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I really want to play that game.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Alright, cool.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
So, any suggestions for next year's Game Awards?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Because I noticed in chat at live.vongnetwork.com,

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
Kaijuto says, Game Awards were good, just chill with all the trailers.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
No, I mean, I think it was fine the way it was.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I guess we'll just have to see...

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Some of the words are really quick.

26:46.000 --> 26:54.000
I don't know if we necessarily need best e-sport personality or best YouTuber or whatever.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I think that's kind of...

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
That really I don't think needs to be there, but it is.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Right.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Trying to give a nod to the community.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
Well, as far as honestly, one of the few things I did see from the whole event

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
was when SonicFox won that award for the best e-sports personality.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
And he gave a great speech that I couldn't help but sit there and just go, yes.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I just thought he was awesome.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
So, on one hand, Loki, as much as I understand that maybe we don't need the personalities

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
as much in the game thing, I was like, that really was one of the best moments, at least for me.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm just glad Ninja didn't win it.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
He's overexposed.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
It's overexposed.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Same thing with PewDiePie.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
PewDiePie's not so bad anymore.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
He's not in the forefront as much.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Maybe he's listened to some of the feedback he's gotten about some of his poor decisions.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
I would assume.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
I don't know.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
But, like...

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
S2100Matt says Ninja won, though.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
So, he must not have seen that part.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Ninja's not an e-sports guy.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
He didn't win the e-sports thing. He did win best...

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Best Fortnite player.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
And he got it.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
And Tigerlaw says he only got famous because of the whole Drake thing.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Well, you know what?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Whatever. Do what you gotta do.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
I know. Do what you gotta do.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I'm not gonna hate Ninja.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
I don't know the guy.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't watch his stuff.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
But I do think some people are just, like, overexposed.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
And it doesn't make...

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
You know, you can't help but go, ugh, again?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Like, there's certain celebrities, right?

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
You see them in a trailer and you're like, ugh, again?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Tom Cruise still making movies?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
You know?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Those types of things.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I don't know. I can't explain it.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
But anyway.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
S2100mattinchat says he won content provider.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah, I know.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Like, whatever.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
You know, it's fine.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I don't have to like these people.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It's fine.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
And I don't even know who he is.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
Or, like, I don't even watch his content.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
So I don't know why I would not like him in the first place.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
It's just...

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Just like the stories I read.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
Like, I guess we're talking about, like, how he goes and, like, tries to ban different players off of Fortnite for...

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
He claims that they're stream sniping him, but they just may best him somehow.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
And so then he'll go and get them, like, perma-banned from playing Fortnite.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That seems a little dickish.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
And that, I guess, has the impression I have of him.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
But I don't know.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Do I fucking care?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
No, I don't.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Alright.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Well, let's see.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Go into our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Bobby Blackwell says,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
I'm fine with Ninja.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I've seen some of the interviews he's given outside of our gaming realm.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
And he's pretty much the face we need right now.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
He says all the right things to the right people in the right language.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
Like his CNBC or MSNBC interview right after the Drake thing.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Akuma JP says,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I dislike Ninja character, though.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
The way he looked down to other people.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Alright.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Anyway, let's move on from the Game Awards.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yeah.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I need to thank Akuma JP, by the way.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Oh, me too.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
Because Dan super loved his present.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Oh, yeah, because you haven't been here for a little bit.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
So Dan had a birthday while you were out.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
And you had Akuma JP kind of help you with some shenanigans, right?

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
So Dan's birthday present this year was Red Dead Redemption 2 Special Edition.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
The Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box for PS2.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
And Salamander Deluxe Pack for Sega Saturn, thanks to Akuma JP.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
And Dan was absolutely thrilled.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
So thank you for helping me make my husband's birthday a success.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Well, why do we transition from that into our gaming weeks?

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Because after all, this is the part of the show where we talk about the types of video games we've been playing this week.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
So I imagine maybe some playing of that around the Summers household.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
Well, of course, there's been a lot of Red Dead Redemption 2.

30:48.000 --> 30:54.000
We also picked up, well, by we, I mean I braved the crowds.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Picked up Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And it's been really fun.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
Dan's actually been tackling the unlocking while I've been at work.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
And we got a new pinball.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
We got Monopoly, Stern's Monopoly.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
And apparently it was a home use only machine.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
It hasn't touched an arcade.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
It is in glorious condition.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Just needs a little bit of cleanup.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
And that's really been the major gaming that's been happening in my house.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Cool.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Alright, then we'll move right on over to Loki.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
How was your gaming week?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I played a few things this week.

31:28.000 --> 31:35.000
So I finished, like I've gotten to a point now in Pokemon Let's Go.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
I think I am basically done with the game.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I finished the game.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
I beat all the Final Four or whatever with my, you know,

31:44.000 --> 31:51.000
Uber level Pikachu that basically just single handedly took down the whole Final Four or Elite Four or whatever.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And then I beat them again.

31:53.000 --> 32:01.000
And then I guess you can go back and fight, like refight the other gyms as well if you want to.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
Now you've got to the point where you have to fight the different Pokemon masters.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
They're masters of like Pikachu and all these other like things.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
So you have to have basically the same Pokemon as them and you fight them.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
And it's a hassle. I don't want to do it.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.000
So I don't really know if, I think I'm kind of done with the game at this point.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
My Pokedex isn't filled up all the way, but it could be if I just transport a few other things.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
In fact, I got to do that because I got to, you know, unlock my stupid Meltan.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
So I have to keep putting new Pokemon into the Pokemon Go park.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
And do all that crap.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
So I'll probably still play it.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
I've been occasionally swapping Pokemon out into the, oh, and I caught Mewtwo.

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
So I've caught everything in the game, all the like legendaries and stuff.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
They make a vaccine for that, you know.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Yes.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
So I've caught all the legendaries in the game and I don't know.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
I'm kind of getting like bored with it, I guess.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
But it's alright. It's an okay game.

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
I just, I don't really want to grind just to like beat all of the Pokemon masters because why?

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
I don't know. There's not really any more story left in the game.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
Like once you've got the Go park and you're getting your Meltan boxes, it's kind of like,

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
well, there's not, except just the incentive of I beat a fucking Pokemon game.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
Yeah, I beat a Pokemon game. It was good.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
I mean, I like the story of it and everything and I would like to, you know, play through more of them and stuff.

33:34.000 --> 33:40.000
But I just, eh, I don't know if I really want to play like the end end game that they have here.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
There's not really, maybe like they'll add stuff to it later on.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
But right now it's like there's not a whole lot in the incentive for me to,

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
let's go capture a ton of Pokemon so we can get some candies to level up like a stupid Oddish

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
so that I can become the Oddish master.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And who gives a shit about that? No one does.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
So I don't know. Or, oh, let's say try to chain catch 31 of these things

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
and just keep trying to catch the same Pokemon until we find a shiny.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
That doesn't really sound like my sort of fun.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Shane would be into that.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
I just, I just don't want to do it right now.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
I have more, you know, I have other games I could be playing.

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
You know, Red Dead Redemption 2 or, fuck, I could, there's so many games.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Dude, the horses poop.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Huh?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
The horses poop.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Yeah. Horses do poop.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I mean, in the game, I thought it was cool.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Yes, they, they're ultra realistic.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
And then their balls shrink.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Yes.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Um, and then what else?

34:36.000 --> 34:44.000
So I was at the store this week and so I got to try out one of those arcade, one up arcade cabinets.

34:44.000 --> 34:52.000
So I played some, um, Missile Command and Crystal Castles.

34:52.000 --> 34:59.000
And, you know, really, I hate track balls, but track ball controls work pretty good on those games.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
So I'm not complaining there.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
That actually worked.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
It's a pretty good use case right there.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
Um, so I tried those out and then what else?

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
I did more Pokemon Go.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I played some of that.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
Um, gosh, I don't know.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
Uh, Dance Dance Revolution Euro Mix 2, as I mentioned, I've been playing that this week.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
I've been kind of swapping through some of the different mixes I can put on the cabinet.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I'm kind of getting tired of all of them.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
Um, I'm probably, I'm really leaning towards a step mania cabinet cause it's going to be,

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
you know, a lot easier to add new songs to it, to keep everything fresh and interesting

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
because it's, it's hard like playing like the old, the same old songs.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Once again, I thought Euro Mix 2 be more of a draw because not a lot of people have seen

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
a Euro Mix 2 machine in action.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I know, certainly I haven't.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
So, um, well, I imagine a lot of people in Europe have, well, yes, they probably, this

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
is a worldwide show.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
They had to deal with some bullshit that really they shouldn't have had to deal with.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
And now you feel so, like we have to go back.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
Remember, we talk a lot about DDR on this show.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
Loki's having his Renaissance, his midlife crisis with DDR because this was the stuff

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
that we, Orange Launch Radio is here because of DDR.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Orange Lounge is a band in DDR.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
Dude, I completely forgot about like, did you know DDR Max had no difficulties in it?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Like I didn't like completely forgot about that.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I'm like, what?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
There was no difficulties on there?

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
Like they had no like indicator of what song was difficult.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
Oh yeah, because it was, it was just that little, it was that little chart.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
They never had the feet.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
It was just that little chart.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Like I'm like, I completely forgot that was a thing.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
How did we know that this was this difficult?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Did we just make that shit up?

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Because when Max 2 came out, everything kind of got retconned.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
Well, maybe the home versions also had that shit, but like I just completely forgot.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
And also my copy of, cause I'm using a super disk.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
I obviously don't have a legit Euro Mix 2 in my system, but, uh, it doesn't have any

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
of the background videos, which is fine.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
I mean, it's kind of actually makes it easier to play certain things.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Also, it seems like they half assed half of the steps of the game because half of the

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
steps that are in there for their new license songs don't have free zeros.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
They just don't have them.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Not actually play it.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Not good.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
They should have that shit in there.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
You can always turn them off if you don't like them.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Right, exactly.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
But like, Oh, there's only one song they ran across actually had it.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
And it's funny when you do run across the song, it does have it.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
It gives you the free zero warning thing, tells you what they are and stuff, which is

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
so weird.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Um, so they have that.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
And then what else?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Um, so I'll probably switch it up again.

37:32.000 --> 37:40.000
Um, I may end up do, I think I might move to Disney's rave or, um, fifth mix.

37:40.000 --> 37:46.000
Fifth mix will be fun, but Disney's rave, I think it would be fun for a day.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
And you're gonna be like, why, why did I do that?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Um, I still do want to come over.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
It's going to get a little crazy now.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Cause this week, obviously with the changes around here, I got to make sure we're set

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
and ready to go for that.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
Uh, next week, uh, I don't want to say too much about it on air cause I don't know if

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
I'm doing it yet, but I might go on the most random fricking trip in the middle of the

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
week.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
If I can swing the time.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
You're going to Albuquerque.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
I I'll tell you in chat.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
I don't want to say until I know I'm going, cause it is literally a random thing.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Uh, but soon I'm hoping to come over.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Right.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
And it's great cause you can install new mixes in about 15 minutes.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
So it's, it's not a big deal.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
Uh, that's why I was like, eh, I'm just going to, I'm taking off fourth plus here.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Um, which I mean, ideally fourth plus is a great mix.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
It's just, I don't know.

38:28.000 --> 38:35.000
I miss having all those modifies in there cause some of those fourth mix, um, step charts

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
are just some weird shit and you really need to have like that spacing in there to be able

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
to read it.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
And I need to get better just reading charts.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
It's just really hard.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
But, um, so yeah, so that's, that's what I've been doing.

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
Um, and uh, now this week I have Katamari, so I'll probably be playing some more Katamari.

38:53.000 --> 38:59.000
I also did not buy Earth Defense Force Five because the review has been kind of okay on

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
that, but, and I'll probably wait for a sale on that.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
I don't know.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
We'll see.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
So I don't know.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
I could be playing some more new songs, but I'm waiting because, or new games, but I had

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
to play the old games too.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Oh, and Just Cause 4.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
I need to pick up Just Cause 4 and so many things.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Anyways, that's it.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
All right.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Well, let me talk about my gaming week a little bit.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
Um, so I've been playing a lot of Smash, just like I'm sure a ton of people have.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Uh, I really am enjoying this Smash game.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
Uh, it's, it's probably my favorite so far, but it's easy to say that because I don't

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
get into all the technicalities like some tournament players do and all that.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
All I go is that it's pretty and there's a lot of people and there's so many modes and

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
this is the best one yet.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
And, and honestly, I think that's good enough in some ways.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Uh, so I'm just, I'm having a good time playing it.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
The unlocking thing is a little weird.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
It's a little weird how you only start with eight people.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
And so like when I took my Switch over to a house party thing Friday night, cause we

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
played some card games.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
I know I don't talk a lot about card games on this show, but I played an old school card

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
game called Phase 10.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I'm sure that's a, it's like the same people who do it.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
And then we, we played that and then we played a game called Saboteur, which is like, you're

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
using cards to build caves and like somebody's lying about it.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
So, and these are all people that I met playing these online, like Survivor, Big Brother.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
So they're all great liars cause that's, you know, what you do in those games.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Phase 10 destroys friendships.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Yeah.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
So we played friend destroying games and then, uh, we played Smash Brothers a little bit

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
too, but it was weird because it was like, okay guys, I have the basic eight characters

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
and Ness.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
That's it.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Like I don't have any other characters so far.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
So we kind of, but the good news is, I mean, we were able to unlock some, but the funniest

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
fucking thing happened.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
So, uh, one of my pals, Curtis, um, he, he only wants to play pit.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Like that's like his favorite character, right?

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
He only, so the fact that pit's not in the game, he's like, whatever, I don't care.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Well, pit shows up.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
So we're playing for like 20 minutes and pit shows up, a new challenger approaches.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
And so one of my friends hands me the controller says, you need to do it Rob, cause I'm going

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
to fuck this up.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
And I was like, okay.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
So I take the controller and it goes match start and I just start moving to the left

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
and I fall right off the cliff and die because I forgot that she was playing player one and

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I was playing like player four.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
So I didn't want to go to the left cause that is going to walk right off the edge.

41:22.000 --> 41:27.000
So anyway, and Curtis is watching me and of course he's already had a bit to drink.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
We're already hyped up because we've been playing saboteur.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
We've been yelling at each other all night and he's like, you did that on purpose.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
You bleeped and did that on purpose.

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
You, you like trying to, so it was just, it was really funny, but I didn't realize this

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
until later.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
It was my pal Delvin who does his streaming at VG realness, cheap plug.

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
Um, but he actually told me that if you go into the blue menu, the games and more menu,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
there's actually an icon that'll appear there.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
It looks like a little door.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
It lets you redo any of the fights.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
So I found that out like after I got home Friday night and then I was able to unlock

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
pit easy.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
So, um, that tip saved my life.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
So if you didn't already know about that, that you can re challenge anybody in that

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
blue games and more menu with a little door icon, you can, and if you lose to them again,

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
it's okay.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
They'll, the door icon goes away, but it will come back after like 10 or 15 minutes.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
So, and I know tons of people are cheesing it with the unlocks.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
That's just, that's just not how I'm going to do it.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
It's fine.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
I've already unlocked like 25 people, just the normal way.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I just got Simon before the show tonight.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I kind of, yeah, I do want to play the game.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
I think it'll be fun.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
It's just, I don't know.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Maybe I have to get paid.

42:38.000 --> 42:44.000
I feel like at some point, um, there's going to be like a code that'll just unlock everything

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
like an up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right type of code.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
That'll just unlock everything.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
Cause it is weird that like, you know, people are going to have tournaments and it's like

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
either somebody has to loan their copy of smash brothers or what are you going to do?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
You're not going to be able to unlock everything for a tournament right away.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
So I feel like they're going to put out a code at some point, um, to let people do it.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
It could also be something they patch into the game later on too, because obviously if

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
there's a code, someone's going to find it.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
It is weird too, that there's just the whole double unlock thing.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
You know what I mean?

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
Because, and I say that because not only do you unlock in the regular smash mode, but

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
then you have your world of light, which is the single player mode and you only get Kirby

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
in that mode to start.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
That's it.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
You have Kirby and nobody but Kirby, which if you're act deaf is not a problem.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
And it forced me to learn to play Kirby who actually, actually now I will say this is

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
like the best character.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
I act.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Yeah.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Like I am.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
I've always been like a nest guy, a pit guy, but now I'm like, okay, well thanks to world

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
of light.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
I kind of had to fucking teach myself how to play Kirby.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Uh, I'm cheap as fuck.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Just doing that up B move all the time.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
The slice thing.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
But Hey, you know what y'all are sucking on link for a bit.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Fuck it.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Hey, Oh, um, it works.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Phrasing.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
We're phrasing.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
Um, it works on purpose.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
So anyway, uh, act depth and chat says tier list be damned.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
You know what?

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
I'm going to co-sign with that because honestly my favorite character in Wii U smash was Pac-Man

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
and he's always on like the trash tier.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I don't give a fuck about your tier list.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I want to play Pac-Man.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
He's fun.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Done.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Some of the stages by the way are so good.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
Like, have you looked at some of the stages in this new smash?

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
Like, I guess it brings back stuff from the 3DS and all the other games, but there's,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I love the retro stuff re-imagined.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
They do such a good job with like, there's one that's just straight up, like a remake

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
of world one, one from super Mario brothers and the whole level scrolls as you play it.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
I think that was in an older game.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
I know the Picto chat one was in an older game.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Those are still fun to play, but like they've just, they've just got some crazy.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
They need to update the Picto chat one with all penis drawings.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I don't think they're going to do that.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
They're not going to do that.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
They totally need to do it.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Bobby Blackwell said there are peni in the Picto chat stage.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
I don't know if he's making it up, but no, he says already there.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Hmm.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
Uh, what they need to do actually instead of Picto chat is they need to do,

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
what was the other one that was, uh, for cat pictures?

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
That was the, uh, swap note.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Yeah.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
They need to do a swap note stage with all cat pictures.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Yes.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Yes.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Oh my God.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Anyway, so I'm, I'm loving smash and you know what?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
I'm going to play more of it.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
And honestly, that is pretty much all I played this weekend.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Those card games and smash.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
And then the rest of my week I played a little bit of wow.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
A little bit of final fantasy.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I'm still juggling two MMOs.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
I don't know how I do it.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Did you know dark Sakura?

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
I have a one 20 Alliance and a one 20 hoard and like my Alliance.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Thanks to Delvin.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
I've been, I've been working.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
Like he's been pity running me through some mythics and I've got some decent

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
gear.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Well, clearly those are clouds, Bobby.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I mean, I'll play you there.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
That's one jagged penis.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
All right.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
Anyway, Bobby's linking and chat pictures of things that may or may not be a

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
penis and picked up chat.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
It looked like noses shooting lightning time to penis.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
All right.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Anyway, that's it for my gaming week.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
So a housekeeping.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
So I will.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
So we're, we're not taking any shows off for the holidays.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
We're still going to be here over the next few weeks.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
So as I mentioned earlier,

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
and as I've been saying ad nauseum the past couple of weeks next week,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
fingers and toes crossed.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
I, I, I'm not definitively saying it will happen.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
You'll see a go or no go on Twitter around Friday.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I may not be here on the 30th.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Damn it.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Damn it.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
Sorry.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
All right.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
It's important.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
I have this.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
I'm visiting my dad before he moves to Texas for good.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I'm sorry.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Well then if Jamie can't be here,

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
there may not be a show that night or we're going to have to do it in

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
advance.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
That's fine too.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Um, so, but anyway, well that's even more the reason why I really hope this

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
week.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
We'll see.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
We're doing it early in the day.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
So I don't want to, I don't want to keep you from family stuff.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
None of us do.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
So yeah, you just go to spend time with dad.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
So anyway, uh, next week, uh,

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
hopefully assuming everything in on the tech side is ready to go.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
We still have shout cast set up as a fallback and we may use it,

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
but we will be doing our first show live on Twitch on Sunday night.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
We do video and everything.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
It's going to do video and everything.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Don't don't expect the world.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Yeah.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
The world I'm expecting it.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Does that mean I'm going to have to start breaking out the wig of the

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
week?

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Yeah.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
You don't need to break out the wig.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
You look fabulous.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Thank you girl.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Yes.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
She does look fabulous.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
You can wear whatever the hell you want.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
The best idea I heard for you,

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
and I don't even remember if you were there,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
if this was something I was talking about online with somebody,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
but the best idea I heard from you for,

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
for how to do you if you are feeling a little camera shy,

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
which you have every right to be online because men are trash,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
but you look great.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
And I think all of our listeners that we've built up over the years,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
as well as myself, as well as Loki,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
we would fight anyone that tried to come for you.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
You know that you know that giant hat,

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
but I'd cut a bitch too.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Well, I loved your SIA idea.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Yeah.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
So that was the, where the wig thing came from.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Yeah. I love that.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
I ordered like all these wigs on wish.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
And actually I got a duplicate of the one with the stupid Navy blue roots.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
I honestly thought she said wigs on wigs.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
I could do that.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Wigs.com for all your wig needs.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Anyway,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
I was just thinking wigs.com.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
I was just thinking wigs.com.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
The secret to a successful OLR? Wig water.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Anyway, but here's the thing, Darsagra.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
My favorite idea was that you would be just off to the side

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and you would have a special hand on.

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
So you would look like Dr. Claw off to the side.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
That was my favorite.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I need Ms. Smooshy here to pet.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
How to handle Jamie if she's camera shy is to do the Dr. Claw thing.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
How about that?

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Can we set that up?

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
We'll see.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
All right.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
Bonds006 says, so start a GoFundMe for your wigs.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
Tigerclaw on chat says, you gotta do that if people would pay.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
You guys are going to have to wear a lot of makeup while you're at it.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
You got to look to your best.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Okay.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
There's no amount of makeup that's going to help me.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
You're lucky I'm going to put on pants.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I cut my hair and shaved today.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
So that even though the camera's not here.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah, I don't like honest to God.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
No, look, I understand that makeup when you do certain things is important.

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
But for the purposes of OLR, you are lucky if I wear pants.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
I wear enough makeup for everyone.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
All right.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
I'm going to be all up in that drag.

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
But seriously though, like I'm not like as camera shy as I used to be.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
I was really kind of self-conscious for a bit,

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
but I don't mind now as long as I'm not like, you know,

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
about to do the sneeze face.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
Well, the good news is I think you're in a lot of good company over on Twitch too.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
There's a lot of women, there's a lot of, you know, different types,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
different sizes, different colors.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
There's a lot of just wonderful people on Twitch streaming that have normalized

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
it I think a lot more that it's not just white bros doing streaming on Twitch.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
You know what I mean?

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
Like it's the good news is there is a more diverse community.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
I know I am pretty white.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Hey look, hey look, hey look.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
There's just because somebody says diversity doesn't mean they're saying

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
get rid of everybody else.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
I know, I know.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Yeah, exactly.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I'm also wearing though like my new shirt for today.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Are we going to do a tacky, a sweater episode?

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Oh, you're not going to be here the rest of the month.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
No, it's not tacky.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
It's not tacky.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
It's my Dilbert Sonomori GameCube shirt.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
I will wear it for, so December 23rd, I think is a show night.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Let's do a tacky Christmas sweater night for Twitch.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
I don't have a tacky Christmas sweater.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I will borrow one from Alan then.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I refuse to wear anything related to Christmas.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
All right.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
What do you guys think? Tacky, tacky Christmas?

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
If they mark down the Hanukkah sweaters at Target, I'll buy one.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Even though Hanukkah is like ending after tonight.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Do they sell a tingle sweater?

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Oh my God, perfect.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
You know what?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Let me internet this.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Anyway, Vaga Network is our Twitch channel.

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
Please go ahead and go over there, subscribe and catch Bobby Black Wolf.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
We'll also be making the transition with us pretty soon.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I don't know if they're doing it the first week,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
but pretty soon after in the next couple of weeks,

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
Anime Jam Session will also be joining on the Twitch bandwagon.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
So that's really exciting.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
And you can stay tuned to all of that over at Vaga Network.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
We'll either be hosting Who's Live,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
or we're still going to be a network of promoting each other

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
and helping each other and just getting more voices out there.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
So that's what the plan is to do.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
I want to add something in relation to Ranma.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
I'm super proud that you're using the Hebrew hammer

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
as your Facebook cover picture.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Bobby Black Wolf says,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I have an ugly sweater that's gaming related.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I can wear that on the 23rd.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
There you go. So Bobby's in for ugly sweater night. I'm with it.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says,

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
Cats on my head is a streamer speed runner

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
that wears a cat thing on her head.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
So you would not be the first to do the...

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
But not a real cat because I mean,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I'm a little bit let down if that's your name.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
And you don't have a real cat on your head.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
The only way we're going to get people to tune in on Twitch

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
is for me to promise that Mr. Smoosh might show up.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
He will.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Loki, let's be real.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
They don't give a shit about you or me.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
They don't really care what Jamie looks like at the end of the day.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
They only want to see the cat.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
That's what it is.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Show us your pussy.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
This is the internet.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Your loud, screamy pussy.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Alright, anyway.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Let's move on.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Let's get into some news.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
The news of the week.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
There's a lot going on.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Including a follow up to last week.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Sort of, right, Loki?

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Yeah, so the whole trash bags...

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Should I queue up the Betty Hill theme?

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
No.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Maybe the shade sound.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
So as we talked about the Fallout 76 collector's edition that they did.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
The $200 one.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
So unfortunately they had sent out originally these nylon bags that were just garbage.

52:41.000 --> 52:46.000
And people were pissed off because not only did they not get what they were promised.

52:46.000 --> 52:53.000
Then Bethesda said, oh hey, we'll give you $5 in in-game crap currency.

52:53.000 --> 53:02.000
And then also we're also going to actually have these canvas backpacks that we'll give out to our influencers instead.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Even though you did pay $200.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
Well, they decided, hey, we are actually going to send out replacements.

53:09.000 --> 53:19.000
So please go to our website and file a ticket to get a replacement bag sent to us.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
And we're like, oh finally, they're doing something right.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
Thank god they're actually not Bethesda-ing this up.

53:28.000 --> 53:38.000
And then they Bethesda the crap out of it by their Bethesda support page leaking Fallout 76 customer names, addresses, and phone numbers.

53:38.000 --> 53:45.000
So what was happening is people were logging into their support ticket and they could view everybody's support ticket because that's how websites work.

53:45.000 --> 53:51.000
So apparently there was an issue where they were able to see other people's information.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
Including their purchase information, whatever they've scanned and uploaded into it.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Screenshots, names, addresses, and whatnot.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
Bethesda said, of course, that they had fixed the issue.

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
They basically said, hey guys, we resolved the issue.

54:07.000 --> 54:13.000
No apologies or anything, but they resolved the issue.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
But they still fucked that up too.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Because, of course, they did.

54:17.000 --> 54:23.000
If I am a lawyer right now that has Bethesda in my sights, I am having the best holiday season.

54:23.000 --> 54:29.000
By the way, since this didn't make our show roll, but I saw a video about it today.

54:29.000 --> 54:38.000
So last week we talked about how, hey, we're going to fix some of these problems that you guys have and we're going to patch the game to make it better.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
So that you guys can enjoy it and it's not so buggy and shitty and stuff like that.

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
So guess what came along with that very first patch that they put out.

54:46.000 --> 54:53.000
So the very first patch that they were doing, one of the things they were trying to fix was this zero health glitch or whatever.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
Where people would basically be indestructible and you couldn't kill them.

54:57.000 --> 55:05.000
So you would have to basically restart the game if you encountered that.

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
Because basically the health would come back and they would just be a bullet sponge.

55:10.000 --> 55:17.000
Well, they didn't fix that and they also patched in stuff to rebalance the game to make it even grindier.

55:17.000 --> 55:24.000
So they reduced the amount of the different power cells that they have in there.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
They reduced the amount that those lasted and they also made it harder to harvest that stuff among other things.

55:29.000 --> 55:35.000
So while patching the game to fix some of these bugs, they're also patching it to make it more grindy.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
So that you want to use their in-game money to speed the game up.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
Just fuck this company. I mean, seriously.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
How about they go eat a pile of dicks?

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I can't.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
It's garbage. I'm not even touching this hot garbage at all.

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
I didn't really have a lot of interest in Fallout 76 to begin with.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
But now my interest is at a negative one.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
My interest is down in the base. I feel bad for Fallout fans. I really do.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
But at the same time, I'm going to do a special message.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
And Jamie, maybe you can join me in this.

56:11.000 --> 56:21.000
A special message from me, a Mass Effect fan who survived Andromeda, to you, a Fallout fan who will survive Fallout 76.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
It'll be okay.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
I gotta tell you this much. I watched that new...

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
They had a new Anthem trailer that was during the game awards.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I don't fucking care about the game at all now.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
I didn't care about it much to begin with, but I just like...

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
This is fucking Destiny. I don't want to play this.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
So you know they had like a super secret beta over the weekend, right?

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
I'm not in it, but I'm pretty connected. I know people that are.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
It's not our secret if we know about it.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
There's an NDA. That's why people aren't talking about it.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
And I don't know if you heard, but EA is taking it very seriously.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
Somebody streamed it and they freaking banned the guy from Origin or something like that.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
They're taking it very seriously.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
So not a lot getting out there about what's going on.

57:01.000 --> 57:06.000
But should I say it? Because I have some tea.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
You ready for some tea?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Now obviously I cannot tell you.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
I cannot tell you where I'm getting this.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Hold on. I'm looking.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Because where was it?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Okay.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
Here's my review of Anthem Alpha.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
I'm sad we aren't ever going to get that Dragon Age game they teased.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Because BioWare won't be around.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Ooh, girl.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
That was a text message I got earlier today, but I ain't telling you from who.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
That's sad.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
But hey, Outer Worlds.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
It looks like that's going to be a game that's by the original Fallout people.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
When Fallout was good.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
So maybe there's hope.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
Maybe Fallout's not going to be necessarily your game, but it'll live on as a spiritual successor.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Alright, anyway. Let's move on.

57:59.000 --> 58:06.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, CHILD.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Going to the next...

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I don't know.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It could be just dramatic.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
People being dramatic on the internet, hyperbole.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
No, seriously though.

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
If it doesn't end up being a runaway success, I think that EA will close them down.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
That's just because that's their MO.

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
I think as much as there is over-the-topness and extra-ness sometimes.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
And again, that is one review.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
And it's an early build.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
So I think that's a fair thing to just acknowledge.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Don't make your final decisions off of an anonymous message I just read.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
Bobby Blacko says, Rob's friends being dramatic.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
TigerClanChat says, will Anthem be the downfall of Bioware?

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
Let's hope not, because I would like to see that Dragon Age game, and I would like to see a Mass Effect game.

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
But I do think there is a lot of money being invested in this, and there's a lot riding on this game.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
I don't think Bioware or EA can afford to make the same mistakes they made with Andromeda.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
So maybe that's part of the reason they're doing this, to get some of that now.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
Because maybe they'll end up delaying the game again, if it is a mess.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
Dragon Age games have been pretty good so far.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
I need to go back and play the last one. I had the last one.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Inquisition was great.

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
And so the new Dragon Age sounds cool.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
And you know what sucks? I don't necessarily blame them.

59:30.000 --> 59:39.000
And that's unfortunate, though. It's the bad decisions by higher-ups end up when the game does poorly because of their shitty decisions.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
And the dev teams actually take the brunt of it. It's annoying.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
But that's just EA's fucking M.O., unfortunately.

59:47.000 --> 59:54.000
We've lost many great studios because of stupid EA, so what are you gonna do?

59:54.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Those talented people will find homes elsewhere, and you will get spiritually successor games, much like this new one. I don't know.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Alright. Anyway, moving on. Let's talk about Doom.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Did you know Doom turned 25? Doom is now 25 years old.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And that makes me feel old, because I remember when Doom first came to me.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I remember calling BBSs to play Doom 2 multiplayer.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Remember, I could never get Doom to run on my PC, because I only had four megs of RAM.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And even though you needed four megs of RAM to run it, you could never allocate quite enough using your config.sys file.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I had Doom in black and white for Mac Classic.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Oh, that's awesome. I didn't even know they made a black and white version. That's rad.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.000
There were some great black and white Mac games back in the day. My favorite was always Crystal Quest.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Because they did it on 360, they did an arcade version of it.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I think so.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And there was one call, I think the Dark Castle.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I was going to Tetris.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Oh yeah, Tetris. Anyway.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
But anyway, this isn't about just Mac games, because Doom was huge on PC as well.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000
December 10th, so the actual anniversary is tomorrow, which honestly will be the day most people listen to this on the podcast.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Anyway, that's the day it turns 25 years old on December 10th.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
John Romero will be hopefully revealing something new that day.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Romero Games is going to announce pre-orders for a project that John Romero just completed.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That was an email that went out from Romero Games.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You can follow it on his Twitter, at The Romero, where there are some hints.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Some people are thinking it could be Black Room is the project that he's been working on.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So I'm assuming we would see a little bit more about that tomorrow.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So, there you go.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
But I'm wondering, you know, obviously we don't know what this project is.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
We weren't going to know until tomorrow, so we can't speculate too much more.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
But I'm just curious, what do you think about Doom all these years later?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Do you think Doom is an important game in gaming's history?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Or where do you think Doom kind of stands for you?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yeah, absolutely. It's an important game.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It helped launch the whole FPS genre.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I mean, that and Quake, it was one of the pillars of these modern games.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Yeah, I think a game like Overwatch owes a lot to something like Doom.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I mean, sure, Overwatch draws from other places as well, as well as Blizzard's own perspective.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I'm not saying they're just ripoffs, but I think there's so much that, you know, certainly Doom really pushed forward.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And especially, you know, remember the other, ID Software was kind of really the king of those 3D games back in the day.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And that movement from Wolfenstein, which was its own amazing, you know, game.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
But really, Wolfenstein was a 2D game in a 3D space, right?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Doom was a 3D game in a 3D space, where you started to have the elevation.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You had walls that weren't just square.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
You had maps that, you know, were in different shapes.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Like, Doom really was, like, that pushed forward.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Yeah, I mean, I remember it was a CompUSA.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
We had saw, like, Wolfenstein 3D being played on a PC.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And just, like, just a group of people around going like,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Holy crap, you know, this looks amazing.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Back in the day when shareware.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I fucking love shareware. It was great.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000
You'd go to a store, you'd buy a Wolfenstein 3D disc for, like, two bucks.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Or, like, some dirt cheap. You know, I'd buy a ton of those shareware discs.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Well, because you could only pay because they couldn't charge you for the shareware, but they could charge you for the disc.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
That's what it was.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
They had copies of it, and it was great.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Because, like, I'd pick up all these games, and if I liked them, cool.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I could send my money away, you know, for, you know, the full game.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Or, you know, wait until the BBS had the pirate, you know, that type of stuff.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But, um, it was a great way to do it.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And I remember they had Doom was, like, you know, on those discs as well one time, and I knew.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I remember being connected to a BBS for, like, an hour and a half just to download Doom.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Like, for real. Like, it's just, yeah.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Man, I miss the BBS community. Those were the days.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Old Man Alert. Let's see, Bonds006 says, Doom is the granddaddy of SPSs.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Tigerclaw says, Doom is definitely an important game in history.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
The same as how Castle Wolfenstein is an important game, even though that was the first FPS game.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And, let's see, Bonds006 says, Doom, Unreal, Half-Life, WS, Wolfenstein, Counter-Strike.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Those games will never grow old to me.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So, yeah. It's important stuff, for sure.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Well, and then, like, Quake didn't come out that much longer after that,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
so I'm thinking we're gonna be coming up on the 25th anniversary of Quake as well, right?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Because that wasn't much later.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Um, yeah. Quake wasn't much later. Quake was probably, what, like, nine months later, maybe?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Maybe a year.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It was probably a few years later.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Maybe. They'll do something really big for Quake, I'm sure.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Yeah.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Must be.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.000
All right. Anyway, let's move on to the next story, Dark Sakura.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Wheel.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I'm sure we are all familiar with Hajime Tabata, who was the Final Fantasy XV director.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Well, he told Squenix to bite his butt. I'm kidding.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
He actually left the position as a studio head of Luminous Production on October 31st,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
and he is starting a company called JP Games.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Unquote says, um,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I started up my own company called JP Games, Inc.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Right now, we are preparing for a target January 2019 launch.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
And to everyone who has assisted me until today, I kindly ask for your ongoing support.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So, there's no more information than that, but we'll see what happens.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
All right.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Um, yeah, I mean, very interesting after that whole, uh,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
him just kind of suddenly leaving Square after Final Fantasy XV was apparently losing money.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But, you know, wish him well.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
You know, I think a lot went into that that is not necessarily dude's fault.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
So, I wish him well and see what creative...

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Sometimes, like, from Ashes...

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And I wouldn't even call Final Fantasy XV, like, a disaster.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Like, it was a fine game.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
It was a fine game.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
But, you know, with the financials or whatever, perhaps not turning around the way they wanted,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
and maybe the DLC just kind of went on a little bit too long.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I think maybe that planning that went into that is kind of where things went wrong.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
You know, maybe something will rise up from the ashes, right?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You know, can flop designers make a great game later?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I'm not calling this guy a flop designer, but we've seen that, right?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
You know, it's okay. You can make a bad game and then make good ones after that.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It happens.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
So, all right.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Uh, well, let's move on.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
All right. So, this was kind of cool and out of nowhere.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Apparently, there is a competitor now.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
A new challenger arrives.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
So, the Epic Game Store is something that was launched this week,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
and basically, it is going to be a competitor to Steam,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
another game storefront that you'll be able to put games on for sale,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
and also to purchase stuff with your Epic Games account,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
which a lot of people have Epic Games account,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
because, you know, Fortnite is the shit right now,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
and everybody is participating with that,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
or you're like me, you have an Epic account because you use the Unreal Engine.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Speaking of which, so to kind of step back a little bit,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
and so leading up to this,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
or actually, we'll talk about this in a little bit.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So, there was a change in the revenue share on Steam.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
So, Steam right now, for most people, takes like a 30% cut

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
of the revenue that you make on their storefront.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So, for example, if you publish a game there,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
you'll get 70% of it.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Steam takes their 30% cut.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So, the main difference with this is the Epic Store

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
is actually only going to take a 12% cut on games.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So, you're actually earning an additional percentage there,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
so 88% on those games.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And on top of that, so if you're using Unreal 4,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.000
normally Epic takes a 5% cut of your revenue from that as well.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Well, if you use Unreal Engine 4 on the Epic Games storefront,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
they're actually going to waive that 5% fee,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
so it's still going to be 12% as well.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000
So, you can make a lot more money on the storefront.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Plus, being that the storefront is just starting off,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
you have a lot more visibility as well,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
so that's also a good thing.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
What's kind of nice about this, though,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
as a little bit of a perk to get people their eyes on it and stuff,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
is they're actually going to start offering free games

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
every two weeks on the storefront.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
No membership or anything.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
You just basically create your free account

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and you can add it to your library.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Well, I like free.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Tiger Claw on chat says,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I'm all for a free game every two weeks.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
That's kind of where I'm at. I like free.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
But the only thing, see, here's the thing.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Now you've got all these different companies

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
kind of giving you free stuff.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
So, it's like I have Steam, of course,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
because you have a huge library on Steam.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And once in a while, they might have a free game

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
or like a 99-cent game or something.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Or other sites that have free Steam codes for things.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
But then you have now Twitch has their own store thing.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Origin, GOG.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Origin gives away free games.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
GOG, once in a while, gives away free games.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
There's another one, too.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And Transphobia, don't forget about that.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Well, that's a whole other thing, yes.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
But we don't cheer on GOG like we used to.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
PlayStations, Xbox.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Sure, if you're a yearly subscriber on those things, sure.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Damn it, there's another one.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Oh, Discord just did the store thing.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
And they have like a plus plan type of thing

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
for their Discord Plus where they give away free games.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So that's the only bummer is that then it's like

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
you have all these different stores on your computer

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
and all these games.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
But, well, see, Discord, I noticed,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
is now very big on let us scan your computer

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and we'll just put shortcuts to all your games

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
no matter where they're from right here in Discord.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Because I'll tell you what, those guys at Discord,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I honestly think those guys are so fucking smart.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I really do, and I'm not being paid by them.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Of course I use Discord as a fan.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
We have a VOG Network Discord, plug plug.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I think what they have done since the beginning

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
is fucking smart, and it should be called out and commended.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
They put a Trojan horse, the good kind, though,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
not the virus kind, on everybody's computer

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
by offering those types of services

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
that people were paying for, TeamSpeak, Slack.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
They give it to you for free,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and they got everybody to put Discord on their computers.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
People put Discord on their phones.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
When Nintendo couldn't step their pussy up, Discord did.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And Discord embraced the Pokemon Go thing

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
because that was a mess to coordinate

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
until Discord was like, use us for Pokemon Go.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And now look, now that they're everywhere in that regard,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
they're like, oh, well, you know,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
since we're here on your computer,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
we're just gonna open up this little store right here.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Just if you're interested, no pressure,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
come browse our little store.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Oh, by the way, if you're a Discord Plus member, though,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
we'll give you free games.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And you know what, since you love Discord, we love you,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
you know, we wanna be your one-stop shop

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
for all these games.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Why don't you just, come on, just let us load all the games.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Dude, they're so smart at what they're doing.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I honestly think, like, you know,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I don't wanna be dramatic or nothing,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
but it is gaming media.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I think Discord is smarter

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
than any other gaming company out there right now.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Agree? Disagree?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I think it's pretty smart.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Pretty smart, but I don't know.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I mean, they'll fuck up eventually, everyone does.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But for right now?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I still think for that, though,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
that before they do things automatically,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
there'll be like a permission to allow.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I mean, it's one thing that I really like about,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
just about any app that installs itself on like your Mac,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
that it has to ask permission to access things like your photos,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
like your camera, your microphone.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Even some of the Apple apps request that approval,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
like GarageBand does it right now.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Windows 10 kind of took a lot of cues from that.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Like, I know with Windows 10,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
there's a lot of things where it will come up and go,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
so and so wants to access your device.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Would you allow this type of thing?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And even if it's not natively built into Windows 10,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
a lot of the web browsers,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
and because so much is built on either a Chrome frame

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
or an Internet Explorer frame,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
which ironically, I know we all heard this week,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
is just going to be a Chrome frame pretty soon anyway, right?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Am I right? Did you hear all that?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
So anyway, but still not going to use it.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
But those will also ask permission.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Like if you try to go to a website that wants to access your camera,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
it's going to tell you.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So that way you know you're not broadcasting your picture,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
you know, somewhere you don't want it to be.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And no, any website that wants some notifications to be sent to me,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
you can fuck right off.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
But to be fair, I do first remember that on an Apple system.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
So now that's just kind of becoming the industry standard

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
when it comes to privacy.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
But since countries like everybody in Europe

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
under the E-L-U-L-A or whatever that, sorry,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
whatever that acronym is that governs all that,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.000
that, you know, they have the strangest privacy standards now.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And I think everybody is kind of having to do these

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
to kind of conform to that, if that makes sense.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So anyway.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Anyway, so as I was talking about Epic Games.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Yeah, sorry.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Yeah, so with that, you know, some of the things that they want to do,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
they basically said they want to have a direct relationship with players.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
So they said people who buy your games automatically subscribe

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
to your newsfeed so you can actually send them updates.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So this is, you know, if you're putting content on the storefront.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
You can connect with creators.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
They're sending you YouTube content creators,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Twitch bloggers, and whatnot.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
You control your game pages, and they, you know, welcome all engines.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
In fact, they mentioned Unity on here as well, which is kind of cool.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And it's going to be a launcher that's available on PC and Mac,

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
which I think is pretty awesome.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And then, like I said, you know, two free games a month.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And in 2019, they're going to be doing that.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
So let's see.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Actually, I think they're starting it this month as well.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
So the first free game is going to be Subnautica,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
which is, you know, like a $25 game.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And that's going to be coming out, or free copies available

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
from the 14th to the 27th of December.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And then after that, Super Meat Boy, which is from the 28th to January 10th.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
So pretty awesome.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And then they're going to be doing that through 2019 as well.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
So definitely looking forward to checking that out.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
And I'll add yet another copy of Super Meat Boy,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000
which I have on literally every fucking platform that I practically own.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Except for the Switch. I don't have it on the Switch,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
but my kids aren't playing that game.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
That's it.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
All right.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Fortnite, man, it's everywhere.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I was just at Target the other day.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
They had like a Fortnite aisle.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Crazy.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Speaking of Fortnite, so my son started playing Fortnite.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And so he's decided that he wants V-Bucks for Christmas,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
which is their in-game currency.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
To which I've tried talking him out of that, because I'm like,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
do you see how much this shit fucking costs?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I'm like, it's basically one to one.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
So like, you know, $5 is $500 V-Bucks or whatever.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And like an emote or a dance is like $7.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I'm like, fuck that.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
You do not need to pay $7 for a goddamn costume in a game.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
That is not worth it.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Especially since I know how you play these games

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
and you fucking get tired of this game in like a moment's time

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
after you've bought in-game currency.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
So I'll probably get him Robux instead,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
which is also just throwing money.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
It might as well just set the money on fire

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
because it's just, you know, pretty much a waste of money.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
What's that game that Julian likes, Pirate101?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I remember he talked about it on the show a long time ago.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
He's still playing it and he's 11.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Good for him.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
But I mean, maybe, maybe a game like that would be fun.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Bitch, I still play Number Munchers.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
He likes Octodad.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I had to explain the Oregon Trail to somebody

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
a little younger than me this week

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000
and how that was like all the rage when we were like in grade school.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
You know what I mean?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I had to kind of like explain why that game was cool.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Have you played the Oregon Trail?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Yes, I have played the Oregon Trail.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I have that, but I have not played it though.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
The parody game, yes.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Oregon Trail is great.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Tigerklonchow wants to know about the kid.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Is he good at Fortnite?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Because that's a game that looks like it has a steep learning curve.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
No, he is not very good at it.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
He is looking forward to,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
that was something that they announced during the Game Awards, though,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
is that they've got a creative mode coming out.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
So right now, apparently if you subscribe to their little

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
season pass or whatever they call it,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
that you get access to it now.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Otherwise, us, you know,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
normal people who don't pay money towards that,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
you have to wait until, I think, the 13th to play that.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
So he's looking forward to messing around with that.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
He doesn't really know what he's doing in the game.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I mean, he might get a kill, you know,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
but that's why I'm like, you know,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I don't really want to buy him.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I'm like, you know, for the amount of money, like,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
it's been like,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
it's like talking about this costume pack that was like $30.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I'm like, you could buy another game for that kind of money.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Like, why are you going to spend money on a costume

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
in a game that you're only going to play for a little bit?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Just, no.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Just don't.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So, that's it.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Just have him play Second Life.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
No.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
That's, that's just, no.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
No one should play Second Life.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
All right.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I mean, I guess it still is.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Nobody, nobody plays it anymore.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It's probably there. Well, somebody just brought,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Bonds006 in our chat just brought up Sony Home

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
saying, I blame Sony Home

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
for the normalized trend of buying clothes

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
for my in-game people.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And Second Life may really be something to blame for that,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
or just that whole era.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I actually, isn't it weird that like,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
despite how much we always kind of made fun of it a little bit,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
like, there's stuff about Sony Home that I actually kind of miss.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Like, I just feel like there was so much potential there

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
that really didn't get realized.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Fortnite, I don't have a problem if you spend money on skins.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Like, if you're actually playing that a lot,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
then I have no trouble with you,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
no problem with you spending money on that kind of stuff

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
if you want to support the game.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
But I know my kids,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
and they don't have the attention span

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
to play that game for hundreds and hundreds of hours.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I want it, I want it, I want it,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
and then they'll have it, and it's like, okay, cool, bye.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And then they're going to play something else.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I get it.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
We have Minecraft, I needed Minecraft,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
and then I got Minecraft, and no.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
KumaJP suggests, let him earn his own

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
to buy stuff like that.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Yeah, make him do chores.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Alright, anyway.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Let's talk a little bit about

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
what is going on on Steam's marketplace

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
because they are doing a new little profit sharing thing

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
that doesn't have any developers very happy.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
In short,

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
right now, revenue for Steam games is split

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
70-30, so the developer gets 70%,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Valve gets 30%,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
as we know, Epic is undercutting this

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
quite a bit, and that's going to be a huge deal.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
18%.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
But, from now on,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Valve is only going to take 25%

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
if the earnings are above

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
10 million, and only 20%

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
if the earnings go beyond

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
50 million.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Oh, how generous of that.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
However, the first 10 million will still be split

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
70-30, and it's going to impact any revenue

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
after October 1st.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
So, this really does

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
jack and shit for indie developers.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
It's still going to be 70-30.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
But, I mean, here's the thing.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
This was announced almost

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
at the exact same time that

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Epic whipped it out and put it

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
on the table, so to speak.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Yeah, they announced theirs first, and Epic's like,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
oh, by the way, since you guys are fucking

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
pissed off about this announcement,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
here's our $399 US dollars.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
That's what they did.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Okay?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
And, yes, that's a throwback to the infamy series.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
You want to talk about trading games?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
That's right. You want to talk about

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
paying those fees for the

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Unreal Engine? Yeah, let's talk about that.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
So, very interesting

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
what they've done there.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
That may cause Steam to make a counterplay.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
You know, the thing is,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Epic is

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
the company to take on Steam right now

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
because Epic has Fortnite.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Steam doesn't have any

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
new games that are huge.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Speaking of, I forgot one of the announcements

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
that they made during the whole

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Game Awards. If it's not Half-Life 3,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I don't give a fuck. It's not Half-Life 3.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
It's Counter-Strike.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Counter-Strike GO is going free to play,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
and they have this new

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
battle royale mode

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
called Danger Zone,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
which is in there. Please tell me

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
we played Kenny Loggins. They didn't

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
play Kenny Loggins, but

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
yeah, so now they're trying to compete directly

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
with that by having Counter-Strike GO

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
be free to play, which pissed

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
so many people off.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
So many people are not happy

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
about that either.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Well, Valve also wanted to explain

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
why a certain Steam algorithm

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
led to smaller games losing traffic.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
There was a bug in October that made

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
the more-like-this section of

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
pages, I guess, start acting up

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
in favor of more popular games

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
on Steam. Valve did fix this, but

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
it kept a change that factored

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
in the sales, the wishlist

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
popularity, so the games that saw

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
traffic got changed as a result.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
So, I guess now a new algorithm

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
is in place, and it shows fewer

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
products to a subset of customers. Anyway,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Valve is saying the traffic has recovered

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
towards the end of October as a result,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
and things have stabilized, but again,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
indie developers kind of got one-two

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
punched with

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
both these news articles this week.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
By the way, have you all checked out

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Falling Plus on Steam?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Support our buddy YYR, just

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
because he needs it right now after

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
hearing these one-two stories. I hope you all

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And honestly, if you're not going to support

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
YYR because his games don't call to you,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
then cool, support somebody. Go

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
buy an indie game. We've had tons of indie developers

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
here on this game. Timespinner,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
go get that, or Monsters &

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Monocles, they'd love your money too. Any of those

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
games we've had here on this show, go give them some

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
money. They'd appreciate that.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Alright.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Anyway.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Moving on, just a few more stories for you guys

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
before we get to the classic peripheral of the month.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
The last one ever!

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Because we're going to change it in 2019, but we'll get there in a minute.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
For now, Dark Sakura, what do you have

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
for us? Well, there

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
is a game that we

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
used to talk some shit about

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
until we figured out it was actually good.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
That is coming out

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
on Instant Games on Facebook.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
You want to know what that is?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Pump It Up!

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
HTML5 edition. How do you play

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
that on Facebook? I have no fucking clue.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I guess with a keyboard.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Well, Andamiro has

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
decided to go via Facebook, so

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
it is playable on

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
mobile, PC, or anywhere else

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
with an internet connection.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
It has 100 songs, different play

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
modes, custom play styles,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
and they'll release more information over

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
time. Now, if it actually

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
has a dance pad, that'll be even

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
better, but no, probably not.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
But anyway,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
star points are used to buy the songs

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
and you start off with 10.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Step points are used to play the game, and you start

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
with 60 step points, so with each song, and depending

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
on how well you do, you earn

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
more star points as a reward.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And I'm pretty

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
sure that you can

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
buy more, but right now, the only thing

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
you've got up there is Pump It Up! H5

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
on Instant Games on Facebook.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And that's it.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Okay, cool. Like, you know,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
it's not something I'm probably going to invest a lot of time

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
in, but sure, more

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
mobile games on the go. Why not? As long as

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Run To You is on it, I don't care.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Bounce with me, bounce with me. Oh, I love

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
that song. Anyway.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Act F does want to point out, there was Pump It

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Up! Portable on the PSP,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
two of them, so there was, I guess, another

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
portable version a long time ago, but

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
who has a working PSP? I shouldn't say that.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Probably a lot of people have to work through PSPs.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I'm not sure if they're working.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Do you know what somebody tweeted about today that made me

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
go, aw, somebody tweeted,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
and I'm sorry, I forgot who you are, but somebody tweeted me

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
saying, I first started listening

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
to OLR because of OLRPSP.com,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
which hasn't been updated since you first started listening.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Does it even still work?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I think we stopped paying for it.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It's long gone.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
There's probably a domain squatter there now.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
But, um, yeah, I just remember,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
like, oh, remember, I just

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
want to kind of give you a pat on the back, Loki,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
because a lot of that PSP innovation was you. You did

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
good in that time. Like, that

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
PSP stuff that we really embraced. It was very limited

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
what we could do with that. I know, but still,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I loved having

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
more podcast stuff on a

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
gaming platform. You know what I mean?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
It's harder to do that now. I can't just whip

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
up an Xbox One game. Thanks to PSP

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Radio that they have their

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
radio app or whatever.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Aw, everybody in chat is having a

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
moment to pour one out for OLRPSP.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Oh.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Bonds006 says, OLR for PSP

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
was the shit. I mean,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I wish we'd done something

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
that smart since.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Oh, well.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
We'll do it for Game Boy at Pants Browser.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Alright,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
moving on. Just a couple more stories.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Loki. So, the Game Wars wasn't the only

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
kind of game showcase that would happen

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
this week. Also, there was the kind of funny

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
game showcase, which

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
they showed off a stream of

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
a bunch of different indie games that are going to be

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
coming out in 2019. So,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
some of these are actually pretty cool.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
They showed a new trailer for Super Meat Boy

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Forever, which I guess is now releasing April

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
2019, and of course, you guys are aware

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
what Super Meat Boy is.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
There's a game called Moving Out, which is

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
by the guys that did Overcooked

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
in Overcooked 2,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
which looks hilarious. It's a game basically about

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
moving your friends out of a house,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
but it's just like Overcooked

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
that's kind of silly and fun.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
So, that's going to be coming

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
out on PC and consoles also in

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
2019. Showed another trailer

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
for ToeJam and Earl Back in the Groove,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
which is coming out March 1st.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Then they've got,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
let's see, a game called Quarantine

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Circular, which is out on the Switch

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
already. Conan

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Unconquered,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
which looked like a new Conan

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
game. Human Fall

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Flat Dark, which is going to be a DLC

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
update to that game.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
They had a game called Vain,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
which I don't really get to watch this

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
trailer, but it looks like

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
some artsy

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
indie game there, and I guess you can turn into

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
a bird. And then they had

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
a game called, this made me think of you Rob,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Supermarket Shriek.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
It's about a guy,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
a guy and a goat. It's me

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
when I see box wine is on sale.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
A guy and a goat being

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
like going through a

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
supermarket screaming and they have to

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
crash into a bunch of stuff. I don't really know what it was,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
but it looks hilarious. I'm

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
so down, it sounds great. So yeah, that's

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
going to be coming out as well.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
A game called Fold Apart, which is

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
a game about

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
these two characters that have

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
a long distance

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
love

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
for each other and they have to

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
use this page folding

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
mechanic to get them to meet

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
each other. And that's going to be coming out as

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
well soon. And then

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Desert Child, which is a cyberpunk

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
beat-em-up racer game.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
That's like retro. That's going to be coming

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
out on consoles and

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
PC as well.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Actually, that's coming out this week

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
on December 11th. So PS4,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Switch, and PC. And the

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
little trailer that they had for it looks very

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So, looks pretty awesome.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Seeya Tiberian

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
chat says Rob Roberts is low-key

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
turning into Monique Hart tonight.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
OK! Brown Cow

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
stunning! Yeah, but Supermarket

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Shriek looks awesome because

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I so watch Supermarket

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Sweep all the time. And

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
that show is fantastic.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
But this doesn't necessarily look like that.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
It's just like ridiculous. I can just imagine

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
you know the goat screaming sound and some guy

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
screaming for no

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
reason whatsoever.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Rob needs to stream that.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I'm going to do it. Done. We're going to do

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
some Supermarket Shrieking.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Oh girl.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
You should play it too, DartSagra. Be fun.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Something else that I

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
probably won't be streaming anytime soon because that would

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
involve me having to buy one is the PlayStation

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Classic. They're all over the place. They're just

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
sitting on shelves. Please buy

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
one. Well, here's the

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
thing. Is

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
it really news for me

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
to say they're already finding

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
ways how to hack these things wide-ass open?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Is that news?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
No. Is it really news?

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
No.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
But here I am.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Apparently some USB keyboards

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
can be plugged into the PlayStation Classic

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
and it will allow you

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I'm sorry, this is just funny.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
It will allow you to access the emulator

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
settings because of course

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
the PlayStation Classic is using some open source

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
emulator and you can just go in there and

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
access the emulator settings with certain

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
keyboards. I don't know what it is but I guess some

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
will work some more. Some Corsair and

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
stuff keywords and ironically

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
enough I have one of the compatible keyboards

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
for that. How about that? Yep.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Now they are saying use with caution

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
because you don't know how you're going to fuck up your PlayStation.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I had heard that somebody went in

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
there and just changed some

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
setting and got the

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
US versions of those games.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Yeah you can change the rendering setting from

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
NTSC to auto to

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
PAL and you do that. And then there is

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
also a way they can also change

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
I think you can overclock the system like 20%

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
doing that as well.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Which got I guess Ridge Racer

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
type R4 to actually

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
run correctly.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Now I don't know if I fully

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
understand what exactly happened

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
here but I guess somebody went into the

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
PlayStation and data mined it.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Which is you know everything gets mined for data right?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It was the source

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
code because the reason

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
why is the

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
licensing that they had on there.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
There was a dump of

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
the core that was

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
on a PCSX

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
PlayStation emulator. So they had to have

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I think they dumped it to

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
GitHub or something like that. So they had

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
the source on there. So it

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
showed that there were 36

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
other games I guess like their

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
names were buried in the code or there was something

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
pointed to these games in the code

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
that make it seem like these games

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
were like tested on this

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
or at one point were possibly

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
being included but it ended up not

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
being included. And so of course you know

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
as I'm about to name some of these games

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
these are all the games you really wanted right?

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Such as Chocobos

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Mysterious Dungeon, Crash

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Bandicoot, Driver

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I said that for you Logie. Or guys

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I also said that for you Logie.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Clona, Clonoa

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I love Clonoa.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Let's see, Parappa the Rappa I said that for myself.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Silent Hill, I said that for

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
everybody because if you have taste you love Silent Hill.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Sweet Coden

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
and the first two Tomb Raider games. Obviously

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
the list is gigantic there's many more I'm not

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
saying. So some

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
reports saying these games are actually there on

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
the console but nobody's... No I think they're not.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Yeah I think that would have been a really dumb thing

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
to leave on there and it could have left them open to a lawsuit

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
but certainly some things are pointing

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
out. Weren't some of those in the Japanese

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
version because the Japanese version got different games

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
than we did. We got, like they got

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Armored Core and

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I don't know about, I don't think they get

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Ergites but I thought they had Parasite Eve

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
over there. Yes they do they have some different

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
they have some more RPG type games. So Parasite Eve I could

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
see that but

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
yeah they got the better list out of this

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Clonoa. Well it depends on what you're into but

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
from my perspective yes I agree

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
they got the better list.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Anyway let's

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
take a trip down memory lane

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
shall we?

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
We're going to do the classic game of the week where every

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
week Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
a game that she thinks hey you brats

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
you should be playing this game this week you don't need no

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
PlayStation Classic for this. It's a little sticky

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
and gross. But this week it

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
is a little bit different because Dark

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Soccer for the past 11

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
months every month in 2018

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
once a month she has flipped

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
the damn script

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
and she's done a peripheral to

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
highlight instead of a game. As you do

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
as you do once in a while. It's how we keep it fresh.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
So anyway this is the last

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
one we're going to do something else in 2019

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
so we'll talk about that in a minute.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
But what is the last classic

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
peripheral of the week?

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
It is actually two

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
peripherals. But they are

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
very similar in concept.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
The first one is

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
the VMU our visual memory

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
unit for Dreamcast. And so

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I didn't really want to have a YouTube of just

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Dreamcast noises. I do

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
have just that lovely

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
intro.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
It's

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
just like

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
you took the world's biggest P.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
It's just refreshing. Thank God. I would

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
go for a Dreamcast

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
classic mini. Yes me too.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
It sounds like the

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
nasty plunge. So anyway

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
and now you're just going to hear Sonic Adventure because

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
that's what I picked.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
You know Dan was actually

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
watching like a full playthrough of that the other day.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's probably the same

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
one I'm looking at right now.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Much longer. Anyway

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
but Sonic used the VMU.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Yes so the visual memory unit also

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
known as the visual memory system

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
was

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
a memory card

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
that was produced by Sega for the Dreamcast.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
It had a

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
monochrome LCD

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
multiplayer gaming

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
capability via the connectors on

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
top. Second screen functionality

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
a real time clock file manager

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
built in flash memory and

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
sound capability.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
It actually before the launch

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
of the Dreamcast

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
in Japan

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
there was actually a special

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Godzilla edition. Guess who owns one?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
This bitch. I also have

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
the Ghidorah one. And yes

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I raised my mini Godzilla like

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
a freaking Tamagotchi.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
it is at its

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
most basic function

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
it is a memory card.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
It's a storage device. But it also

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
will give you like certain

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
layout things like

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
you know a heart sensor in some

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
games you know for your characters health.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
You know all kinds of

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
different stuff but it has like some other console

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
like features on it. Including

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
a D-pad. It had

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
a couple of buttons. It had

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
you know

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
different you know like a mode

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
and a sleep button.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
But there were also

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
other special edition VMUs

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
like the ones released by Sonic Team

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Capcom and the Hello Kitty one by

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Sanrio.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
So it will plug directly into

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
the controller of the

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Dreamcast. And of course

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
that's how you would look down on it to do

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
different playing. You can

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
also hook one to

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
the other via the connectors on the top like I mentioned.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
The VMU runs on

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
two CR2032 lithium

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
batteries that are inserted

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
into the rear VMU.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I will tell you this.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
My Japanese VMUs

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
still freaking work.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Just saying.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:34.000
But a VMU without battery power will

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
beep when the Dreamcast is powered on

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
if the VMU

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
is inserted into the

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Dreamcast controller.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So as far as

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
its technical capabilities

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
it had 128 kilobytes

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
of flash memory.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Holy moly! 48 by 32

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
LCD screen.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
So basically a VMU

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
is two Commodore 64's stuck

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
taped together.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
But it actually would fit in

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
your pocket.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
It had a one channel PWM sound

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
source. It had

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
the D-pad. Four input buttons

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and one reset button.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
It, like I said, functions as a

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
memory card, second screen, minigames,

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
a calendar to file manager.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
It only weighed like

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
one and a half ounces.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
It was really really tiny.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So as far as the data

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
that it would store,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
28 kilobytes of it were

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
reserved for system usage and

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
100 kilobytes were used for data

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
storage which was divided into 200 blocks.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
And then homebrew programs

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
like Dream Explorer or the VMU tool

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
would unlock

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
more of the reserved space

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
that you could save more on it.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
As far as different minigames

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
you had Chao Adventure

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
from Sonic Adventure

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
games. You had

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Sega GT

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
included Pocket GT which was

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
kind of a top down racer

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
a bit like how Spy Hunter did.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
But now

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
as I was mentioning for Code Veronica

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
you had a heart meter on it

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
that would show you your character's health.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And that was pretty cool.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Now people have done different homebrew

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
games on it.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Including a version of Metroid,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
VMU

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Deepak Man, Breakout, Space Invaders,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Tetris, VMU Fighter

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
which is a side scrolling shoot em up.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
VMU Chao Editor 1 and 2

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
so you can make your own Chao.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
VMU Football for American

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Football. VMU A Sketch

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
which was an Etch A Sketch thing.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And 3D First Person Shooter.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
So

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
some of the games that would use

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
them to put in different extras

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
is like that Cardcaptor Sakura game

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
that I have Rob. They came with the plate

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
and all that shit. I'll never get over

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
the fact that you bought a game with a plate.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
And a clock and a spoon.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
It also had a pillow case.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
But it came with a version of Breakout,

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Oyatu, and Toba Kero

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
and it had a clock with different themes on it.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I'm looking at some

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
of the other ones in here. Godzilla Generation

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
had Atsumete Godzilla,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Gamera Dream Battle and

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Mothra Dream Battle. Jet Set Radio

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
1

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
had, well Jet Grind Radio, Jet Set Radio

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
had a graffiti transfer.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 would let you do

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
character transfer, colors,

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
and stages.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Pop and Music had

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Pop and Music Anywhere minigame.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Power Stone came with three different games

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
on it. Like

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Gun Rock's Gun Gun Shot, Falcon's

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Aerial Adventure, Ayame's Shuriken

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Training.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Look at some of the other ones on here. I'm just going through

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
some of the best. Shenmue had Shenmue goodies

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
and training instructions.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
We got all the chao ones.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Let me see what else.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Trick Style had Trick Style Jr.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
on it. Time Stalkers came with different

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
minigames. Tokyo

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Bus Guide had a traffic sign

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
quiz.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Other things is like what they would do just like

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
you know plugged into the games like

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Ready to Rumble would add a punch

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
count and a hit percentage.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Quick 3 Arena played

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
different

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
animations. Pop and Music

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
had Virtual Pop and Music Controller.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Namco Museum

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
sorry that was the one that came with

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Packet.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
NFL 2K came with

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Secret Plays.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
F355 Challenge came with

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Arcade Connectivity.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Dino Crisis, Health Condition, and Ammo Count.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So there's just all kinds of different stuff.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
D2 had

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
a

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
what's the word I'm thinking of? A compass.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Girl you're going to go all night if you read every game

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
So for the other versions

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
that came out there were

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
some memory cards

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
that came out like a VMU that

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
had none of the VMU features.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So they had no display

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
input button, speaker, built in clock

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
but they had

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
multiple pages to save. There was the

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
4X memory card that Sega released.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
It had 800 blocks.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I think I have one of those too.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
It did not come out in Europe.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
There were of course a bunch

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
of third party memory cards.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
But as far as the

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
reception goes, GamesRadar

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
said in a 10 year retrospective

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
it was one of their favorite storage devices.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Because it was

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
such an original concept.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
That brings me to the knockoff

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
concept. The Pocket Station.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Dun dun dun.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
How about some

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
some

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Vibrobin Music Rob?

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Oh I will work on that right now.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
You know I love me some Vibrobin.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
So Pocket Station

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
is basically Sony's

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
version of the VMU.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
It

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
was sold as a

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
combination memory card and a

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
miniature personal digital assistant

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
that had a monochrome

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
LCD, infrared communication

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
capability, a real time clock

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
built in flash memory and sound capability.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
To use the memory card

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
it has to be connected to a Playstation

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
and it was released exclusively in Japan

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
on January 23, 1999.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
It was

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
used for specific

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
games.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
It was actually

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
delayed with its release.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And of course

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Sony was actually planning on releasing it outside of

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Japan, but the release

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
never happened due to

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
inability to meet

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
the Japanese demand for

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
they were focusing on the Japanese market.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
But a few games such as Final Fantasy 8

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and Saga Frontier 2

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
still had Pocket Station functionality for

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
their local versions.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
The most popular game for Pocket Station was

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Doko demo Isho

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
which sold 1.5 million

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
copies in Japan.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
It was the first game to star

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Sony's mascot, Toro.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Who was that

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
little funny Sony cat looking thing?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
The Pocket Station

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
was discontinued in July 2002.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Now

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
it was announced that the Pocket Station

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
was going to be revived

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
as an application for Playstation Vita.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
It was

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
only available at first to Playstation Plus

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
members and then was released to the

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
general public and was exclusive

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
to Japanese Playstation Vitas.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
It

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
actually had a smaller screen

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
on it than the Dreamcast.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Five input buttons, one reset

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
buttons. It did

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
have bi-directional infra-red.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
The

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
battery it used was a 1 CR 2032

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
lithium battery.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
It had calendar functions and

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
identification numbers. It weighed

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
30 grams and it came in different colors.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
There was white, crystal clear.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Black for the

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories limited edition

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
in Japan. Crystal slash clear

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
pink for Tokimeki Memorial 2

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
limited editions.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
It worked with DDR.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Everything from third mix,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
fourth mix, and fifth mix.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
It worked with Soul

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Hackers. It worked with Digi-One Trainers,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Final Fantasy VIII, Fire Pro G,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Grandia,

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
IQ Final,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Jade Cocoon, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
I'm just trying to think of some other

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
games that people would know over here. Legend of Mana.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Weren't they going to re-release

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Vib-Ribbon? Did it ever come out?

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
It did on the Vita and I thought it came out on

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Playstation 3. I don't know if it ever did on

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Playstation 4. Remember, Playstation 4 can't play

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
PS1 games. Well, I don't know why I said

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Vib-Ribbon because it doesn't work with it.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I guess

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I just wanted to hear Vib-Ribbon.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
She just wanted to hear Vib-Ribbon.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
It worked with Ray Crisis.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Also, super awesome

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
game. It worked with R4.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
You know what game that I played that it

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
worked with?

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
You don't get music anymore.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Final Fantasy VIII? Didn't Final Fantasy VIII work

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
with it? That's what I said earlier.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
It also did work with

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Shirooch Justice Gakuen

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
which was

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
the evolution disc for Rival Schools

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
because there was that

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
dance mode on it. I remember I used to leave it

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
plugged into my Playstation

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
and

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I'd do some mode where the chocobo would

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
walk and it would get items

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
and I just left it running

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
overnight or a couple days

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
and I had like a hundred or so

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
items from that made the game

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
so much easier.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
It really did actually work with quite a good

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
number of games.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Chocobo Stallion?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Ark the Lad 3

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I'm just again trying to think of games that

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I know of that people might

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
recognize. Love Hina 2

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Metal Gear Solid

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Integral

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
and actually Metal Gear Solid

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Integral was one of the US games that would

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
work with. Same with Ray

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Ray Crisis

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
and then Rival Schools 2

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
and Rockman Complete Works

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and there you go. So yeah

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
it was pretty popular

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
but alas

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
it only had a three year life.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Alright.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
It lived about as long as a beta.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
So there it is. Your classic peripheral of

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
the month. The pairing of the

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
VMU and the PocketStation

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
which kind of mixed memory with portable

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
gaming with...

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
With boredom alleviation. I feel like it was

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
the precursor to other second screen

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
things like cell phone

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
gaming. What do they call that

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Microsoft thing that was short lived? Share

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
screen? Second screen? What do they call that whole thing?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Or the Wii U quite frankly.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Or

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
even the DS.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Kinda. Or what's really kind of like mobile

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
phones now I think honestly has kind of filled in that

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
void. Thank you Smart Glass.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
We actually have color. Don't be a

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
smart glass. Alright. Before

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
we go to our music break I do

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
want to recap since that was the last

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
speaking of music classic peripheral

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
of the month. Hold on though. I want to

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
recap our twelve peripherals of

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
the twelve days of peripherals. So

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
we had in January the

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
U Force. February

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
was the activator.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
March was the NG

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Con. April

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
was the Saturn Twin Stick slash Dreamcast

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Twin Stick. May

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
was the XE1 AP.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
June was the trans vibrator

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
cause obviously if we're gonna do

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
a peripheral we had to do the trans vibrator at some point.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
So she did that for my birthday month.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Dance Pads in July.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Cause you know it was a show that we met

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
playing DDR so we've done our fair share of dance pads.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
August was the sewing machine.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
It was the

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Raku Raku mission. The sewing

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
machine. Yes. The sewing machine's awesome.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
September was the Sega 3D glasses.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
And October was the

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Steel Battalion controller cause we kinda did a

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
combo that week. And then last

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
month was the Wii Balance board and we ended

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
it with the VMU and the Pocket Station.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
So. Yes.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
So starting in 2019

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
so here's the thing. 2017 we mixed

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
it up with the classic system of the month.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
This year was the classic peripheral

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
of the month. So next year in 2019

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
not only will you get

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
several classic games of the week every month

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
but once a month you're gonna get the

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
drum roll. We're gonna get the classic

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
soundtrack. Game soundtrack.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Awesome.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
This is just a way for you to re-highlight

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
games you've already done isn't it?

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Not particularly no. Because

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
there and I'm actually gonna try to

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
avoid the usual stuff like Super Metroid

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
and Final Fantasy. Well I mean you don't have to.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Well and the thing is

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I want this to actually extend

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
for a couple years because there are so many

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
awesome soundtracks.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
And there are games out

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
there that one wouldn't think about the

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
degree of how awesome the soundtrack are.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
And I may or may not do some of the ones

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
that I'm gonna name but Zero Wing.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I mean how's that?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
There is also

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
oh what was that shooter game

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
that used

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
2 Unlimited's music?

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Oh okay.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
So like games that maybe used some

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
like cool music that you may have forgot about

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
type of thing. Okay I'm down with that.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
You know and I'm not gonna go for like anything relatively

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
new either. I'd like to focus on 16

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
and 32 bit systems.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Even 8 bit systems like Wrecka.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Although you really should do Alan Wake.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Oh my god the licensed music in that game is so good.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
But it's your segment. I'm gonna be going

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
for original pieces.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
You know I'm just trying to think about

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Ys III Wanderers from Ys.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Had a really good soundtrack and it's not one that people

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
would just oh Wanderers from Ys

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
or oh here's another one Rob.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Bejeweled

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
on iPhone. Okay.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
And I'll tell you this

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
that game has some freaking astounding music

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
in it for a little iPhone game.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I can co-sign with Bobby Blackwell suggesting

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Last Ninja on Commodore 64.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
That's one of the greatest like

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
soundtracks that use that chipset.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Well and see that's what I want to do

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
is I want to focus on the things

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
that I

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
that I know

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
people wouldn't think of at first for like

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
amazing soundtracks. Right.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
So you're gonna stay away from Final Fantasy 6 cause we all know that one.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
You know those types of things.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Exactly. Okay.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I think it'll be fun.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
How about Acid Tetris?

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
As a soundtrack featuring

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
our pal. Okay forget it.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I tried. I tried.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Alright. But at any rate

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
you know and I'd be happy

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
to take suggestions. I mean

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I kind of wanted to do this one

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
twice a month. Instead

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I'm gonna do it for over the next couple

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
years. Because

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I think that there

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
are enough

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I'd say

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
unrecognized or

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
what's the word I'm thinking of like not regularly

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
thought about.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
You know soundtracks that

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I think deserve a little bit of love. Sounds

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
good to me. Or fuck even the Guardian Legend

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
soundtrack is pretty fucking amazing.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
But no one thinks about it. Because

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
honestly there are still people out there

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
those poor ignorant

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
fools who don't know what

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
awesomeness the Guardian Legend is. Basically them

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
kids. They get Gen Z.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
They need to get the fuck

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
off my lawn and get into my house

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
on my Nintendo.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Right. And play some

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
fucking good games you dumb shits.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Classic soundtrack of the month coming in

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
2019. Please look forward to it.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Yes. Ewada bow. Alright.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
That's gonna do it for part A. But we've

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
got plenty more show to come. We're gonna take a quick

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
break here live. We haven't done a break

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
live in a while because thanks to Radio Magic.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
But we are gonna take a break and when we come back we have

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
more of Orange Lounge Radio right after

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
this. Please don't go anywhere.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Lounge Radio. Live and in progress

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
here at the Voice Geeks Network.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
For episode number 755

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
December 9th of

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
2018. Our show already in progress.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Already running pretty long.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Having a lot of good times. I think something about

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Jamie being here and having another person to bounce

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
everything off of I think helps the show be that

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
three hour length we're used to. A lot

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
of the shows without you Jamie have been like two and a half

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
two. It's just shorter

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
when there's less people to talk to here.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
So. Anyway.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I have a

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I'm

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
happy to be here. I mean I like

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
having my Sundays off and I don't like

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
working on Sundays. I know. I know.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
But you know what? Good for you and your job and I

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
know you're doing the type of work you

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
were more wanting to be doing. So sometimes

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
you have to make changes to do that. Radio magic

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
has been fun. Honestly and I was mentioning this

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
to the live only people.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
But the radio magic stuff that we did

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
has been fun and it's actually

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
kind of got my gears turning for

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
why don't we do something like this all the time

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
even though you might still be here in studio

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
maybe there's a way we can do pre-recorded

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
segments that kind of allow us to

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
have a break in studio but still

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
do everything that you kind of get during the show.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
I've been wanting to do a mini cast.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Yeah. That's like

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
maybe an expansion of the

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
classic game. Yeah maybe. Like

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Jamie talk shit about games. Or something like

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I know I know there are some there's a couple

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
of you out there that missed the

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Pokestop podcast. Maybe something

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
like that once a month for like seven minutes just

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
to recap like what we've been doing. Maybe we'll be fun.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
So I don't know. There's a lot of a lot of ideas

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
kind of floating around out there. We'll see what we

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
land on. Just a little bit of behind the scenes stuff.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Yeah. I am

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
actually working on my iMac right now.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
And I've already got

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
logic. So

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I've already

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I'm going to be ordering

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
an interface.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
And I'm going to be getting hijack

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
for my own computer.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
So I'll be able to start doing like

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
more like Skype feeds and everything.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
It would be kind of like a bit like pump up the volume

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
was. Except it just be me

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
and whoever calls and talking shit.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
But you know what. That's a thing people do on

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Twitch. Like just chilling. I think

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
that's like a category. I don't know if that's what the categories

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
go. Just chatting I think is what it's called maybe.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
But I would use Twitch for that.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
But I'd record it. Yeah. You know

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
why not. And just I don't know how to do

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
it live because I don't think I'm going to use shoutcast.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
But we'll see what happens.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
We'll see. Anyway as

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
as we were addressing with the live

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
listeners I think the theme

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
an appropriate theme for

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
the future of O.L.R. and why

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
we're doing this big change. You know after 16 years

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
look to the sky. That's what it is

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
right. Look to the sky. I'm just

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
really excited. I'm really to this guy.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I'm really hopeful that

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
we will be able to grow after

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
you know it's we haven't had a lot of

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
new people. Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
every new person that comes around to O.L.R. and I know some friends

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I've told about the show started listening and so forth.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I really appreciate that. But like on a bigger scale

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
we have not really been able to grow in a very long time.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
And I think this is going to really help us to do

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
that. So I really hope you guys will welcome in

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
with open arms next week the new people

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
that are going to poke in on Twitch being like what

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
the hell's this. You know as long as

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
you know you know the number

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
one rule is going to be be

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
cool. Like don't

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
don't be a jerk. So anyway

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
as long as I'm sorry we don't take dick

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
pics. Yeah but most honestly

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I don't get I don't get a lot

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
of bullshit on Twitch like when I

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
watch stuff like the Pokemon reruns

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
or like Bob Ross especially

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
like you know you would think like watching

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Bob Ross with the chat room is just going to be like the

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
worst thing in the world but actually like the chat

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
room made that whole experience.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
It really did. So I'm

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I'm hopeful. I really am.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Alright anyway

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
let's move on. We've still got some news

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
too. We still have a show to do. Changes

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
or not we're still going to be covering the news. So let's

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
get to it. Loki with some rapid fire

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
news starting us off. Yep. So

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
there is a new mod for

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
the Game Boy Advance to allow

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
you to connect it via

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
HDMI to a TV.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
It'll actually upscale it and everything. So it's

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
the GBA Consolizer

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
and

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
it's by this guy

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Steven Williams who goes by Woozle

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
on YouTube. And basically

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
it's this device that you actually have to wire

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
up to a

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Game Boy Advance. It even has a

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Super NES controller

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
port. So you can actually hook up

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Super NES controller to it as well.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
But it'll upscale it. It looks awesome.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
It has lots of different

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
tweaks. So you can actually

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
adjust

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
the color to see what it would actually look like

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
without the backlight and everything

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
or

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
even just

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
being able to

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
I guess

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
make it look like other screens. They have options

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
to select between the different types of screens that you would

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
play it on. Even like a PSP as well.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Pretty cool though.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
And I'm not sure if it's for sale

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
just yet but probably

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
is going to be something that he's going to offer

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
at some point.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Pretty cool looking device. So they were showing

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
off like Yoshi's Island

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
and everything with that Mario Kart

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Super Circuit. It's all

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
upscaled and crisp.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
So you can do that or

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
you can

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
buy a

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
SNES Classic or any

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
of their device and just throw it

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
on there for

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
cheap and upscale it yourself.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
But this is actually using

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
the legit hardware though.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Fair enough.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Alright and then

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
so there's

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
going to be some more backwards compatibility

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
for Xbox One.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I know that everybody's looking forward to this

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
but Duke Nukem Forever is now

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
supported on the

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Xbox One. For the dozens and dozens

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
of people that play that game. There's several

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
of you.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Also The Darkness is getting

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
support as well and XCom

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Declassified. Those were

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Xbox 360 tells.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Cool.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Neat.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
But seriously though there are better games than

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Duke Nukem Forever.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
All of the games.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Literally any other game.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Anyhow

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
except what was the one that Shane called in to talk

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
about a couple weeks ago? The Quiet Man?

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
The Quiet Place? Remember that one he called in

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
a couple weeks ago? He's like this game is fucking terrible.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
He actually was texting me about

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
it earlier this week because I guess they

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
he's like

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I kinda almost want to play it again after

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
that trailer but he's like but it's so

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
bad.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
But now they have audio in the game

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
so it's not fucked up.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
That'll be a thing

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
we can do for a break in the future is

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
make a new person play The Quiet

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Man.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Make Loki play The Quiet Man. I love this.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Anyhow.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I would say we'd do that if we didn't get emails

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
but then that's just gonna

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
convince people not to send us emails so we're not gonna.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Alright.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Moving on let's talk about some retro

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
sales numbers. For every email we receive

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I have to play The Quiet Man for one minute.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
I like where this is

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
going. Alright. Yeah but I gotta read

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
em. Alright moving on.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Retro consoles were a big deal

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
this year and in fact one out of every

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
five consoles sold in the US this year

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
was a retro device. That is according to

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
NPD's Matt Piscatella.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
We're getting to that part of the year where

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
we're gonna look back on the year in review.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
2018 in review.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
When it comes to

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
console sales one out of every five was a retro

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
console. Of course Nintendo snatched

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
all the wigs when it came to the retro world

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
with their classic NES

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
coming back and of course the classic SNES

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
which just came out last year.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Reggie Fils-Aime in an interview with the New York Times

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
suggesting why these are

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
being sold so well and why people

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
love them so much. Remember

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
people remember the colors and shape

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
of the console and the feel of the controllers

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
from their childhood and they have a visceral

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
reaction when they first fire up their

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
favorite NES or Super NES

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
games. Or if you're Loki

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
you have that reaction the first time you hack

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
the fuck out of that thing. That's what he said.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Believe it or not.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Funny enough I actually did play

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
that was one thing I did play this week I forgot

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
to mention. Not the NES

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
classic but I played the

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
NES games that you get for free

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
well not free cause you pay for the online service

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
so the NES

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
collection that they have

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
on there. So I played Dr. Mario

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
because I was like bored and I didn't know what games

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
to play. I played a little bit of that and that was

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
alright.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
But yeah I think a lot of those

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
consoles are selling also because you don't sell any fucking

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
games through virtual console anymore so

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
it's their only way to get them.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
So but no

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
they're pretty decent consoles.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I can't wait to see the NPD numbers for the

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
PlayStation Classic though.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Those are not gonna be good.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Yeah we'll see what that looks like pretty soon.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I'll still pick one up at some point

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
when it gets fully hacked open and it's

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
dropped in price. By the way act deft

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
with a compromise idea on your Quiet Man

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
thing. One minute of

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Loki playing the Quiet Man for every

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
single email that is well written and has

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
good grammar. Then he won't be

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
playing at all. Hooray!

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
That's his win win. So we'll go

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
for that. Alright. Bobby

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Blackwell suggests I'll get a PlayStation Classic

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
if it's $20. That's my bar.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
I feel like

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
if the price on those starts to fall fast

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
which I think is gonna happen. Those fuckers

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
are gonna end up at big lots. Just wait.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I'd buy one for $20 too.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Why not?

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I bought a Dreamcast for $40. They were way too

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
expensive for the price. They really were.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I don't know. It's just

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
They still hold up

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
well. Even if you watch the

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Digital Foundry video where they're talking about

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
the visuals and stuff and the different emulators

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
that are available. They're like

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
this is running on the PCSX

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Classic

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
and this is what

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
PCSX also can look like.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Why didn't we get

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
that? Because that looks great.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
This looks like shit.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Speaking of things that might have cost

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
too much when they first came out, Street Fighter

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
5 is going to be getting some in-game

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
advertisements.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Capcom calls it sponsored

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
content and it's coming on the 11th of December

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
and it's going to show you about

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
costumes, bundles, and the Capcom Pro Tour.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
You can turn these

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
game ads off, but players

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
of course are encouraged to keep them on because you

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
get extra fight money in ranked

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
and casual matches when you have them enabled.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Boy oh boy.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Extra fight money for watching ads. Wow that sounds like a

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
mobile fucking game. Every character

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
has ad-style costumes where the sponsored

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
content will appear somewhere on the clothing or model.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
So for example, here's Ryu and Balrog

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
where they have the

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Capcom Pro Tour logo

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
like they're a fucking NASCAR.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
I don't have a problem with the Capcom Pro Tour

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
stuff, but like, we're going to get

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Cup Noodle shit. Can I get

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
a Cup Noodle tattoo on my buttocks?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
That's what I would like to have on my

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
in-game character. Cup Noodle.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
That was some fucking

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
weird crossover shit for me.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
But you know what?

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
More people

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
have talked about Cup Noodles since that game came out

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
than ever did before. Well then there was the Pizza Hut

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
crossover that they had with, I think it was

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
like, um, oh god what was it?

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Uh, Neptunia? I can't remember

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
It fucking works, Loki. I see like

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Cup Noodles stacked and stacked and stacked

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
at Target or something and I kind of giggle.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I go, heh, Cup Noodle. Final Fantasy.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
And then I go, god damn it, it worked.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I'm a consumer whore.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
It was super extra. It was just ridiculous.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Anyway, you can

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
turn in-game ads off, but obviously

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
people are obviously irritated about it

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
because...

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
No, this um,

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
meme that somebody did where they have like a

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Pornhub logo on the floor and KFC

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
in the background, yeah that's pretty fucking great.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Honestly, I would keep in-game ads on if I'm

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
gonna get like KFC advertisements.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
And Pornhub. And Pornhub, hell yeah.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Somebody needs to hack that

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
so that it just plays a random Pornhub

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
video in the background on those stages. You know

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
that's something hackers are gonna be working on.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
No they're not.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Loki. Rule 34.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Is it rule 34 or 37?

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Rule 34 of the internet. If you

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
envision it, it will be made.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Well that's just if there's gonna be porn.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
There's always porn for...

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
So why are you sitting here breaking rule 34?

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Somebody is going to porn

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Street Fighter 5. Wait for it.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
They've already done that with costume

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
hacks and stuff. Do you know, especially

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
not to sidetrack things too much,

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
but with Tumblr

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
about to lose

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
all of their porn.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Well it's nice to see how they're gonna go the way of the MySpace

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Pornhub is

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
like, hey-o

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Tumblr people, come over here

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
because Pornhub is

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
another one of those companies that for what it is

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
we all know what Pornhub's got.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
We all know what it is. Y'all know if you have

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
a need for something like that in your life or not.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
But Pornhub does a great job

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
of just being who they are.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
You know what I mean?

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Anyway.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Well they own all of the porns

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
like a lot of the top porn sites

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
and shit. That's all owned by Pornhub.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
They own like all of them.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
They just need to fucking put out a legit

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
video service that's not

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
porn. Oh just

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
take video hub

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
or something. Yeah they'll just fucking take

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
on YouTube. I hope so.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Whatever. They're making

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
boatloads of porn money. Let's move something

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
less porny from Dark Sakura. Sorry Jamie.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
We're being very unclassy on this show.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Porn is inevitable. It's true.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
So um

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
of course Dragon Quest 11 S

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
we are waiting for

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
for Switch. But Squeenix

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
is actually thinking about

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
the next Dragon Quest game

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Dragon Quest 12. And it was even

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
asked how is the 12th entry going

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
and Horii said

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I actually came up with the keywords but I can't see

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
anything here. And he added

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
that since Dragon Quest 11

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
scenario was well received this time I went

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
the same reception for gameplay systems

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
but I could also surprise everyone and make it

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
an epic. Now I just feel like teasing

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
everyone and that it is still many

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
years away. Hopefully enough time

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
for them to get a new composer.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
And then

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
for the other

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
thing Capcom is working on

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
a mystery game that will surprise

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
and hopefully delight.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
They actually want to

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
make a game. This was in an interview with

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Famitsu.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Jun Takeuchi

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
is you know their senior

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
producer and is going over this.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And says and if we keep gradually

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
increasing the size of our stuff I'm thinking that at some

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
point we might be able to handle four AAA titles

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
at once.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
So Takeuchi

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
said we are currently working on a title

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
that will make our fans think wow they're

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
making that. So

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I mean

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I don't know they're already doing

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
the Resident Evil 2 remake.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
That's

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
not really a surprise.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So I mean

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
we've already we've already had

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Mega Man 11.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
And I'm trying to think of what

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
would what would Capcom I mean

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
if it's Rival Schools 3.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Fuck yeah. It better be.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Bitches you hear me.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
They've already had their first year of school

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
they've had their second year of school we fucking need

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
their third year of school. Maybe another Capcom

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
versus SNK.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
No it's Rival Schools it better be.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Personally I prefer the Capcom

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
SNK but I don't I don't hate her suggestion.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
So we had Chirich Justice Kakuen then we had

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Moru Justice Kakuen which is burning.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
What would be even better than

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
burning. You know we're still waiting

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
on for crossovers though we never did get

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
we got Street Fighter versus Tekken but we never got

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Tekken versus Street Fighter. We're still waiting on that

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
one. Yeah let's keep waiting. Yeah

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
I have a feeling. Maybe we'll have

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
a Street Fighter versus Pokemon.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I would love that. Bob Coffee

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
in chat says Rival Schools 3 technically

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
already happened. No it didn't.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
No because um

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Chirich Justice Kakuen

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
had a sequel to that which was Chirich

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Justice Kakuen to like the evolution

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
disc or whatever. Moru Justice

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Kakuen was a new installment in the

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
series. Now

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
even though you guys are joking about this whole like

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Pokken thing I would I would be there

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
in a heartbeat for Tekken versus Pokken

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
but why not because Tekken has those fucking

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
nuts characters like Panda

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
and Bear and the tree thing.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I want Pokemon.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Oh well Pokken was Pokemon.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
It was

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
a Tekken game.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
I want a Pokemon game with

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Street Fighter. Oh so you want to go

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
around and collect fighters and you know

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Chun Li used spinning bird kick. It's super

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
effective. You want that?

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I just want another PlayStation All-Star game.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I know that they you know

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
You know they're doing another jump

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
superstar right? Yeah.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
It's got like all the Dragon Ball and

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
What if it was Capcom versus

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Shonen Jump?

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Can I take another Tatsunoko Capcom game?

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
I would love another Tatsunoko versus Capcom

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
with you know actually playing on a good controller.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I did a double take when I saw an arcade machine on one of those

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
at round one not that long ago. I was like what?

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Anyway let's move on with the release dates.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I found out they have

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
an arcade cabinet also for a Pokken tournament.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I did not realize that. Yeah.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I think they're obviously more popular probably overseas

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
than here. 2019 by the way is the year

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
we're finally going to get a local round one.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I downloaded

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
an image of that.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Anywho. Did you know

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
it is going in at the Galleria

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
because they have the signs up for it now.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
It's the old Sears.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
As some speculated but here's the thing

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
the first floor is round one.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
The second floor is going to be a new movie theater.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Yeah so interesting.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
It would be cool if we had another dinner theater except that's still way too far

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
for me to drive. Yeah Roseville is kind of far.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Yeah I like the dinner theater.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I'm down with round one.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
You mean like the movie girl?

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Yeah. They are building

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
one at Waten El Camino.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
That's closer to me.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
You know the Walmart that flopped across the street.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Sorry local talk for a minute.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
The one that was the Montgomery Ward.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Yeah so across the street where they have Winco

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
they're putting in so Macy's went away.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
But I think one of the other things that had gone away

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
in there previously is going to be turned into another

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
movie girl place. Well that's cool they're actually revitalizing

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
the old country club shopping mall.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Which does tie to this show

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
because Country Club Lanes the bowling alley

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
across the street was like one of the places we used to play

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
DDR all the time because they were the only

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
place that had like fifth

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
mix. They had a

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Japanese first mix.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
They had something after that.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Yeah they were like the only ones that had fifth mix for a while.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
So yeah we used to go

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
there like play midnight to three in the morning.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
But

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I actually have been sitting on for a while.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
I won for my work and I haven't figured out what I'm

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
going to use it for. I have a

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
gift certificate for a party

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
for 10 at

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Country Club Lanes including laser

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
tag and bowling and arcade gameplay

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
and like we were going to

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
I was originally going to use it for like my

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
son's birthday but then we're going to

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
this broccoli farm to

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
you know for his birthday.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
But

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
yes this is what my wife has been

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
wanting to do. She wants to tell

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
them what they're going to. We're going to I finally convinced

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
her that we're going to tell them on Christmas

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
but right now

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
you're going to have a blue harvest.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
This broccoli farm

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
just makes me

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
think of blue harvest.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Because that was originally this

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
broccoli farm. We tell them that they're going to

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
L.A. but they're like oh yeah we're going to the

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
broccoli farm. You'll love it.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I don't want to go to a broccoli farm.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
This is terrible.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
This is when you first

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
said you were going to have kids

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
years and years ago. This

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
was what I was waiting for were these

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
epic fucking troll moves. I knew you were going to pull on

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
the kids. It wasn't my idea. It was

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
her idea. I think it's terrible. I don't

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I don't know that. I don't

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
I don't like it one bit. I

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
I keep telling them like don't worry

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
you'll have fun. Don't worry

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
it'll be fun. And they're just like I want to

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
stay home. I don't even want to go on this trip.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
They're going to the broccoli farm.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I'm sorry

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
it's my favorite thing.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
You're just going to just think

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
what we do when we do twitch you're going

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
to get to see the laughing. I'm like beat red

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
right now. Her idea was to

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
like not even tell them at all until we got

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
there. Like we're going to just arrive

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
there and then they're going to all of a sudden

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
notice that hey

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
there's this giant castle and lights and fireworks

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
and shit. And what is this

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
you know.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
So that's her idea. I wanted to tell

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
them so they can look forward to it but

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I will see. So you're going to do it on Christmas.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
You're going to say the broccoli farm is

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
next door to Disneyland. So we're going to go to Disneyland.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Yeah. Broccoli farm

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
burned down. Broccoli farm burned

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
down. Knott's Broccoli Farm.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
It makes me think of

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
the old deep thoughts of Jack

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Handy. One day I took my

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I said my nephews that I was going

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
to Disneyland. We

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
drove by an abandoned farm

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
house. I said oh no Disneyland burned

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
down and went home.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
The end.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
So anyways I don't even remember what the hell

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
we were talking about. Oh release dates.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
We were going to do release dates

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
but then you started talking

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
about the broccoli farm. Which do they even fucking

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
grow broccoli on a farm? Yes.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Sure they do.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
No Rob they pull broccoli out of their

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
asses. We're on so many tangents I don't even remember where

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
we are. And that's the shape of broccoli.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. It's shaped

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
like a sphincter. Oh right right right.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
So yeah I was going to yeah because

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
we the party that's right the party

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
I have. Oh right. I'm sitting on this I don't know

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
what the hell I'm going to use it for now because I don't

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
really want to wait until my next son's birthday party.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
It's 10 people that's not a lot so

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
I'm just like maybe just one of these weekends we'll

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
just have an impromptu laser tag bowling

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
arcade party

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
for 10 people.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
We should just invite strangers.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I guess.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
And pizza they have pizza.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
All right.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Did you win 10 tickets to the broccoli

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
farm? I did not.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Now I want to do I swear to

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
God so you know now my brain is going

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
on all these like tape segments I want to do for

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
O.L.R. I swear to God Loki you and I are going

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
to a broccoli farm and taping something for

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
O.L.R. You know actually

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Rob. What? Apple Hill

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
has a tomato farm. Do they?

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Actually Becky and I used to go

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
there to pick heirloom tomatoes.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
I used to go to pet the alpacas. That's

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
why I like Apple Hill.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
All right anyway. Let's go have

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
the alpacalypse.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Let's travel

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
around the world and check out release dates.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
I don't know if there's a lot this week I think finally

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
with Smash and Katamari and all that out

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
I think we're finally kind of dying down

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
but let's see. Apparently there's a broccoli farm

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
in Salinas. Is there really?

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Because there's this viral video of some

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
boy named Max who really wants to go to a broccoli

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
farm. Did something break behind you?

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Oh I thought I heard like a smash.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Oh okay. Anyways

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
so let's talk about

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000

I hope to God YYR

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
is listening tonight. That's all I have to say.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I think I want that. I also like Broccoli

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
No Touch Gene. I kind of want

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
like a game that's Loki

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
and the family at the Broccoli Farm. Loki goes to

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
the Broccoli Farm.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
You know what I would

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I would do a children's book.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Really? Well she wanted

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
to get them like t-shirts that said you know

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I heart broccoli.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
I can't make that happen.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
You know Broccoli 3.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I don't know.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I just think it's a bit elaborate to like

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
upset them this much. And don't forget about the

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
sequel. Kale Quest. Cause I'm gonna have to listen to

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
eight hours in the car

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
of like them complaining about this.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
And she does this a lot where she'll like

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
stir them up and then she's like okay bye

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
I'm leaving. And then I had to deal with the

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
aftermath of like this bullshit.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
So.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Well you know what I said the sequel should be Kale

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Quest.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
And we've lost Rob. I'm broken.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Okay. It's not

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
even that funny. I don't know why I can't

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
stop laughing. It's funny because it's not.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Coming out on the Playstation 4

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
I hope God's eating his broccoli.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
He's broken.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
You're supposed to save this for the show when we have video.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
This is no good.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
It's not good radio.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
This is a teaser.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Rob loses his shit.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Okay.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
No broccoli does make you shit.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000

no to Econ. Shinigami

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
no broccoli. No more fucking

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
broccoli. And Fortnite

Peach Ball. Senran

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Kagura is out as well. And there's

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
some type of double pack with that as well.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Maybe it comes with broccoli. I don't know.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
There's also Mickey

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
and Friends Special Card Pocket

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
24. So it's like Disney branded

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Switch stuff. Yeah. Sure.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Maybe

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Loki can buy some at the broccoli

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
farm. I don't know. Anyway.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Dark Sakura. What's coming out in the UK?

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
You better get through this segment

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
without naming a vegetable.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Aubergine.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Okay. My Little Writing Champion

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
on December 14th. And the

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
only other thing coming out that week

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
V-Rally 4.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
On the 14th.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
You know what else they get?

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Brussels sprouts.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Let's get

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
to the mailbag. Because every week

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
you guys email us.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
and Jamie will probably yell at me for not

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
deleting old emails. You know

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
that shit pisses me off.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
So just make sure they're from December 3rd or after.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
I think there's only one from today. I think

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
last I checked. But Dark Sakura

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
is going to go to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
and read some of her favorite emails on the air.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Um. Yeah. There's one. Can I

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
actually. Can we have a heart to heart moment?

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Since we're doing. Talking about changes.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Um. Ch-ch-ch-changing.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
The lack of participation in this segment

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
has me concerned. I'm thinking about getting rid

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
of it. Um. So.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
You might want to give your feedback over

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
on Twitter. At Twitter.com

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
slash O-L-R. Should we continue to do the

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
emails?

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Because I just think people

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
aren't writing emails anymore. They're writing Facebook

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
messages. So I'm open to.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
So is that going to mean I'm going to have to read everyone's social media

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
and critique them of the grammar? Well. I'm

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
considering bringing back

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
something akin to the Fugu question of the week.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
But obviously Google Plus is going away.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
So it'll either just be Facebook or social media.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Maybe something with Facebook and Twitter.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Maybe something with Discord. I don't know.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I would love to hear suggestions. But I just feel

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
like email ain't it sis.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Because it's. Maybe it'll change

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
when we get some new folks and stuff.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
But I just feel like you guys aren't.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Well I think for now if you want to send us

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
anything on Twitter. Of course

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
tag at O-L-R. But add

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
your hashtag tweet O-L-R.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
I don't know what that's going to do. But sure.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Because if we do it specifically to

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
bring something to our attention or make a comment. Oh OK.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Then the hashtag tweet O-L-R

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
is going to be directed to us. Alright.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Well I'm going to stew on that. I'm not saying it's going away yet.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
I'm just saying it's up.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
It is up for elimination. That is

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
what I'm saying. So

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
if y'all want to lip sync for your life and

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
save the segment you can. But

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
I'm just saying the emails of the week are.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
You thought your email sent.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
But it bounced.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Your email was stamped

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
return to sender.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Winner winner

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
chicken dinner.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Loser loser

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
broccoli.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I'm doing my

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
my tricksy

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
does RuPaul.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
To go with your RuPaul shirt.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
OK. Read the goddamn email.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
You requested that I stop it

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
but instead I'm just getting started.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
OK. Hey everyone.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
One question for all of y'all.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
I don't remember if this was ever asked

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
but is there a video game

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
that you have played that has gotten you through a

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
tough time in your life.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
For me it was Secret of Mana.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
I know I have mentioned it but this game has got me

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
through a rough time in my teen years.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
That's it. See you all on the flip side.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Ronma P.S. Shabbat Shalom Uchan.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Because it was

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
as my rabbi said

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
he said happy Shabbatica.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Because the seventh night

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
was on Shabbat.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Alright. So

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
as far as games

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
that got me through a really tough

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
position. Well certainly

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
actually Legend of Zelda Link to the Past

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
I was really really unhappy

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
for a while and that was just like my

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
obsession of getting my head out of

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
you know

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
actually just getting myself out of my own head for a while

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
and living in another world because the real world

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
was absolute shit garbage.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Um.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Right now. Um.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I don't know if there's anything right now

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
that's really doing it for me. I'll just go play

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
pinball to get my aggressions out.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I'm trying to think of something else

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
that really kind of pulled me out of a

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
tough loop.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
I'd say the Guardian Legend did it

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
for me for a while. It was sort of like having a sense

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
of accomplishment when nothing else was going right.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Because the game was fucking hard.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
But.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Yeah. I don't know

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
most of the video games I was playing were to get me

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
not thinking about just

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
all the garbage that was going into my life

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
when I was a kid.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
So. That's it.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Um.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
So. To go from a

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
very laughy note to a maybe somewhat more

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
serious one. Um.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Dance Dance Revolution. Like.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Not to be too sappy but

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
like those were not always

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
the greatest years of my life.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Being just dropped out of college and

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
dealing with a lot of things about myself

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
that I was just learning in regards

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
to who and what I

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
was attracted to sort of thing.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
And it was not

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
always the greatest period and I kind of

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
actually fell out of gaming in general for a long time.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
But then

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
you know Rocky Horror

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
was a big part of that and so

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
you know admittedly the first time I ever saw Dance Dance

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Revolution was at a Rocky Horror

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
convention. If you didn't know that story that is the

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
absolute truth. The first time I ever played Dance Dance Revolution

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
was at the 25th anniversary Rocky Horror convention

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
at the Hard Rock Hotel.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
And honestly from finding

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Dance Dance Revolution I met

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
people that I'm doing this show with

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
right now. Um.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Some other amazingly awesome people

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
too. Some not so awesome people but you know

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I'm just kidding. They're not around anymore.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
We don't talk about them. No. But no for real.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Like so many awesome people that are in

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
my life including many of you that are

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
still supporting this show to this day and all that.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
And like honestly like

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
yeah. Like I didn't mean to go from

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
like broccoli jokes to a really heavy

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
response to your question but like

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
what would

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
this life be without

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
what that game and that community

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
and everything did for me. It's

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
weird to think about. I mean

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
for the most part I probably would have turned out somewhat

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
the same but I probably would

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
have this show. I wouldn't know you guys.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
It would be different. It would be so different.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
So. There you go.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I remember that first visit over to your apartment

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
where we had to tread lightly.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Because I lived upstairs.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Yeah. And the downstairs neighbor

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
who listened to gospel at 6 a.m. on a Sunday

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
and always woke me up. I was afraid of you know

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
getting her back basically. I don't know. She

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
deserved it. Yeah. Probably.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
That was fun. I think I brought you

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
third mix on that visit.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
I think you did. You did because

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
I had that jungle mix dance pad and you brought

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
it was you or my old

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
crazy roommate that brought that.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
I think we were both there that day. I think

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
he brought the

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
CD image. You brought the plug

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
thing that let us play it. That's right.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Yeah. It was the

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
what were they called back then? Not the game genie

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
but it was. It was the plug thing

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
in the back. Game shark. That was it.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
No. Anyway Loki do you have a question

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
now that I've killed the funny

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
mood? No. I

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
don't have anything actually.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
So. Alright.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Maybe DDR I guess but.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I would think Earth Defense Force gave

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
you a good distraction. Do you want another serious

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
answer? World of Warcraft?

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Because certainly that community

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
did a lot for me too. You know I totally

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
love my years doing Horde House

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
and getting really involved with that community and

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
many of the people that I met there that I'm still in touch with to this day.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
But I think also more importantly

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
you know when Alan and

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
I first met which is weird to

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
think about that like all of this would be chronicled

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
on this show in the archives because

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
this show has existed longer than I've

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
known Alan which is a weird thought but it is what it is.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
This show's been on longer than I've been married to

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Dan. Isn't it weird to think

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
about before he had kids?

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I mean it's just like this show has been

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
so huge. But anyway

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
in all seriousness because Alan and I

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
were dating like long distance

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
for a while. Well I mean I say long distance. What do you

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
call it when like your boyfriend

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
lives two hours away? So you

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
can't see each other on weeknights. Moderately distanced.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Moderately long distance.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
But one way that we used to

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
hang out and I'm using my

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
cody fingers is by playing World of Warcraft.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
I know that sounds so nerdy and so

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
super weird but just being able

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
to exist at the same time in the

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
same space just kind of like

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
being with each other even though you're not

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
you know what I mean? Like you're not really with each other

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
but you're kind of with each other. You're doing

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
the same thing in the same place at the same time.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
When Dan and I started getting together you know

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
after he called me when I had that bad breakup

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
we were hanging out on AOL

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
role playing

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
in

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
not Town Square Sailor Moon by that point.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
I think we'd moved on to Kuno's Island

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
was our chat room of choice.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
And we would exchange like bad fan fiction with each

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
other. You know

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
I'd critique the grammar because I've

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
been doing that since I was in middle school.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Right. So

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
yeah.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Alright.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Yeah thanks for the email even though it took us from

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
by the way the broccoli is still going in the chat.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
But I did

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
post a tweet I think you can appreciate

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
I will not serenade everyone with Bob breath.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
You can probably appreciate this dark soccer.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I just took a screenshot of our chat room

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
lit up with all the broccoli puns and I just

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
put can't wait to bring this romper room fuckery to

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Twitch.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
That's a good term for it.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Romper room fuckery.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
That means I actually have to sign into my Twitch account

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
on my computer

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
now. PUBG players unknown

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
broccoli grounds.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
You guys stop.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
All right. That's it for e-mails.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
You can still e-mail us for now.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Participate at orangelaundrydo.com. We'll let you know in the next couple weeks

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
what we decide to do with the segment. But for now

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
send us e-mails because

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
otherwise I'm going to talk about the hollow slice

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
spectacular. What? I really don't like broccoli

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
unless it's tempura.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I used to

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
be a picky eater and I wouldn't really eat

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
broccoli but now I actually find

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
it to be one of the better greens.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I used to really like broccoli and now I don't

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
unless it is blanched

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
or tempura.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
I'll eat just like steamed. I love like

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
a teriyaki chicken

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
bowl that's like half broccoli

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
anymore. No I'll do like broccoli

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
on a chicken bowl. Just the littlest bit of teriyaki

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
sauce on it. It's not kind of they'll want broccoli

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
beef. I think I'm going to stop by Chinese on the way home.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
All right. Anyway. Moving on.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
We have more believe it or not

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
video game related stories here. Loki. We do.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
We're not going to be talking

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
about grand sets of broccoli I guess.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
All right.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
So Microsoft is looking

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
to bring the game pass

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
to other

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
devices. They say every devices

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
or every device.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
So of course they have it on Xbox.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I know that they're planning on bringing it to

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
PC. So possibly

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
maybe other systems

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
as well. They're saying you know

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
apparently

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
there was

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
a report from GameSpot

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
that talked about

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
it was during the Barclays conference

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
where they're saying what do you

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
when you think about reaching

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
customer with this content

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
where they're only compute device

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
could be Android phone

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
you think about

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
well what are the ways

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
that person pays for content

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
today. So we built Xbox game pass

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
started on console and it will come to

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
PC and eventually it will come to every device

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
we use the flywheel that we have

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
with customers on Xbox

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
to start the growth with

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
in the Xbox game pass.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Not sure if this is something we'll see

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
like come on other consoles.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
It would be neat if they

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
did that. I just don't think that's going to happen.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
But it may be other

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
maybe Xbox devices whenever

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
that come you know whatever the next

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Xbox system and stuff.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
I just don't think that like you know

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Xbox games on the switch

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
is going to be a thing. Maybe

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
though on Android and

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
the other thing could be like on

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
TV. So like you can get like an app

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
or something that runs on like

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
your Android TV

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
or Roku or something like that.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
And

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
you can get games through that.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
I can't even look at you

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
without thinking about the broccoli farm.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
But game pass

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
yes game pass

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
this makes sense for Microsoft

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
to bring this everywhere. It's just a

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
matter of time before they put it on the computer.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
It's already it's kind of already be there

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
right. I haven't really explored that at Windows 10. But you would think

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
like you can purchase it on

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Windows 10. But I don't know if there's

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
anything there's got to be a client inbound

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
for Windows soon. There's just got to be like

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
it makes sense for them to it's

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
basically their answer to Netflix. It really is

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Netflix we know makes oodles and oodles of money

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
and it makes so much money that they're able

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
to spend that money on making new shows

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
like Sabrina and

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Queer Eye I was just watching

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
the other night and God Netflix makes

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
so many fucking shows now and they're

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
doing it all from subscription dollars.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
They're watching Adam Maroon's Everything.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Although I don't think that was a Netflix original show.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
But that show is awesome.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Anyway

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
let's move on to a console

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
that probably won't have game pass but

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
boy this sounds

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
like a fucking mess and

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
believe it or not it's something that Soulja Boy

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
has a hand in. Soulja Boy

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Soulja Boy

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
is making a new console

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
called the Soulja Game Console

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
and handheld. Well let's

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
just be honest here he's not making shit.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
He's just lending his name to it.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Probably more like.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
But anyway the handheld is going to play

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Switch, 3DS, Vita, Neo Geo, GBC

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Game Boy, GBA games. 3,000

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
of them built in.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Well that doesn't sound like a lawsuit waiting to happen.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Anbernic

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
is the developer of this

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Soulja Watch console

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
or whatever it is. Anyway

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
it's a Chinese retailer that puts a lot of

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
this together and I guess these

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
consoles are retro mini video

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
game consoles and yeah

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
basically it's going to be just

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
an emulator box and

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
lord knows what kind of games

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
are on this thing that are of

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
questionable legalities.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Yeah so anyway.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Which I like how they had like

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
you know Tumor, Lara Croft

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
and like Tekken characters

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
and shit advertising this and like

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
they're asking for trouble.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
You know what's funny is if you want to buy the console

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
and the handheld together it's

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
$199 but if you

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
want to just get the direct version without the

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Soulja Boy stuff on it $105.99.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Right.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
It's just it's a quick

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
cash in is all it is. It really is.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
It really is. They're just taking the broccoli

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
and running. Uh Dark Sakura

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
what do you have for us?

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Uh broccoli. No I'm

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
kidding. I have

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Nintendo news kind of.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Build-A-Bear is

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
working with Nintendo to have

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
a few plushies in their shop.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
One of them

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
is two different colors of Yoshi.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
One of them

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
is a Bowser and the other one is

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
a bear that gets Mario outfits

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
and there's also

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
a piranha plant.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Um it is a

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
stuffed piranha plant for $10.50

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
and a kind of freaking want one.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Um

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
but there's also it looks like there's like little

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
you know accessories you can get like

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
a Yoshi coin wrist accessory

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
and just all kinds of cute stuff

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
um even the Bowser for

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
as mean as he as he looks he looks really

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
adorable. And of course there's the Mario

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
and Luigi outfits. Um

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
I'm actually going to their collection page

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
just to have a look at it.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
And um so let's

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
see what else we've got on here. Ugh

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
stop it. I hate whether

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
you went without cookies.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Bitch I might.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Um but there's also like a little

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Yoshi hoodie and a Princess Peach

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
dress. And

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
uh you

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
can get like Bowser five and one

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
sounds and you can get the Super Mario

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Brothers theme song. So it's

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
kind of cute you know.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I would actually get just the Yoshi

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
hoodie for one of my ball

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
jointed dolls. But yeah

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
pretty cute.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Yeah I

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
I wouldn't mind getting some of this stuff

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
from the Build-A-Bear stuff. I think it would be really

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
cute. So um

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I did do uh like a Pikachu

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
one once. It was super cute.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
So. Remember the one that

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
um we got for Allen? Mhm.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
We got him a

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
a cat. It was the Hello Kitty Ursula.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Yeah Ursula. Yeah we still have that.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Hello Ursula.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Yeah it's great.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Alright uh let's just do

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
a couple more stories Loki. And then we're gonna open up the

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio all one word

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
on Skype. But I'm gonna

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
warn you guys if we don't get a lot of calls tonight we're just gonna

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
end the show cause it's already almost nine o'clock so

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
we've been running along tonight. So Loki. So apparently

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Steam is kind of walking back

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
this whole allowing sex games

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
on their platform. Mainly

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
they're cracking down on

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
some of these games that depict

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
um girls

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
that might look a little young.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
How has the Steam. How long has the

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Steam store been open? Like how

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
how are we just now having this

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
conversation about you know maybe

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
sex games

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
featuring characters that are insinuated to be

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
minors could possibly

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
be a bad. I mean come on.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
It's 2018. Why are we talking about this now?

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Steam

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
you are a mess. So apparently

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
yeah there was um one of the

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
publishers affected by this was a game

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Hello Goodbye and they

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
have games

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Cross Love Hello or yeah

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Cross Love Hello Goodbye and

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Emotionalist. I guess

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
we're for a couple of the games that were

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
in question. The

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
publisher of Hello Goodbye they said that

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
the Steam version

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
had to be censored

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
and could not have adult content.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
But the other

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
I don't know the other ones

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I'm not sure what they're going to be doing there but

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
apparently it says um

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
you know these scenes aren't

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
there to be artificially

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
shoehorned in. It says that while they

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
do exist further proof of

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
the characters ages

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
beyond the disclaimer in the beginning

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
explicitly states that they're um

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
them being 18. So the real reason

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
they're there is to further

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
many a times the themes of the

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
story. So what they're trying to

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
say is basically that you know

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
they're pushing a story narrative

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
but I don't know

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
I guess it's just a style you know this

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
lowly style

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
that's in the game. I don't know whatever

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
it's going to either be on the platform or it's

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
not going to be on the platform and

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
there's other platforms that can host those

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
type of games.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Alright uh but you really

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
shouldn't support those games

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
that are you know

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
gross. Like that's just

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
like some things are just don't need to

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
be existing and

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
games that have young young girls

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
like that no just no all the no.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Alright uh anyhow

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
ending on a very serious note tonight this is

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
this is sad and yes it does relate to Orange

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Lounge Radio watch this. Pete Shelley

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
which Jason did reference

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
in the intro so I'm finally getting around to what

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
he talked about there in the intro but Pete Shelley

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
who was the leader of the punk rock

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
band the Buzzcocks died

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
this week at the age of 63.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
So um he passed this week and I know

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
he's been very influential but did

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
you know a club mix

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
of one of his songs was once in

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
DDR?

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
What?

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Well

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Are you telling me it's a cover?

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
No it's

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
it is

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
it is a sample of his voice

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
based on the song that he obviously did

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
so if you remember

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
the song Telephone Operator from

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
DDR that was Pete Shelley

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
who was the voice in that song

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
unfortunately he passed away this week at

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
63 so rest in

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
peace.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
That is it for this

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at least the

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
scripted news the part we knew we were going to talk

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
about now we're going to open up the skype

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000

about tonight maybe you want to talk about

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
some of the news

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
we've talked about maybe you want to share a broccoli

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
lighting up already so let's get to it

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Hi you're on Broccoli Lounge Radio who's this?

Rama. Hey Rama how you doing?

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
I'm good how is everybody else

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
out there? I'm dead

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
tonight basically this show has

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
literally ended me like I'm actually kind of glad

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
it's getting out of my system tonight so I can be

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
a professional next week.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Hold on

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
you said professional I got to mute myself for one

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
second I'm sorry. Fuck all the

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
way off. Oh

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
baby.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
I'm a professional alright well what's

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
on your mind tonight besides making fun of me?

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
You mentioned two buck

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
chuck that's not professional

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
you know it's like four buck chuck now

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
you

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
you are the Blanche Gemero

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
of OLR okay? You can still get the tamponio

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
from Trader Joe's that I like for three bucks

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
oh so it's three buck chuck alright anyway

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
oh good

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
lord people okay look

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
this Playstation class thing had

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
me rolling the fact that you can

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
plug in a keyboard and hit

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
escape and you get these

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
I'm just laughing

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
about all of that I'm just

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
wow. We knew it was gonna

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
happen we just didn't think it would be so easy

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
the keyboard they probably tested like a

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Sony keyboard that they probably tested in

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
house probably didn't work

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
and in house

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
in their QA department they probably just have a bunch of

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Sony keyboards it's just probably have

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
it's probably however they

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
decided to the device ID

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
however they're filtering that for

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
some reason it's not catching everything and so

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
it's catching or allowing certain

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
things to work on it

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
that's exactly what I was thinking

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
so Loki nailed that right on the head

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
but

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
it's kind of interesting that this comes up in

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
topic because I decided to break out my

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
SNES classic and actually

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
pack it and put some custom ROMs on there

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
and when I was

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
getting my stuff together I forgot

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
a friend of mine gave me a Raspberry Pi 3

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
so I think in the next few

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
couple of weeks I will be putting together my own

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Playstation classic

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
and the thing is I'm just doing it because

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
I can do it you know

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
and

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
it's interesting

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
that

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Jamie mentioned Wanderer Some Ease

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
because that was one of the games I

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
wrote my SNES classic and I remember playing

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
the hell out of that game

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
it was a good game

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
there's some good underappreciated classics

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
I'm really surprised we haven't already

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
heard Nintendo start talking about

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
a classic NES 2

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
or something along those lines but maybe

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
that's something that's going to be next year I don't know

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
also they probably have the Switch Online

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
thing they're kind of looking at right now

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
because December's games are going to be out

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
this week I think is when the December

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
games hit which Ninja Gaiden

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
I know is one of them that's a pretty big deal

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
I don't remember all of them but I know Ninja Gaiden

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
was the one that really caught my eye

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
but after this month we don't know what

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
they have on deck for January, February, March

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
so it's going to be interesting to see how that continues to

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
grow out

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
well I don't have the Switch

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
just yet I know Mako-chan

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
she has a Switch I was there

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
when she bought it so you know she'll probably jump on

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
that right there

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
oh thank you Ninja Gaiden, Wario's

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Woods and Adventures of Lolo

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
we're looking at Broccoli 3 nice try

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Adventures of Lolo are the games

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
that are coming out that's right Lolo I love the soundtrack

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
to Lolo it's such a cute little soundtrack

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
I don't know I enjoyed the

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
soundtrack more to Adventure

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Island you know I love Adventure

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Island I wish they would put that game out you know Adventure

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Island is just

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
what did they call Adventure Island

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
when it was on Turbo Graphics

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
when it was an original Hudson game

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
oh no they did get it as Adventure Island

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
on Turbo Graphics though I know

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
it was based on another series

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
was it Monster Boy?

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
I think it was Monster Boy

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Wonder Boy

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
I think I know what you're talking about

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
I know on Turbo Graphics it was called New Adventure Island

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
there was a spinoff of these games

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
on Sega and I had one of them

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
I think it was called Revenge of

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Drankon or something like that

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
it basically was part of the whole Adventure Island

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
family but it was just like a

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
offshoot of it and I used to play that

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
all the time on my Game Gear

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
I loved Adventure Island on the

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Nintendo I remember that was one of the early Nintendo

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
games I played and had that cute little

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
and like one of the power-ups was randomly

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
like a skateboard

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
maybe someone from Konami

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
is listening maybe we'll get a new

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Adventure Island for our next gen console

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
oh honey if anybody from Konami was listening

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
they unsubscribed a long time ago

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
sorry to say

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
I don't know

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
Twitch may give us a second chance

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
a lot of that though because I think

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
there's definitely going to be a lot of people that are like

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
that shit's still on

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
that's

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
that's usually the reaction I get

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
when somebody's like oh yeah I remember

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
O.L.R. I'm like actually we're still doing it

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
that shit's still going?

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
I just

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
realize you know

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
going through my archives I've been doing my podcast

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
I've been doing my podcast for ten years

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
I'm just like wait

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
how do we do ten years

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
and not do a ten year show

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
I'm like did we do it or did I

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
actually forget you know

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
I'm just like wow

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
I distinctly remember

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
the early shows

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
I remember that house we were in

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
I remember having the people over

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
I remember how they were all like big parties basically

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
I remember some of the subsequent shows

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
but I just I feel like I'm like

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
all of that was across a scope of

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
sixteen years

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Jesus

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
and like then I have to sit here and think about

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
okay we call this studio

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
N7 because it's the

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
seventh studio

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
and the first was that house

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
I was renting a room in where my

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
roommate was like totally cool with us doing the show

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
the second was

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
oh it was when I lived with you

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
then the third

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
was

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
that when I was at that other house

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
and then we were doing it at Dark

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Socrates for a bit

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
oh there was the apartment with Extrofer

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
that was the studio

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
see I can't even remember

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
World of Warcraft

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
oh that too yes

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
oh my god he was so good at Devil's Crush

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
you know what he's really good at now actually

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
I know we haven't had Extrofer on the show in a long time

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
you know what he's moved on to

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
he actually moved back east

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
that's one of the reasons we don't really get to hear from him a lot anymore

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
is all about Tetris Effect

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
he had like a top 100 score

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
at one point yeah he's really into it

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
so

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
that's pretty impressive

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
yep

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
well Rama anything else on your mind before we wrap up tonight

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
yes

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
in response to bringing

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Romper Room to Twitch

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
yes I can't see you

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
as Miss Molly I just

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
can't no

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
but I can't see you

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
as Miss Frizzle driving all of us in a

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
magic school bus okay

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
that I that that that

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
that do that

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
I can see that easily hands

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
down

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
I'm fucking excited yes

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
let me answer a question

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
is this related to the call Act Broccoli wants

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
they're all fucking changing their names to Broccoli

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
in chat Act Broccoli wants to know

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
what number was the studio when you started broadcasting

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
on Justin TV that would have been

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
number 4 because that was before

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
your house right Dark Sakura

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
and then there was the house

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
that was the one that was in Rancho

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
so that was 4 because then it was your house after that

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
then it was my apartment

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
and then it was here yeah because we were moving

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
out of the house right so we moved

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
to the apartment because we didn't have a studio

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
space at the rental

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
right so it was number 4

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
yeah yeah

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
that would have been after the Exeter

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
apartment yes

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
I miss Jeremy

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
there you go alright

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Rama I'm gonna let you go buddy okay

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
one more thing I promise you

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
this whole thing about

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
not having to be forced to wear pants

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
during Twitch I feel you on that

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
believe you me I feel

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
you on that to be fair

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
because one of the things

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
that makes OLR unique is that we are

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
in the same room when we do this all

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
out of respect for Loki and Jamie

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
I do wear pants when we do

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
the show but I have been known to

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
wear like gym shorts

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
pajama bottoms a hoop skirt

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
a Snuggie

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
a Snuggie definitely have done

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
shows in a Snuggie did you see that they've actually

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
revitalized the concept of the Snuggie but

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
as like a big cloak

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
it's like a big Sherpa

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
lined like a blanket

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
like a cloak with a hood

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
with a hood awesome

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
but to be fair I might have thought about it

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
I'm not gonna promise that Snuggies are gonna go away

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
dude if you

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
if you start wearing Snuggies I know the rest

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
of my staff will on the benefits

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
side I have like 60 different

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
geek shirts I will be sitting here wearing

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
a different shirt every

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
week

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
tigerclaw on chat says do you also wear a tank top

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
oh no I don't have a body for a tank top

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
um right now I have a

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
RuPaul what you can

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
wear whatever you want I don't want

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
to wear a tank top until I got guns

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
um but right now um I have

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
a RuPaul shirt on maybe I'll wear it next week

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
too it says step your pussy up

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
okay

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
okay so just so you have an idea of the

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
wardrobe I'm gonna be bringing to OLR

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
okay okay alright alright

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
I know I said last thing and I'm getting out of here

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
but what can I say I just

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
I bring the comedy and I bring the pain

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
to the show um

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
in response to the whole soldier console

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
uh huh you can find

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
AliExpress for 75

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
dollars oh yeah no that came up right at the end

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
there I don't know if you heard of it yeah

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
a bunch of people went digging for it

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
I'm just laughing I'm just like

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
who wants to buy that garbage

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
nobody's gonna buy that garbage

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
also by the way the retro core who does

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
battle of the ports also

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
does reviews of those knockoff multi

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
cart systems and

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
his reviews are actually pretty honest and show them

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
running like not emulated

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
he'll do some of them through um

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
a capture but he'll also show them on

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
the tv and on the screen

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
and what they actually look like and take them apart

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
I'd say before anyone buys any of the knockoffs

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
like that check out Retro Core's

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000

a VR music video

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
for Kingdom Hearts that probably

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
means it's uh that Utada song that's all

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
there's that um

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
there is a game called I guess

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
Satisfactory which

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
was it's okay it was on steam

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
um and it got delisted

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
so now it's gonna become exclusive to

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
the epic game store I guess wow why did

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
it get delisted though uh

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
um I don't know

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
hmm

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
I'd be curious about that I mean did it break a rule

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
what happened

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
um

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
yeah I don't

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
know maybe he they just delisted

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
too I don't know

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
no we'll see maybe a deal

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
they they worked on with them

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
well we're gonna wrap up here in studio thank you guys

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
so much for tuning into another week of Orange Lounge

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Radio uh we'll be back to do it all again

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
uh in seven days although

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
it may have a fresh coat of paint but

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
uh we're really excited about that thank you guys who

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
stuck with us over the years through the

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
thick and thin and all the broccoli uh if

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio I'm gonna tell you

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
the same thing uh tell a friend or two

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
about the show help us spread the word because we are the show

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
where every gamer has a voice but we can only put

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
those voices out there if they're actually you know here

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
in the studio to be able to air um

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
bear with us there's gonna be some changes

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
ahead and I know a lot of people don't like

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
change but I think in the long run even

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
though the first couple shows might be rough

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
um I think it's gonna be a change is inevitable I think it's gonna be

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
a great thing I really do I'm really excited

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
to welcoming more people to OLR

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
uh doing some more things with visibility

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
uh and just it kinda

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
and I responded to a tweet about this

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
today um you know was

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
kinda like it's a new era it's a really big change

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
for OLR but you know what we've been here before

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
uh at one point uh

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
we were doing a three hour show about nothing but

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
DDR and music games and at some

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
point we actually had to say you know what

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
that that isn't really working for us anymore let's

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
just discuss all games like we're doing on

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
our podcast uh that

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
has uh gone on and uh

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
you know that was a big change or you know

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
speaking of when I used the phrase all games

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
when we left our live 365

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
network to join the all games network and

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
then when we made that change in the all games network

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
to come here to to VOG those were all

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
big changes too and you know those were all very important

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
eras of the show that made this show

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
what it is but it was a change and anyway

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
my point is with all those changes

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
um it helps things not get stale

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
and so not to say that like I'm feeling

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
stale around here cause especially after tonight

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
I mean you know it was a funny fuckin

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
show and we had some good moments but

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
you know I think I think that type of stuff like

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
really just kinda motivates you to keep going and so

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
when someone asks me in the

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
future OL that shit

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
still going OLR it's still going

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
I can say yeah and it's

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
even better than you remember

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
so thank you guys uh so

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
much for supporting us uh over the years

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
I really appreciate it and we will see

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000

me if we're right back here on Shoutcast in a week

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
I know I've done a lot of hype but technical issues

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
we're gonna be doing a lot of changes

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
so I have to make sure the technical issues are 100%

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
cause I'm not doing a show

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
we're gonna give you 100%

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
um that's it final thoughts time

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Carl

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
things okay

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
I eat hands and I kill

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
people sorry

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
I'm thinking of uh llamas

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
llamas with hats

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
uh my final

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
thought tonight is um

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
look to the sky yes it is

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
uh Loki your final thought tonight

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
I don't know I wanted to do

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
another llamas with hats reference but

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
sadly I am a bit rusty when it comes with

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
llamas with hats

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
just remember there was

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
I have a craving

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
that only hands will satisfy

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
I don't remember exactly

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
I don't know

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
go watch the whole series it's awesome

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
which by the way

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
isn't there supposed to be another

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Charlie the Unicorn thing that they're working on

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
oh my god that would be great like a movie

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
shine the disbeliever there's a movie I know there's

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
a movie coming cause there was a kickstarter for it

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
oh god I would love that

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
you know I used to have get this

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
last time I actually went to Alabama

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
my luggage got lost and

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
and I went to a thrift store in Alabama

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
and there was a Charlie the Unicorn shirt

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000

I used to have a candy mountain shirt too but it

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
but if someone finds the Charlie the Unicorn shirt

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000

shit and if it's a women's

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
