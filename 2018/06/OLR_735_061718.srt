00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,960
This week, spice your morning bread up with the Sonic the Hedgehog imprint for the low

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,800
cost of 35 rings, and yes dear listeners, that is an accurate statement, $35 coin rings.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,520
This is just one consumerism-tastic story, happy 16th anniversary to the show where every

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,520
gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,160
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,220
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,800
It's Orange Lounge Radio with this, episode number 735 for this June the 17th of 2018.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm laughing because I usually listen to Jason's intro, but I didn't listen to the whole thing,

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,760
so I didn't catch that Gotta Toast Fast till just now.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,720
Anyway, we're full of surprises tonight, on our 16th anniversary show, my name Rob Roberts

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,120
here in studio with you, based out of lovely Sacramento, California, and by my side, as

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,680
she has been for the last 16 years, we kind of made a child together in a non-awkward

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
way.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
It's DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,120
I feel very awkward actually.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
How are you?

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,600
A little tired because of the food-stravaganza today.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,560
Well, I was going to say, something that's less awkward than having a baby together is

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,480
the fact that we had brunch together, and the fact that I literally had cake for breakfast

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
at this place.

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
You did.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
It was pretty amazing.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,960
We went to this trendy place downtown, this new place called Punch Bowl Social, which

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,400
I have no idea where that name comes from.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,120
Well, I keep wanting to say Punch Drunk Social because of that movie, but it's Punch Bowl

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,280
Social, and I guess they have these in other towns, but Sacramento has one now, and it's

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
kind of like Dave & Buster's.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
But not as cool.

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
But not yet.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Well, because the arcade isn't nearly as big.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,920
The bowling alley in the middle of the thing is way too loud.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Yeah.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,000
The bowling alley, they have all these other weird shuffleboard, like, ew, come on down

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
to play shuffleboard.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Like, who plays shuffleboard?

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who knows?

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But anyway, so we went there.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's from another time, Rob.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,120
But I had this, it was called Monkey Bread French Toast.

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
It looked like a big slice of cake.

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
It was a big slice of cake, and I was like, it was amazing, though.

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Don't get me wrong.

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
It was pretty good.

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,520
On the outside, it was kind of crunchy-ish, and then the inside was bread pudding, really

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,800
nice soft bread pudding, which Rob was kind enough to let me sample both parts, the outside

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,080
and a little bite on the end, but I just had an impossible burger that I ate a third

47
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
of.

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,120
It wouldn't be an episode of OLR if we didn't deviate to talk about food, right?

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Because food is amazing.

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,960
And then we went to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Company, but we were like, oh, oh, oh, chocolate.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,760
That's the best time to go shopping for candy, is when you're already full.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,720
Although I did buy candy somewhere else.

53
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,360
I know, I know.

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Candy is irresistible.

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
What can we do?

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,920
Anyway, let's move on and talk over to Techmaster Loki.

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Hi, Loki.

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
How are you?

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Doing good.

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Good.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
What's on your mind?

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Not much.

63
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
My mouth's on fire.

64
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Yeah, because you're also eating all this food talk.

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Salsa.

66
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Yes.

67
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Yes.

68
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Happy 16th.

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
You also, I mean, I don't know how you parent with three parents.

70
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,720
Well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't say that.

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,000
That's totally, in 2018, you have all sorts of different households, and some households

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
have three parents, but this is a three-parent household with OLR.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,260
So I mean, this show existed long before your kids were born, your actual kids.

74
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260
So kind of crazy.

75
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,260
It's true.

76
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,260
Yeah.

77
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,260
But OLR is your favorite child, right?

78
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,260
Yes.

79
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,260
Yes.

80
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,260
Okay.

81
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,260
Just getting that clear.

82
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
Just getting that clear.

83
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,980
And of course, we wouldn't be able to do it without you guys in our chat room over at

84
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,220
live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network, as seen on Variety

85
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
this week.

86
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,260
I don't know if y'all heard about the Bobby Black Wolf doing the Billy Mitchell panel

87
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,980
thing, but that was covered by Variety this week.

88
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,980
So check that out.

89
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,700
So hello to anybody who may have heard of VOG thanks to Variety and the involvement

90
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
with that.

91
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
All zero of you.

92
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
You never know.

93
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,180
You never know.

94
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,340
Anyway, we do tape live, of course, at the Voice of Geeks Network every Sunday night

95
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,820
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after world famous moderator, Bobby

96
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,500
Black Wolf and his show, The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

97
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,160
As we, I mean, God, we, Bobby and our show have gone together, not all 16 years, but

98
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,940
at least, at least 10.

99
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,200
Probably I don't remember the actual date.

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,100
Bobby probably remembers it better than I do, but let's see.

101
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,340
Live 365 as a network was about three years.

102
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,500
And then I think maybe four years we were on all games, but we were syndicated on all

103
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,140
games before our show moved there.

104
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
He said 2006.

105
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
It was 2006.

106
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
So it was 12 years.

107
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,140
All right.

108
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
It was when we joined.

109
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,140
So it was 12 years.

110
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
I knew he'd know.

111
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,380
For me, you get to a certain point where everything just kind of blends together.

112
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,380
That's for sure.

113
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,440
Well, also joining us in studio tonight, we have a special guest and somebody who's been

114
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,980
here since really the very beginning and was with us those nights at Roseville Golf Land

115
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,980
playing DDR.

116
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,020
And here he is 16 years later.

117
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,740
Say hello, everybody, to Bradley or Arcadian42.

118
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
Hello.

119
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Happy anniversary.

120
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,740
Thank you.

121
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,120
I know I broke tradition a little bit by not playing that Para Para song at the beginning,

122
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,700
but I couldn't because, you know, anniversary from Para Para.

123
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,280
Usually we have to open up the show with that.

124
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,700
There's only so many years you can do that.

125
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
There's only so many years I can tolerate that song.

126
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,380
No, maybe I'll do it on break, but I wanted to mix it up a little bit for those that are

127
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,380
on the podcast feed.

128
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,020
I did Shut Up and Drive by Rihanna, which we usually don't play like, you know, major

129
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,740
label music before the show.

130
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
But it's our birthday.

131
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,380
We're gonna do something different.

132
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,100
And as Jamie pointed out, that song was the big Wreck-It Ralph song.

133
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,980
Remember, they had the was it Wreck-It Ralph 2?

134
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,980
No, it was the first one.

135
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,980
Yeah.

136
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,980
We're going on the track.

137
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,060
I was throwing up the peace sign.

138
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,260
Oh, I thought you were saying Wreck-It Ralph 2.

139
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,380
When you said my name, I was like, yo, V.

140
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,500
I thought you were saying Wreck-It Ralph 2.

141
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,100
And I was like, no, it was the first one, silly.

142
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
Anyway, it's not about you.

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
It's about Arcadian42.

144
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,920
But he's used to these tangents by now.

145
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
How have you been, my friend?

146
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
I've been OK.

147
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Yeah?

148
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Do you still play music games anymore?

149
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Sometimes.

150
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Yeah?

151
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
What kind of music games do you still kind of get?

152
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
I rez sometimes.

153
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
It's been a while.

154
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
I rez like that.

155
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Yeah.

156
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Last one.

157
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,960
And it's been a while, like four years since I played like any rock band.

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,880
Like probably the last thing, the actual music game would have been like retrograde, which

159
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,360
you can use a guitar with.

160
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,080
Oh, right, right.

161
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,280
And I was going to say, with the whole rock band, I feel like with four, you know, they

162
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,200
kind of recovered when they did the behind the music parody thing a year later.

163
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,440
But it feels like a lot less people were really into that.

164
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,600
And sadly, I really think those plastic guitar games are kind of dead now.

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,040
I feel like music games now are showing up in VR.

166
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,360
You know, when we were at this restaurant, I was mentioning earlier, they do VR, too.

167
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,260
You can like rent a VR station for 30 minutes or an hour.

168
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,920
So we were walking by and somebody was playing Audio Shield, which I was like, oh, I've played

169
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
that.

170
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Bobby Block will show me that.

171
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
I know that game.

172
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Like, I don't remember a lot, but I remember that game.

173
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,880
And then so that game is really popular on VR, I think.

174
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
And then Beat Saber.

175
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
I don't know if you've seen that one.

176
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,160
That one's incredible.

177
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,320
And that's all today.

178
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,320
But yeah, I haven't done it in the last actually the last game I played that was a music game

179
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
was Dumper.

180
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Oh, yeah.

181
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Like six months ago, though.

182
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,880
That's a really good time.

183
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
It's really hard, though.

184
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
It is.

185
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,520
I have a hard time getting past like the second world.

186
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,920
It's really the turns, because those timing on the turns are really hard.

187
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,240
And some of the other stuff is kind of weird, too.

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,200
You don't have a lot of reaction time in those games.

189
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
That's for sure.

190
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,780
And another newer music game that we've been talking about here on the show, you might

191
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,280
be into this, the Just Shapes and Beats.

192
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
I don't know if you've seen that.

193
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,580
It's kind of like Bullet Hell meets music game.

194
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,580
It's pretty cool.

195
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,360
Check that out if you get a chance at some point.

196
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,540
I don't know if you've been watching the E3 stuff, but since you liked Rez, did you

197
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,360
see the Tetris Effect?

198
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,080
I saw the trailer.

199
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,000
I have not watched zero E3 stuff.

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,080
I watched the Game Boy for it.

201
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
They said that's the first song in the game in the trailer.

202
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Oh, the one that's in the trailer?

203
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Yeah.

204
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, it's probably the big signature song, just like, you know, the original Luminous

205
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,780
game, which that is another music game that's coming back because the remaster comes out

206
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,920
like in two weeks comes out on my birthday.

207
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,440
So but like, you know, Shinin was the big song from Luminous.

208
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,720
I think everybody knows that first stage in Rez, you know, what's the name of the Mexican

209
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Flyer?

210
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Is that the name of it?

211
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
From Space Channel 5?

212
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,760
Yeah, but it was older than Space Channel 5, of course.

213
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
I know, but that...

214
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Mexican Flyer, yeah.

215
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Right.

216
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,500
But that's, you can't think of Space Channel 5 and not think of that song.

217
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,720
So I think this is like, I think this is kind of like a trade of Mizuguchi's.

218
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,120
He tends to kind of put these big songs as the first stage in a lot of his stuff.

219
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,160
And so we're going to have that song that was in the trailer, the little trance vocal

220
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,860
thing, will be the first song in Tetris Effect.

221
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,960
So yeah, but the trailer was really cool.

222
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Yeah.

223
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,320
I remember like one person I saw on the forums saying it was like the most pretentious trailer

224
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
that they've ever seen.

225
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Really?

226
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
I don't know about that.

227
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
It was just, when I watched it, I made it maybe laugh a bunch.

228
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,560
Then I must be pretentious because I ate that trailer up.

229
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,920
That's just a matter of fact, for sure.

230
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
It's pretty cool though.

231
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
All right.

232
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Anyway, let's see.

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,420
Rama's pointing out that more music games are coming to mobile phones.

234
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
That's true.

235
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
You had a decent selection of mobile phones.

236
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,860
I like Neon FM and the whole like the synergy between the arcade and the mobile version

237
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
of that.

238
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,860
It's pretty fun.

239
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,360
What was I going to ask?

240
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,260
Oh, you said, Bradley, you're not really watching a whole lot of the E3 stuff.

241
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,920
I assume that's because you tend to play more like classic games, pinball.

242
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,880
Do you get excited about any of the new stuff anymore?

243
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,000
It's just, I don't have any of the new consoles.

244
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,520
Last console was Xbox 360.

245
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,680
I haven't gotten the PS4 or the Switch or the X-Tone.

246
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
Have you thought about investing in one of them?

247
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
I might get a Switch.

248
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,600
It's just, I might want to play the Zelda, but there's like a bunch of Zeldas I haven't

249
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
played.

250
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Gotcha.

251
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,280
I haven't played like a, whatever, I can't remember the name.

252
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,920
Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess and the Wii ones.

253
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I haven't played those.

254
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,240
I haven't even played the Moon one, whatever that one is, the 3A one.

255
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Oh God, Majora's Mask?

256
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Going that far back?

257
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Yeah.

258
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
That's okay.

259
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
You know what?

260
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
I barely touched Majora's Mask either.

261
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,000
You don't need to know the old Zelda games because they're all in different timelines

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
anyway.

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Pretty much.

264
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Just jump into the new one.

265
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,760
The new one's kind of, the new one doesn't really play like the old ones either.

266
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,280
That's another important thing about it.

267
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,720
The new one was very much influenced by open world things like Skyrim.

268
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,560
No, it doesn't play like Skyrim, but I think they kind of took that like hint of just instead

269
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,240
of like in the old school Zeldas, it was like, you have to go to level one and level two

270
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
and level three.

271
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
But then they kind of saw that like in speed running and so forth, people really like to

272
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,240
break that pattern.

273
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,660
People like to run through the game without a sword.

274
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,120
People like to do all these crazy things to it.

275
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,520
So I think Nintendo sort of, and the developers of that game sort of thought, what if the

276
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,840
game was just about do what you want?

277
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,300
You know, like maybe you don't have to get handheld to all these different things.

278
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
It's very open.

279
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,400
And in a way it's kind of jarring at first because you're like, where's my hand holding?

280
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,880
And the game kind of doesn't really give you much.

281
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,680
And not to be too spoilery, but it's been out for a year now.

282
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,260
The game starts you off in this little like area and I say little, but it feels really

283
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
big.

284
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,960
And so you go through like the tutorial in this area and you go to these different dungeons

285
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,280
and you're like, wow, this is a really like big area and so forth.

286
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,440
And then you find out you're on one tiny little like island in like this gigantic fucking

287
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
world map.

288
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,120
And it's like the world opens up and you're like, oh, this world is like really big.

289
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,560
So it's kind of neat the way they do it.

290
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
I really liked it.

291
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Yeah.

292
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Of course.

293
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
The big thing is just backlog.

294
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
I have so many games.

295
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
I never played like everything.

296
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,680
Everyone else, millions of steam games and yeah.

297
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,920
And she said like half of the games that are on my 3ds I haven't played yet.

298
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,380
So Bobby Blackwell is asking, what does he play today?

299
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,120
But I think, I think there's a lot of gamers like you out there.

300
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
Not everybody necessarily has that financial luxury or whatever the reason is to just jump

301
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,520
into the new generation until you know, a long time after the consoles have been out

302
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,800
and they come down to like $200.

303
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,000
I think there's a lot of gamers in your position.

304
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,040
So what, what do you play right now?

305
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Okay.

306
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,360
Right now I play mostly stuff on steam and 3ds generally.

307
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,920
The games I'm playing now are, so you're the reason they won't kill off the 3ds.

308
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,120
Maybe when I'm playing 3ds is I play like the Pokemon shuffle.

309
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,920
I play that game all the time for no good reason.

310
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,720
It's a time killer.

311
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Yeah.

312
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,600
The big one I've been playing the last two, by about two months is a game called Slay

313
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,920
the Spire, which is on the, it's on steam.

314
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,880
It's, it's still in early access, but it's pretty much complete.

315
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,760
They're just kind of tweaking various aspects of the actual, like maybe the card cause it's

316
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:34,040
a rogue-like deck builder game and you basically, you fight a group of enemies on each level

317
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,080
and at the end of the level you get like an, you can get another card or you might get

318
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,040
some, some other benefit and then you pick and choose kind of which way you go and you

319
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,120
kind of try to build towards beating the bosses because there's like three sort of like statements,

320
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,840
three, three areas and there's a boss at the end of it and you kind of, kind of got to

321
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,560
build your deck so that you can actually win and not, and not, and not die of course.

322
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,600
And there's, you have to kind of make different risks and rewards too.

323
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
So it's like one of those like PvE, like, like I've played, I played a tabletop game

324
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,800
like that was Sentinels of the Multiverse.

325
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Is that the name of it?

326
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,720
But there's like, there's a, there's a card game where you actually like, you play with

327
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,200
other people and you're actually, you're not fighting each other.

328
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,440
You're fighting like a different card boss in the middle that you're all kind of ganging

329
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,840
up on.

330
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,440
And it's like a deck building type of game.

331
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,600
Yeah.

332
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,360
Well, this is just a single player, but okay.

333
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,560
But I get it.

334
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,280
I get it.

335
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,160
All right, cool.

336
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,480
Yeah.

337
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:25,800
All right.

338
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,440
It's pretty fun.

339
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,480
As far as other stuff, we'll wait till our gaming weeks to get into other stuff, but

340
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,360
I do want to talk about other E3 going on because, you know, not only is it our 16th birthday

341
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,120
tonight, which by the way, I do need to, you know, even though we kind of stopped doing

342
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,760
big things for anniversary shows a long time ago, I do just want to say, you know, a big

343
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,400
thank you to everybody who's stuck with us.

344
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,040
You know, whether it be for 16 years, Bradley, or whether it be for 16 minutes, you know,

345
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,000
just a big thanks for the support that you guys give to OLR.

346
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,080
I know we're not the biggest gaming podcast out there by far by a lot.

347
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,960
We're not the biggest.

348
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
We're the best.

349
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,320
We're just the best.

350
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,520
No, we're best in the way that we can be best.

351
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,240
Just like other shows are the best in the way that they can be best.

352
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,120
We're 16.

353
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,200
We are teenagers with emotional issues and overconfidence.

354
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,560
Nothing can defeat us.

355
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,240
So you're being a stupid spoiled brat.

356
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,440
We're Wolverine.

357
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,720
We're the best we are at what we do.

358
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,480
Well, I try to still be humble whether I'm in my crazy 16 teenage years or not.

359
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,120
But, you know, we obviously wouldn't be here if you guys didn't give us the motivation

360
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,480
to be here by showing up, you know, and the fact that we weren't bored.

361
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,080
Whether you're not whether you're showing up in chat live on Sunday night or you're

362
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,760
showing up on the podcast feed and tweeting at us or I actually made a Facebook post today.

363
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,360
I'm trying because the last time I made a Facebook post, I did a Facebook post with

364
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,680
a bonus episode and somebody was like, oh, you're back on Facebook.

365
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,040
You remembered Facebook.

366
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,880
And I like, all right, guilt me.

367
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,760
Why don't you?

368
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,160
So I was like, all right, I need to remember that Facebook is the thing.

369
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,400
I think Google Plus, I can let that go.

370
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,120
But Facebook, I got to I got to try and interact with that more.

371
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,160
So I made a Facebook post today and you guys left some really sweet comments.

372
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,360
And they were like names I don't see in the email bag or in chat and stuff.

373
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,880
So I was like, oh, shit, there's more people out there than I realize sometimes.

374
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,000
So thank you so much.

375
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,520
I actually forgot to put the thing on my on my personal quote fan page.

376
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,120
But I while I may make the joke, yeah, we do this because we're bored.

377
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,520
But in a nutshell, I wouldn't know what to do with my Sunday.

378
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I rearrange my work schedule when I can for you guys.

379
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,440
I miss out on sleep for you guys.

380
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,640
I mean, not that it's a major thing.

381
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,280
I would do it.

382
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:46,600
But I was posting that there's two things, two activities that I do that give me life.

383
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,400
And I'm meaning this in the not in the give me life kind of way, but in the squad,

384
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,360
but in the way that makes me feel like parts of my life are great.

385
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,200
And that's what I should be doing.

386
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,880
And number one is the show.

387
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,800
Number two is being a novice sister of perpetual indulgence.

388
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,840
So those are two big things.

389
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,960
One of them is the what we do for you guys on the show.

390
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,920
And the other one is what I do for the LGBTQ, et cetera, community.

391
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,520
So those are two big things to me.

392
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,560
And if I wasn't doing this, I would feel like part of my heart was missing.

393
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,040
So now you made me all sappy.

394
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,960
I almost want to hug you.

395
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,460
Almost.

396
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,160
I will after the show.

397
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,720
No, I when you say like, what else would I do with Sunday night?

398
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,520
Like, that's totally how I feel.

399
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,560
Like, we're not going to be here next week because I'm going to be on vacation.

400
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,720
OK, that's the best present we can give ourselves for being on the air a year is to take a week off.

401
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,960
That and I make Rob bring me stuff.

402
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,160
But I'm going to Chicago to hang with some friends I have out there.

403
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,840
And as you all I've said on the show before, I'm turning 40 this month.

404
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,360
So it's kind of like and my husband is turning 40 like two weeks after I do.

405
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,520
So this is kind of like our big birthday trip, too.

406
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,240
So I'm heading Rob on the head from a distance.

407
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,760
This is one of those things where it's like, well, I know I'm fine with turning 40.

408
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,320
I really am.

409
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,840
Like, I know there's so many people out there that like, wow, 40 is like old.

410
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,640
But like, honestly, my 30s were better than my 20s.

411
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,480
Why won't my 40s be even better than my 30s?

412
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,040
That's my outlook.

413
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,680
Well, this is the thing, too, is that people say, oh, you don't look 40.

414
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,360
What is 40 fucking look like?

415
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,640
Am I supposed to be like middle aged man from Saturday Night Live?

416
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,280
No, you're not going to have a bad comb over and wear, you know,

417
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,320
polo shirts with your pants pulled up to your boot.

418
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,080
I might, though, you know.

419
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,400
But I'm saying, you know, 40, especially since people are living longer and taking

420
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,680
better care of themselves, 40 isn't middle age anymore.

421
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,200
I know so many people that are like having kids at 40.

422
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,560
You know, that ain't going to be me.

423
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
If that's what they choose to do, everybody does.

424
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,040
But, you know, like I remember when like people would have.

425
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,520
Well, I would because the generation I was born out of, people were having kids at 21,

426
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,280
22, and people still do that.

427
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,240
People still do it.

428
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,520
But I was there's a lot more that are like my mom was 17.

429
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,320
It was the 70s.

430
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,040
They had drugs.

431
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,120
And it's it's and it's well documented on MTV shows that that still happens.

432
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
But I'm just saying more and more people are like waiting.

433
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,680
You know what I mean?

434
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,080
Anyway, not to get Dungeon Buster says level 40 unlocks new perks and skill trees.

435
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,800
That is true.

436
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,680
It really is.

437
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,760
So anyway, what was I going to say?

438
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,120
I was saying something about going to Chicago.

439
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,280
So no, but Sunday night I'm going to be sitting there and the clock's going to hit six o'clock

440
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,160
and I'm going to be like, I should be doing well right now.

441
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,120
And I do I do I do this when I'm at fucking Dragon Con where I'm like out there promoting

442
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,480
Vogue and like kind of doing something very adjacent to this here.

443
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll sit there and go.

444
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,800
And if Bobby happens to be in the same room, I'll be like, Bobby, I should be listening

445
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,680
to your show right now.

446
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,040
You should be calling me right now.

447
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,680
We should be doing it.

448
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,000
And, you know, I think one year we even did a pretend live call in the same room.

449
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But, you know, that's a podcast.

450
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,200
I was sitting in a Jewish deli in West Hollywood looking at my kugel going, I'm supposed to

451
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,240
be doing all right now.

452
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,640
Oh, shit.

453
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,280
My phone's dead.

454
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,560
Looks like I'm going to the Apple store.

455
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:56,840
All right.

456
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,760
Anyway, Loki, I don't know if you have any any words you want to say about it before

457
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,280
we get into E3.

458
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,840
Nope.

459
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,480
OK.

460
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,760
He's a man of many words.

461
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, Loki, he's a man of a single taco.

462
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,320
You know, you you know this.

463
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,480
Originally, the plan was Jamie and I were going to start a show and you kind of showed

464
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,400
up and you you stayed there.

465
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,760
You showed up every single week for many, many, many weeks.

466
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,280
And it really got to a point and it is at a point where it's like, I could never imagine

467
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,720
not having this show without you on it.

468
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,440
You know what I mean?

469
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,600
And like your rants, which people don't always agree with.

470
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,920
But I think people you know, it's it's you provide a different perspective here on the

471
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,560
show.

472
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,880
I think it's really brought something to the table.

473
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,400
So, you know, I can't imagine or without you on it is basically what I'm saying.

474
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,080
I can't imagine it without me either.

475
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,800
I don't know if we would have made it this long without you.

476
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,000
So who knows?

477
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Just like we would have made it this long without her.

478
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,320
So anyway, let's get into and if I may say so, you guys have been with me through some

479
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:04,680
pretty big shit in my life through, you know, losing both of my grandmother's, my mom losing

480
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:11,880
her husband, my my wedding, you know, lots of like really crazy life.

481
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:18,840
It's kind of like how people use, you know, the Bible, I guess the B.C. or B.C.E. and

482
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,520
then C.E. or whatever.

483
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,240
Sure.

484
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,920
And for me, I kind of think of things in terms of aspects of my life.

485
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,560
Like I have my pre California, my post California, but I have my pre O.L.R., my post O.L.R.

486
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,280
because O.L.R. has been the majority of my life here in California.

487
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,080
And I think every major important thing that's happened to me in my life has been while doing

488
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,840
this show, I'm not like on the show, of course, you know, but major important things.

489
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,080
And even doing the show when I was probably at my lowest has always been a high point

490
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,560
for me.

491
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,360
So I hear that a thousand percent, because honestly, like last year and you guys know

492
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,240
this, especially last year, like you guys have been through some shit like when I was

493
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,800
really sick, when I was twenty nine, I was like really sick.

494
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,360
You know, the show was there and you guys were sending your well wishes.

495
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,120
But like honestly, and this is not a secret.

496
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,240
You all know this last year was like the worst year for me.

497
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,680
And I was not in a really good place with my mental health for several months.

498
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,400
And I'm hoping that didn't really come through on the show.

499
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,840
I mean, I'm sure you guys could probably figure it out with, you know, how many shows we were

500
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,000
kind of missing just everything that was going on and stuff.

501
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,160
But like, I have not had a worst year personally than last year.

502
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,920
And this show kind of like gave me a reason to get out of bed.

503
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,080
Like it's that big, you know, is just that whole like feeling of, but I got to do this

504
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,080
thing because I always do this thing and I'm not going to end it over this.

505
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,640
You know, it's why, like, even when I'm, you know, dirt sick and physically can't make

506
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,600
it to the show, I get on that Skype call to do my classic game or do what I can, you know,

507
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,440
unless I'm just completely out of town, you know.

508
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:50,940
Right.

509
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,880
But I mean, the show has seen both of us through health scares.

510
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,920
Absolutely.

511
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,640
And I know Loki had a lot of personal issues, too, with the show during the show.

512
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,840
So it's not just us.

513
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,080
Yeah, well, I meant all of us.

514
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,760
We've all that's life.

515
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,960
Let's throw shit at you.

516
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,240
All you can do is throw shit back like you're a orangutan.

517
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,520
And take it out on some video games.

518
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,200
I do have to give a shout out because I just noticed in chat this doesn't happen very often.

519
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,360
But the one and only DJ Morpheus joined chat, who you might know as Travis Donovan.

520
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,920
And I'm hoping he's here because he bought us a car for our 16th.

521
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,760
Did Pod Daddy get us a car?

522
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,920
He got us a Hot Wheel.

523
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,520
For the podcasters that don't know.

524
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,040
No, not a Hot Wheel.

525
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,440
For the podcast listeners that don't know, Travis Donovan did Understation Live,

526
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,800
which Jamie and I were both.

527
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,440
I was a host.

528
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,040
You were like the most frequent guest before we had OLR.

529
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,760
So, you know, I can say Travis-

530
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,040
I've even been a temporary host.

531
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,080
I've even said this on DragonCon panels, whether Travis-

532
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,120
He just flipped you off, by the way.

533
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,720
Whether Travis realizes it or not.

534
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,560
Travis Donovan showed me that any idiot can do this.

535
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,200
But he didn't get us a Hot Wheel.

536
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,880
He got us one of those overstocked fake diecast knockoffs from 99 Cent Store.

537
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
But it takes a special idiot to do it well.

538
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,200
That comes off so shady.

539
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,320
It's not supposed to be shady.

540
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,120
Travis knows.

541
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,040
Travis knows I love him and that's what-

542
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,000
As God as my witness, I am that fool.

543
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,520
All right.

544
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,800
Anyway, let's get into-

545
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,480
We got a lot of E3 news to get into.

546
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,160
It feels like E3 was like six weeks ago at this point.

547
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,000
Like a week moves fast.

548
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
But so we did our show last week.

549
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,680
We were talking about Microsoft.

550
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,120
Bethesda happened during the show.

551
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,320
We got to wrap that up.

552
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,160
But then we got to Monday, which brought us Sony, Ubisoft.

553
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,920
So, Loki, if you would kind of recap some of the highlights of these press conferences

554
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,040
and we'll talk about each one.

555
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,720
Okay.

556
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,800
So honestly, in my opinion, there wasn't a whole lot that happened.

557
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,960
I mean, it was kind of a disappointment a little bit,

558
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,160
but we'll get into that a little bit.

559
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,640
So let's talk about the first one that was of the day, Square Enix.

560
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,640
Which, they basically showed the same shit that was in the other Xbox conference and whatnot.

561
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,960
So they had trailers for Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy XIV.

562
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,440
They talked about the new expansion.

563
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,560
And there's going to be this Monster Hunter Worlds

564
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,920
Final Fantasy XIV crossover thing happening this summer.

565
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,480
They showed off the trailer again for Awesome Adventures of the Captain's Spirit.

566
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:34,280
Dragon Quest XI, Babylon's Fall, Nier Automata, Become as Gods,

567
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,000
which is the Xbox One definitive edition.

568
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,040
Octopath Traveler, they showed off another trailer for Just Cause 4.

569
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,520
A game called The Quiet Man, and of course, Kingdom Hearts III,

570
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,600
which they also reiterated again that the release date is going to be January 29th, 2019.

571
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,160
To bring back to your point, as you mentioned earlier before the show,

572
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,320
that's probably not supposed to come out before the show.

573
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,840
Yeah, I feel like Square Enix's show didn't really show us a whole lot.

574
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,440
And maybe that Kingdom Hearts release date was supposed to be the big announcement.

575
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,280
But then I think it was announced at a symphony in Japan or something, right?

576
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,800
That's where they first announced it.

577
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,640
And I think somebody didn't really figure out that once you say something

578
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,760
at a show like that, it will be all over the internet instantly.

579
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,280
So I'm not so sure that they were supposed to announce it a couple days early.

580
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,880
I don't think it's a big deal at the end of the day,

581
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,680
but I do feel like that was supposed to be the big thing.

582
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,160
And yes, some of you are like, but wait, they showed that trailer at Microsoft saying

583
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,360
they could have cut it short.

584
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,800
You know, they could have just cut off the end.

585
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,440
It would have been just as impactful.

586
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,600
But anyway, like Square Enix really just kind of showed us like a lot of, yes, we know.

587
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,160
I think it's more interesting with Square Enix didn't show.

588
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,160
Fam has seven remake still, still not around, not there, but okay.

589
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,200
They, you know, we probably kind of figured that we would get Kingdom Hearts three

590
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,840
or the seven remake, but not both.

591
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,520
So they're focusing on the Kingdom Hearts remake seven or Jesus Christ,

592
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,120
the Kingdom Hearts three, the seven remake will be next year probably.

593
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,600
And no Avengers, no Project Avengers.

594
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,200
That was very surprising.

595
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,360
No Final Fantasy anything except like a patch in 14, which, you know, I'm a 14 player.

596
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,040
I'm all about patches, but let's be real.

597
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,720
That's not really big Final Fantasy news.

598
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,080
Nothing about continuing adventures in 15, which I'm actually more than okay with.

599
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,200
Nothing on 16.

600
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,360
I thought this would be the year to say, yes, we're going to make Final Fantasy 16 and leave

601
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,600
it at that.

602
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,480
I think it's too early for that.

603
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,520
They're working on too much stuff.

604
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,480
All right, maybe next year.

605
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:29,880
I don't know.

606
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,680
Bobby does say the Final Fantasy 14 cross monster hunter thing.

607
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,880
Okay, cool.

608
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,920
But it's like, it's an event and not really like a whole, it's not even really DLC.

609
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,120
It's probably going to be in 14.

610
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,240
If you remember 14, Bobby, it's probably just going to be a bunch of fates.

611
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,800
And that's it.

612
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm going to skip the limited run games press conference because these are basically all

613
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,720
games that have been out that are just getting physical releases.

614
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,520
So there's not a whole lot of news there.

615
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,920
I mean, unless you're a collector and that sort of thing.

616
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,760
Ubisoft, they showed off, of course, predictably, Just Dance 2019.

617
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,760
They showed off a new trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2, which looks interesting.

618
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,800
They showed Jade.

619
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,600
And then there's this new thing that this kind of pissed off a lot of people.

620
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,760
This whole space monkey program, where basically they're teaming up with Hit Record,

621
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:33,000
Joseph Gordon Levitch company to crowdsource assets for the game.

622
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,360
So whether that be artwork modeling, you know, like 3D models,

623
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,040
music, level design, whatever you're supposed to be contributing to or you can contribute to that,

624
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,400
which is weird because that makes it seem like that game is really far off then.

625
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,800
And the concern was, well, people are getting they they want free artists basically.

626
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,920
They're paying them apparently, but I don't know how well they're paying them.

627
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,640
They claim they're paying them.

628
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,640
So that was kind of controversial.

629
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,920
Rainbow Six Siege, they talked a little bit about that.

630
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,280
They showed off a new trials game, Trials Rising,

631
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,120
which is going to be coming out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC and Switch in February.

632
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,960
The Division 2, they showed off a little bit of that.

633
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,520
They talked about the Mario and Rabbids Kingdom Battle DLC,

634
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,800
which is coming out later this month.

635
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Skull and Bones, they showed a new trailer for that.

636
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,760
It's coming out sometime in 2019.

637
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,760
A game called Transference, which is a game by Elijah Wood.

638
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,240
I mean, it's nice to know what Elijah Wood's doing these days.

639
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,800
Yeah, yeah.

640
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,240
There's a game that they showed off called Starlink Battle for Atlas,

641
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,400
which is kind of like a space shooter.

642
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,440
Think of like a twice to life version of Star Fox, No Man's Sky.

643
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,840
Yes.

644
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,360
And they also are including Star Fox in the game as well.

645
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,400
So you can like swap out parts of your ship in real time.

646
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,880
And I don't know, I'm just, I'm a little done with the Toys of Life stuff, honestly.

647
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,160
Yeah, I kind of thought we were past that too, but apparently, yeah.

648
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,440
Ubisoft doesn't like to take really strange risks.

649
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,000
I mean, remember they had that one year with laser tag vests and their, you know, health.

650
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,120
Oh God, I remember that year.

651
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,760
Yeah, yeah.

652
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,880
Now I was like, whoa, laser tag, I'm all down with that.

653
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,120
Uh, SGA 100 Matt in our chat at live.vognetware.com says,

654
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,480
I think Starlink is the closest thing we'll get to a Star Fox game for a while.

655
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,480
Um, possible.

656
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,160
It definitely was not at Nintendo's.

657
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
Well, Nintendo mentioned Starlink.

658
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,360
We just got a Star Fox game, what, last year?

659
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,720
I guess, but, or the Wii U one?

660
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:45,880
Yeah.

661
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,320
That was like two years ago, I think.

662
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,600
Because Switch was last year.

663
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,200
Well, they quit your whining.

664
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,400
Where's our F-Zero game?

665
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,800
Where's our racing game that, you know, is Toys Life stuff, you know?

666
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,300
The fuck?

667
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,820
You guys are complaining.

668
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,180
Oh, where's my Star Fox game?

669
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,580
I have it.

670
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,500
It's been two whole years.

671
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,620
Oh, wine.

672
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:09,100
Um, anyways, so for Honor, um, they showed off some new stuff that they have for that.

673
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,100
They have a new, um, I guess expansion for marching fires that has four new, new fighters.

674
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,740
Um, they also have this new castle siege mode.

675
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,500
Plus they gave out the game for free on Uplay.

676
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,940
I think that offers over though.

677
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,620
Um, the crew too, they showed that in the open betas starting this week.

678
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,860
And then Assassin's Creed Odyssey is of course, they finished with that and that's coming

679
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,220
out in October.

680
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,740
Which looked really interesting for an Assassin's Creed game, which I don't usually get into

681
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,140
those games.

682
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,580
Like I'm not trying to shade Assassin's Creed.

683
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,620
It's just, I don't have time to play everything, but I like the fact that they're giving all

684
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
these like branching story choices and stuff.

685
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,380
It looked like Mass Effect in a way.

686
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,820
I was like, oh, there's my new Mass Effect game, sorta, sorta.

687
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:55,100
And obviously, you know, the team took their lashes a few years ago with the whole, it's

688
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,300
too hard to render a woman and the things that they paid for with that.

689
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,500
Uh, so now right off the bat, they're like, you want to play as him or you want to play

690
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,000
as her.

691
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,460
And then as part of the story, it's like, you can just, it's, it's grease people.

692
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,900
You can romance anyone.

693
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,900
So kind of, kind of neat to see that direction that Ubisoft's going.

694
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,140
I'm, I'm curious about some of the like narrative stuff.

695
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,580
I'm not just fixated on the romance.

696
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,500
I like the fact that the story is kind of taking on that branching stuff.

697
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,460
I, I will be looking more into this and I don't usually get into Assassin's Creed games.

698
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,300
Um, no, then we'll get to the Sony conference.

699
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,660
So Sony didn't show off a whole lot of stuff.

700
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,980
They showed off some extended looks at different games.

701
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,820
So they started off with The Last of Us 2 after wasting a bunch of fucking time playing

702
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,700
music.

703
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:45,660
And then, um, you know, after that they talked about, they're supposed to be a new, um, like

704
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,100
I got a word, new game plus.

705
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,420
I just want to say real quick, that musician, as I understand it, is a really respected

706
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,180
musician for that instrument that he plays.

707
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,780
But that kind of, the unfortunate is that kind of stuff is I think really just lost

708
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,220
on an E3 audience.

709
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,660
It just is like, like I get what they're trying to do, but like you've got a finite amount

710
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:10,700
of time here to show off stuff and you're wasting how much of it of not only that, like

711
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,100
it's the exact same criticism we gave to Bethesda last week with their music.

712
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,100
And don't get me wrong, that's fine.

713
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,380
But then on top of it, they're like, oh, and we're moving venues.

714
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,820
Let's take 10 minutes to do that.

715
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,580
It's like, why, why were you doing that?

716
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,100
Yeah, I heard at the show there, it was, it was pretty messy.

717
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,740
Like people were like, why are we just standing in the back of this barn?

718
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,820
Like, are we going to have to stand here for two hours?

719
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,340
Like, heck no type of thing.

720
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,460
And then like, it was just, it sounded like it was really weird, but anyway, I'll let

721
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,100
you finish it.

722
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,300
I've got, I got some opinions on what Sony did, but I'll let you finish.

723
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,700
Then they show Call of Duty Black Ops 4.

724
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,940
All they do is talk about map packs.

725
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,060
So they've got this like thing.

726
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,260
If you preorder, you get some older maps and stuff.

727
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,580
Black Ops 3, though, is available for PlayStation Plus users.

728
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,220
So that's cool.

729
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,260
So I got in on that because I didn't have it yet.

730
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,460
And then they showed off or they talked while they were transitioning stages or whatever.

731
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,700
They are showing off some of the announcements that they did.

732
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:16,380
So they showed off the Tetris Effect, Days Gone, Twin Mirror, Ghost Giant and Beat Saber.

733
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,140
They should not have announced them on Twitter earlier in the week if they were going to

734
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,820
announce them during the show.

735
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,460
All they were doing is like, yeah, they took the wind out of their own sails.

736
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,180
So that move.

737
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,500
Yeah.

738
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,300
In my opinion, they showed off Destiny 2 Forsaken.

739
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,060
That's coming out September 4th.

740
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:38,140
The next big thing that they showed was Ghosts of Shusima.

741
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,500
And of course, with that, they also had a musical intro with that.

742
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,700
Gameplay looks fucking gorgeous, though.

743
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,740
So that's pretty awesome.

744
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,460
A game called Control.

745
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,780
That's going to be like it looks like Quantum Break.

746
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,460
That's coming out in 2019.

747
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,780
Resident Evil 2 is getting a full remake and that's coming out January 25th.

748
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,180
Trover saves the universe, which is the new Justin Roland game.

749
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,580
The greatest of Rick and Morty.

750
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,580
So that's going to be coming out soon, hopefully.

751
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
They showed off more Kingdom Hearts 3.

752
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,020
They talked about like the Pirates of the Caribbean thing.

753
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,020
And plus, there's a limited edition PS4 Pro

754
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,420
that's coming out with all of the Kingdom Hearts games.

755
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,020
Then they showed gameplay of Death Stranding.

756
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,220
And I still have no fucking clue what that game is about yet.

757
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,700
I mean, but it's neat, I guess.

758
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,460
No Man Stranding.

759
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,220
I have no idea what it's about, but it's a game.

760
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,420
Neo 2, they showed off more Spider-Man.

761
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,060
And then a game called The Scene, which is from From Software.

762
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,780
And it's a PlayStation VR game.

763
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,980
I don't even remember that.

764
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,740
But I think they showed that at the end.

765
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,020
That was like after that, because it was really ambiguous when their thing ended.

766
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,100
Because it was very clear they were trying to get people to stay

767
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,620
to watch more of their little like blended kind of like pre-show post-show thing

768
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,620
that they also kind of had in the middle of that while they were changing venues and so forth.

769
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,660
So it was really kind of weird when it ended.

770
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,060
But OK, here's the thing with Sony.

771
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,460
Like, I think Sony took a big risk with the way that they did their thing this year.

772
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,100
They warned us it was going to be different.

773
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,060
So I'm going to give them that.

774
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,700
They warned us.

775
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,100
They said, don't expect bombshell announcements this year.

776
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,940
We're going to focus on these four games.

777
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,300
They told us what games.

778
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:37,100
They set us up and they took a risk with this whole venue thing and the moving and all that

779
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,500
stuff.

780
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,900
So I applaud Sony for taking the risk.

781
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,300
That said, it was a miss for me.

782
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,020
Totally.

783
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,220
Like it didn't work.

784
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,500
It was a risk that failed.

785
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:51,500
I hope Sony learns that and kind of goes back to honestly, the type of press conference

786
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,260
that Microsoft kind of excelled in this year.

787
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,140
I don't like to grade.

788
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,060
I don't like to say one E3.

789
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,860
I like to look for positives and constructive criticism to everybody.

790
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:06,140
But the reality is the criticism I have for Sony this year is that Microsoft kind of was

791
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,420
more effective at your game.

792
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,620
Here's my issue, though.

793
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,100
Like, let's let's just talk about the games that they showed, though.

794
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,460
The first party games.

795
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,980
What's coming out this year?

796
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,900
None of their games are coming out this year.

797
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,260
The Spider-Man.

798
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,140
Spider-Man was okay.

799
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,460
Fine.

800
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,820
Spider-Man is coming out this year.

801
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,460
Yep.

802
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,180
But that's it.

803
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,140
I mean, that's September.

804
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,980
I mean, like, I don't disagree with you.

805
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:31,340
It's like Sony was kind of especially when we get into some of the things later in the

806
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:31,580
show.

807
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,820
And if you all been watching gaming news, you know what's coming.

808
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,940
Sony is sitting up on this throne right now, and they kind of feel like being up on this

809
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,740
throne.

810
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,260
They can do some stuff.

811
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,140
But you know what?

812
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,580
Microsoft making a lot of improvements.

813
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,940
I think things are going to really turn around for them when we get to at least to the next

814
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,740
realm of consoles.

815
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:56,460
The Switch, both Sony and Microsoft have kind of dismissed Nintendo as true competition

816
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,980
for a long time because they are kind of everybody's second place console.

817
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:06,780
But I think what Sony is allowing to happen by not really highlighting a lot of what's

818
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,740
happening this year.

819
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,420
And Microsoft gets some of this criticism, too, is that when it comes to the holiday

820
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,620
and systems that people are going to buy, I think the Switch is going to start to look

821
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,740
more and more attractive.

822
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,620
You just heard our guest Bradley say that he was thinking about getting a Switch if

823
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,780
he's going to jump into this new generation of consoles.

824
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,100
And I think that might be where a lot of people's minds are at.

825
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,700
So that was another reason I think Sony's conference was a miss for me.

826
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,940
And honestly, I'm going to be very real, and this is not going to be a popular opinion.

827
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,420
I'm sorry.

828
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,860
You're just going to have to deal with this particular gamer's opinion because it's the

829
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,300
show where every gamer has a voice.

830
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,780
I understand a lot of you are very excited about Last of Us 2 and the Samurai game.

831
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,500
And you'll notice I don't even remember the name of the Samurai game and these other games.

832
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,860
I don't really like...

833
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,180
I was like, that Samurai game is gorgeous.

834
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,300
It's pretty.

835
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,620
And then while I was watching, I was like, it's really not for me.

836
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,940
The Last of Us 2, I give Sony huge props, huge praise.

837
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:12,060
The fact that here we are in the year 2018 and a major game company, major game publisher

838
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:19,420
opens their press conference, essentially, with a well-executed, not a stunt, but a well-executed

839
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,860
same-sex kiss.

840
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,180
Like, Sony gets massive props from me from that.

841
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,060
I will give them that.

842
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,140
Sony fucking rocked that with the representation and everything.

843
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,300
But I have to say, honestly, as much as I really want to support that game, then it

844
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,060
got into what the game actually is.

845
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,380
And it was that whole scene with the disemboweling and all that stuff.

846
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,340
I was like, this is nasty.

847
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,140
I don't want to play an uber violent game like that.

848
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,260
That's just not the type of stuff I'm into really so much.

849
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,460
You know, when it's cartoony, it's fine.

850
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,740
I don't like Mortal Kombat.

851
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,060
The old Mortal Kombat games was cartoon shit like that.

852
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,100
It's fine.

853
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,340
But when it's like, when it's that, like, I was like, that's a little too real for me.

854
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,180
And y'all know I hate those Saw movies and stuff.

855
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,780
And so, like, I was watching all that going, this is like, am I turning into my mom?

856
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,660
I'm saying this is, this is gross.

857
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,780
I never played the first, I mean, I never played the first Last of Us.

858
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,700
And I'm just, it doesn't look interesting to me.

859
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,700
I'm not really into a huge amount of this, like, stealth action games.

860
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,180
I mean, it looks like a gorgeous game.

861
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,140
I'm sure it's great.

862
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,740
Not a game I want to pick up, though.

863
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,060
Yeah.

864
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,540
And same with, like, Spider-Man looks all right, but I never really pick up Spider-Man

865
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:26,780
games.

866
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,660
Me neither.

867
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,260
And so, like, I'm right there with you.

868
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,900
I'm like, wow, if I played these games, I'd play that.

869
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,020
But I just don't have enough time.

870
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,660
Exactly.

871
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,860
Or like, even like the Ghost of Shazima, I'm like, that looks fucking hard.

872
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,900
Well, not a game I probably can pick up.

873
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Here's the, I think, you know what this is leading to?

874
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,860
I think in some ways, Sony showed very strong diversity with what I just mentioned.

875
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,220
But ironically, they didn't show good diversity with the games they were showing at the show.

876
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,540
And I think that was their biggest weakness.

877
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,700
That's the whole problem with most of the entertainment industry anyway, is tokenism.

878
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,900
Well, I'm not even talking about the LGBT representation, all that stuff.

879
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,660
I'm talking about just the games were all cut from a similar cloth to me.

880
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,620
That's what I'm talking about.

881
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,380
They throw in the things that they think everyone wants as a token.

882
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:12,940
Right.

883
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:18,780
You know, yeah, we want to see more, you know, quilt bag characters.

884
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,180
Yeah, we want to see people of other ethnicities.

885
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:27,900
Yeah, we want more strong female leads, but they do the same kind of game over and fucking over.

886
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,180
Okay, I get what you're saying.

887
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:35,820
I still think, though, I cannot, I don't want to criticize Sony's big move for making L.

888
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,220
Ellie in a game of that caliber for spotlighting that.

889
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,620
Like, I really don't want to criticize that because it did,

890
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,700
you know, watching the intro, watching the scene was it really didn't feel token to me.

891
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:53,420
Like, it wasn't like, God, what's like, sometimes you play those Japanese anime titty games,

892
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,060
and there might be like, like, I don't even want to say Bayonetta because I think Bayonetta is

893
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,100
parody, but, you know, some of those games are sexy lesbians.

894
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,900
Yeah, like Galgun.

895
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,940
That's tokenism.

896
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,440
Okay.

897
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,900
But I didn't I didn't I wasn't I was more thinking like it's the throw a bone.

898
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,460
I just didn't really get that.

899
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,500
I mean, I'm not a lesbian, so maybe I or bi because technically it just shouldn't matter.

900
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,940
It should just be a natural part of the game.

901
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,420
I want ace characters, but I haven't had one yet except for one ever in Borderlands.

902
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,500
So but the diversity of the games themselves, I think, was was Sony's weakness.

903
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,660
And the fact that these other games like the Tetris effect and the other stuff was kind of

904
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,180
like, oh, and by the way, we announced this earlier this week, too, was kind of like,

905
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,540
well, give you should probably show that a little bit, too.

906
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,820
And then, OK, they gave a lot of time to Kingdom Hearts three, which is great.

907
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,820
That is the kind of game I'm signed up for.

908
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,180
Too bad I already saw it twice before Sony's thing.

909
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,860
So it felt really redundant at that point.

910
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,660
You know what I mean?

911
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,160
Yeah.

912
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,680
So and it was really weird to me how there was all this stuff missing from E3 completely.

913
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,960
Where was Soul Calibur six at anybody's show?

914
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,120
Where was Red Dead Redemption two?

915
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,760
I would have thought for sure that would have been a Sony thing.

916
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,120
Well, you have to also remember there's Gamescom in a few months, too.

917
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,760
Yes.

918
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,680
So it struck me as weird.

919
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,320
It was weird.

920
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,120
Where was dreams?

921
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,720
They had the transitions with dreams.

922
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,080
They didn't talk about that at all.

923
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,720
No, it was just it was weird.

924
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,560
Sony was just weird this year.

925
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,520
They took a risk.

926
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,400
I didn't like it.

927
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,920
I hope they don't do it again.

928
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,160
The only other thing I'm going to say Death Stranding.

929
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,280
All right.

930
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,000
It looks pretty, but I've officially had it with the teases for Death Stranding.

931
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,720
We're getting into No Man's Sky territory here.

932
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,680
Yes, I realize some of what they showed there was the gameplay, but I'm sorry.

933
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,720
They didn't really explain, like, what is the game?

934
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,440
And I know some of you might all be, but that's the art.

935
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,480
That's the mystery.

936
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,880
Look, I fucking stand David Lynch's Twin Peaks hard.

937
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,160
And if you want to know about something that doesn't make any fucking sense, let's talk

938
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,920
about David Lynch's Twin Peaks.

939
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,560
But my point is with this Death Stranding thing, like, they've shown it over and over

940
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
and over and over again.

941
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,160
And it's just like, okay, you know what?

942
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,040
Put up or shut up.

943
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,640
Like, it just kind of, like, feels like the thing.

944
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,960
It's just it's the new No Man's Sky.

945
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,600
And I worry in some ways it might end up disappointing.

946
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,320
Maybe it won't.

947
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,880
And you know what?

948
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,760
Maybe I'll decide.

949
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,120
I play the game and I'll be like, oh my God, I was so fucking wrong.

950
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,480
This game is incredible.

951
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,560
But I just think if there is such a thing as too much promotion, too much teasing, we're

952
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
getting to that line with Death Stranding.

953
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,600
That was what they did with No Man's Sky.

954
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,320
Yeah, it became good eventually.

955
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,360
Anyway, go to our chat at live.vog.network.com.

956
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,840
At Def does want to clarify the Last of Us girl is bi.

957
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,920
It was explained in the DLC for the first game.

958
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,040
Well, I'm glad I did say it could have been either or.

959
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,840
I was not aware.

960
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,600
Certainly would not want to erase any sexualities here on the show.

961
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,200
Sia Tabiri in chat says Twin Peaks makes more sense.

962
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Inland Empire is the one that did make sense.

963
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,680
I saw Lost Highway in the theater, okay?

964
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,640
You want to talk about a movie?

965
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,000
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

966
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,640
Go watch a movie called Lost Highway from the 90s.

967
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,640
Tigerclaw in chat says you have to take into account that this is Kojima.

968
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,800
His games tend to have really weird shit going on.

969
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,920
It's Kojima's trait.

970
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,760
Okay, Tigerclaw, I do get that.

971
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,200
But it's been weird shit for four years now.

972
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,160
Like, where's the fucking game?

973
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,520
God, can you imagine?

974
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Is the game walking from place to place?

975
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,800
If it's a walking sim or that whole thing, then okay, cool.

976
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,240
I don't think that's what it is.

977
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,680
Can you imagine if he actually did Silent Hills, man?

978
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,880
I feel like a lot of probably what was going to be in that game

979
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,800
is probably going to be in this, but we'll see.

980
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,840
Anyway, SG-100 Matt does say I'm in the same boat,

981
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
three years of this nonsense of Death Stranding.

982
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,520
Dungeon Buster says I feel that Kojima's Metal Gear Solid teases

983
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,560
had a lot more information going on with him than Death Stranding does right now.

984
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,440
Yes, agree.

985
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,320
Anyway, sorry, I will stop ranting on that

986
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,920
because I don't want to be overly negative,

987
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,520
but I'm just like, please stop showing that game

988
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,160
until you're ready to show us the game and the release date.

989
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,600
I do not want to see that game again.

990
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,040
All right, is that it for Sony?

991
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,000
That's it for Sony.

992
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,360
Let's talk about the Nintendo Direct.

993
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,080
So Nintendo Direct started off with a game called

994
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Daemon X Machine, and it's basically a spiritual successor to Armored Core,

995
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,200
at least that's what it looks like.

996
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,760
So awesome metal soundtrack coming in 2019.

997
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,280
It's a pretty cool name, like a play on Deus Ex Machina.

998
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,320
So then they showed off Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is getting,

999
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,240
I guess, some DLC that's coming out in September.

1000
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,200
They showed off more Let's Go or Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee

1001
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,600
and talked about the transfer as well as the Pokeball Plus

1002
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,200
is going to come with Mew in every single one.

1003
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,840
And that's going to be coming out November 16th.

1004
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,480
Super Mario Party, and they even have a way

1005
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
that you're going to be able to use multiple switches

1006
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,400
to play across two screens, which is kind of interesting.

1007
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,960
They have Fire Emblem Three Houses,

1008
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,240
which is coming out in the spring.

1009
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,400
Fortnite was out that day.

1010
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,600
They talked about some of the indie games,

1011
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,440
so they highlighted Overcooked 2, Killer Queen Black, and Hollow Knight.

1012
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,080
And then they talked a little bit about Octopath Traveler,

1013
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,400
which had a demo that came out as well.

1014
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,320
I actually know a little bit, I haven't played it yet.

1015
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,000
Dragon Ball FighterZ coming out October 2018.

1016
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,000
And then they talked about, of course, the big announcement,

1017
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,160
Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

1018
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,920
And it's got every character in every Smash game so far,

1019
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,040
and even bringing back Snake, and yes.

1020
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,760
And of course, along with that, they announced new characters.

1021
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,960
Daisy, they added, she's now what's called an Echo Fighter,

1022
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,440
so basically like a clone of another character.

1023
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,760
Does she still have an eyeball in the back of her head?

1024
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,160
I don't believe so.

1025
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,600
It would be cool if she did, though.

1026
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,920
Maybe one of the reskins or something, who knows?

1027
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,640
And then Ridley is also playable, and they've got amiibos coming for them as well.

1028
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,160
And that's coming out this year, December 7th, so pretty awesome.

1029
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,560
I sensed that there was a lot of people that didn't really care for Nintendo's presentation,

1030
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,880
because they focused on Smash Brothers too much.

1031
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,120
Because yes, it was all Smash Brothers.

1032
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,480
It's 30 minutes of Smash Brothers.

1033
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,640
Don't get me wrong, I love Smash Brothers.

1034
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,840
I just wish, it's like, where's Metroid Prime 4?

1035
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,520
Where's the Yoshi game that you guys talked about?

1036
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,600
Where's Animal Crossing?

1037
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,760
Where's anything else?

1038
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,520
It's like, where is all this stuff?

1039
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,360
I agree and I disagree.

1040
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,760
Like, certainly, I would be lying.

1041
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,440
I would be straight up lying if I didn't say.

1042
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,720
There wasn't that part of me that was like,

1043
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,680
oh, I wish they teased us a little more on Metroid Prime 4.

1044
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,640
Or I wish we kind of got some other stuff as well.

1045
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,840
I mean, we did get some new announcements in there with the Super Mario Party

1046
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,960
and the mech game and, you know, some of those things they were showing.

1047
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,560
There were at least some new things in there.

1048
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,320
But I'd be lying if I wasn't saying I wouldn't have appreciated some of these other teases.

1049
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,880
However, what I will give Nintendo credit for,

1050
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,200
that I think a lot of people are overlooking,

1051
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,040
is that the things they showed are coming a lot sooner

1052
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,000
than collaboratively what Sony, especially Sony, or Microsoft showed.

1053
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,440
Is that most of what you saw, like 90% of what Nintendo showed, was this year.

1054
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,560
And they still do these directs every month or so.

1055
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,060
Right.

1056
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,100
Exactly.

1057
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,400
You could think that they'd have other things.

1058
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,600
I just wish they would say,

1059
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,080
tease some stuff and like, oh, we'll have directs to talk about.

1060
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,360
For like, I didn't need...

1061
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,480
Which they did last year.

1062
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,040
Yeah, exactly.

1063
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,840
I didn't need Super Smash Brothers Ultimate to tell me what the differences were in the characters.

1064
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,600
All of the characters, like, here's all of the differences.

1065
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,480
I didn't need that 30 minute long explanation.

1066
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,720
That was a bit deep dive that maybe wasn't needed for the whole audience.

1067
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,200
Like that could be in like your Smash Direct that you do.

1068
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,600
We did not need to waste 30 minutes doing this.

1069
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,360
How about give 10 of those minutes to talking about Nintendo Online?

1070
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,720
Exactly.

1071
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,640
What the fuck is Nintendo Online?

1072
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,320
Because we haven't talked about it.

1073
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,440
We have a web page.

1074
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,800
This was that opportunity.

1075
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,920
So I was very surprised that was not there at all.

1076
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,920
And y'all know, I've been wondering, like, what is Nintendo's fucking retro plan already?

1077
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,120
And I feel like we're going to hear about it the day before at this point.

1078
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,440
The day before it's live is when we'll finally find out what their fucking retro plan is.

1079
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,920
Because I guess they don't want people analyzing it to death or something.

1080
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,800
I don't know.

1081
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,240
But it's, uh, yeah.

1082
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,280
I mean, I didn't, I didn't hate what Nintendo did.

1083
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,640
No, but it was, you know, again, and I kind of looked through it at the lens of,

1084
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,240
okay, well, at least they're just showing, like,

1085
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,160
here's the stuff to hold you over till our next direct type of thing.

1086
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,760
And I was like, all right, I'm okay with it.

1087
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,960
And honestly, you know, again, I don't like to do grades.

1088
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,920
I don't like to do the whole who won E3, but I am going to say the press conference

1089
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,000
that kind of surprised me this year of like, wow, I kind of feel like they put on

1090
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,760
the strongest thing was Microsoft.

1091
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,120
Yeah.

1092
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,680
And I think it's because everybody let Microsoft do the third party unveils.

1093
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,640
And Microsoft really had a whopper of an announcement with the fact that

1094
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,040
we're positioning ourselves to really kick some butt with our next console

1095
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,160
by acquiring four studios and building a fifth.

1096
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,120
You know, that if I was a Microsoft Stan, which I'm a fan of everybody,

1097
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,200
but if I was like one of those Microsoft fan boys,

1098
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,240
like certain other podcasts I've heard before, I would have been really excited.

1099
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,320
Plus, they had a lot of announcements.

1100
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,240
Granted, a lot of them are like far out, but like they announced a new Halo game.

1101
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,920
They announced three new Gears of War games.

1102
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,360
They announced a new Forza game.

1103
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,560
I mean, they got a lot of stuff coming.

1104
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,120
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, stop showing me Death Stranding.

1105
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,800
I'm tired of seeing it three minutes later.

1106
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,360
Why didn't they show us more about Metroid Prime 4?

1107
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,440
Okay, I'm going to show you the difference here.

1108
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,040
One, Sony is not only showing Death Stranding shit at E3.

1109
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,960
They're showing it at PSX.

1110
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,720
I think they did one at Gamescom, didn't they?

1111
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Didn't the Guillermo del Toro thing come out of Gamescom?

1112
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,320
Yeah, or Tokyo Game Show or something like that.

1113
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,240
They've also been joining the Game Awards.

1114
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:00,720
That's it.

1115
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,960
The Game Awards is the other thing that I'm not thinking of.

1116
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,600
So they're showing Death Stranding like multiple times a year,

1117
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,440
just like they were doing in No Man's Sky.

1118
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,920
Metroid Prime, we haven't seen in like a year.

1119
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,280
And I'm not saying, we don't need to have a 20-minute deep dive

1120
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,840
on Metroid Prime 4 if it's not coming out to 2019,

1121
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,320
but it just might be cool to see a screenshot,

1122
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,120
uh, something that kind of gives us, is it 2D?

1123
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,080
Is it through, oh, it's Prime.

1124
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,040
It's probably 3D.

1125
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,040
But just tease us a little bit with the HD graphics.

1126
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,160
Are they doing multiplayer?

1127
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,440
Just drop that little tidbit in there.

1128
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,560
That's all I need.

1129
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,800
Just a little tickle, okay?

1130
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,400
That's all I really need from Metroid Prime 4 or anything.

1131
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,760
I kind of feel like there's a difference.

1132
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,160
Or like what Retro Studios is working on, you know?

1133
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,520
Or just whatever.

1134
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,400
I don't know.

1135
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,900
Yeah.

1136
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,080
Anyway.

1137
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,760
Or DLC for fucking Mario Odyssey.

1138
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,280
I'm surprised that's not a thing.

1139
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:52,160
I feel like a lot of the comments in the chat room are a very

1140
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,680
agreeance that Microsoft was the one that people really walked away

1141
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,880
feeling the best from.

1142
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,520
SG100Matt says MS did what people wanted.

1143
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,240
Showed games.

1144
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,320
Whether those games are for you is a different story.

1145
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,520
Dungeon Buster says Microsoft and Phil Spencer put on a solid presser.

1146
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,280
I don't have an Xbox One, but for us it looks like a game I would at least like to try out.

1147
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,400
Well, you could on PC.

1148
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,760
And Bobby Black Wolf pointing out with Metroid Prime.

1149
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,480
Fun fact.

1150
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,920
Metroid Prime came out five months after OLR started.

1151
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,400
Thanks for that friendly reminder.

1152
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,120
I appreciate that.

1153
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,400
Sometimes sequels take time.

1154
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,400
Look at The Incredibles 2 14 years later.

1155
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:28,880
That's true.

1156
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,600
That's true.

1157
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,320
I yeah.

1158
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,240
I'm all for Metroid Prime 4 can take its time to be done when it's done.

1159
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,840
And here's the thing.

1160
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,640
It didn't specifically have to be Metroid Prime 4.

1161
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,120
But being at a 3 or like anything.

1162
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,160
Show us enough.

1163
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,000
Hey, here's an update on these games.

1164
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,120
They can even preface it.

1165
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,480
These games are coming out, you know, much a little bit later, like, you know.

1166
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,600
But we want to show you here where here's some of the progress that we've made.

1167
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,880
You know, kind of like how movies will say here's here's a still from the production set.

1168
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,640
Here's a new actor that we've got in the game, which to be fair, I guess Death Stranding did do.

1169
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,880
But, you know, here's a new character in these games.

1170
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,240
Nintendo loves to show new characters.

1171
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,640
I did want to back up, though, real quick to talk one more about Ubisoft.

1172
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,120
Um, I think it was Ubisoft or maybe I'm thinking Bethesda.

1173
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,600
One of them.

1174
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,640
I can't remember which one.

1175
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,800
The highlighted all the developers that were making their games.

1176
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,400
And maybe that was Bethesda I'm thinking of.

1177
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,480
Well, they do that big intro reel with Bethesda.

1178
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,880
But I think now Ubisoft are the annoying marching band.

1179
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,040
OK, now I'm getting it cleared now.

1180
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,520
Sorry.

1181
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,560
No, that's all right.

1182
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,760
It's nice.

1183
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,000
It's nice to see the faces behind this.

1184
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And I think a lot of times, you know, when gamers on Twitter can be really fucking mean

1185
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,840
sometimes and social media in general, Facebook, too.

1186
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,680
I always make fun of Twitter.

1187
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,360
But the reality is Facebook comments are even worse.

1188
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,880
Like if you go read Facebook comments on a lot of like public posts the companies make,

1189
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,280
there's so much fucking garbage that people write on Facebook.

1190
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,280
It's a good thing that their algorithm is such shit that it's really hard to find anything.

1191
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:55,840
Lord.

1192
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:01,040
Anyway, but my point with all that is like people really will razz games and be you know,

1193
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,240
we forget that there are so many hard working people that make games.

1194
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,680
And like, you know, I anytime that I feel like I personally have taken issues with what

1195
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,920
game companies do or things, it's very high level executive decision type of things that

1196
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,520
really tend to piss me off.

1197
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,720
Like the whole EA thing like disclosure.

1198
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,640
I know people that work at EA, OK?

1199
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,840
Like, you know, you do a show for 16 years, you're going to meet some people, OK?

1200
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,640
So I know people that work with EA and and obviously the problems that I have with what

1201
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,200
has happened with Mass Effect, what is happening with loot boxes, what is happening with Anthem.

1202
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,240
I would place none of that blame on those hard working people that are just being told,

1203
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,520
you know, being doing what they are supposed to do and doing it well.

1204
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,600
These are obviously when it comes to the money, the loot boxes, the how Mass Effect

1205
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,640
was handled and all that stuff.

1206
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,400
That's boardroom fucking decisions.

1207
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,400
And that is where oftentimes, unfortunately, people are brought into those boardrooms that

1208
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,840
aren't gamers.

1209
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,440
And I will tie this together.

1210
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,360
I think part of why Microsoft is in a much better place now with the Xbox One than it

1211
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,000
was when it was unveiled is you had Don Mattrick.

1212
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,640
Who is a little more that thing I was talking about that isn't such a great thing to have

1213
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,440
in boardrooms versus Phil Spencer, who clearly is a gamer himself.

1214
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,840
You have a very different person at the front of the wheel.

1215
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,920
That's also, I think, why Nintendo is mostly successful with Iwata at the helm.

1216
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,880
Oh, for sure.

1217
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,760
And even Reggie, you know, Reggie came from fucking Panda Express.

1218
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,800
People forget that.

1219
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,600
But Reggie, you still feel whether whether it's genuine or not, honestly, you he still

1220
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,280
shows enthusiasm for games.

1221
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,880
He's willing to get in there, make fun of it all.

1222
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,320
Play the games.

1223
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,800
Take it on.

1224
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,120
So you get the sense that he loves video games, whether it's legit or not.

1225
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,960
That's what he's able to show off.

1226
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,460
You know what I mean?

1227
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,040
So anyway.

1228
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,880
And also, honestly, Panda Express, pretty good, fast, casual food.

1229
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,400
And I'm not being made to say that.

1230
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,840
So Reggie's had a pretty successful past.

1231
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,720
Anyway, Dartetsuya in chat says, I definitely admire Reggie's dedication.

1232
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,360
Dungeon Buster says, got tired of the toxicity.

1233
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:02,800
Yeah, for sure.

1234
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,440
For sure.

1235
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,320
Bobby Blackwell points out, Bethesda always starts with their people.

1236
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,360
Yes, it's very important.

1237
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,480
And Sia Tabiri says, npr.org completely disabled their comment section last year or two years

1238
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,120
ago.

1239
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,360
All comment sections get bad sometimes.

1240
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,600
The VoG network comments aren't too bad.

1241
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,880
Not that that's a challenge.

1242
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,720
Please do not come up to that challenge.

1243
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
But I think it's because no one's using them.

1244
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,080
Very few people are.

1245
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,760
Leave some comments on episodes.

1246
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,960
I see one once in a while.

1247
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,000
I see you guys, especially overseas people that are leaving the comments on the episodes.

1248
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,040
We could use a few more.

1249
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,000
Show the internet how to behave, VoG network folks.

1250
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,320
All right.

1251
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:42,080
Anyway, if that's it for Nintendo and the E3 conferences, let's move on to our gaming

1252
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,400
weeks.

1253
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,600
Let's quickly, because we are an hour in and I know we only have Jamie till nine o'clock

1254
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,080
tonight.

1255
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,360
Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

1256
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,720
So Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

1257
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,360
Some Kirby.

1258
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,680
Also, mostly a lot of pinball because we had pinball league at my house on Thursday.

1259
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,640
I'm still playing idle pouring.

1260
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,760
I'm still playing Pokemon Go.

1261
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,120
We played some Pokemon Go today.

1262
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,160
Mostly I've just been reading a lot because books have kind of been my refuge while last

1263
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,120
week was kind of crap.

1264
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,560
So yeah.

1265
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:12,880
All right.

1266
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,840
Lots of pinball though.

1267
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,600
I'm sorry to hear about the crap, but I'm glad video games were there to help you in

1268
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,240
my garage.

1269
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,920
We have a guardians of the galaxy and it's fucking fun.

1270
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,120
It's a very colorful table.

1271
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:23,680
Very loud.

1272
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,480
I told Dan I'd be willing to sell Star Trek to get a guardians of the galaxy.

1273
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,800
So there may be some changes in my house.

1274
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,000
Ooh, friendly reminder too.

1275
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,920
I know this isn't you, Dark Sakura, but for the pinball fans out there that don't mind

1276
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,120
playing on PC, don't forget those license tables are going away at the end of June.

1277
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,640
So this like last chance.

1278
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,520
So a reminder, if you didn't drop your 200 bucks on buying all those old tables yet or

1279
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,120
however much it was, I don't remember the cost.

1280
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,040
Loki, let's do your gaming week.

1281
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,080
We'll go to Bradley.

1282
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,760
I didn't play much this week.

1283
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,920
I did play a little bit of Super Mario Odyssey.

1284
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,520
Still trying to just get all the power moons.

1285
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,120
So I finished the Luncheon Kingdom.

1286
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,560
I think I've gotten all of them there.

1287
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,160
So I moved on to other things.

1288
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,280
And then so that's two out of however many kingdoms are that I've gotten everything in.

1289
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,960
And then I did download the Octopath Traveler demo, but I still haven't played it yet.

1290
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:23,760
A little bit more Pokemon conquest and or Pokemon quest conquest would be even better.

1291
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,680
But Pokemon quest, I played that and Pokemon go.

1292
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,600
And I keep forgetting to mention every week, but still playing dance dance revolution extreme.

1293
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,640
So doing that.

1294
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,360
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

1295
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,680
No, not a ton.

1296
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,440
OK, let's go over to Bradley.

1297
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,560
How was your gaming week?

1298
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:42,880
All right.

1299
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,400
So aside from the other the aforementioned Slay the Spire also been playing.

1300
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,440
I play pretty much play Fire Emblem Heroes every day.

1301
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,880
At least like a little bit of it just for whatever.

1302
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,680
Also playing SteamWorld Heist.

1303
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,240
Oh, yeah, I know those games.

1304
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,960
Yeah.

1305
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,200
Yeah.

1306
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,960
Basically, it's a sort of a strategy platform sort of thing.

1307
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,960
Try to get into position and shoot the enemies and all that.

1308
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,840
So that's pretty fun.

1309
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,840
And I also played the Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.

1310
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,200
Pretty much wrapping up that game.

1311
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,760
There was like two other achievements that I got to do it the correct way.

1312
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,560
What are you playing that on PC?

1313
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:28,800
Yeah.

1314
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:28,960
Yeah.

1315
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,360
So I figured because you mentioned you didn't have the newer consoles.

1316
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,560
The not Castlevania wink pretty much.

1317
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,360
Doesn't it feel like it's just it's just Castlevania pretty much pretty much.

1318
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:38,800
But it's great.

1319
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,120
It's great.

1320
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,320
It's nice to have a new game like that.

1321
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:41,840
Yeah.

1322
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,760
And I'm not too much else I've met.

1323
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,520
All right.

1324
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,240
My gaming week.

1325
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,080
So I'm pretty much old favorites for me.

1326
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,160
Diablo three season 14 start of season 14 of Diablo 14.

1327
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,760
That's really started this past week.

1328
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,800
So I was like, oh, what the hell?

1329
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,640
So how often do they do is like every quarter reset them about every three months.

1330
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,760
So they were playing with the time at some point.

1331
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,480
It was four months.

1332
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,440
Somebody was two months.

1333
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,520
I think they're settled on like a three month average.

1334
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,120
So I started a witch doctor for season 14 and I haven't been power leveled.

1335
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,880
So I've grind my own levels up to I think I'm about 48 right now.

1336
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,880
So I'll be by the time the next episode of our airs in two weeks,

1337
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,640
I'll be like Paragon 500.

1338
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,080
It's just the way these things go.

1339
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:24,000
Although then again, I can't play when I'm in Chicago, so maybe not.

1340
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,040
But I've been playing that.

1341
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,520
I got sucked into heroes of the storm again.

1342
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,600
So it's like I'm back on my blizzard.

1343
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:30,800
Bullshit.

1344
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,360
Basically, I'm playing with the casual blizzard games and doing that.

1345
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,880
So I've been playing heroes of the storm.

1346
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,880
I've been watching heroes of the storm on Twitch because they do like some of the drops.

1347
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,200
I guess right now you can get loot boxes for like watching people play heroes of the storm on Twitch.

1348
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,720
It's actually a really cool little promotion.

1349
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,840
I don't think it made our show roll,

1350
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,840
but I thought it was very clever that like the game makers are rewarding people

1351
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,480
with items in that game for watching that game.

1352
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,080
And especially for something that's a free to play game like heroes of the storm.

1353
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,040
It's very, you know, it gives people more people an excuse to check it out.

1354
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,640
I'm only level 70, which I know people that are in hundreds of levels.

1355
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,800
But guys, I only ever play AI.

1356
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,600
I have done that completely like AI matches.

1357
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,400
So if I had more friends that I played with on a regular basis,

1358
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,400
I might do more like player versus player.

1359
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,680
But for right now, like AI allows me to get quest done every day,

1360
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,360
get the gold to buy new characters.

1361
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,480
And that's just kind of what I do.

1362
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,040
So I was doing a little bit of the event.

1363
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,440
They did like a wrestling event.

1364
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,640
It was kind of interesting.

1365
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,360
They did an event a couple of weeks ago,

1366
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,200
but now they're moving into an Alterac Valley event.

1367
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,960
So I think there's a new map coming out on Tuesday.

1368
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,080
So that'll be cool.

1369
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,440
Anyway, other than that, Pokemon Go community day was Saturday.

1370
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,120
So I played lots and lots of that.

1371
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,360
Walked around Capitol Park again for three hours catching shinies.

1372
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,920
I got two shinies pretty quick.

1373
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,920
And then like that third shiny,

1374
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,200
because you know I want a shiny for every evolution of Larvitar, right?

1375
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,320
That third shiny would not fucking drop.

1376
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,280
So like I had two shinies by 1130.

1377
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,560
And then like 130 showed up and I still didn't have a third shiny.

1378
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,840
And I was getting really pissed off.

1379
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,040
But then by some miracle, I caught two more shinies.

1380
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,760
Phew, so I had my four shinies by the time the event was done.

1381
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,640
And I Pinat buried almost every single...

1382
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,840
I went into the event with 90 Pinat berries.

1383
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,520
I used them all.

1384
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,040
So I walked out of that event with over a thousand Larvitar candy.

1385
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,760
And now I have an army of Tyranitar's waiting to shred up raids and things that...

1386
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,480
Obviously, Tyranitar's won't do everything, but they do a lot.

1387
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,640
Especially, you know, because some have fire blasts,

1388
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,600
some have the, you know, Stone Edge and, you know, the different moves.

1389
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,840
Well, didn't you get all of them that you evolved during the event?

1390
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,240
I evolved two to get Smackdown, yes.

1391
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,240
So I caught a couple high level wonders at the park and I evolved those

1392
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,040
to just have a high level Tyranitar with those moves out the gate.

1393
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,600
It's a bummer because I had a level 100...

1394
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:54,160
Or I'm sorry, a 100% IV Larvitar from back when scanners were available

1395
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,760
and people would post to our raiding group.

1396
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,800
They'd say, there's a 100% Larvitar over at the, you know, the...

1397
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,240
Where was this at?

1398
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,920
It was at an apartment complex somewhere.

1399
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,680
So we drove over there because we happened to...

1400
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,320
Me and one of my Ingress buddies were out playing Ingress

1401
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,240
when that message came in and it was like, 100% Larvitar, turn Ingress off.

1402
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,520
We're gonna go get this.

1403
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,160
So we did.

1404
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,240
So we went and grabbed it.

1405
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,080
And so, but I had already evolved that to Tyranitar all the time.

1406
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,040
So are those the ones that like come up as a wonder or how the...

1407
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,760
They're a wonder.

1408
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,760
It'll go, if you're on blue team, the language in red and yellow is different,

1409
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,560
but for blue team, it says, this Pokemon is a wonder.

1410
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:31,280
Its best stat is attack, matched by its defense, matched by its HP.

1411
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,840
And then it goes, the stats are so impressive.

1412
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,400
It's amazing.

1413
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,560
I don't remember the exact verbiage, but basically it's a 15 basically in that stat.

1414
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,520
So yeah.

1415
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,760
So anyway, that was my gaming week.

1416
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,440
Mostly those games.

1417
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,000
So yeah.

1418
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,560
Let's move on and get into some gaming news.

1419
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,240
As a reminder, guys, for housekeeping, we will not be here next week.

1420
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,600
I'm gonna be out of town in Chicago.

1421
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,840
We're just gonna take a week off, but we'll be back in two weeks

1422
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,960
for the next year of Orange Lounge Radio and what's to come in the next year.

1423
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,000
I will say this though.

1424
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,400
We are...

1425
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,400
I don't want to be too much of a tease,

1426
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,400
but there's going to be some big changes by the end of the year.

1427
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,640
Not with hosts or anything like that.

1428
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,720
Just there's going to be some big changes at the end of the year.

1429
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,720
And I think you guys will like them and that's all.

1430
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,760
I hope you guys like them.

1431
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,480
That's why we're doing them.

1432
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:19,040
So we'll, it's something you guys have been asking for for a long time.

1433
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,640
So we'll give you more on that at a later date.

1434
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,800
In the meantime, let's get into some gaming news for this week.

1435
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,680
Loki.

1436
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,760
So let's talk about, since we didn't talk about during the, you know, recap of E3,

1437
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,760
the PC gaming show.

1438
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,720
So there's a few things.

1439
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,920
I personally hate watching the PC gaming show because it would be pretty dumb,

1440
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,080
but there were a few things that get announced out there.

1441
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,800
So one of my favorite studios, Coffee Stain Studios,

1442
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,360
has a new game coming out called Satisfactory,

1443
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,560
which is like a survival game.

1444
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,760
You can build these different machines that do different automations and whatnot.

1445
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,440
So that's pretty cool.

1446
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,520
And they have a closed alpha coming pretty soon.

1447
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,640
There's a game called Neo Cab, which is about a futuristic

1448
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,040
or glass cab, human cab driver in a futuristic city.

1449
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,840
And that's coming out in 2019, February 5th.

1450
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,720
A game called Mavericks Proving Grounds,

1451
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,480
which looks like a battle royale game with a thousand concurrent players.

1452
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,040
So that sounds pretty neat.

1453
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,200
No word on one that's out.

1454
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,400
Game called The Forgotten City, which is like a...

1455
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:22,960
I'm sorry.

1456
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,520
One versus a hundred wasn't enough.

1457
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,840
Wait until you try one versus a thousand

1458
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,000
and realize you're going to place no higher than nine hundred and ninety eight.

1459
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,560
Yeah.

1460
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,160
After the two people that disconnected.

1461
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,320
Let's see, they have a game.

1462
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,520
They showed off Forgotten City, which is coming in 2019.

1463
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,120
A game that's kind of interesting for me

1464
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,160
because I used to play the old Star Control games, the Star Control Origins,

1465
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,440
which showed off like they have it's an open universe action RPG.

1466
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,160
They guess they're launching that on September 20th.

1467
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,080
A game called The Hunt or Hunt Showdown,

1468
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,280
which I think is a survival FPS game by Crytek.

1469
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,240
A game called Archangel Hellfire.

1470
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,080
It's a 2v2 PvP multiplayer mech shooter.

1471
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,720
Let's see what else.

1472
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,120
They showed off some stuff for Warframe.

1473
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,440
Now it's more Sega PC titles coming.

1474
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,800
So Shenmue 1 and 2, Yakuza Kiwami,

1475
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,440
Valkria Chronicles 4 and Yakuza 0.

1476
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,920
So and Shining Resonance are all going to be making their way to the PC now.

1477
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,080
Killing Floor 2.

1478
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:32,880
What else?

1479
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,120
We had another.

1480
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,840
They showed off some gameplay for Jurassic World Evolution,

1481
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,320
a game called Stormland, which is an open world VR game.

1482
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,960
That Jurassic World Evolution,

1483
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,880
a lot of people have been playing that on Twitch lately.

1484
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:52,320
People are I guess those people that are playing the the SimCity and the city.

1485
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,360
Oh my God.

1486
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,120
Why can't I remember that again?

1487
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,440
Cities Evolved or Cities Skylines.

1488
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:57,840
That's it.

1489
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,280
Skylines seem to be into Jurassic World right now.

1490
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:01,520
Yeah.

1491
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,520
It's like a little memory like of a theme park game.

1492
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:03,760
It is.

1493
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,640
But it's where the obviously the dinosaurs can kill everyone.

1494
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,440
So that's kind of fun.

1495
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,000
That's always fun.

1496
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,500
Yeah.

1497
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,420
What else?

1498
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,080
Stormland.

1499
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:13,920
I think I talked about that.

1500
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,040
Night Call, which is you play as a Paris taxi driver.

1501
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,440
Tiger Claw says it's from the developers of Planet Coaster.

1502
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,360
So there's a reason why it feels adjacent.

1503
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:21,920
That's pretty awesome.

1504
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,480
That is awesome.

1505
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:31,200
They showed off some Star Citizen stuff and then they kind of got into a monitor.

1506
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,280
Of course, this is a PC gaming show, a game called Genesis Alpha 1.

1507
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,000
I think this show was like three hours long, so there's a ton of shit.

1508
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,120
Don't Starve Hamlet.

1509
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,800
I'm not really sure what that is.

1510
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,880
More DLC for Don't Starve, I guess.

1511
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,280
I guess.

1512
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:43,780
Yeah.

1513
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,200
They showed off Just Cause 4 on PC and talked about the, you know,

1514
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,440
upgrades that PC version is going to get.

1515
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:55,840
They had the Walking Dead FPS game from Overkill that's coming out on November 4th.

1516
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,560
They also talked a little bit about the Walking Dead, the Telltale series.

1517
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,600
They have the final season coming out August 14th.

1518
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,680
And what's kind of unique about this season, though, is it's going to have unscripted combat

1519
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,320
and some more free camera scenes.

1520
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:17,280
A game called Noita, which is a pixelated side scroller cave adventure game.

1521
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:17,520
All right.

1522
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,120
Anything we're dying for over here, Loki?

1523
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,560
There's a game called Realm Royale, Hitman 2.

1524
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,720
Oh, I think that Realm Royale is showing up on Twitch too.

1525
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,720
I think it's a real game.

1526
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,880
And then a game that looked kind of neat.

1527
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,600
Ooblets.

1528
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,160
I've been seeing a lot of that on my Twitter feed.

1529
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,720
It's kind of like a Pokemon Animal Crossing game.

1530
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:44,080
Bobby points out that Realm Royale is the same studio high res that does Smite and Paladins.

1531
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,280
I thought so by the logo.

1532
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,920
The logo is like the same font as Paladins.

1533
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:48,960
Yeah.

1534
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:49,760
All right.

1535
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:54,320
And yeah, they have like another battle royale, Rapture Rejects, which is another battle royale.

1536
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,400
So all the battle royale games are the PC gaming show.

1537
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,400
Like all the just about all of them are over there.

1538
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,680
The Rapture Rejects one.

1539
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,320
I like to mention this one is kind of cool because I did see this

1540
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,880
on YouTube because it's Cyanide and Happiness co-created it.

1541
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,400
So it's their art style.

1542
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,160
And I fucking love Cyanide and Happiness.

1543
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,480
So that looks awesome.

1544
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,560
Well, something else that could have been a Nintendo's little event that was missing was

1545
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,000
non-games.

1546
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,800
I mean, yeah, I know we don't want to fixate too much on that.

1547
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,720
Like, look at what happened at the Xbox One reveal.

1548
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:27,760
But it might have been nice to hear, oh, hey, Netflix, YouTube going to come to Switch.

1549
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,960
And apparently it looked like that was going to happen because Best Buy

1550
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,960
had leaked something on their website.

1551
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,320
I say leaked, but obviously it didn't happen.

1552
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:39,920
But they said that it listed features on the Nintendo Switch as Netflix and YouTube right

1553
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,480
alongside Hulu, which we know is already there.

1554
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,800
Unfortunately, the direct happened and it wasn't there.

1555
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,360
And Best Buy did say that, oh, it was an error.

1556
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,720
You know, of course, they kind of cover their tracks a little bit there and say that was

1557
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:57,920
an error because, of course, that picture with Netflix and YouTube made its way all

1558
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,960
around the Internet.

1559
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,920
So, of course, Reggie Fils-Aime kind of got asked about it in one of the many E3 interviews.

1560
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,160
And he said in a quote in one of the interviews, when we launched the Switch, we were very

1561
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,720
clear we wanted to position the device as a game playing device.

1562
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,360
We've done that.

1563
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,320
And so you've seen Hulu, for example, come onto the platform.

1564
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,520
In terms of other services, the conversations are ongoing.

1565
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,120
We've got nothing to announce right now, but certainly those opportunities will come

1566
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,240
in due time.

1567
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:26,320
So in many ways, it's the same line we've been getting ever since the launch of the

1568
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:26,800
system.

1569
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,800
Like, sure, we'll do it at some point, but we're just trying to focus on the games because

1570
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,080
that's what you all want us to do anyway, which is kind of the underlying overtone.

1571
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,960
But he didn't say never.

1572
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,640
He said in due time.

1573
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:44,560
So it certainly seems like we'll have Netflix and YouTube when they talk about the networks.

1574
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,280
Yeah, maybe.

1575
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:45,840
You know what?

1576
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,760
It would be a good coupling with online stuff.

1577
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,920
So maybe that'll be when they unveil it.

1578
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,600
But at the same time, when it comes to setting expectations in Nintendo, I think it would

1579
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,280
just be a bad idea to do that ever.

1580
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:03,280
So we'll just we'll just sit here and be surprised by whatever it ends up being.

1581
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,880
So all right.

1582
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,360
Anyway, let's move on.

1583
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,720
Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?

1584
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,520
Something that people don't always expect to hear on the show, stocks.

1585
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,480
Although I have said that the way to have some say in a company is to own some stock

1586
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:18,960
in it.

1587
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,460
Hello.

1588
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:26,180
But anyway, there were some pretty big stock changes that came out of news from E3.

1589
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:35,140
In fact, three of the biggest stock increases went for Take-Two, for EA and for Blizzard.

1590
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:40,740
So those three had the biggest stock increase, which keep in mind, you know, again, the stocks

1591
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:47,620
are an indicator of how not just how the company is performing, but also, you know, where their

1592
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:48,340
strength is.

1593
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:52,420
You know, a company that's making more money is going to be in a stronger position to do

1594
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:52,980
more.

1595
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:57,060
And of course, you know, again, money into the local economy.

1596
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:57,560
Hello.

1597
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:04,420
But companies that took a hit was Nintendo dropped ten point four percent.

1598
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:09,860
Who knew that all those investors were also eagerly awaiting Animal Crossing on the switch?

1599
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:16,180
No, it's because all those investors, they're like, wait, where's Waluigi?

1600
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,180
Sell.

1601
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,260
You know who's not investing is Tom Nook.

1602
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,020
But they're investing in turnips.

1603
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,980
Sony dropped one point seven percent.

1604
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:29,460
Microsoft just barely dipped like point two percent.

1605
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,980
Other ones that did get a hit were Logitech.

1606
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:40,900
AMD took an increase and so did Nvidia, I guess, with, you know, seeing how.

1607
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:44,340
So this this E3 kind of I don't want to say it was a flop,

1608
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:50,580
but this E3 from a financial stock perspective, like nobody was excited out of E3.

1609
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:55,460
And honestly, in talking to a lot of like fans and things and I feel like a lot of people

1610
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,700
are walking out of this E3 going, it's OK.

1611
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,220
It wasn't the best.

1612
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:06,100
The thing is, is that the largest players, you know, in I would say generally at E3 were

1613
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,380
the ones to take a hit.

1614
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,420
Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft.

1615
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:18,580
But all the smaller ones and maybe the medium developers seem to be doing pretty well coming

1616
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,060
out of this.

1617
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:25,700
So, you know, this I think it's really showing that people are more looking toward not toward

1618
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:29,620
the very biggest of the names, but looking toward the software publishers as opposed

1619
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:30,740
to the hardware providers.

1620
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,700
And this is this is good information to look at, because ultimately, like your letter grade

1621
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,540
on Twitter doesn't mean shit.

1622
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,500
This is what this is where the money is.

1623
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:40,900
Yeah.

1624
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,900
Well, some of that could have come out of copy text as well, because their show was the

1625
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,380
week before and they were showing off all the PC hardware stuff.

1626
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:53,220
Maybe some maybe some of the AMD and things, but not not the big three.

1627
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:53,380
Yeah.

1628
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:58,980
The ones that are like and I mean like hardware, not like console hardware is the one that

1629
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,100
are the ones taking the hit.

1630
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:02,900
But I think the component providers are the ones that really.

1631
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:10,260
Because, I mean, basically a lot more home gaming is being done, I think, on higher end

1632
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:10,820
PCs.

1633
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,580
It's really gotten an increase, I think.

1634
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:17,620
Even I was reading another article that Turtle Beach has actually had an increase in revenue

1635
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,500
thanks to Fortnite directly because of Fortnite.

1636
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,060
Oh, sure.

1637
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:21,620
Yeah, sure.

1638
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:22,760
Good call.

1639
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:27,380
Rama in chat says, fuck Waluigi, to which I respond.

1640
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:34,260
When and Dungeon Buster in chat says investors were hoping for a stronger holiday showing

1641
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,420
from Nintendo, from what I read.

1642
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:42,260
But are we I mean, are we even if you have a pretty strong holiday, they've got a Mario

1643
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:48,660
Party game, a Pokemon spin off, but like one of the more logical spin offs.

1644
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,140
If you're going to spin anything off, spin off the mobile.

1645
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,180
Yeah, yeah.

1646
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,460
It's still like Pokemon.

1647
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:58,180
And they got obviously Smash Brothers, which, you know, is a top 20 of all time.

1648
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:03,620
And I watch and I didn't watch you casually some of the Nintendo Treehouse stuff.

1649
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:08,260
And I got to say, as a person who doesn't play Pokemon, I want that Pokemon game.

1650
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:14,100
I mean, my kids want that game like Loki is talking positive about Nintendo like a lot.

1651
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,100
And it's because of that Pokemon game.

1652
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:20,820
So like y'all, I'll be picking up all three of their games this new holiday.

1653
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:25,540
Nintendo fans that always send the angry emails about Loki and his fits like like y'all

1654
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,180
hearing this.

1655
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,060
Y'all hearing it.

1656
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,980
I only I I criticize because I love.

1657
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:31,300
I know.

1658
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:31,700
I know.

1659
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,980
We've said that over and over again.

1660
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,860
Bobby says two Pokemon games, not three.

1661
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,380
It's still the same thing.

1662
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,260
It is the same thing.

1663
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,540
Oh, he could be talking about the mainline game.

1664
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,820
They did kind of right.

1665
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,660
They did a tickle to say mainline Pokemon isn't dead.

1666
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,100
It's coming in 2019.

1667
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,220
Then that's fine.

1668
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:55,620
I'm talking about like, you know, and then your your dumb little Pokemon quest thing,

1669
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,700
I guess, could be counted as a game in some ways.

1670
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:58,580
That'll be on mobile.

1671
01:15:58,580 --> 01:15:59,140
It's still a game.

1672
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,100
I mean, I still play it.

1673
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,740
That's that's the one I don't get.

1674
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,140
Even I look at that going, Loki, why do you like that?

1675
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,020
Holy shit, by the way.

1676
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,540
Well, all right.

1677
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,380
Don't mean to derail, but there was actually a big earthquake in Osaka.

1678
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:13,860
Oh, no.

1679
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:14,900
Yeah.

1680
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:18,260
What what what did Richter scale?

1681
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,100
Uh, lower sixes.

1682
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:26,100
OK, I mean, but at least it's not an eight, you know, derailed some trains and killed

1683
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:26,580
two people.

1684
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,860
So just saying, I didn't mean to interrupt for anything like that, but I mean, no, that's

1685
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,100
OK.

1686
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,300
I thought we have listeners in Japan and friends in the area.

1687
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:38,740
So just stopping to acknowledge and give you all tsunamis are going to be the big concern

1688
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:41,460
center center central of the country.

1689
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,460
So I don't think oh, so then the water would go.

1690
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:43,700
Yeah.

1691
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,500
So it's not going to do that.

1692
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,140
OK, that's great.

1693
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:45,940
That's good.

1694
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:46,580
Anyway.

1695
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:47,060
OK.

1696
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:52,900
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOG Network

1697
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,380
dot com, use the passphrase window.

1698
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,780
Let's move on, though, with some other news.

1699
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,820
So, Loki.

1700
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,100
All right.

1701
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:04,980
So Valve is, I guess, doing something.

1702
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:08,500
I mean, they decided now they're going to put some limitations.

1703
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,860
They're trying to stop a lot of these like sketchy games are coming to steam.

1704
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:18,740
One type of game that comes out there is these achievement games that basically spam, you

1705
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,580
know, achievements.

1706
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,380
You play the games like, oh, hey, you get 100 trophies all of a sudden.

1707
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,220
So what they're doing is they're putting in some sort of limitations for that.

1708
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:34,580
So with with this, they're basically going to limit games to having 100 achievements

1709
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:40,020
and there's supposed to be some sort of like confidence metric.

1710
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,220
They'll prevent features.

1711
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:42,500
OK, I can't hold it in.

1712
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:47,060
Why all of a sudden to steam feel like, oh, but we need to regulate this.

1713
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:48,820
Oh, steam.

1714
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:53,860
Oh, I thought there was supposed to be things in games that purposefully make you mad.

1715
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:58,580
This has been like this has been an issue for like a long time.

1716
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,180
Why now are they fixing this?

1717
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:04,420
You know, and yeah, and to your point, you know, oh, offensive content.

1718
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,260
Well, the whole platform is fucking broken.

1719
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,540
I mean, it's what it is.

1720
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,940
And steam fix your life.

1721
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:15,220
If it wasn't so convenient to get stuff, you know, on that platform, then, yeah.

1722
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:21,140
But here's the other problem, too, with steam, though, like, I don't know, like, I just feel

1723
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:25,300
they like even their sales and stuff, it's just hard to get excited about anymore.

1724
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:29,860
When I see people with garbage achievements, I go, oh, look, they got a garbage achievement

1725
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,940
like it does.

1726
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,620
I just feel like, OK, fine.

1727
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,300
Is is this need fixing?

1728
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,900
I guess if it's ton and ton and spam.

1729
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,540
What is exactly the trophies do?

1730
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,620
Is that like raise your level or something?

1731
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,180
I don't I don't fucking know anymore, Loki.

1732
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,380
I don't fucking know anymore.

1733
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,780
And who gives a shit about what level you are on steam?

1734
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:50,500
Does anybody go like I'm a level 20 on steam?

1735
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:55,780
If if it still works the same way when it first came out, it affects the drop rate of

1736
01:18:55,780 --> 01:19:02,580
the cards every time I see now every 10 levels you go up on steam, you get a higher chance.

1737
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:09,380
So what happens is they're power leveling the box, they're farming the cards so they

1738
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:13,220
get more drops so they can make more money off the broken ass platform that steam has

1739
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,540
let them get away with for such a long time.

1740
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:20,740
I see it's all about the steam, steam, steam, steam.

1741
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:21,380
Have a seat.

1742
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:21,860
Steam.

1743
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,620
We need to talk at your life.

1744
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,660
Look at your choices.

1745
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,020
Look at your life, look at your choices.

1746
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,500
The call is coming from inside the house.

1747
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,100
That's all I have to say.

1748
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,860
Steam, the call is coming from inside the house.

1749
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,220
Why don't you fix that?

1750
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:39,620
Yeah, moving on.

1751
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:45,860
Hey, let's talk about the switch and some big arcade announcements that were not a part

1752
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:50,180
of the big press thing that they did.

1753
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:57,380
But they came out later because they like to drop little things during the tree house

1754
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,260
thing, right?

1755
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:58,580
Right.

1756
01:19:58,900 --> 01:19:59,700
That was the one thing.

1757
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:05,300
It's like, I can't watch all three days of this, but yeah, so I have to wait for people

1758
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,740
to report on it for me.

1759
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:12,420
But anyway, it did come out that Donkey Kong, the arcade Donkey Kong has come out to the

1760
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,700
Nintendo switch.

1761
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,860
Now this is kind of a big deal because Nintendo has released Donkey Kong time and time and

1762
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:18,500
time again.

1763
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:23,060
But what they tend to release is that original NES cartridge of Donkey Kong, which was not

1764
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,660
an arcade perfect port.

1765
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,980
It's missing the pie factory.

1766
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:31,860
So which was, did y'all know there's a board in Donkey Kong?

1767
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:35,460
It's actually a cement factory, but I call it the pie factory.

1768
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,260
They look like pies, even though it's supposed to be the whole thing that was supposed to

1769
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,100
be like a construction scene.

1770
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:40,500
Yeah.

1771
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:45,780
So cement mixer in pie, whatever, which goes with the other boards.

1772
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,140
You know, I'll have a construction theme.

1773
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:47,540
Absolutely.

1774
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:50,180
It looks like a pie factory, but it's cement factory.

1775
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,180
But regardless, that board is in this.

1776
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:56,580
So that's a pretty big deal because it's a more authentic, if you will, port of Donkey

1777
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:56,820
Kong.

1778
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:02,980
So that is available and it's going to be on the switch for $7.99 through the arcade

1779
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:03,780
archives.

1780
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:08,740
This actually has the Japanese version to the Japanese original, the updated Japanese

1781
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,220
original with bug fixes and the international version.

1782
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:15,380
You can play a vertical layout by rotating 90 degrees.

1783
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:16,100
That's rad.

1784
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:16,820
That's awesome.

1785
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:20,660
Is it going to be so convincing that certain professional Donkey Kong players aren't going

1786
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,980
to be able to tell the difference between this and an arcade version?

1787
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,940
I'm going to defer all those questions to Bobby Black.

1788
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:27,220
All right.

1789
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,380
Just confirming, you know, it can be confusing.

1790
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,380
He's the variety spokesperson now.

1791
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:35,380
Dartage Studio says, to be fair, they did have an edited NES version that re-added the

1792
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:38,660
cement factory level, but this is the first time the honest to goodness arcade version

1793
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,220
has been released.

1794
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:39,700
Yes.

1795
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,060
And for the record, I still believe that the ColecoVision version was superior to the

1796
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,420
Nintendo version, but.

1797
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:49,220
And I prefer the Commodore 64 version, but that's also my fandom from when I was a kid.

1798
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,780
Now, something else to keep in mind.

1799
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,340
This was not the only arcade game that they released.

1800
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,180
This is kind of a big deal.

1801
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:59,460
Sky Skipper also is getting a release.

1802
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:02,500
Sky Skipper never got formally released in arcades.

1803
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,060
They did some location testing in 1981.

1804
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,020
That was it.

1805
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:10,020
Also, I think, didn't this cabinet show up at like Southern Fried Game Room Expo or something

1806
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:10,340
like that?

1807
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:14,660
Like, I feel like this cabinet is like one of those things that shows up rarely, but

1808
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,260
anyway, or maybe they rebuilt it or something.

1809
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:16,740
I don't know.

1810
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:22,020
But apparently Nintendo had to extract the ROM from the only arcade cabinet still in

1811
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,860
existence to make this happen.

1812
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,620
So this is like a rare Nintendo.

1813
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,500
You are sitting on a joke.

1814
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,300
What do you want to say?

1815
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:31,620
I'm just saying, just based off their previous experience with Virtual Console, they extracted

1816
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,100
off of the arcade board that they downloaded off the Internet.

1817
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,660
You know, how did that come about?

1818
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:38,820
All right.

1819
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:44,020
Anyway, Darticcia does confirm it was a Sky Skipper cabinet that was restored at last

1820
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,380
year's Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

1821
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,420
So, yeah, very cool.

1822
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,180
So anyway, that is also available now.

1823
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:53,380
So if you want to take something from the archives of Nintendo that was never released,

1824
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:57,220
well, it wasn't Mother 3, but you got this.

1825
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:57,940
It's something.

1826
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:01,940
Anyway, at least Mother 3 was released somewhere.

1827
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,620
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you got?

1828
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:10,820
Well, how about one of our favorite things that has taken over Netflix?

1829
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:11,700
Stranger Things.

1830
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:12,740
Queer Eye.

1831
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,660
Season 2.

1832
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:15,380
Stranger Things.

1833
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:21,860
Anyway, it looks like Telltale has got the rights to do a Stranger Things game.

1834
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:25,140
So and, of course, we know what Telltale is best at.

1835
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:28,820
It's interactive adventures and point and click goodies.

1836
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:36,260
So they are actually doing a Stranger Things game.

1837
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,180
It's actually still in the project state.

1838
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:45,060
It hasn't been determined on, you know, what exactly the story is going to be or when it's

1839
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:45,700
going to be out.

1840
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,580
But they say that it's not going to be on Netflix at all, so there won't be any kind

1841
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:51,300
of story to it.

1842
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,300
They're just it's all going to be pure game.

1843
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,660
So there you go.

1844
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:00,340
This is one of the things that when I heard the news, I was like, oh, yeah, I guess I

1845
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:04,340
guess it would make sense for Stranger Things to have a game like this.

1846
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,500
I mean, I know there's that crappy little cell phone.

1847
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,500
I shouldn't call it crappy, but it was a cell phone game and very much just a cell phone

1848
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,940
game of Stranger Things that came out.

1849
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:15,300
So it makes sense that, you know, they're getting something a little more substantial.

1850
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,420
Yeah, substantial.

1851
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,220
That's a good word for it.

1852
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,380
Substantial and not upside down.

1853
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,340
Yes, correct.

1854
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:20,740
All right.

1855
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:23,620
Anyhow, let's move on.

1856
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,180
Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1857
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:29,460
And you've got another big story from this week, Loki.

1858
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,660
Yes, I do.

1859
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:37,700
So right after, you know, they announced during the Nintendo Direct that, hey, Fortnite is

1860
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,540
on the Switch and you can play it now.

1861
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:46,740
Well, unfortunately, some people couldn't just play it right now because they found

1862
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:54,020
out when they tried to log in that they couldn't if they happen to have played on a PlayStation

1863
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:55,460
4, because that's right.

1864
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:03,380
While the system or the game is cross platform or cross play, it can only cross play with

1865
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:06,580
Fortnite on PC, mobile and Xbox One.

1866
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:09,860
You can't play it if you've accessed it on the PlayStation 4.

1867
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:15,380
The only way you can get to play that is if you create a new account.

1868
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:20,180
In fact, you can even unlink it from the PlayStation 4 and it'll still say, nope, sorry,

1869
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:20,740
can't do it.

1870
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,740
That is such bullshit.

1871
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,260
But that's even unlink it.

1872
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,300
That's OK, though.

1873
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:31,860
So Sony did make a response regarding this, and their response was very, very to the point.

1874
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:36,260
We're always open to hearing what the PlayStation community is interested in to enhance their

1875
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,140
gaming experience.

1876
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,100
Done.

1877
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,340
And the lie detector test is determined.

1878
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:47,140
That was a lie because people have been harping on Sony about this cross play thing for a

1879
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:47,380
while.

1880
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,740
It happened with Rocket League.

1881
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:52,980
It's happening with Minecraft, although that one with Microsoft owning Minecraft is a little

1882
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:53,780
more dicey there.

1883
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,100
But we've had these cross play discussions before.

1884
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:00,180
Shit, we've had these discussions before when it was Microsoft that was sitting at the top

1885
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:03,780
of the heap with the Xbox 360 when the PlayStation 3 was floundering.

1886
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:11,620
And this whole thing about cross play and Microsoft not allowing it fucking gave a Sony

1887
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:14,100
Street Fighter 5 essentially at the end of the day.

1888
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:18,980
And Final Fantasy 14 is not on a Microsoft platform because they made those mistakes when

1889
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,260
Don Mattrick was in charge.

1890
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,940
And now the tables are turned.

1891
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,500
So no, you're not listening to what the gamers want.

1892
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:30,900
Like, look, I think most people generally accept because there is competition that there

1893
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,820
are things you're going to be able to play on PlayStation.

1894
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:37,220
You can't play with your friends on Microsoft and vice versa and the whole thing.

1895
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:39,380
It would be nice to see those walls come down.

1896
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:43,460
And as we've illustrated many times on this show, it has come down in the past when the

1897
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,740
companies really want it.

1898
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:51,940
IE Final Fantasy 11 is like the only thing I can think of that was like PC, Sony, Microsoft,

1899
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:52,420
all of that.

1900
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:55,460
Like back in the day, Final Fantasy 11 worked on all those things.

1901
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:56,820
Cross play is not hard.

1902
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:00,500
Okay, but now we've got this whole other complication as well.

1903
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,660
It's not just the cross play thing that's annoying.

1904
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,700
I mean, it's a little bit annoying.

1905
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:09,540
It's definitely not hard because I think at one point it was accidentally turned on on

1906
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,620
the PlayStation for you to play with.

1907
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:17,700
Yeah, but what's really annoying last month, Twitch for Twitch Prime people gave away Fortnite

1908
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:21,220
stuff and you had to basically, you know, give it get it on your account.

1909
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,900
And it's like if you have all that on your account and you've ever played it on PlayStation

1910
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:29,060
for even if it was just like once out of curiosity and you'd had to be too bad, you're fucked

1911
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,580
because you can't unlink.

1912
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,420
That's the worst part of all of this.

1913
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:37,140
In my opinion, like if Sony wants to be dicks and if they want to be like, oh, but the 80

1914
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:38,340
million gamers are over here.

1915
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:42,340
Bitch, you should know this by now.

1916
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:45,860
You can have those gamers and you can lose them just as easily.

1917
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:48,420
I got three words for you.

1918
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:50,420
Giant enemy crab.

1919
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,980
So y'all better watch yourselves on that throne because you had those 80 million gamers.

1920
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,580
You should learn by now the gamers can fucking turn on you like that, bitch.

1921
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:06,900
So my suggestion is you stop this business speak and you listen to what people are telling

1922
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:12,900
you, and that is that, you know what, when I buy shit, I want to be able to use it when

1923
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:17,380
that precedent is there that it's on, you know, it carries over my PC account to PlayStation.

1924
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:22,340
If I want to move it over to the switch because I want to play, you know, on the go at friends

1925
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:25,780
houses and stuff with Wi-Fi and I want to play on my portable console stuff and I don't

1926
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:29,540
want to be fucking locked in because I checked it out for five minutes on your console.

1927
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:33,700
Like a long time ago, then you need to like, let those people go.

1928
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:37,620
And there's a part of me as well that kind of wonders like,

1929
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:43,140
is Epic necessarily blame free in this scenario?

1930
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,340
I have this weird feeling. Call me crazy.

1931
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,220
Wouldn't be the first time.

1932
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:52,420
Epic may have set it up this way to push this issue with Sony.

1933
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:58,020
This whole thing might've been done to get gamers to needle Sony on this issue.

1934
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,500
And boy, are they needling Sony on this issue.

1935
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:03,940
Go look at any reply to a PlayStation tweet right now.

1936
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,540
They're getting needled on this issue.

1937
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:12,100
And I have to wonder, is some of that maybe Epic's doing?

1938
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:15,380
I'm sure a little bit of it is because I'm sure that they could work it in a way that,

1939
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:19,860
you know, Oh, any PlayStation exclusive items that you get on your play or whatever,

1940
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,820
are just only on that platform and not necessarily,

1941
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:26,580
you know, something you would see on another platform.

1942
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,080
Yeah.

1943
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:32,020
S2100 Matt in chat says their response was such a slap in the face to their consumers

1944
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:34,980
to have an address that seems like it was written by our president.

1945
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,020
Made no sense.

1946
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:39,780
Sure. Microsoft has messed up in the past, but had no problems making things right

1947
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,940
and communicating with their base very quickly.

1948
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,860
Sony could use a major Nelson.

1949
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:46,740
I'm telling you right now, like even with like this stuff,

1950
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:51,060
this is just between this, the way they had an old model mod support.

1951
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:55,860
And just how even like how 4k is seems to be even better on Xbox one.

1952
01:29:55,860 --> 01:30:00,180
Like I'm telling you that when the next round of consoles comes out, I'm going Microsoft.

1953
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:00,680
Yeah.

1954
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:03,940
Sony, you better watch yourself.

1955
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,180
Like seriously, this is my, this is my loving advice.

1956
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:10,260
Again, you know, I know people I'm very close with that are at Sony and I'm sure

1957
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,300
this is not their problems.

1958
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,300
This is the problems of executive decisions.

1959
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,500
So Sony executives, listen the fuck up.

1960
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:21,700
Microsoft just let you know this week, they are bringing in the troops.

1961
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:26,340
They want to snatch the crown in this next generation of gaming.

1962
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:33,140
Sony, if you keep doing dumb shit decisions like this and not, and compounding those dumb

1963
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:37,940
shit statements or dumb shit decisions with really dumb shit statements, like your response

1964
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:41,940
to this whole thing, gamers will turn on you like that.

1965
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,460
Listen to what Loki just said.

1966
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,580
So Sony, you still got a window here.

1967
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:48,120
Fix it.

1968
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,380
And yes, I am being extra sassy.

1969
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:53,140
It's the sweet 16.

1970
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:57,940
I wish that they, they would like support like the backwards compatibility and all that

1971
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:01,860
stuff because it would be nice to be able to play all these PlayStation three games

1972
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:04,100
that I have in my library that I can't play.

1973
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,620
But you know, Microsoft is doing that.

1974
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:08,580
They're supporting that.

1975
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:13,380
So, and their mod supports way better, even though both are pretty limited.

1976
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,700
I guess PC would be the winner there.

1977
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:21,540
And I mean, technically I don't need to get an Xbox one because I have a PC and I can

1978
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,060
play all her games through that.

1979
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:27,460
But I just like a lot of the games I play are multi-platform and it just seems like,

1980
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:30,500
you know, like when it comes to like Skyrim and stuff like that, like the mod supports

1981
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,000
is better.

1982
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:33,700
Bob coffee and chat will end on this and we'll move on.

1983
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,300
Cause our show's running very long.

1984
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:40,100
Bob coffee and chat says it's pretty ironic when Nintendo is more open to cross play than

1985
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,060
Sony LOL.

1986
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,420
Isn't it though?

1987
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:44,580
Isn't it though?

1988
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:49,300
Dude, do you know the other thing we haven't even brought up Loki with Nintendo and Fortnite

1989
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,780
did do we all just like there's voice chat in Fortnite on the switch.

1990
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:55,380
Yeah.

1991
01:31:55,380 --> 01:32:01,540
You just plug in any old headset and you got voice chat enabled in Fortnite on the switch.

1992
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:01,780
Yeah.

1993
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:05,380
It's like, it's so weird that the console can handle that.

1994
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:07,460
Why the fuck do I have to have a phone app?

1995
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:08,260
Hold up.

1996
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:10,340
Because that brings up a whole other thing.

1997
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:11,700
So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1998
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:17,780
So all this bullshit fuckery with the Nintendo app, this, this was all a ploy to get us to

1999
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:18,900
download your shitty app.

2000
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,660
Nintendo that only works with one game right now.

2001
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:25,380
And it's the most convoluted, stupid thing ever.

2002
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:31,300
Like that was, that was, that was the gag I was not prepared for with Fortnite on the

2003
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:34,340
switch was this secret unlocking of, Oh yeah.

2004
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,700
Voice chat's been there the whole time.

2005
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:36,580
Works just fine.

2006
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:38,740
What?

2007
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:41,620
Yeah.

2008
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,220
That I don't get like, seriously.

2009
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:44,500
No wonder more.

2010
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:48,500
Is there a network that fucking borked that they can't fucking, Oh, I'm sorry.

2011
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,980
This, we just can't do voice chat.

2012
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:53,140
Like, do they not know how?

2013
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:57,060
I mean, no, I think the reality is the answer you don't want to hear.

2014
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:03,460
Loki Nintendo is afraid of, um, pedophiles getting tied to the switch on how they met

2015
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,500
their victims.

2016
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:08,340
That in a nutshell, that is what Nintendo remember.

2017
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:13,380
Remember when, um, I don't even remember the name of that fucking app, the drawing application

2018
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,100
on 3DS.

2019
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:17,860
Remember when not picture chat picked out, whatever that thing was, the other one that

2020
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:18,820
you sent the little thing.

2021
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,820
Remember when that got on the chat?

2022
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:24,980
Remember when that got on the news in a negative light and it was pulled from all the 3DS is

2023
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:25,860
everywhere.

2024
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,460
That is the root problem.

2025
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,820
Loki, whether you want to hear it or not.

2026
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:30,740
I know, I know you don't want to hear it.

2027
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:33,940
Loki, I know you don't want to hear it, but that, I'm just keeping it real.

2028
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:36,340
That is why voice chat is a fucking problem.

2029
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:39,460
And that's such a backwards way to think nowadays.

2030
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:39,940
Swap note.

2031
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:40,180
Thank you.

2032
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:40,660
Swap note.

2033
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:44,900
That's such a backwards way to think chat from like to chat with the DS thing.

2034
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,820
What year do they think they're in?

2035
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:51,300
I mean, seriously, how many kids nowadays have access to the internet?

2036
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,100
Which is tablets and mobile devices.

2037
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,980
You're asking someone to have a fucking mobile device to chat.

2038
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:59,780
So they fucking have a access to the internet.

2039
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:05,700
Why is it that you just make it so stupidly hard to just function?

2040
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:07,380
Just go for the children.

2041
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:08,900
It's fucking dumb.

2042
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:09,400
I don't.

2043
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:13,300
It would be so easy to chat with friends only.

2044
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:15,480
Done.

2045
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,300
Exactly.

2046
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,900
And not fucking hard.

2047
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:21,620
The parental controls would allow your parents to see who's your friend.

2048
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:24,340
You have parental controls built into the fucking system.

2049
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:26,180
I don't understand what the problem is.

2050
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:28,740
D'Artezio says, I should have known that would set Loki up.

2051
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:31,860
I had to offset that positivity on Pokemon with something y'all.

2052
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:33,220
It's an anniversary show.

2053
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:33,780
Stupid.

2054
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:35,380
It's fucking dumb.

2055
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:35,620
Right.

2056
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:35,940
Shut up.

2057
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,020
Cause like they're like, though, I understand it.

2058
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:43,620
The argument was, well, the system is powerful to run these games, but it just can't do both

2059
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,460
this and voice chat at the same time.

2060
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:50,580
Even the Nintendo fans, even the most hardcore Nintendo fans on this issue, even they're

2061
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:53,060
going to be like, I really can't be mad at Loki.

2062
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:56,260
Like this is an issue Nintendo needs to evolve on.

2063
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,700
So anyway, let's move on.

2064
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,660
I got one more switch thing.

2065
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:02,180
And then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week, which of course, for an anniversary

2066
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:06,660
show, you know, dark soccer, dark soccer has picked a fun one, but, uh, the switch porting

2067
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:10,420
studio that did doom rocket league Wolfenstein.

2068
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,700
This studio is called panic button and they're doing a pretty good job.

2069
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:16,020
All these ports were really well done.

2070
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,580
Uh, they are working on something else.

2071
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:22,180
They won't say what it is, but it's another AAA switch port.

2072
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:25,940
Uh, and it's another major port that they will announce in July.

2073
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:33,140
So I wonder if there's going to be another Nintendo direct in July to possibly fill in

2074
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,380
some of these gaps we're feeling after E3.

2075
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:38,980
I don't know, but anyway, there's something else that's going to get ported to the switch.

2076
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:43,620
Lots of people thinking grand theft auto five.

2077
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:49,620
They could do the three 60 version of the game.

2078
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,180
Yeah.

2079
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:52,180
Um, cause that's how Skyrim is there.

2080
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:56,260
And that's why we don't have fallout four because follow four was the next gen game.

2081
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:59,060
So I could see grand theft auto five.

2082
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,500
That's again, that is just, I would have to pick up.

2083
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,060
I would have to pick up grand theft auto five again.

2084
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:09,620
And that would be, you know, I'd be curious to see how the online mode works in grand

2085
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:10,100
theft auto.

2086
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,220
Well, that's the problem though.

2087
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:15,780
See, it wouldn't because the grand theft auto online, they've stopped supporting the Xbox

2088
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:20,260
three 16 PlayStation three because it just, they're not supporting any more updates for

2089
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:20,340
it.

2090
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,180
So it'd be weird to see how that would work.

2091
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:23,700
You know what I want to see?

2092
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:29,060
And I would, it would go a long way in making a lot of hurt feelings, feel a lot better

2093
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:30,740
when Nintendo have boobies on their plan.

2094
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:35,940
They might, uh, mass effect trilogy on the Nintendo switch.

2095
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:40,180
That would, that would go a long way in healing some hurt that I feel in my heart.

2096
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,900
Or how about the mass effect quad trilogy?

2097
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,660
Why not destroy Andromeda in it?

2098
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:44,980
All right.

2099
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:48,100
Anyway, I know I'm reaching, I'm reaching.

2100
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:49,540
All right.

2101
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:51,700
Let's, let's take a trip back to a simpler time.

2102
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:56,900
A time when, uh, you didn't have remasters and all this stuff.

2103
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:00,500
You know, you know what you got if, if, if it was on the Nintendo and then it came out

2104
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:03,620
on the super Nintendo, it was pretty much the same damn thing.

2105
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:05,300
That's what happened in the Ninja game trilogy.

2106
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:09,860
Anyway, uh, it's the classic game of the week, dark Sakura, seven, the vault find a game

2107
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:12,180
that you think, Hey, we should be playing this week.

2108
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,780
I wish I had one of these in the vault.

2109
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:14,180
Right.

2110
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:16,420
And it's a very special 16th anniversary selection.

2111
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:19,540
It is, but it only lived for two years as a series.

2112
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:20,180
Did you know that?

2113
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:23,860
Uh, I knew it was, it kind of came and went.

2114
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:24,820
Yes, I knew that.

2115
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:26,740
It was beat mania three.

2116
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:32,740
Cause I've done beat mania and I've done excuse me.

2117
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:35,060
I ate something funny and now I have the burps.

2118
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:43,300
Um, beat mania three is, um, the followup to the beat mania series, um, by Konami.

2119
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:50,660
Um, it came out in two, actually, um, the first one came out in March of 2000.

2120
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:57,060
Um, the last one, which was beat mania three, the final came out in 2002 and had five releases

2121
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,500
though in that two year period.

2122
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:05,540
So, um, the awesome thing about beat mania three, it actually, and I really liked this.

2123
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:08,340
It had like 10 speakers in the cabinet.

2124
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,020
You had four mid range that were stacked vertically on either side of the screen, two

2125
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:16,660
subwoofers and every time, and no matter where you went to play it, it was always turned

2126
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:17,700
to the fuck down.

2127
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:20,340
This is a game that needs volume.

2128
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:20,740
Hello.

2129
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:23,780
Um, although you could also play with headphone jacks.

2130
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:27,940
Um, and it actually, two players could bring their own headphones to use their own jacks.

2131
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:31,700
Um, however it doesn't, uh, disable the external speakers.

2132
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:40,580
Um, it had, um, something, and this is actually something that made it into 2DX later on,

2133
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:45,140
was the, um, uh, major effector panel.

2134
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:48,420
Instead of just having the one effector button like the first beat mania did.

2135
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:55,300
So you had, um, echo, low pass, high pass, uh, phaser, volume based.

2136
01:38:55,300 --> 01:39:01,380
I've always mispronounced this, flanger, flanger, lo-fi, a few others like that.

2137
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:09,300
Um, and it could be, uh, applied to the background or just the sounds or both.

2138
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,260
Um, and of course you could increase the intensity of it.

2139
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:15,620
So, um, and sometimes it's the only thing that made some of these things audible.

2140
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:19,220
It also introduced the foot pedal.

2141
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:21,780
So each player got a foot pedal.

2142
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:27,860
Um, you can, um, use it to turn on or off of the, um, effectors in normal play.

2143
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:34,660
Some songs do have a, uh, a foot version that adds another column with a green note

2144
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:36,180
that you play with the foot pedal.

2145
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:41,620
Um, you can also set the foot pedal so that it can function as any one of the five keys.

2146
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:47,700
I would be really happy if it would have functioned as the spin for really crazy spins

2147
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:49,620
because it's kind of hard sometimes.

2148
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:51,540
It also had a floppy drive in it.

2149
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,140
It had a three and a half inch floppy drive.

2150
01:39:53,860 --> 01:40:00,820
And now it does have to be formatted for NTFS, um, but it would record your scores on it

2151
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:02,420
and save your status.

2152
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:07,860
Um, and then you could use it in the game again, you know, if you wanted to keep track

2153
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:10,900
of the scores or you could look at your scores on your own computer.

2154
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:15,620
Um, the disc is also required to unlock secret songs or game modes on some of the versions

2155
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,180
of the games.

2156
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:24,020
So the various versions that came out is we had Beatmania 3, Beatmania 3 append core remix,

2157
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:30,500
Beatmania 3 append 6 mix, Beatmania 3 append 7th mix and Beatmania the final.

2158
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:35,860
Which to be perfectly honest, I'd say Beatmania the final is probably the best of them.

2159
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:38,420
It's the one I've certainly seen the most of and played the most of.

2160
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:46,980
So, um, of course we've never had, uh, I mean some of the songs have been in home releases,

2161
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:51,220
but we've never actually had a Beatmania 3 dedicated home release.

2162
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:54,980
So if you want to get your Beatmania 3 on, good luck.

2163
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:59,700
Find an arcade or go to California Extreme like they have every July.

2164
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:01,220
Or domain like everyone else is doing.

2165
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:06,340
Not that we endorse that, but the reality is if Konami is going to make it hard to find,

2166
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:10,580
then I'd like to find a way to, cause you know, I still have two, five key controllers.

2167
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:15,380
So if I could find like a little converter deal, so I can use my five key controllers.

2168
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:19,940
Then again, I'd probably just go back to playing BM 98, like back in the day.

2169
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,820
I have a few of those PlayStation controllers.

2170
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:24,340
Nice.

2171
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,540
It'll be worth a try with it.

2172
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:26,660
All right.

2173
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:29,300
My five key controllers are all old PlayStation.

2174
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:30,580
There it is.

2175
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:33,380
Your classic gift of the week, Beatmania 3.

2176
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:37,780
Not to be confused with third mix, just Beatmania 3 that came and then went.

2177
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,180
But 2DX still around.

2178
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:44,020
Beatmania 2 deluxe is still around all these years later on there.

2179
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:44,660
What, what are they on?

2180
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:46,180
Like their 26th?

2181
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:48,260
I don't even, I lost fucking count at some point anyway.

2182
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:49,460
Cause they started naming them all.

2183
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:53,700
Uh, I only remember Linkle cause it's also the name of a character in Hyrule Warriors.

2184
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:54,980
It's pretty bad ass.

2185
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:55,460
All right.

2186
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:58,340
We're going to take a break, but when we come back, we got plenty more orange later.

2187
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:04,500
Orange lounge radio to come, including, uh, your calls at orange lounge radio on Skype.

2188
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:08,820
Uh, we're going to do a release dates, uh, the mailbag, and we'll talk about nudity.

2189
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:13,140
I promise when we come back with more of orange launch radio, right after this.

2190
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:25,700
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number 735 of our

2191
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:31,860
show for this June 17th of 2018, celebrating 16 years of orange lounge radio.

2192
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:37,220
Also taking a look back at E3, but also, you know, we, we have rudely been almost two hours

2193
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:42,020
into the show and have yet to say a happy father's day to all the fathers out there,

2194
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:43,380
especially our own Loki.

2195
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:43,940
Thank you.

2196
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:46,260
And of course all the father figures, et cetera, et cetera.

2197
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:47,700
You know, we don't want to leave anybody out.

2198
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:51,780
Uh, cause I can, I consider myself a daddy, uh, to Mr.

2199
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:52,580
Smush.

2200
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:53,700
Get your mind out of the gutter.

2201
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:58,260
I know a few daddies, but a happy father's day to all the daddies out there as well.

2202
01:42:58,260 --> 01:42:58,900
Wink.

2203
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:03,220
So, you know, anyway, but no, in all seriousness, I hope everybody's having a good day.

2204
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:06,980
Uh, that was the joke.

2205
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:11,620
Uh, my, uh, my own dad, uh, he went to universal studios for the first time today.

2206
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:16,740
I took him to the airport to go to long beach, uh, which he, he never really would fly a

2207
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:20,580
lot before, but he went, he flew to long beach to visit my sister, which is where she lives.

2208
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:26,340
And she took them and like long beach to, to north of LA where universal is, is not

2209
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:27,220
exactly close.

2210
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:27,700
So Mr.

2211
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:30,820
Driven an hour up there, but they went to universal studios and I'm kind of impressed.

2212
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:36,900
Now, my dad, my dad is, you know, he's, he was, when I was born, he was pushing 40.

2213
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:40,100
So he's, he's like 78, 79 at this point.

2214
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:43,140
So, um, he wasn't exactly going to ride all this right.

2215
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:45,620
So he didn't ride the Harry Potter ride, but he did do the studio tour.

2216
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:49,220
I was pretty, I was pretty happy to hear that they did all that kind of cheesy stuff.

2217
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,060
So, uh, really cool.

2218
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:55,860
So anyway, uh, looking at our chat room, uh, Rama says, since today is father's day and

2219
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:59,860
OLR and OLR 16th birthday, who is OLR's dad?

2220
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:03,300
Uh, it was established, uh, you might've missed it, but during the, uh, Bobby call and then

2221
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:06,820
thereafter, uh, Travis Donovan would be our, our daddy.

2222
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:09,860
And when you say it, you can't say he's the dad.

2223
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:15,220
If I, you have to say daddy, Loki shaking his head over there.

2224
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:16,260
All right.

2225
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:23,540
Anyway, moving on, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and, uh, some other video

2226
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:26,740
games that you and your daddy can look forward to soon.

2227
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:28,820
Loki, start us off, please.

2228
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:34,980
It's disturbing, but, or as Dungeon Buster says, big daddy Donovan.

2229
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:37,780
All right.

2230
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:43,380
So apparently some modders of the game Bloodborne have discovered that there is a cut boss rush

2231
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:44,660
mode in the game.

2232
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:49,380
And these actually appeared in some test, uh, arena maps that were actually labeled

2233
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:52,740
as boss rusher in Japanese.

2234
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:58,580
Um, they were apparently some holy, uh, optional dungeons.

2235
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:04,100
And they talked about like some of the different things that were in there that showed that

2236
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,500
it was kind of before the game's release.

2237
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:09,460
And actually some of this stuff actually had come out in one of the, I don't know if it

2238
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:14,980
was an update or DLC that they had found, but they got it working a little bit to where

2239
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:18,180
some of the actual bosses spawn, but it's just not finished.

2240
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:21,940
Kind of neat to see, you know, that was something that was in development, but too bad it never

2241
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:22,740
made the final game.

2242
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:28,100
And then, um, call of duty black house four.

2243
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:28,660
Oh yeah.

2244
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:34,420
You may remember call of duty black house four decided that, you know, it was not going

2245
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:38,420
to have a single player campaign and said, they're going the route of it's going to have

2246
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:42,900
multiplayer, it's going to have a battle royale and that's that.

2247
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:47,060
Well, it's also going to have a season pass because they want all of the money.

2248
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:51,380
And, uh, what's going to be kind of different about this season pass, which they're calling

2249
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:58,340
the black ops pass, um, is that the maps, instead of being released, it's 12 multiplayer

2250
01:45:58,340 --> 01:45:58,660
maps.

2251
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:04,420
So in four zombie maps, instead of releasing them in map packs, like they have in previous,

2252
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:09,860
you know, releases so that, because basically in order to be able to play one of these,

2253
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:13,780
you have to be able to have the same maps as the person you're playing it.

2254
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:18,340
So say, you know, I bought the season pass and my friend did not buy the season pass.

2255
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:22,020
He would not be able to play with me unless he bought the same maps that we were going

2256
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:22,660
to be playing on.

2257
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:27,540
So instead of releasing these maps in map packs, which would be like four maps each

2258
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:32,980
and charging a flat fee for that, they are releasing them individually.

2259
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:41,700
So you have to buy, um, these individual map packs, I guess for 14 99 each, which I'm wondering,

2260
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:47,860
you know, how many is going to come in these map packs in, uh, the season pass itself is

2261
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:51,780
49 99 and it's apparently not going to be available.

2262
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:54,100
Okay, now I'm getting confused here.

2263
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:57,860
So, oh, they're talking about in the past.

2264
01:46:57,860 --> 01:47:05,060
Okay. So, um, the season pass or black ops pass right now, how much is that?

2265
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:10,020
I'm not sure, but it's additional money on top of the game itself, but they're selling

2266
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:11,220
the maps individually.

2267
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:15,940
So if you want to play, instead of buying the map pass for like 14 99 for four maps,

2268
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:19,460
you're going to have to buy each one individually, which is going to split the player base that

2269
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:25,220
much more because, you know, I may have maps one, two, and three, and, you know, the other

2270
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:30,020
person has two, three, and four, and now I can't play, you know, half of the maps with

2271
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:30,980
the other person.

2272
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:32,420
So that kind of sucks.

2273
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:39,140
Um, and apparently the issue also is this black ops pass.

2274
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:40,740
It's not going to be available after launch.

2275
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:44,500
It's only a pre-order thing, apparently.

2276
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,220
So that's a dungeon.

2277
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:48,580
Buster's kind of saying in chat is that the black ops pass is literally all or nothing

2278
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:50,900
and it isn't initially available at launch.

2279
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:54,020
You need to spring for one of the more expensive versions to get in on it for now.

2280
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:55,160
Yeah.

2281
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:56,820
So that's lame.

2282
01:47:56,820 --> 01:48:00,180
And it, they're coming out, you know, slowly as it progresses.

2283
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:01,700
I don't know.

2284
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:07,220
I am really not interested in black ops four just because of this and the lack of a single

2285
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:07,940
player campaign.

2286
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:13,380
So I'll just wait for the best of, you know, they I'll wait for the gone sale.

2287
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,860
The, the, the year of definitive edition.

2288
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:17,300
I don't even do that anymore.

2289
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:21,060
Like the, the definitive editions that they released or the previously released, it's

2290
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:24,820
like, Oh, we have the first map pack in there for you.

2291
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:27,620
Oh, but you got to buy the rest if you want to play all the maps.

2292
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:31,460
Fuck Activision is what the moral of the story is here.

2293
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:36,340
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I actually played some of black ops three single player

2294
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:39,780
campaign when it was on PlayStation plus I didn't realize it was 70 gigs.

2295
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,540
I spent almost one 10th of my bandwidth cap on fucking call of duty.

2296
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:44,260
Oh shit.

2297
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:44,660
Yeah.

2298
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:46,180
Good thing I haven't downloaded that yet.

2299
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:46,900
All right.

2300
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:48,820
Anyway, let's talk a little bit about kingdom hearts.

2301
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:51,780
We already mentioned, I was going to mention here the official release date in January

2302
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:55,620
2019, but we kind of covered that earlier, but maybe some of you were wondering why did

2303
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:56,820
they bump it to 2019?

2304
01:48:57,460 --> 01:49:01,940
Well, in an interview with Tetsuya Nomura, uh, he was talking about with IGN, uh, why

2305
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:03,060
this delay happened.

2306
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:06,900
The timing of the release that we actually are looking at, we were told by many people,

2307
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:11,780
including hardware manufacturers, marketing teams, sales teams, that it just wasn't good

2308
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:12,660
timing in the year.

2309
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:17,220
He also mentioned that there are differences in holiday links and store behavior in different

2310
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:17,780
regions.

2311
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:21,300
And I suppose that's something to consider, uh, for kingdom hearts three, the square enix

2312
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:26,100
Western offices had requested to release the game as simultaneously as much as possible

2313
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,860
between Japan and America.

2314
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:32,980
So we were no longer able to just think about Japanese issues and retail situations.

2315
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,820
Kind of an interesting point.

2316
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:37,220
Kingdom hearts three is also a big deal in Japan.

2317
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:41,220
Christmas is not the same thing in Japan as it is here.

2318
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:46,260
I mean, you might have a lovely cake, but it's not quite that same holiday season like

2319
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:46,980
we have here.

2320
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:50,980
So a January, 2019 release in Japan, not as big of a deal.

2321
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:51,700
You know what I mean?

2322
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,020
Yeah.

2323
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:55,780
So that from that element, I'm like, okay, that actually makes a lot of sense.

2324
01:49:55,780 --> 01:50:00,660
Even though I was already in the camp of just get it right, bitches, just, you know, just

2325
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:03,620
don't have to do all these patches post release.

2326
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:08,020
Um, there were other considerations that went into January, 2019 as well.

2327
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:12,020
We of course considered maybe speeding up development to release earlier than that would

2328
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:15,780
when we were told that wasn't good, but the development team said, nope, we just couldn't

2329
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:16,100
do that.

2330
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:18,500
We could delay it, but we couldn't make it any sooner.

2331
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,020
So they're not going to delay it obviously.

2332
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:21,140
So there it is.

2333
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:24,500
Uh, and they've also said on big hero six, a little tidbit.

2334
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:27,220
We pretty much have finished creating all the gameplay within that world.

2335
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:29,380
We're just not finished with the cut scenes yet.

2336
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:33,140
They're not finished with the cut scenes and it's fucking like July or getting to get to

2337
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:33,780
almost July.

2338
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:38,260
By the time we have another episode, like, wow, I guess so.

2339
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:38,980
I guess so.

2340
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:43,380
I guess if they have the engine six, seven months, I mean, I guess that's true.

2341
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:43,780
It's true.

2342
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:47,940
I'm just a little surprised to hear we're not really in like, kind of like fix it all

2343
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:48,260
up mode.

2344
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:49,700
What are they supposed to do in seven months?

2345
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,340
Yeah.

2346
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:50,660
All right.

2347
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:54,660
Anyway, uh, also one thing to keep in mind if you are looking forward to blood stained

2348
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:58,420
ritual of the night, which, uh, Bradley brought up the eight spit eight bit spinoff earlier,

2349
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:02,820
but obviously this is all kind of a prelude to the more symphony of the night type of

2350
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:03,940
a blood stain game.

2351
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:09,860
Uh, it will be releasing on Vita, but it's only going to be digital only, uh, is what

2352
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:10,580
it sounds like.

2353
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:14,820
And by the way, this is a little bit of a muddy issue right now because the original

2354
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:19,780
report on this was actually updated after it came out saying it said on a slide that

2355
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,180
it was Vita is digital only.

2356
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:27,860
Uh, but apparently, uh, and a PR representative, uh, confirmed it, but then representatives

2357
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:33,140
from bloodstain to said they're trying to make Vita copies for backers working, uh,

2358
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:36,900
even though Sony is apparently ending physical media production for the platform in the West.

2359
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:40,660
So it sounds like the issue is a little bit more complicated, but it sounds like it's

2360
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:44,420
going to be a lot easier to get digitally than it will anywhere else.

2361
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:45,460
Um, so there you go.

2362
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:47,300
But blood stain, I'm looking forward to it.

2363
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:50,340
I don't know if the Vita would have been my platform of choice, but I know a lot of

2364
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:54,820
people, uh, really love the Vita, but, uh, I think a lot of people have moved on to Vita's

2365
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:56,740
successor, uh, the Nintendo switch.

2366
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:59,460
Anyway, dark Sakura.

2367
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:02,020
Uh, what do you have for us in a rapid fire toast?

2368
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:03,460
Yay.

2369
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:04,740
And not avocado.

2370
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:09,380
Even though it was on the menu at that place, I almost ordered avocado toast because even

2371
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:11,540
though I'm turning 40, some days I want to be a millennial.

2372
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:13,160
Xenial.

2373
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:16,580
I'm never going to use that term, but you just did.

2374
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:16,820
All right.

2375
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:18,820
Anyway, I was using it ironically.

2376
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:20,100
That was so hipster of me.

2377
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:20,660
I know.

2378
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:21,140
Fine.

2379
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:29,300
Um, anyway, um, there is a Sonic the Hedgehog toaster that is on the, um, Sega store, Sega

2380
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,340
shop, sorry.

2381
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:31,780
Um, it's $35.

2382
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:34,340
And if a thousand people don't order one, no one's getting one.

2383
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:40,740
So if you want your toaster to burn Sonic's face onto your Wonder bread, then.

2384
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:42,820
I kind of do.

2385
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:44,420
Got a toast fast.

2386
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:49,220
Although I do have a Hello Kitty toaster that I've used maybe twice in my life.

2387
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:51,300
I have a nice toaster.

2388
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:56,820
It's by like a normal company and it's red and matches my fucking kitchen.

2389
01:52:57,380 --> 01:53:00,100
We have a toaster oven that we use for pretty much everything.

2390
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:01,300
As I'm sure a lot of people do.

2391
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:05,860
I linked the link to the toaster in the chat room.

2392
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:07,220
It's okay.

2393
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:13,220
So according to this, that if everyone does that, they've sold 561 out of a thousand.

2394
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:17,620
And if they sell them, they're going to ship by October 1st.

2395
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:24,100
But only if they make the a thousand, if they don't do a thousand, nobody gets any good.

2396
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:24,740
No Sonic.

2397
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:25,380
Wow.

2398
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:28,500
Talk about a book or a page out of Konami's book.

2399
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:29,700
Wheel of bullshit.

2400
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:34,500
You'll just have to wait for somebody to come out with the unofficial Sanic toaster.

2401
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,540
You know what I'll do?

2402
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:41,700
I will slice up some avocado and put it into a pastry bag and draw a fucking Sonic myself.

2403
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:43,940
And it will look a bajillion.

2404
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:47,460
It'll look like Sonic adventure, Sonic, and not just like the Sonic team logo.

2405
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:49,380
Then my toast will have avocado on it.

2406
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:49,940
I'm not sure.

2407
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:51,380
Who said that's your fucking toast?

2408
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:52,580
That's my toast, bitch.

2409
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:59,780
My toast is going to have delicious avocado with Sonic's face.

2410
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,380
You make your own goddamn sandwich.

2411
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:01,940
That's right.

2412
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,220
You can make yours out of mustard.

2413
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:09,940
That's I feel like it will make you some whipped butter and you can have a yellow Sonic.

2414
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,860
Not that I ever want to have Biggs the cat.

2415
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:14,820
Not that I ever want to talk about Jamie's obituary, but you know,

2416
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:19,300
like years and years and years from now, I feel like the obituary should say, you know,

2417
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:22,980
Jamie, last name, such and such day, such and such date, and then put,

2418
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:24,580
you can make your own goddamn sandwich.

2419
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:27,160
That's it.

2420
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:37,300
I want that to be if, if I don't do my, my tree pod burial in a protected land.

2421
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:41,620
Cause you know that if you, if your body is buried on a reserve,

2422
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:45,380
then that becomes a federally protected land that cannot be overridden.

2423
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:45,880
True story.

2424
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,900
So that's, what's going to happen to me, but you can make like

2425
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:52,660
my temporary grave marker say, fuck your toast.

2426
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:53,940
Your Memorial.

2427
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:58,100
Or as Act Deft and Jack says, uh, Oh, bitch you airy.

2428
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,060
Obituary.

2429
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,820
That just reminds me of a really bad joke I learned in the eighties.

2430
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:04,900
Now, you know, I'm going to ask.

2431
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:05,940
Okay.

2432
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:10,500
So the bear walks into a bar and he's like, I want some vodka.

2433
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:15,460
And the, uh, bartender, the bartender says, we don't serve bears.

2434
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:17,220
And the bear's like, well, if you don't give me some vodka,

2435
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:18,820
I'm going to eat this woman over here.

2436
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:21,860
Bartender's like, we still don't serve bears.

2437
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:27,140
So the bear ate the lady and the bartender's like, and so the bear's like,

2438
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:29,700
okay, give me some fucking vodka now.

2439
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:32,820
And he's like, I can't, we don't serve, uh, drug users.

2440
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:35,780
What the bear says that was a bar bitch.

2441
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:46,980
You ate, I hate it.

2442
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:50,340
I heard that in elementary school.

2443
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:51,300
Oh God.

2444
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:54,660
Oh, Hey, sorry.

2445
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:55,060
Everybody.

2446
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,660
Oh, LR is canceled.

2447
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:58,420
I hope we had a great run.

2448
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:01,860
Really great with that is where I draw as father as his father's day.

2449
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:04,260
That was the ultimate of dirty dad jokes.

2450
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:04,740
There you go.

2451
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:06,100
All right.

2452
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,220
Oh, LR is canceled.

2453
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:08,100
Good night.

2454
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,900
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

2455
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:11,700
Bite my butt.

2456
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:15,140
I can tell you the one about the foo poo bird.

2457
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:16,660
No, no more jokes.

2458
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,060
Don't you have a story on soul caliber?

2459
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:26,180
Well, you know why the clock is considered a bad person to have at a buffet?

2460
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:27,940
He goes back four seconds.

2461
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:32,100
What do you do with a chemist when he dies?

2462
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:32,600
Stop it.

2463
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:33,980
Bury him.

2464
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:36,120
Okay.

2465
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:40,200
So the other piece of news I'll just do it quick is so caliber six has a release date.

2466
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,600
It's what happens when you started working with drew.

2467
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:43,160
I know it.

2468
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:43,720
I know it.

2469
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:45,640
No, no, he did this to you.

2470
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:46,840
He did this to you.

2471
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:49,240
That joke predates his birth.

2472
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:52,120
Oh my God.

2473
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,320
He's learned how to time travel.

2474
01:56:55,480 --> 01:57:00,120
Some of the jokes I learned from my uncle and my uncle for not having any kids is definitely

2475
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,240
the master of dad jokes.

2476
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,720
Soul caliber six.

2477
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:05,800
You need to look at chat at some point.

2478
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:09,000
I am sad to announce the cancellation of orange lounge radio.

2479
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,840
16 years was a great run.

2480
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:13,400
After 16 years, we've reached peak status.

2481
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:14,920
Oh, Bobby did one of my favorites.

2482
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:17,800
Bobby black will show will be four hours every Sunday night.

2483
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:20,120
Bobby said, do you want to hear a joke about sodium?

2484
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:22,680
Nah, please.

2485
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,880
For the love of God.

2486
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:27,880
Do I was trying to, and then you were harassing me.

2487
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:29,240
Mr. Smoosh, come tell you.

2488
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,760
I was harassing you.

2489
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:36,840
Come tell your daddy to STF years have been physically assaulted with a deadly pepper.

2490
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:44,600
Anyway, so caliber six has a release date of October 19th, 2018.

2491
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:47,960
They put out a story mode trailer, which I haven't watched because I've been interested

2492
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:49,080
in soul caliber since two.

2493
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,760
Um, and, uh, yeah.

2494
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:57,720
Soul caliber on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC.

2495
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:00,360
So caliber four was pretty good and I can't wait for six.

2496
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,760
I feel like the even numbered ones are good.

2497
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:07,720
Soul caliber, by the way, introduced a very crazy in joke in my house.

2498
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:08,360
Not a pun.

2499
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:13,160
We just used to give everyone weird names, but the only one of them that is stuck is

2500
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:14,040
Bob Astor off.

2501
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:16,200
I'm Bob.

2502
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:17,320
Bob Astor off.

2503
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:19,560
You may know me from such games as soul Cal.

2504
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:24,840
We would do like these whole intros as Bob Astor off in my house.

2505
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:26,200
It was just me and Dan.

2506
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,120
So Bob Astor off.

2507
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:28,440
All right.

2508
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:29,080
I'll remember that.

2509
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:30,120
It's better than the other jokes.

2510
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,160
Nightmare.

2511
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:31,660
All right.

2512
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:37,640
I, we would do like, like Julia Sofia would just come up with like crazy names.

2513
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:38,440
So anyway, that's all.

2514
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:42,200
But then I think a Tekken when you bring up Julia, Julia Chang was great.

2515
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,000
Anyway.

2516
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:43,240
All right.

2517
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,720
And then she decided to be a wrestler.

2518
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,280
She'd had her costume.

2519
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:49,960
Let's travel around the world and check out some games.

2520
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,040
We'll be playing a little sooner than soul caliber six.

2521
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:53,480
All right.

2522
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:56,200
And we should go to the end of the month for this since we're not going to be here.

2523
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:59,240
Uh, yeah, we can do that if you want to go over a couple of weeks.

2524
01:58:59,240 --> 01:58:59,560
All right.

2525
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:01,880
It's not gonna be much more, but let's do it.

2526
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:07,080
Uh, the lost child is coming out in the switch PlayStation four in the Vita.

2527
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:09,560
A game called Musenix.

2528
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:11,160
Musenix.

2529
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:13,800
I thought that's what I take when I have a cold.

2530
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:15,960
It's like Muse musics.

2531
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:18,440
They spelled it really wrong.

2532
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:19,640
It's a rhythm game.

2533
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:20,840
It's coming out on the switch.

2534
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:25,640
Mustnix Vegas party on the switch.

2535
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:26,440
It's a card game.

2536
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:35,880
And then we've got Mario tennis aces on the switch and new Gundam breaker on PlayStation four.

2537
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:44,600
And then we've got, um, the following week, the blob remastered on the switch hunting

2538
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:47,560
simulator on the switch.

2539
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,880
Do we really have to label everything as a simulator?

2540
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:54,120
Because obviously if you're playing a hunting game on a console, it's probably not hunting

2541
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:54,760
real animals.

2542
01:59:55,560 --> 02:00:02,520
Um, and then of course, luminous remastered that's coming out on PC, Xbox one, the only

2543
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:06,200
thing I need near automata on Xbox one.

2544
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:10,920
The other thing I need, which is an Android simulator, uh, the awesome adventures of captain

2545
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,800
spirit on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

2546
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:18,680
That's free and ease eight, uh, like Ramosa Donna on the switch.

2547
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:23,960
And then if we're going to finish up the month, then let's just go ahead and do MotoGP 18.

2548
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:32,280
Crash bandicoot insane trilogy on PC switch and Xbox one, the crew two on PC, PlayStation

2549
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:39,240
four and Xbox one, the Vita, which is going to be getting, um, psychedelic, uh, of the

2550
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:40,040
ashen Hawk.

2551
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:43,640
And that's a visual novel surprise.

2552
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:47,000
And then finally on the switch Wolfenstein two, the new Colossus.

2553
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:48,440
Okay.

2554
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:51,880
And if they can do Wolfenstein two, the new Colossus, which is an excellent game that

2555
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:53,160
maybe they can do fallout for.

2556
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:55,240
Did you mention on tempest?

2557
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:58,680
4,000 is coming out on PlayStation four on June 26.

2558
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:02,520
I didn't realize that it was also coming out on my birthday on the list.

2559
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:06,440
It's on my other list is my Japanese list has some other stuff from other countries.

2560
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:08,760
Did you know they're making a tempest 4,000 Jamie?

2561
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:11,960
I remember it's one of those things like now that I see it, I'm like, Oh yeah, that was

2562
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,000
the thing that's happening.

2563
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,520
So I want to check that out.

2564
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:15,720
I love me some tempest.

2565
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:16,200
Yeah.

2566
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:16,520
All right.

2567
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:19,480
Anyway, uh, let's look at Japan and some of the releases for this month.

2568
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:23,800
So in Japan, we have new Gundam breaker, uh, in a regular and several different types of

2569
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:26,200
limited editions because they love their limited editions over there.

2570
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:27,960
That is out on June the 21st.

2571
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:34,920
And then closing out the month on the 28th, we have Tonari ni Kanoujo no Uru Shiwaze

2572
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:38,120
Winter Guest in a regular and limited edition out in Japan.

2573
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:41,400
Tonari means like neighbor something.

2574
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:41,900
Yeah.

2575
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:47,640
And then Island, a game called Island is also out in Japan and that is also on the 28th.

2576
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:52,200
Although oddly, um, I guess it's a worldwide release because, uh, the crew too gets a Japanese

2577
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,360
release on June the 29th.

2578
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:56,680
So that is all on the PlayStation 4.

2579
02:01:56,680 --> 02:02:00,600
Um, taking a look quickly at the Nintendo switch and seeing what's out there.

2580
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:05,000
Uh, we have, um, uh, a mahjong game that's coming out.

2581
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,480
I'm sure you're all excited for that on the 21st, but also a Minecraft switch release,

2582
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:11,560
uh, in Japan on June the 21st.

2583
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:14,920
And then we have Mario Tennis Ace on June the 22nd.

2584
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:18,520
So you Waluigi fans can at least, uh, have something, uh, to hold you over.

2585
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:23,400
So that is out on, uh, the same day that it comes out in the rest of the world, the 22nd of June.

2586
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:29,160
And then also in Japan, a game called Sheen, uh, on June 28th, as well as Ys VIII,

2587
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:33,400
Lacrimosa of Dana on, uh, the 28th as well.

2588
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:34,520
How about Europe, Dark Sakura?

2589
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:39,320
Mario Tennis Aces coming out on June 22nd.

2590
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:44,440
Also on the 22nd is Harvest Moon, Light of Hope for Switch and PlayStation.

2591
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,960
Um, on the 29th, moving forward, we have The Crew 2 for PlayStation and Xbox.

2592
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:56,360
We have Wolfenstein 2, The New Colossus for Switch on the 29th.

2593
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,720
Actually, the rest of these are on the 29th.

2594
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:00,440
We have Song of Memories for Switch and PlayStation,

2595
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:04,520
Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy for Xbox, Switch, and PC.

2596
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:07,880
Um, then that's it.

2597
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:09,560
I almost went a little bit further, so that's all.

2598
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:12,760
All right.

2599
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:14,280
Let's, uh, let's go to the mailbag.

2600
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:17,400
Every week you guys email us and, uh, sometimes we read them.

2601
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:22,760
No, we always read them, uh, most of the time, as long as it isn't spam or something that

2602
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:24,360
you say, don't read this on air.

2603
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:25,240
We'll read it on air.

2604
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:29,560
So, um, or like we have had some weeks where we get like eight emails all at once and sometimes

2605
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:32,360
we have to edit a little bit, but this week I think we just have one or two.

2606
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:34,600
So Dark Sakura is going to dive into the mailbag right now.

2607
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:38,760
And if you want to send us an email, participate at orange.trader.com, especially since you

2608
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:42,760
have two weeks, I would love to hear your stories about how long you've been listening

2609
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:48,200
to OLR and like, if you have a favorite moment, um, from the past 16 years, or is the tweet

2610
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:50,920
that we just got said, uh, what was this?

2611
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:55,800
Uh, dark Tetsuya is saying, just have to say the whole joke tangent from earlier is why

2612
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,800
I still do the show this many years later.

2613
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:00,600
I got a joke for you.

2614
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:01,000
There you go.

2615
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,440
Moving on, uh, emails.

2616
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:05,080
All right.

2617
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:07,480
This comes from, um, Ron Chan.

2618
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:11,240
Um, good afternoon, Rob, Jamie and Matt.

2619
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:13,240
How are you all also happy pride.

2620
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:13,960
Thank you.

2621
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:14,360
Super.

2622
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:15,160
Thanks for asking.

2623
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:18,360
The last three or so weeks, my life has been hectic.

2624
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:20,200
So I'm very thankful for podcasts.

2625
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:25,800
Instead of calling in and discussing topics, we best to send an email one valve and visual

2626
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:26,360
novels.

2627
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:28,760
A part of me feels like valve shouldn't carry these titles.

2628
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:32,440
Visual novels are more like an interactive book, like a choose your own adventure style

2629
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:32,920
book.

2630
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:34,680
The visual novels are akin to dating.

2631
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:39,800
So I can see why they're on steam, but a lot do contain content in there.

2632
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:44,360
Maybe this would just be a perfect time for, for valve to spin off a site just for that.

2633
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:48,600
But valve, just like Twitch, they have a neutral slash gray area side.

2634
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:53,080
When it comes to adult content, one voice actress said, censorship of sex and lobbying

2635
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:56,920
against sexual material is a big reason people struggle with sex positivity.

2636
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:58,760
You can find more in detail on this link.

2637
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:00,040
I will put it in the chat.

2638
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:02,120
Unless Ron Sean already does.

2639
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:07,000
On the plus side, we do have Faku's gaming site that will handle these mature titles

2640
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:07,480
as well.

2641
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:11,080
Two, retro gaming.

2642
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:15,720
I always said that I wanted to see Sega come back with a Linux-powered Dreamcast 2 system

2643
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:20,440
with USB ports for controllers and a DVD drive that plays DVDs and GD disks.

2644
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:21,820
Excuse me.

2645
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:27,800
The closest that we have is the Atari VCS and the new Intellivision retro consoles.

2646
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:30,280
Truth be told, I like the Atari VCS.

2647
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,520
It's the first gaming system I ever played on.

2648
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:33,560
I do kind of want one.

2649
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:37,960
With the rise of retro games, I feel there's plenty of room in the ecosystem for more consoles.

2650
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:39,880
They aren't competing with the big three.

2651
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,760
I'm very skeptical of the price, but it's a wait and see for me.

2652
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:47,080
It does sound like the Atari VCS will achieve what Gabe Newell tried with steam machines.

2653
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:51,160
Three, PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5.

2654
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:55,480
Given that the PS4 is only five years old, I really don't believe Sony's saying that

2655
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:57,960
the console is winding down to the end of reproduction cycle.

2656
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:00,920
Sorry, production cycle, not reproduction.

2657
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:04,840
As for the rumors of the next system going rise in, I'm not really believing that.

2658
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:07,800
When the PS4 came out, it was $399.

2659
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:11,480
If they go rise in, expect the price to jump to $599.

2660
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:12,520
Four, JD Roth.

2661
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:16,280
I remember that y'all talked about him and some of his endeavors in reality shows,

2662
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,680
but here's a couple of things you might not have known.

2663
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,680
He was a host of the game show fun.

2664
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:21,640
We knew that.

2665
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:24,600
He was a host of the game show fun house, which was similar to Double Dare.

2666
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:26,920
Here's a couple of clips below.

2667
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:30,440
The show spun off another series called Fox's Fun House.

2668
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:32,120
I didn't grow up in the 90s.

2669
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:34,920
My friend wanted me to go on that show with him and I said no.

2670
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:38,280
College Madhouse and Fun House UK, which ran for 10 years.

2671
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:41,400
I'll copy and paste stuff in a bit.

2672
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:42,840
Nothing to confuse with TV Fun House.

2673
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,280
Unless Rob, you would care to go into the mailbag and copy and paste all those links for me.

2674
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:47,720
Uh, I can try.

2675
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:53,960
I just, for the live folks, Winamp straight up crashed at the end of that song and killed the

2676
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:54,520
stream.

2677
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,240
So weird.

2678
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:55,640
Great.

2679
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,760
So we've, we've been down while you were reading most of that email, but sorry.

2680
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:00,120
Well, the podcast folks hear it.

2681
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:00,620
Okay.

2682
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:02,840
Um, five, Microsoft.

2683
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:04,680
I admit they dropped the ball on exclusive titles.

2684
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:07,400
Um, they really need to play catch up on that.

2685
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:12,280
As for reducing the cost of Xbox live, I doubt that since Microsoft builds and maintains the

2686
02:07:12,280 --> 02:07:17,000
servers for all online games on their consoles, except for MMOs, a price reduction maybe,

2687
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,040
but nothing more than that.

2688
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:19,800
Six, Battlefield.

2689
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,160
Jamie, you nailed that.

2690
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:22,520
Yeah, of course I did.

2691
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:23,960
Even I learned a few new things.

2692
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:27,480
The problem is that history is so selective on what's taught in public schools that some

2693
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:31,720
people refuse to learn on what actually, what really happened.

2694
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:33,080
No shocker there.

2695
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:38,200
And by the way, I'd like to just take this moment for people to go up and just research

2696
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:39,000
the night witches.

2697
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:44,040
I might've brought it up on the show the other week I was here, but these were women who

2698
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:48,760
would cut the power to their planes, coast in on idle and bomb the fuck out of Germany.

2699
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:54,200
The official Reddit for the battlefield thing foot, put their foot down this week and said,

2700
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,600
no more posts about historical inaccuracy.

2701
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:57,320
Shut up.

2702
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:58,680
Basic in a nutshell.

2703
02:07:58,680 --> 02:07:59,560
This is battlefield.

2704
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:03,560
We're talking about a game where it's very known that people eject out of their plane,

2705
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:07,080
shoot someone with a rocket launcher and land back in their plane and fly away.

2706
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:07,720
Come on.

2707
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:08,600
I did that yesterday.

2708
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:11,160
I think that's it.

2709
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:11,560
Oh yeah.

2710
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:12,200
One more thing.

2711
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:13,400
Rob Loki was right.

2712
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:14,440
I'm disappointed in you.

2713
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:20,520
I think you should look up gravitation, uh, Yurikama Arashi and Dramatical Murder.

2714
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:25,240
Oh, if you want to know more about some grade A yaoi titles, just ask Mako-chan.

2715
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,800
Uh, I'll just stick to like X-tube.

2716
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:35,960
For the record, for the record, I do have like episodes of like D gray man and, you

2717
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:38,520
know, uh, sensitive pornography.

2718
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:41,000
I just didn't know there were video games out.

2719
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,360
I didn't know it went all the way to clearly I'm aware there's a whole convention.

2720
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:46,200
I'm aware there's manga.

2721
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:49,560
I'm aware that if you think of it, it exists.

2722
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:51,640
However, I was not aware there was a video game.

2723
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:51,880
That's all.

2724
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:52,280
That's all.

2725
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:53,640
That was the, that was the news to me.

2726
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:55,320
I'm glad it's there.

2727
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:58,920
Do you want to watch little boys touching each other?

2728
02:08:58,920 --> 02:08:59,160
No.

2729
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:00,920
Good.

2730
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:01,720
That's the right answer.

2731
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:03,240
Yeah, that's it.

2732
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:08,200
I do not like the was, they call it shota creepy.

2733
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:09,640
Um, yeah, that's it.

2734
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:12,840
My apologies on bad spelling punctuations and grammar.

2735
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:16,440
Actually, dude, your article, your email is pretty nice.

2736
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,800
I knew that there was more I wanted to talk about, but it's been,

2737
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:25,000
but it's been three weeks and I have spent three or days.

2738
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,080
I guess that should be three or more flops.

2739
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:29,800
The grammar right at the end, working on this email at work.

2740
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,400
Cause y'all are worth it.

2741
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:33,480
See you all on the flip side.

2742
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:34,120
Rama.

2743
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:35,800
He has an exclamation point.

2744
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,200
Run.

2745
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:39,480
I don't know what else.

2746
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:42,280
There was a lot to cover in this email here.

2747
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:48,120
Um, I, I still think there's going to be changes with Xbox live, but I don't know.

2748
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:51,640
Maybe, maybe Microsoft's going to try to position this a different way,

2749
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:53,960
especially the studio acquisitions really change a lot.

2750
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:54,760
So we'll see.

2751
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:59,240
I still think if they really want to have an impact, they would merge that.

2752
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:03,000
And their past that Xbox game pass, I think would really say a lot.

2753
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,600
Uh, that's, that's all.

2754
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:07,240
Um, but then, uh, what else?

2755
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:10,760
The, uh, PlayStation four to PlayStation five and that whole thing.

2756
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:13,160
I think it's all 2020 at this point.

2757
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:16,520
I don't think next year, next year you might get some teases,

2758
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:19,000
but I think 2020 is going to be the year it all goes down.

2759
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:23,640
But not Nintendo, although Nintendo, I would anticipate is going to do a switch

2760
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:28,520
deluxe or like some type of, you know, how they do the new 3DS.

2761
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:32,120
There'll be something with the switch in a couple of years.

2762
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:36,120
But anyway, last email.

2763
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:37,720
Cause we got one in the interim.

2764
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:37,960
Okay.

2765
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,120
Uh, good evening you guys.

2766
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:41,960
Well, E3 is done for another year.

2767
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:43,400
Some surprises, some shockers.

2768
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:45,400
I know quite a few games have gotten my interest.

2769
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:47,480
Excuse me.

2770
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:53,320
Nioh 2, Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Control, Resident Evil 2 remake.

2771
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:54,840
I'm actually kind of looking forward to that.

2772
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:59,080
Rage 2, Forza Horizon 4, Cuphead, The Last Course DLC,

2773
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:05,080
Ghost of Tsushima, Metal Wolf Chaos, and Battlefield 5 for starters.

2774
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:07,880
I thought the press conferences weren't as good in previous years.

2775
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:10,280
Maybe it's because the overall delivery wasn't great.

2776
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:14,280
Change of venue that set the tone or something, who knows.

2777
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:18,520
The Sony presentation of The Last of Us 2 got people mad quiet when it ended.

2778
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:22,760
I was surprised that, I was surprised that barely applauded.

2779
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:26,360
Xbox is still hurting for exclusives and Nintendo did a great job.

2780
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:28,440
Anyways, that's just my thoughts on it.

2781
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:30,040
Take care of yourselves, needle crash.

2782
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,920
There was a lot for the press conferences that were missing.

2783
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:35,240
I think, I think is maybe where some of your thoughts are.

2784
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:38,760
That's where I'm kind of at is I'm like, no Soul Calibur, no Red Dead.

2785
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:39,960
You know, I said this earlier in the show.

2786
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:43,720
It seems like there was a lot that weren't at the press conferences.

2787
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:44,920
So that was kind of surprising.

2788
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:48,040
But otherwise, I think we kind of, we kind of well went over our thoughts earlier,

2789
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:49,320
but I appreciate you sharing yours.

2790
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:53,960
And to clarify with The Last of Us, everything outside of the game looked great.

2791
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:58,040
Like those scenes in the barn were really well done.

2792
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:03,160
Like I'm almost, I wish it just weren't so gory and realistic.

2793
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:04,680
Like I'm just not here for that.

2794
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:05,080
Sorry.

2795
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,040
Am I, am I old?

2796
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:06,540
Maybe.

2797
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:09,320
All right.

2798
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:09,800
Rob.

2799
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:10,300
What?

2800
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,760
You have a week before you're old.

2801
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:13,320
A couple weeks.

2802
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:15,160
No, you're not.

2803
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:15,800
No, I'm not.

2804
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,120
I'm not.

2805
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:16,840
I know I'm not.

2806
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:20,040
It's just one of those, you know, it's just not for me.

2807
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:21,080
Age is a number.

2808
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:21,880
Yeah.

2809
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:23,320
Experience is the real teacher.

2810
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:26,040
I'm okay with like a little bit of violence in games.

2811
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:30,040
Like I'm looking, I'm looking right at my copy of Rise of the Tomb Raider on Xbox One,

2812
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:30,760
sitting right here.

2813
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:32,840
Tomb Raider games can sometimes be a little intense.

2814
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:34,680
They can get a little, you know, a little bloody and stuff.

2815
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:37,160
Lara Croft and the terrible, no good, very bad day.

2816
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,400
There's no fucking disembowelment in those games.

2817
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:39,880
You know what I mean?

2818
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:41,000
That's like in your face like that.

2819
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,760
It's just that there's always the sequel.

2820
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:43,320
I know.

2821
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:44,440
Well, there is a sequel coming.

2822
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:45,000
Who knows?

2823
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:45,800
Well, they'll do in that.

2824
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:47,320
So anyway.

2825
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:47,560
All right.

2826
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:48,600
Thank you for the emails.

2827
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:49,320
Send us more.

2828
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,960
Participate at orange lounge radio.com.

2829
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:55,400
Until then, we have more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line at orange

2830
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:56,120
lounge radio.

2831
02:12:56,120 --> 02:12:56,920
Loki.

2832
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:58,840
Let's talk about nudity.

2833
02:12:58,840 --> 02:12:59,960
Let's all right.

2834
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:04,360
So Cyberpunk 2077 is going to have the nudity.

2835
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:04,860
Woohoo!

2836
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:09,240
And because CD Projekt Red said,

2837
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:12,280
Nudity is important for us because of one reason.

2838
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:13,160
It's important for me too.

2839
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:15,000
This is Cyberpunk.

2840
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,680
So people augment their body.

2841
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:19,960
So the body is no longer sacred.

2842
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:20,920
It's profane.

2843
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:27,160
And because people modify everything, they're losing their connection to their body to the

2844
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:27,960
meat.

2845
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:30,760
And that's why we need to use nudity in many situations.

2846
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:34,120
Whatever you have to do to justify it.

2847
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:34,840
Sure.

2848
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:35,480
Sure, guys.

2849
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:39,880
So yes, there'll be nudity in the game and looks interesting.

2850
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:43,160
And we're talking, we're talking lady nudity and boy nudity.

2851
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:43,400
Yeah.

2852
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:44,440
All nudity.

2853
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:45,800
Equal opportunity nudity.

2854
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:48,520
When the kind of augments are we talking about?

2855
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:52,440
That's buy the game and find out.

2856
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:53,880
No, it looks really good.

2857
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:56,840
Is there going to be a booby slider and a dick slider?

2858
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:58,440
I don't think it works that way.

2859
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:59,640
I don't think it does either.

2860
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:03,480
No, it's very much like the Cyberpunk tabletop game or like the RPG.

2861
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:06,200
So you have different stats and stuff.

2862
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:06,600
Sure.

2863
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:09,400
But I really am looking forward to this game.

2864
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,440
It looks really good.

2865
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:11,160
Yeah.

2866
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:13,960
Apparently a lot of people that went and saw the presentation because they did like a theater

2867
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:16,040
presentation, apparently a lot of people were really impressed.

2868
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:20,200
And I remember going to see the Witcher 3 presentation at one of the last E3s I went to.

2869
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:21,880
And I was impressed then.

2870
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:24,600
I remember walking out of that going, that was like a goddamn movie.

2871
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:25,800
And we just saw the Witcher.

2872
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:28,680
And that was like, like that was a game that was not on my radar at that point.

2873
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:34,920
And then after that, I was like that I remember that I don't usually go the art direction

2874
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,920
and that was really fucking good.

2875
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:39,800
But I walked out of the Witcher 3 going the art direction.

2876
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:41,560
And that was really fucking good.

2877
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:41,800
Yeah.

2878
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:44,360
I haven't played the Witcher 3 or any of the other Witcher games.

2879
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:45,080
I may have to try that.

2880
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:46,040
You should try Witcher 3.

2881
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:46,680
It's pretty.

2882
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:47,880
And I say that to myself too.

2883
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,480
I played a little bit, but not nearly enough.

2884
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:54,680
I really need to like, instead of going back and playing more Diablo or playing Final Fantasy

2885
02:14:54,680 --> 02:14:57,720
12 again or so, I need to go back and fucking force myself to play the Witcher 3.

2886
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:01,640
Cause it is, it is very, um, or Fallout store and Grand Theft Auto.

2887
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:02,760
Yes, or Fallout 4.

2888
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:04,440
All right.

2889
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:11,480
Anyhow, um, or maybe I could play this game cause this might be something that's coming.

2890
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:17,800
Now take this with a big grain of salt because it's coming from user forums.

2891
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:21,160
Oh no, not user forums.

2892
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:22,040
I know, I know.

2893
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:27,800
But there's a lot of buzz around the fact that Konami was showing something at E3 behind

2894
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:29,960
closed doors that was under an NDA.

2895
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:36,680
There's a lot of, there's a lot of buzz and it's going to be revealed soon.

2896
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:37,320
A lot of buzz.

2897
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:42,680
It's another Castlevania game, um, that it is something that actually Konami could be

2898
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:47,800
doing to counteract bloodstain, which seems like a real Dick move in many ways.

2899
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:48,360
You know what I mean?

2900
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:50,680
Cause like they're pretty Dick company nowadays.

2901
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:53,800
I guess so, but, um, which I don't know how you counter it.

2902
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:56,120
The only way you counter it is to get the jump on it.

2903
02:15:56,120 --> 02:15:59,240
So if they're about to announce a Castlevania game, then they're going to say like, this

2904
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:01,480
thing is almost done and coming out like now.

2905
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:05,640
But the other thing that they say goes with this, and I guess this comes from the same

2906
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:10,440
leaker that had said Ridley and Ice Climbers are back in Super Smash Brothers.

2907
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:15,960
Um, this same leaker is saying Simon Belmont is an unannounced character in Super Smash

2908
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:20,760
Brothers Ultimate, which I, I I'd fucking love that honestly.

2909
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:25,800
And you know, even though you probably go, well Castlevania, Nintendo, go way back to

2910
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:33,160
the NES days and Castlevania three was on the classic NES class, uh, super, super Castlevania

2911
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:34,600
four on the super NES.

2912
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:39,080
So it's not like Nintendo Konami's like Castlevania's relationship, like went anywhere.

2913
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:40,520
So yes, I'm in Belmont.

2914
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:40,680
Fuck.

2915
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:40,920
Yeah.

2916
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:42,360
That's something I associate with.

2917
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:43,320
It's back.

2918
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:43,880
So why not?

2919
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:44,360
Why not?

2920
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:45,240
Exactly.

2921
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:47,800
So from that standpoint, it makes a lot of sense.

2922
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:50,520
I, it does feel a little bit fanfic to me.

2923
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:52,680
Um, but I'm saying I'm not going to expect it.

2924
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:54,520
I'm going to take it with a huge grain of salt.

2925
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:58,120
I would love to see Konami bring back Castlevania, I guess.

2926
02:16:58,120 --> 02:16:59,400
I mean, they got to do it right.

2927
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:03,800
And it's going to be weird with Igarashi not there, but I'll give them the benefit of the

2928
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:04,300
doubt.

2929
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:09,240
Apparently also the Castlevania thing could be being held back a little bit because of

2930
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:09,960
the anime.

2931
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:12,040
That also makes a lot of sense.

2932
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:14,840
Netflix's Castlevania anime is doing pretty well.

2933
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:15,640
Why not revisit?

2934
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:17,480
I just was browsing Netflix the other day.

2935
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:19,160
I'm like, Oh yeah, that's on there.

2936
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:19,320
Yeah.

2937
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:20,520
Totally forgot about that.

2938
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:25,640
So well, and Bob, Bob coffee and chat says, Konami making a new game lulz.

2939
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:31,000
You forget though, that bomber man game that they did for the switch release did pretty

2940
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:31,320
well.

2941
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:32,680
It exceeded expectations.

2942
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:37,000
Now, I think the reason for that is there wasn't a lot of games that released besides

2943
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,480
Zelda, the PlayStation four and Xbox one versions.

2944
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:40,920
Do you know that it's on those systems?

2945
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:41,560
Yes.

2946
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:45,720
But I mean, that game did very well, I think because it came out at a really good time,

2947
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:49,160
but whatever the reason, bomber man kind of exceeded expectations.

2948
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:52,920
So I think this is making Konami kind of take a second look at the retro library, which

2949
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:55,080
we've been fucking saying for 10 years, but whatever.

2950
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:57,560
Finally, what is it with game companies getting the memo?

2951
02:17:57,560 --> 02:18:01,000
Like three years to one game in the retro library that could use another release.

2952
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:03,080
Does it start with dance?

2953
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:04,280
It does start with dance.

2954
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:05,160
Does it start with beat?

2955
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:07,420
All right.

2956
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:09,560
Both at the same time.

2957
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:12,840
You better not say it starts with beat because then they might confuse that as, Oh, new beat

2958
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:13,340
and groovy.

2959
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:14,920
Yeah.

2960
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:15,320
Good point.

2961
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:15,820
Good point.

2962
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:16,840
All right.

2963
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:22,120
Oh, as Joe and her Matt two points out, uh, bomber man is an assist trophy and smell that

2964
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:24,120
what they did go out of their way to show that.

2965
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:29,240
So, you know, Konami and, and, uh, Nintendo are still friends.

2966
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:31,000
So we'll see.

2967
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:35,800
Uh, Bob coffee says the next season of Castlevania anime is supposed to drop in July.

2968
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:40,760
Maybe news will drop at anime expo or later in July at San Diego comic con.

2969
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:44,520
I think games come, they're announcing, Oh, and by the way, the new, the new playable

2970
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:51,640
character master chief in his fucking cross play with the X bar and the ceiling opens

2971
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:53,080
up and Mike's fall from the ceiling.

2972
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:54,280
No, I don't think that will happen.

2973
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:58,440
And then all of a sudden Gabe tumbles from the ceiling goes, sorry about steam, but half

2974
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:04,440
life three, that won't happen because that will involve apologizing for steam.

2975
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:05,720
All right.

2976
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:08,200
A few more stories for you guys before the Skypline dark soccer.

2977
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:09,000
What do you have for us?

2978
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,280
Speaking of animes, right?

2979
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:15,320
Yeah, well, um, trigger in Arc system and we know Arc system works has done, um, guilty

2980
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:20,520
year blaze blue and recently dragon ball fighter Z they're doing a kill a kill game.

2981
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:23,160
I am down for this because I fucking love kill a kill.

2982
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:27,400
Remember fashion, fashion kills fashion is murder.

2983
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:31,720
Um, so yeah, I don't know if it's going to be a fighting game.

2984
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:34,360
It just says that it's kill a kill the game.

2985
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:40,680
Um, they say that it should be published in 2019, so we'll see what happens when it happens,

2986
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:42,200
but I'm still happy.

2987
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:47,960
As long as we have like little Omake scenes with Mako in it, I'd be, be pretty, pretty

2988
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:48,460
entertained.

2989
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:53,240
Um, but it's, it's described as kill a kill battle action.

2990
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:58,040
This doesn't say if it's going to be a fighting game or what type of, you know, I would assume

2991
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:03,560
it's a fighting game since it's Arc system, but still whatever it is.

2992
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:07,000
I guess Arc system works are saying in chat is publishing it, but the people behind little

2993
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,360
witch academia are making it.

2994
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:09,320
Okay.

2995
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:09,820
Yeah.

2996
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:11,160
Well, we'll see.

2997
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:14,840
I'm looking at their English website right now and huh, this is awesome.

2998
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:17,080
I fucking love kill a kill.

2999
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:20,040
I freaking cried at the end of kill a kill.

3000
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:20,920
So it was great.

3001
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:22,840
All right.

3002
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:27,800
Uh, Loki, I know you, I know you didn't put this on your show row request thread, but

3003
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:29,640
I was like, I know he's going to want to talk about it.

3004
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:31,400
Of course I want to talk about it.

3005
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:36,760
So you may remember we talked about the Bethesda conference and one of the jokes that was in

3006
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:42,440
there was the Skyrim, very special edition, which was, you know, playing Skyrim on Alexa.

3007
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:42,920
Right.

3008
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:43,800
And that's hilarious.

3009
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:45,240
Yeah.

3010
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:48,360
It's hilarious because you know, it was a funny video and stuff.

3011
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:54,120
But we just couldn't leave it at that, but you were disappointed.

3012
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:55,720
You were like, I want this to be real.

3013
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:59,480
But at that point it was not just leave the joke at that.

3014
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:01,960
They had to go 100% with the joke.

3015
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:04,920
And yes, it is a real thing.

3016
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:06,280
I appreciate that commitment.

3017
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:09,960
You can download it to run on Alexa.

3018
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:13,240
That is, that is now my favorite announcement out of Bethesda's conference.

3019
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:18,840
Or if you don't happen to own an Alexa device, you can also get it through, you know, if

3020
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:24,360
you get, um, through the Amazon store app on iOS or Amazon Alexa app through Android,

3021
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:28,120
you can also click on Alexa and have her get that as well.

3022
02:21:28,120 --> 02:21:28,760
So nice.

3023
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:30,360
Yes.

3024
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:31,000
That's awesome.

3025
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:33,960
Hooray for silly jokes.

3026
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:34,760
It is free.

3027
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,320
Yay.

3028
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:36,120
Free 99.

3029
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:36,920
My favorite price.

3030
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:39,000
So go check it out.

3031
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:39,560
All right.

3032
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:42,520
Just try not to knock all your furniture over like that dude did in the trailer.

3033
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:47,560
And then the wife or whoever that was supposed to be comes in and goes, will that thing clean

3034
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:48,120
that shit up?

3035
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
That was my favorite.

3036
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:51,320
All right.

3037
02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:54,520
Anyway, um, one more news story for you guys.

3038
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:58,200
And, uh, you know, we aren't going to be here next week, so I don't want you guys to forget.

3039
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:00,520
But games done quick is going to get started.

3040
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:01,480
So you know what?

3041
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:04,840
I am totally fine with the fact that we're going to take a week off.

3042
02:22:04,840 --> 02:22:06,840
So the games done quick can do their thing.

3043
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:09,720
We're going to step aside, um, summer games done quick.

3044
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:11,800
It gets underway on June 24th.

3045
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:13,480
It's happening in Minnesota.

3046
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:15,320
It's running through July 1st.

3047
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:19,640
If you want to attend in person, uh, you can go to the double tree Hilton in Bloomington,

3048
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:21,560
Minnesota, and that's where it's going to be.

3049
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:25,800
And it's cost $65 if you registered early, but they do have an attendance cap.

3050
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:29,800
Uh, but I'm sure most of you are going to be watching on Twitch.

3051
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:34,360
So check that out, uh, next week, although Bobby would like to, uh, you all to remember

3052
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:35,560
he still will be live.

3053
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:37,720
So you should still listen to him.

3054
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:38,360
Yes, you should.

3055
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:42,600
But you could, I think Bobby, it would be permissible if at least they listen to the

3056
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:45,960
podcast at some point in the week, Bobby's been really good about getting his podcast

3057
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:47,080
up within a couple of days.

3058
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:49,960
So at least listen to Bobby at some point during the week, if you're not going to be

3059
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:55,720
here live on Sunday night, just like we would hope you would listen to a OLR on the podcast.

3060
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:58,120
If you could not be here live.

3061
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:01,160
Uh, and I'm sure Bobby will tell you about what's going on in Summer Games Done Quick.

3062
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:04,280
And hopefully whatever game they're doing, maybe he'll luck out.

3063
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:06,360
They'll be doing a transition during that time or something.

3064
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:07,400
Setting up for something big.

3065
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:07,880
I don't know.

3066
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:09,400
Anyway, but there you go.

3067
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:13,400
Summer Games Done Quick is coming up and, uh, I didn't, oh, I didn't catch the charity.

3068
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:15,720
Uh, what charity are they raising money for this time?

3069
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:16,520
You guys know, where is it?

3070
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:17,560
Doctors Without Borders.

3071
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:18,920
It's always Doctors Without Borders.

3072
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:23,320
Uh, it is, well, they say that in their history, but I want to know, oh yeah, no, it is.

3073
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:27,160
Charity is Doctor Without Borders, but they have done Prevent Cancer Foundation.

3074
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:28,280
I think that's their winner one.

3075
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:29,640
I know they do one in the summer, one in the winter.

3076
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:32,040
So Doctors Without Borders is the charity.

3077
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:35,800
That's important to get out there too, because technically you could donate to that charity

3078
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:38,920
without this event, but I'm pretty sure it will be a big incentive.

3079
02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:41,240
All right, let's open up the Skype line.

3080
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:43,560
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

3081
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:47,160
If you want to get in and call, um, I may be limiting the length of some of the calls

3082
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:49,080
tonight just so we can get through.

3083
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:53,960
So please don't take it as a personal offense if I limit your call a little bit, just to

3084
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:57,320
make sure we get through everybody that wants to call, assuming people do want to call.

3085
02:23:57,320 --> 02:24:01,480
It is the 16th anniversary, not to guilt you, but, um, we're not going to be here next week.

3086
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:05,160
Anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

3087
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:07,400
Do we have any last minute stories we want to squeeze in while we wait?

3088
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:14,200
Um, yeah, I was going to talk about Netflix is going to be getting, um, more gaming on

3089
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:14,840
the platform.

3090
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:16,280
Not really Netflix.

3091
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:20,440
Yeah, not really necessarily gaming per se, but you remember that they've done some of

3092
02:24:20,440 --> 02:24:22,920
these like interactive storybook type things.

3093
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:28,680
So they have a Minecraft story mode, um, is licensed to do five interactive narrative

3094
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:30,600
series that are going to be coming out this fall.

3095
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:33,400
So they have that.

3096
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:33,960
I like that.

3097
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:35,480
Let's get to the calls.

3098
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:36,520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3099
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:36,920
Who's this?

3100
02:24:37,640 --> 02:24:39,320
Hey, this is Reginator.

3101
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:40,840
Hey buddy, what's your question for us tonight?

3102
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:47,160
Uh, well, no, before I get to my camera, I just want to call tonight.

3103
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:50,680
So I do want to encourage you to, to try to get to it as fast as you can.

3104
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:56,680
Uh, well, I was just going to say, you know, congratulations on 16 years of, uh, you know,

3105
02:24:56,680 --> 02:24:57,720
of doing the show.

3106
02:24:57,720 --> 02:24:58,040
Thank you.

3107
02:24:58,040 --> 02:25:06,120
Uh, it now for my question now is, you know, uh, considering the main focus of tonight's

3108
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:15,800
show has been, uh, E3, um, was there anything, uh, that you were kind of sort of hoping

3109
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:23,000
that would be, uh, talked about in any, any of the press conferences that wasn't, uh,

3110
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:29,560
or maybe something that you were, you know, kind of sort of knew something about, but

3111
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:33,720
they make appearance or maybe some kind of surprise that, um,

3112
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:36,840
for me, it would be final fantasy 16.

3113
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:41,080
I was really convinced this was going to be the year they would give us a peek at it.

3114
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:45,960
Um, I thought maybe we'd get a more traditional final fantasy, uh, like, like final fantasy

3115
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:50,120
nine style or, or, you know, four style maybe in the engine of 15, but I guess that's kind

3116
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:51,560
of what the remake is supposed to be.

3117
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:57,160
So, and maybe I think in many ways, final fantasy seven remake is final fantasy 16.

3118
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:59,640
Not that I think they're going to rebrand it as that, but I feel like we're not going

3119
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:04,280
to progress in the final fantasy series until this seven remake happens, which is starting

3120
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:06,280
to make me resent this remake a little bit.

3121
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:09,240
So I really hope they figure it out and get this out.

3122
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:14,280
I mean, obviously I want it to be good, but I want them to also move on with the main

3123
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:15,000
games.

3124
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,920
So, um, there is that.

3125
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:23,240
Um, but, uh, let's see, otherwise I guess I would join the echoes of people on the switch

3126
02:26:23,240 --> 02:26:25,320
and I'm sure Jamie's in this camp too.

3127
02:26:25,320 --> 02:26:28,600
I was really hoping to hear about animal crossings future and thought that this might be the

3128
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:29,480
year for that.

3129
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:33,560
And, uh, to come up short on that and maybe, maybe that that peak at Metroid prime four

3130
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:34,440
would have been nice.

3131
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:36,040
Uh, Jamie, Loki, anything you want to add?

3132
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:39,080
Think thing you, you wish you would have heard of at E3 that you didn't.

3133
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:40,360
Borderlands three.

3134
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:40,920
Yeah.

3135
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:41,800
That's a good call.

3136
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:42,760
Where the hell was that?

3137
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:44,760
Very good call animal crossing.

3138
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:45,320
That's it.

3139
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:45,800
Yeah.

3140
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:46,840
That's all I care about.

3141
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:47,400
Uh, quickly.

3142
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:50,120
Reginator anything in your camp that you, you were hoping for?

3143
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:54,040
Um, two answers, a serious answer.

3144
02:26:54,600 --> 02:27:00,520
Maybe, you know, some of the third party companies would resurrect some of their somewhat forgotten

3145
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:06,600
a series like Namco Bandai bringing back, uh, no, uh, what's my call it?

3146
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:14,920
Uh, they're, uh, they're one racing series, uh, Ridge racer and not, not like, uh, the

3147
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:20,760
Ridge racer and bothered crap, you know, style game, but more true to form PlayStation one

3148
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:27,720
games, games like, uh, our four or, uh, or, you know, the earlier titles check out horizon

3149
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:28,200
four though.

3150
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:32,280
I'm I'm gonna, they don't pay me to push that series, but I love me some fours of horizon.

3151
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:35,960
So if you like your arcade racers, uh, put your eyes over there.

3152
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:37,320
Yeah.

3153
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:37,640
Yeah.

3154
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:44,920
In fact, I got that recently on the original 360, um, and the game was pretty good.

3155
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:47,800
Um, no, it was for a joke cancer.

3156
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:49,320
I would have loved to have seen a game.

3157
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:56,040
You'll come out on stage, drop pants with, uh, you know, a half-life tattooed on his

3158
02:27:56,040 --> 02:28:02,120
nether regions and him giving everyone the fingers and sucking, you know, motherfuckers

3159
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:02,680
or whatever.

3160
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:04,440
I know.

3161
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:07,000
I'd rather not see that either, but yeah, I understand.

3162
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:10,600
If something like that is going to happen, it has to be extra.

3163
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:13,400
So, uh, I appreciate the calls, uh, rage Nader.

3164
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:14,440
Thank you so much and take care.

3165
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:14,680
Okay.

3166
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:15,560
Yep.

3167
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:16,200
Have a good one.

3168
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:17,000
You too.

3169
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,120
Uh, orange launch radio.

3170
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:18,920
All one word on Skype.

3171
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:22,440
If you want to get through, uh, act F says no Kirby game.

3172
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:23,080
E3 ruined.

3173
02:28:23,080 --> 02:28:24,680
Did you just get a fucking Kirby game?

3174
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:26,280
Yeah, there was a Kirby game.

3175
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:29,400
They just, will you let us F zero fans have a moment?

3176
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:33,080
Just like the people complaining about wasn't fucking had a Kirby game.

3177
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:34,520
I'm getting a star Fox game.

3178
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:36,520
Oh my God.

3179
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:37,240
What do you think this is?

3180
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:39,160
Call of duty where you get a new game every year.

3181
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:41,320
Act F put a frown face.

3182
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:41,560
Fine.

3183
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:42,200
I'll get, you know what?

3184
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:44,280
Act F I'll meet you halfway.

3185
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:47,000
I would have enjoyed a new Kirby golf game.

3186
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:47,640
How about that?

3187
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:48,120
All right.

3188
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:49,240
We got another call coming in.

3189
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:50,280
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3190
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:50,680
Who's this?

3191
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:52,600
Hey, what's going on?

3192
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:53,320
It's Ranya.

3193
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:54,120
Hey Rama.

3194
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:56,920
You're now I can see that you're not calling from a Dixie cup.

3195
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:00,040
I think that microphone, your gain is like really high up on that.

3196
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:00,840
It's really busted.

3197
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:01,480
I think that's what's up.

3198
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:08,760
Well, I've had trouble with it lately, so I think it's with my setup, but my systems

3199
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:10,200
is low over here for an update.

3200
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:15,960
So that's not here nor there, but I only turn on the webcam for two reasons.

3201
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:18,200
I already saw what you got in your hand.

3202
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:18,920
I know it's coming.

3203
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:19,560
I can't wait.

3204
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:20,840
My favorite, my favorite.

3205
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:23,160
This is a bottle of, is that vodka?

3206
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:26,120
No, this is Puerto Rican rum, my friend.

3207
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:28,200
Oh, even guys, Puerto Rican rum.

3208
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:31,880
So as you can see, he's opening it up.

3209
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:36,360
This is the type I don't need to do heroes of the storm commentating.

3210
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:38,360
I want to do people drinking, commentating.

3211
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:43,080
So, uh, this lovely man on our cam right now is pouring a shot of that rum into a little

3212
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:43,800
shot glass.

3213
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:45,080
It's a, it's a plain shot glass.

3214
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:46,840
I don't see a logo or anything on it.

3215
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:49,800
Oh, there's a real flavor similar to Final Fantasy on there.

3216
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:52,040
So I don't know if you see it that well.

3217
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:52,520
I see it.

3218
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:54,200
It's one of those frosted glass things.

3219
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:54,680
Okay.

3220
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:58,280
It's a, it's a plain shot glass, you know, to remind you that we don't have anything

3221
02:29:58,280 --> 02:29:59,320
branded that we sell.

3222
02:29:59,320 --> 02:29:59,560
All right.

3223
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:00,520
Let the man make a toast.

3224
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:04,680
Well, I will say that I have no problem doing shots while doing a live stream.

3225
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:12,120
You know, I got nothing else better to do, but to have a great 16th from the younger

3226
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:14,040
brother at anime jam session.

3227
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:16,760
So thank you so much.

3228
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:22,680
Which means that since Travis is getting all the car, you have to drive us around.

3229
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:24,760
Uh, Rama, I'm going to need you to do another shot.

3230
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:32,920
I already gave you shit over, over your alley.

3231
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:34,600
Don't, don't get me started tonight.

3232
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:35,720
Rama, it's my birthday.

3233
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:37,320
It's my 16th birthday.

3234
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:38,680
It's my party.

3235
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:43,880
So I'm going to need him to do another shot because I was waiting for the here's to you

3236
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:45,240
and here's to me.

3237
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:46,440
That's all right.

3238
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:47,320
He knows where I'm going.

3239
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:48,920
All right, here we go.

3240
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:51,400
I got the man to take another shot.

3241
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:52,200
I love it.

3242
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:53,640
He's pouring himself a second shot.

3243
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:59,160
And I, all I see is his lips going motherfucker.

3244
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:02,440
This is why I love you.

3245
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:05,160
Here's to you.

3246
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,040
Here's to me.

3247
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:07,800
The best of friends we'll ever be.

3248
02:31:07,800 --> 02:31:10,920
If we should ever happen to disagree, well, then thank you.

3249
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:11,800
And here's to me.

3250
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:13,000
Thank you, sir.

3251
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,320
That was, that was the toast I was waiting for my friend.

3252
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:19,960
I held up on the toast cause you were cutting it for time.

3253
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:23,640
I didn't want to take up any more time, but I guess this is an exception to the rule.

3254
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:25,880
Actually, Rob, I'm going to need you to do one more shot.

3255
02:31:25,880 --> 02:31:30,280
No, I'm kidding.

3256
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:35,000
We would do at the end of D and D that actually was in mass effect.

3257
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:37,800
Um, here's to us.

3258
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:39,160
Who's like us.

3259
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:40,840
Damn few.

3260
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:41,560
And they're all dead.

3261
02:31:43,560 --> 02:31:44,120
All right.

3262
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:46,360
Rama drink responsibly.

3263
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:47,000
I know you do.

3264
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:47,640
Thank you so much.

3265
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:48,280
You know what?

3266
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:52,600
I, you have been listening to this show for a very, very, very long time and I appreciate

3267
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:53,320
you so much.

3268
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:57,640
And, uh, I, the show that you guys do makes me proud y'all.

3269
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:59,480
And we appreciate it.

3270
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:03,160
And like you said at the top of the show, we're all like family.

3271
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:04,680
We've been here for each other.

3272
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:06,040
Y'all have been there for the past year.

3273
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:09,960
My mother, you have been there when my ex dumped me and other cool things.

3274
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:12,760
So I, you know how much I really appreciate having this show.

3275
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:16,120
So, Hey, why we appreciate having you as part of the fam.

3276
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:16,920
All right.

3277
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:18,520
Hey, that's all that matters.

3278
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:20,440
So I'm going to be on my nose a little way now.

3279
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:20,680
All right.

3280
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:21,320
One more shot.

3281
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:21,960
It'll help you sleep.

3282
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:22,600
Take care, buddy.

3283
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:25,320
Bye my friend.

3284
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:28,760
All right.

3285
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:30,040
We'll try to squeeze in one more call.

3286
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:33,320
If you can get in here, orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

3287
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:34,440
If you want to give us a call.

3288
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:38,920
By the way, I just got a text message from our buddy, uh, Brad at pod culture who said

3289
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:40,120
no fireball in the house.

3290
02:32:40,120 --> 02:32:43,480
Cause that's his go-to drink, but cracking a cold one for OLR.

3291
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:44,360
And this sounds good.

3292
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:45,240
Uh, dark soccer.

3293
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:46,200
I think you'd be into this too.

3294
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:47,480
It's like a pineapple.

3295
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:49,640
It's an apple pineapple, hard cider.

3296
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:52,120
That's very similar to the mimosa you had earlier.

3297
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:53,320
You know what I'm making though right now?

3298
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:57,000
I'm infusing vodka with, um, fresh plums and cherries.

3299
02:32:57,960 --> 02:32:58,600
A little bit of it.

3300
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:02,200
Cause I can't have much, but I, of course I also have grapefruit soju at home.

3301
02:33:02,200 --> 02:33:02,760
Right.

3302
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:06,200
Well, you could always invite me over to drink and Guinness and then sleep on the couch and

3303
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:08,440
some belching beaver peanut butter milk stout.

3304
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:09,000
All right.

3305
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,120
Last call for calls.

3306
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:12,360
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

3307
02:33:12,360 --> 02:33:12,840
Let me check in.

3308
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:14,840
If there's any other last minute stories we want to get to.

3309
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:15,160
Nope.

3310
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:15,880
Don't have anything.

3311
02:33:15,880 --> 02:33:16,760
No, nothing.

3312
02:33:17,320 --> 02:33:17,720
All right.

3313
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:22,520
Uh, looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

3314
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:25,080
Um, let's see.

3315
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:28,360
Um, dark to see you saying Rob over here trying to get Rama drunk.

3316
02:33:28,360 --> 02:33:29,400
That's what I do.

3317
02:33:29,400 --> 02:33:33,080
Uh, Brad from pod culture also in chat says, uh, it's fucking tasty.

3318
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:36,600
Sia Tabiri says apple pen, pineapple pen cider.

3319
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:40,200
Way to go meme from a year ago.

3320
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:43,640
Rob, I'm gonna have to take you to up cider in San Francisco.

3321
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:44,760
It's nothing but cider.

3322
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:47,320
Nothing but yummy from all over the world.

3323
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:51,080
Many of them on tap, but they had a black bear, uh, a blackberry cider

3324
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:53,880
from Spain that was to die for.

3325
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:54,200
Nice.

3326
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:55,400
I will have to take you there.

3327
02:33:55,400 --> 02:33:58,200
Um, unfortunately, you know, my July is booked solid.

3328
02:33:58,200 --> 02:33:59,640
Who says I have to take you there now?

3329
02:33:59,640 --> 02:33:59,960
I know.

3330
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:04,040
I know me, but, uh, my July is booked pretty solid at least Saturdays.

3331
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:05,480
Cause there's rehearsals coming up.

3332
02:34:05,480 --> 02:34:08,760
I should plug this for anybody who is local in Northern California.

3333
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:10,840
We are going to be doing clue the movie.

3334
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:11,240
That's right.

3335
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:14,440
The old school movie from 1985 with Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn,

3336
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:17,880
clue the movie live on stage and on screen.

3337
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:20,600
So it's like a Rocky horse style shadow cast.

3338
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:21,720
And you ready for this?

3339
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:23,400
I don't even know if I should be saying this on the show.

3340
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:23,900
You ready?

3341
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:27,880
I am unretired because I stopped performing in these shows a few years ago.

3342
02:34:27,880 --> 02:34:28,600
I still host them.

3343
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:30,840
I host them all the time, but I stopped performing in them.

3344
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:32,840
I unretired to do this role.

3345
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:34,520
I'm going to be playing.

3346
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:37,560
Mrs. Peacock in clue.

3347
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:41,480
So if you're local, I really, we bought makeup today.

3348
02:34:41,480 --> 02:34:41,880
Yes, we did.

3349
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:42,920
We went out and bought makeup.

3350
02:34:42,920 --> 02:34:46,520
I bought, I brought one of my best gal pals out to go make up shopping with me.

3351
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:47,960
So check that out.

3352
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:48,600
All right.

3353
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:51,240
Anyway, uh, the Skype line is not lighting up anymore.

3354
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:55,400
So I hope you guys will at least tweet us at OLR or maybe, uh, leave us, uh, an email

3355
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:58,120
participate at orange lounge radio.com.

3356
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:01,160
But again, you know, we've already gotten a little heavy tonight, but I really want

3357
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:03,960
to thank all you guys for your support over the past 16 years.

3358
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:07,240
Thank you so much for helping orange launch radio be the show that it is today.

3359
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:10,520
If you liked what you heard here at OLR, give us all your money.

3360
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:11,640
No, I'm, I'm, I'm kidding.

3361
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:15,960
We don't usually end the show with that, but, uh, I will say in, in lieu of, uh, you

3362
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:20,120
know, uh, whatever money giving source I would give you here, I would say, help us

3363
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:20,760
spread the word.

3364
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:22,680
Um, tell a friend or two about the show.

3365
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:25,480
Help us spread the word because orange launch radio is just show where every gamer

3366
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:26,040
has a voice.

3367
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:28,440
But if the voices aren't here, we can't hear them.

3368
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:32,600
Uh, a nice five star, we're just hearing voices, a nice five star review on a place

3369
02:35:32,600 --> 02:35:36,680
like iTunes or Google play podcasts or wherever it is you heard this show.

3370
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:38,120
Those go an awful long way.

3371
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:41,160
You guys, you really can't underestimate the power of those good reviews.

3372
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:44,680
So please, please take a moment to leave us those reviews would really appreciate it.

3373
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:46,440
Um, let's go around and wrap it up.

3374
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:46,840
Bradley.

3375
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:49,720
I know I didn't get to talk to you a lot past the introduction, but I saw you, I saw

3376
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:51,640
you playing on your 3DS over there.

3377
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:53,800
I hope, uh, I hope you had a good time.

3378
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:54,360
How was it?

3379
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:55,000
It was good.

3380
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,360
It's good to have you here just for support, especially since I know you were one of the

3381
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:01,960
faces that was here early on in OLR history.

3382
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:02,440
What do you think?

3383
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:03,080
Let me ask you this.

3384
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:03,720
We'll leave on this.

3385
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:08,200
What, what, what do you think's changed the most in 16 years here on this show from

3386
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:09,800
what you've observed in the past to now?

3387
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:15,240
It's hard thing to think about, uh, the format of course.

3388
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:21,000
And, and of course the game industry and how, how much indies have grown up and all

3389
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:21,960
that kind of stuff.

3390
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:22,520
That's true.

3391
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:27,240
Indies self publishing has, was not a thing that was around when this show started.

3392
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:30,680
Well, PC was one thing, but you didn't even have as critical as I've been esteem.

3393
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:33,400
That wasn't even around, you know, all those years ago.

3394
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:33,880
You know what I mean?

3395
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:34,440
So yeah.

3396
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:35,160
Yeah, it's true.

3397
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:36,760
Indies have come a long, long way.

3398
02:36:36,760 --> 02:36:38,440
It's a good, uh, good, good headline.

3399
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:41,160
Anyway, any final thoughts or any final things you want to get out here, Bradley?

3400
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:42,520
Not really.

3401
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:42,840
All right.

3402
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:43,400
Fair enough.

3403
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:46,040
I would, I would, thank you.

3404
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:46,760
Thank you for being here.

3405
02:36:46,760 --> 02:36:48,120
Thank you for sharing in the fun.

3406
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:50,120
Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3407
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:51,560
Um, Loki, I'll start with you.

3408
02:36:52,280 --> 02:36:56,920
Um, my final thought is that, I don't know.

3409
02:36:56,920 --> 02:37:00,280
I wish I have energy to work on my game this week.

3410
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:05,000
Cause I sure as hell haven't had time or energy to do it cause I'm working out.

3411
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,080
Well, I have incorporated weight training now.

3412
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:11,240
So now my workouts go from 30 minutes of just, Oh, you lift weights, bro.

3413
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:12,920
So now I have to do that.

3414
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:13,800
Yeah.

3415
02:37:13,800 --> 02:37:17,640
I lift weights, weights that are very light.

3416
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:18,680
Bro, you even lift.

3417
02:37:19,720 --> 02:37:22,200
Apparently my ass is weaker than I thought.

3418
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:27,720
Like I'm like, I used to live more weight in high school and that was like nothing.

3419
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:27,880
Wait.

3420
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:29,240
So you start deadlifting.

3421
02:37:29,240 --> 02:37:32,440
You should see one of the challenges I had to do for that survivor game.

3422
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:34,840
I was playing on Facebook that I didn't get very far in.

3423
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:36,360
I talked about this on a previous episode.

3424
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:40,120
But I had to do a thing with five pound weights where like, for like 20 minutes,

3425
02:37:40,120 --> 02:37:43,880
I had to have like one hand on the ground and the five pound weight up in the air.

3426
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:44,440
Oh my God.

3427
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:46,120
I don't know how my old ass did it.

3428
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:46,520
Huh?

3429
02:37:46,520 --> 02:37:47,160
Five pounds?

3430
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:47,720
Yeah.

3431
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:49,400
It's harder than you think.

3432
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:49,560
Yeah.

3433
02:37:49,560 --> 02:37:52,520
I used to do that with, um, kettlebells for 20 minutes.

3434
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:57,640
Well, not with, with for 20 minutes, but we'd have to do, um, a 15 kilogram kettlebell.

3435
02:37:58,520 --> 02:38:01,000
Um, a series of them for a Turkish get up.

3436
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:05,000
I had to do it while this guy in Massachusetts,

3437
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,680
who ended up being the first one to be voted out.

3438
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:09,880
He, he was doing this whole thing where he had to like

3439
02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:13,240
move plastic cups and stack them with nothing but his mouth.

3440
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:19,800
And if I dropped, if I dropped the weight at any point, he had to start over.

3441
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:24,440
Oh, so it was one of those like, you have to rely on other people not to fuck up.

3442
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:25,480
It was interesting.

3443
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:27,960
But anyway, well, look, you were saying.

3444
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:31,640
Oh, I was just saying it takes a long time to do all that crap.

3445
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:32,920
Yes, it does.

3446
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:35,320
Especially if you're watching your form, which you should always be watching your form.

3447
02:38:35,320 --> 02:38:36,520
I'm trying to watch my form.

3448
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:39,640
I need to watch my, like, I was even doing like, I started like,

3449
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:40,440
I even mixed it up.

3450
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:43,080
I was going to do a different type of like ab workout and thing.

3451
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:44,840
And they have me do like, it's like a rush.

3452
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:48,200
I think they call them like Russian turns or Russian curls or something like that.

3453
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:49,720
And like, and I tried doing it.

3454
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:53,800
You're supposed to like sit on your ass, like sitting down, feet are up in the air a little

3455
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:56,520
bit, and then you have to turn your torso left and right.

3456
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:57,640
Holding your hands together.

3457
02:38:57,640 --> 02:38:57,800
Yeah.

3458
02:38:57,800 --> 02:38:59,400
My body doesn't want to fucking do that.

3459
02:38:59,400 --> 02:39:01,960
It's just like, it's like, no, you can't turn.

3460
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:03,640
Stretch a lot and just ease into it.

3461
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:07,480
But you should always warm up before you stretch.

3462
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:10,040
Just saying, because then you will, you will pull something.

3463
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:11,800
All right.

3464
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:15,560
Uh, my final thought is this is the last OLR of my thirties.

3465
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:17,800
By the next time you hear me, I'm going to be in my forties.

3466
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:21,320
And, um, you know what I look for, I, I, I really can't believe.

3467
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:26,040
I'm going to be 40 years old and still doing this show, but I don't mean that in a negative

3468
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:26,360
way.

3469
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:29,880
Like it's, it's one of those, like, no, I know, I know I'm talking to me personally.

3470
02:39:30,680 --> 02:39:34,440
But I'm like, you've already lived it.

3471
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:37,880
Well then maybe, maybe did you have this thought that like, I'm 40 years old and I'm still

3472
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:38,760
doing all our no.

3473
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:40,840
Oh, well then I guess it's just me.

3474
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:43,480
So it's, you're not going to be a year older.

3475
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:45,080
You're going to be a week and a half older.

3476
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:45,640
I know.

3477
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:45,960
I know.

3478
02:39:45,960 --> 02:39:46,840
It's not a big deal.

3479
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:48,440
It's just a, it's just a fucking number.

3480
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:50,120
I'm still the same Rob Roberts.

3481
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:53,800
I'm still the gore hating Rob Roberts that I would not Chris Gore though.

3482
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:58,440
Cause he's cool, but I'm not the blood and gore hating Rob Roberts.

3483
02:39:58,440 --> 02:40:00,600
Uh, this has nothing to do with my age.

3484
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:01,080
All right.

3485
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:02,440
Anyway, that's it for my final thought.

3486
02:40:02,440 --> 02:40:04,440
I just want to thank everybody again for the love.

3487
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:07,720
Uh, last but not least ladies last dark soccer, your final thought.

3488
02:40:07,720 --> 02:40:13,640
Um, I am six pounds away away from having lost a hundred pounds since last October.

3489
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:14,280
Congratulations.

3490
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:14,920
Congratulations.

3491
02:40:14,920 --> 02:40:15,160
Yeah.

3492
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:20,840
And since I haven't told anybody publicly what I did and people have asked and I'm just

3493
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:22,280
going to go ahead and be upfront with it.

3494
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:25,960
You had, I'm sure I had gastric bypass in December.

3495
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:32,040
And I've had some, uh, highs and lows, but before my decision to have, it was the fact

3496
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:37,560
that I could not walk due to pain in my feet and I had to stop, um, going to the gym, lifting

3497
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:42,840
weights like I was in the past because of, um, a very debilitating problem with my spine.

3498
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:45,240
I had no other way to do this.

3499
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:48,840
And so I just want to tell everybody out there, don't think it's a cop out.

3500
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:52,920
Don't think that it's a easy fix because it fucking is not.

3501
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:55,000
I still suffer.

3502
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:59,160
Like I had to go, you know, I was sick during the break.

3503
02:40:59,160 --> 02:40:59,880
I'll leave it that way.

3504
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:04,280
But for any, your body's still learning what my body's doing.

3505
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:04,760
Yeah.

3506
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:08,920
But if you know anyone who has ever been through it, do not give them shit for it.

3507
02:41:08,920 --> 02:41:11,000
Be proud of them for taking that step.

3508
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,160
It is not an easy fix at all.

3509
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:15,000
It doesn't work for everybody.

3510
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:20,280
It's killed some people before I was to be, you know, I've, because I've said this to

3511
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:23,160
you before, I was honestly surprised when you told me you were getting it.

3512
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:26,280
Cause obviously I knew I was surprised when you told me you were getting it because I

3513
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:28,040
was like Jamie.

3514
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:31,640
I mean, I know people that have gas that are large individuals.

3515
02:41:31,640 --> 02:41:37,400
And I wasn't, you know, but you weren't, I never kind of put you in that large lady

3516
02:41:37,400 --> 02:41:37,880
bucket.

3517
02:41:37,880 --> 02:41:38,440
You know what I mean?

3518
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:39,640
So I was really surprised.

3519
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:40,120
Thank you.

3520
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:43,000
But I was never, I was kind of surprised when you told me, but then when you told me all

3521
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:48,280
this other stuff that was happening, it was like, Oh, because I had, cause I'm so I'm

3522
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:49,240
only five three.

3523
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:51,400
And by the way, I love large ladies too.

3524
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:53,960
There is nothing wrong with big butts and you cannot lie.

3525
02:41:53,960 --> 02:41:54,520
That's right.

3526
02:41:54,520 --> 02:41:56,200
Cause round bottom girls move the world.

3527
02:41:56,200 --> 02:42:02,200
Love yourself large, small, because sometimes our society makes people that are too small

3528
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:03,640
feel like crappy too.

3529
02:42:03,640 --> 02:42:04,520
And that's shitty too.

3530
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:08,040
So you love yourself no matter what body you got.

3531
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:11,480
I had no problem with myself visually.

3532
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:16,360
You know, I, I believe in body positivity, but I do believe that there comes a point

3533
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:18,520
where if you are in so much pain,

3534
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:19,800
but if your feet and your back are,

3535
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:23,800
well, I was in that cast for a month and you remember when we would go walking before I'd

3536
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:24,760
lag way behind.

3537
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:25,400
Yeah.

3538
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:27,480
I was a few steps ahead of you today.

3539
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:28,040
I walked around.

3540
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:29,080
Okay, well let's not get carried away.

3541
02:42:29,080 --> 02:42:29,720
You know what I mean?

3542
02:42:29,720 --> 02:42:33,800
But I was, I was at drag con for three days on my feet and then to Disneyland the next

3543
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:35,640
day and then went to see where it all the day after that.

3544
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:40,840
And I'm just saying, I believe in positivity and health at any size, at any shape.

3545
02:42:41,400 --> 02:42:47,400
But when you come to the point where the size is becoming a medical factor, where it affects

3546
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:50,040
your quality of life, you have to make a brave decision.

3547
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:52,200
I'm not saying that I'm the bravest person in the world because I'm certainly not the

3548
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:53,480
only person that's done it.

3549
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:57,320
Sometimes you have to take a decision for the sake of your health because I don't think

3550
02:42:57,320 --> 02:43:01,400
I would have been able to do OLR in another two years.

3551
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,600
And so I was thinking about it today.

3552
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:05,960
I hurt to drive.

3553
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:07,560
I hurt to do anything.

3554
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:09,000
I hurt to sit at my desk too long.

3555
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:14,200
My, my lungs hurt and now I am healthier than I've ever been.

3556
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:16,120
I can get around and do things.

3557
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:22,200
I have a lot more energy for stuff and I really had a lot of the listeners were really

3558
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:23,800
supportive of me, the people that I told.

3559
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:27,320
So I want to thank all of you for, you've given a lot of hints to that.

3560
02:43:27,320 --> 02:43:29,080
I bet a lot of sleuths might have figured it out.

3561
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:33,240
I know I haven't like fully hidden it, but I'm not, I don't like to share everything

3562
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:34,040
that's gone on in my life.

3563
02:43:34,040 --> 02:43:36,280
It's your fucking business, but it ain't video games.

3564
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:40,280
Some people have asked, I will be upfront and also I've been able to play DDR again.

3565
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:44,120
And that's what it's really all about here on the 16 years of OLR.

3566
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:44,440
Yeah.

3567
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,760
Lots of love in chat room, by the way.

3568
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:48,040
So happy for dark soccer.

3569
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:49,880
Really happy for you, Jamie, less than three.

3570
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:51,640
So there you go.

3571
02:43:51,640 --> 02:43:56,120
I went from, now I only buy old Navy jeans, not to give them that, but they're comfy.

3572
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:57,640
I went from a size 18 to a 10.

3573
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:01,000
So if that gives anyone any indication I've lost.

3574
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:05,080
I don't ever notice when people lose weight and that type of thing.

3575
02:44:05,080 --> 02:44:05,800
Like I just don't.

3576
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:09,960
But like I do notice a different Jamie than I used to see.

3577
02:44:09,960 --> 02:44:10,520
Yeah.

3578
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:13,480
The first place to be fair, you put it on your own Instagram.

3579
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:14,600
Like here's me before.

3580
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:15,160
Here's me now.

3581
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:15,400
Yeah.

3582
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:19,640
I was, I was being, you know, but it's people, I guess some people hadn't put it together.

3583
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:23,400
And I've told, you know, a few people I'm closest to, but I just want to say for anyone

3584
02:44:23,400 --> 02:44:27,960
out there who is suffering with anything and they think that, and I'm not saying gastric bypass.

3585
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:32,600
I'm saying that if you talk to your doctor, talk to your doctor, what's right for you.

3586
02:44:32,600 --> 02:44:33,080
Cause you know what?

3587
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:36,760
I know people that are large and in charge and they go to the doctor and it's like,

3588
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:38,360
the doctor's like, you're fine.

3589
02:44:38,360 --> 02:44:39,080
But it's fine.

3590
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:39,640
Everything's fine.

3591
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:41,960
You're just, you, you were just born large.

3592
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:43,480
Your genes, that's what your genes do.

3593
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:44,520
That's what my genes did.

3594
02:44:44,520 --> 02:44:45,320
Rock it.

3595
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:49,960
But I'm saying, you know, if you feel that you're, you're having pressure in your lungs,

3596
02:44:49,960 --> 02:44:55,000
go to a pulmonary doctor.

3597
02:44:55,880 --> 02:45:01,160
Get, if you are afraid, if you have a pain that you don't recognize, fucking get it seen.

3598
02:45:01,800 --> 02:45:07,160
Cause I, I would have been looking at being unable to walk without a cane in two years.

3599
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:10,920
And not to completely derail, but I think you would support this too.

3600
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:14,840
Sometimes that pain, if it's not a visible pain and I'm talking about mental health,

3601
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:15,400
see a doctor.

3602
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:15,960
Get it seen.

3603
02:45:15,960 --> 02:45:16,920
Yeah, absolutely.

3604
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:22,760
You know, if it's something that does not feel like it did, you know, even if it's just

3605
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:27,240
getting older, you should still go get yourself seen if you have insurance for it.

3606
02:45:27,240 --> 02:45:29,640
If not, there are some free services out there that can help you.

3607
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:32,840
Medicaid in your state, maybe something you can look into.

3608
02:45:32,840 --> 02:45:33,240
Yeah.

3609
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:35,320
Or if you're in Canada, then bless you.

3610
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:39,640
But, um, but I'm saying don't ignore any of the signs.

3611
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:42,440
And if you have a chance to do something about it, fucking do it.

3612
02:45:43,400 --> 02:45:47,320
Don't wait, don't wait, you know, too much longer because you never know

3613
02:45:47,320 --> 02:45:48,760
how much worse it's going to get.

3614
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:51,400
So well, a heavy but good note to end on.

3615
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:53,160
And I wanted just to make sure to leave that with people.

3616
02:45:53,160 --> 02:45:57,880
Cause I love all of our listeners, even the assholes, cause I'm a bit of an asshole,

3617
02:45:58,600 --> 02:46:01,240
but you guys mean a lot to me.

3618
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:06,200
And I just wanted to share that with you that if you, if it's a pain in your heart,

3619
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:08,600
physically or otherwise, if it's a pain in your back,

3620
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:12,200
if it's something that twinge is funny, don't hesitate.

3621
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:14,440
And if they tell you, no, you're okay.

3622
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:15,960
And it's still fucking hurting.

3623
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:20,120
Get a second opinion, make them give you a referral.

3624
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:23,320
Or at least like I have this, I'm not to, I, we really need to wrap up,

3625
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:25,960
but like I have this bump thing on the back of my neck and I was like,

3626
02:46:25,960 --> 02:46:27,320
Oh my God, is this like a tumor?

3627
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:28,120
What is this?

3628
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:30,520
So I went to the doctor cause I was like, it doesn't hurt.

3629
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:31,400
It was like a cyst.

3630
02:46:31,400 --> 02:46:32,040
What is it?

3631
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:35,880
No, she, she did the whole thing and she's like, I think it's just a fat pocket.

3632
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:37,000
And I was like, Oh,

3633
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:38,760
well, no, this formed a lipoma.

3634
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:39,080
Yeah.

3635
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:39,240
Yeah.

3636
02:46:40,360 --> 02:46:41,720
I got a fat neck.

3637
02:46:41,720 --> 02:46:42,520
That's what it is.

3638
02:46:43,080 --> 02:46:43,480
All good.

3639
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:45,240
But at least I know, at least I know.

3640
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:48,120
In a nutshell, I want all of you to take good care of yourselves and each other.

3641
02:46:48,120 --> 02:46:50,280
And that's really the most important thing to me.

3642
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:52,760
You know, sometimes it's scary.

3643
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:54,840
Sometimes it requires a major lifestyle change,

3644
02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:57,160
but be willing to do what's best for yourself.

3645
02:46:57,160 --> 02:46:57,640
I love that.

3646
02:46:57,640 --> 02:46:59,320
We'll, we'll end it on a Jerry Springer note.

3647
02:46:59,320 --> 02:47:02,520
Since I hear his show is ending, take care of yourselves and each other.

3648
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:05,240
And don't go punching people unless they're Nazis.

3649
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:05,960
Punch Nazis.

3650
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:08,600
Have a great two weeks, everybody.

3651
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:12,520
We will see you back here in two weeks with an all new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3652
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:15,240
Thank you for 16 phenomenal years.

3653
02:47:15,240 --> 02:47:17,480
We'll see you for year 17, starting in two weeks.

3654
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:17,800
