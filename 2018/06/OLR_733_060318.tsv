14000	27000	After testing your mind all weekend at gaming cons for the last four years, Just Shapes and Beats finally releases for the Nintendo Switch and PC. The Mortal Kombat theme song is now playing in your head. If this is just one game in a full week of news, stay tuned for the rest, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on June the 3rd of 2018, episode number 733 of our show.
44000	58000	That's right, June is underway, it's a big month. Happy Pride Month folks. Happy me turning 40 at the end of this month. Happy OLR's birthday month. June is a very busy month. Isn't it DarkSakura or Jamie Summers over there with a mic?
58000	59000	Yeah it is.
59000	60000	How are you?
60000	61000	I'm tired.
61000	62000	You tired?
62000	63000	Yeah.
63000	64000	Well wake up girl, we got three hours to fill.
64000	65000	I got woke up.
65000	70000	Somebody shook my ass out of bed and said, you gotta go to Placerville.
70000	73000	Ew, ew, why does anybody want to go to Placerville?
73000	74000	Placerville is pretty though.
74000	76000	No, there's some cool things up there.
76000	78000	That was like...
78000	80000	Wasn't that the one they used to call Hangtown?
80000	82000	I don't know, I'm not from your country.
82000	89000	I think it was back in the day. Anyway, I hope you're doing well. Let's also check in with Techmaster Loki.
89000	91000	Also the VoG Network birthday.
91000	97000	That's right. VoG Network was also born in June. Thank you for the reminder. We kind of passed it. It was June 1st.
97000	100000	But yes, celebrating six years here at the Voice Geeks Network.
100000	112000	So a big toast to not only of course Bobby Black Wolf who's on before us every Sunday night because we do tape live at the Voice Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific at 9 o'clock Eastern right after said Bobby Black Wolf's show.
113000	118000	Not only just a big toast to him but all of the contributors to the different shows from our network.
118000	121000	You know, all the way from the people that have been with us from the very, very beginning.
121000	124000	Shows like, you know, Critical Myth, Pod Culture, Electric Sisterhood.
124000	129000	All the way up to shows like our newest addition to the network Faraway Nearby.
129000	133000	So a toast to everybody who's been participating with the Voice Geeks Network and all our big shows.
133000	137000	You can check out more information on all the shows here at vognetwork.com.
137000	139000	Great plug, Loki.
139000	141000	No problem.
141000	147000	Speaking of plugs, I see you've plugged your switch into your computer to keep it running charged or whatever.
147000	153000	Yes, because my kids were playing with it all day long and I haven't got a chance to really play around with it.
153000	159000	I see. Does that work okay? Like charging it through your laptop and then your laptop is in the wall? Is that given enough of a charge to keep going?
159000	161000	It's apparently working.
161000	162000	Alright, good to know.
162000	164000	A couple percent higher than it was.
164000	170000	But sadly, hooking that into your laptop will not allow you to suddenly get in there and grab all the files, right?
170000	174000	No, I hope they have a mod chip that'll be coming in a couple weeks to do that.
174000	178000	Of course, of course. I knew there was something with that. Alright, fair enough.
178000	183000	Also, say hello. We have a guest in studio tonight and it's been a little while since we've had a fourth chair.
183000	189000	But I think it's great that we're welcoming him back. You guys actually hear this guy every week on OLR.
189000	193000	But you may not have heard him here in studio for, God, it's probably been a couple years.
193000	195000	Welcome back, Jason.
195000	198000	You're gonna get to hear me for a lot more than 13 seconds tonight.
198000	202000	That's right. And you have that down. You know exactly your window that you get.
202000	206000	One of these days, though, we're gonna change the intro on you and I'm hoping to give you something.
206000	210000	Well, what I'm hoping is that in whatever future intro we use, it'll be a loop.
210000	213000	So if you need more time, you can extend the loop. If there's less time, you can just delete the loop.
213000	217000	Which means that I get to actually do all of the audio editing in the process. But yes.
217000	218000	Doesn't that sound fun?
219000	226000	It's a great idea because sometimes, you know, I just want to sit back and say, on June 2nd of 2018,
226000	233000	when the Sacramento weather finally hit 100 degrees, the scorching sun above and the hot rods in the parking lot
233000	236000	led us to a discussion about the... Anyways.
236000	240000	On the seventh day, Microsoft said, let there be GitHub.
241000	242000	Nice. Nice.
242000	245000	All right. Anyway, that little current news going on there.
245000	249000	So, oh, our chat room's lighting up over at live.vognetwork.com.
249000	254000	SSJ saying welcome back to the studio and Eric RPG saying press X to Jason, which I'm sure you've never heard before.
254000	259000	I... nobody... I have a shirt that says that.
259000	260000	Jason. Jason.
260000	265000	And shockingly, nobody has actually used the reference against me.
265000	266000	Okay. Until now.
266000	270000	So I haven't actually heard it plenty. So thank you.
270000	275000	So, Jason, I know, obviously, you know, if I don't say this enough on the show,
275000	278000	like this show wouldn't like fucking exist right now if it wasn't for you.
278000	280000	Like, I hope folks realize that.
280000	283000	Yeah, I'm just, you know, I'm just kind of awesome.
283000	284000	You do it. Yeah. Yeah.
284000	285000	You'll go. Hold on, though.
285000	286000	We'll keep that ego check.
286000	288000	But you do a ton behind the scenes.
288000	291000	You do like the orange laundry dot com website, even though, yes, it's old.
291000	292000	And we've talked about that.
292000	297000	The fact that, you know, we have a podcast generating custom thing, a place to host the shows and everything.
297000	302000	That's all because of you as well as the audio intros and outros that you do every week.
302000	304000	So big, big thanks to that.
304000	307000	What else are you doing in gaming these days in the past couple of years?
307000	313000	I know like you do a lot with at least like watching Twitch and supporting Twitch.
313000	322000	Like you were the one that made me go to TwitchCon and finally kind of like sell me on this concept of broadcasting games for people to watch that now, like two years later, I'm actually like doing.
322000	323000	Yeah. Yeah.
323000	325000	TwitchCon was only two hours away from me at the start.
325000	327000	It's like it's practically your backyard, Rob.
327000	329000	I know. It's just Moscone. Exactly.
329000	332000	It's not like traffic is God awful.
332000	334000	I have to get in the car. I have to pay a toll to get over the bridge.
334000	337000	Five bucks over the pretty water.
337000	343000	I unfortunately like gaming.
344000	362000	What is what is most relevant and most interesting is that the Colorado chapter of the IGDA when when the Twitch Colorado group formed the folks at Cigna, Colorado Independent Game Developer Association, attended the first meetup.
362000	370000	And so there's been a strengthening of the gaming and geek tech nerd communities by nature of getting together.
370000	376000	So I've actually been pained, returning the favor and kind and attending some of the Cigna hangouts.
376000	379000	And I'm not a game developer myself.
379000	382000	And everybody asks, everybody there asks, what are you working on?
382000	386000	Well, I'm not I'm not a game developer myself.
386000	391000	I consider myself more of a kind of an integrator, maybe, maybe web service at best kind of person.
391000	401000	But I am gaming adjacent and I would love to be able to see the things the things that exist in my backyard back in Colorado that I didn't know about.
401000	410000	And I think here locally with Sacramento, even though now we have the Sacramento Game Developers Collective, which is very similar in concept to IGDA and all that.
410000	420000	What what they one thing I've kind of learned with working with them is that there is a lot more in-game development than just necessarily knowing how to program games.
420000	424000	Right. For example, I know like, you know, and I'll just I don't think I'm saying anything that's like a big secret.
424000	431000	But like when Bree was here from from that group and they were talking about the SAC Indie Arcade, which sadly it didn't happen this year, you guys.
431000	437000	We're really hoping it's going to be back next year. But Bree was on the show before and she kind of admitted she didn't really like super get into games.
437000	439000	And so she started getting involved with this.
439000	449000	But when it came to like promotion, when it came to like how to get in touch with the media and how to get your game like exposed and all that, like the business side of things that sometimes people doing the programming.
449000	453000	Don't always think about like she was like rock solid on that stuff.
453000	456000	That was a huge strength for her because she had worked with the radio background, all that.
456000	467000	So my point with that and bringing up, you know, former guests on the show is that it does remind us that like, oh, yeah, there is a lot more in the game industry besides just programmers getting in there, making the game.
467000	470000	Because then the question is, well, where's your music going to come from?
471000	473000	Where's your voiceovers going to come from, Jason?
473000	477000	Where's your voice of voice of God going to come from the other vog?
477000	479000	Nobody's poached me yet, but nobody yet.
479000	486000	Absolutely. Like it, like any like any production, like any art form, like any anything, it's not just the programmers.
486000	491000	It is also the artists, both in the visual and the acoustic and any other sense.
491000	494000	It actually it absolutely is promotion dissemination.
495000	504000	There is a certain there is a certain distribution and marketing Web site of indie games that goes by the name Game Jolt.
504000	508000	The owners are nomads, but they currently reside in Colorado.
508000	515000	And so I back as a lot of nomads do only only for their 14 K and then they move on.
515000	517000	They move on to the next mountain.
518000	523000	I see. But why? I just thought it was the legalization of a certain substance that brought a lot of nomads there.
523000	527000	And then, oh, wait, wait, they got it in California now to the entire coast.
527000	531000	Just just start in SoCal, swim all the way up. And no matter where you land, it's green.
531000	535000	Or as Raginator in our chat room asks, Sega nomads.
535000	537000	That won't even get you to the next city.
537000	542000	That is like the second funny joke Raginator said in our chat room in like this year.
542000	544000	Congratulations, buddy.
544000	547000	Also, I tripped over ours literally.
548000	550000	It is it is a brick.
551000	554000	It hurts when it falls on your foot, just saying.
554000	556000	All right. So anyway, where were we? Oh, yes.
556000	567000	So the moral of the story is, I bet these companies like, you know, your companies, these organizations like Colorado, IGDA, you know, the sat and any game developer in your city where you live.
567000	573000	You know, if you've been wanting to get involved with game development like they actually probably want more people.
573000	576000	That aren't just programmers. I mean, if that's something you want to do, cool.
576000	583000	But like, you know, if you are a music guy, if you're an art person, if you're a marketing person, if you're a Web site creator.
583000	586000	I mean, these all these things go into how to get a game out.
586000	590000	And even even if it's even if there's no digital aspect to it.
590000	596000	Cigna's holiday party at the end of last year had a had a tabletop.
596000	598000	I'm sorry, but every time you say that name, I think of health insurance.
598000	602000	I can't like I'm like, wait, Cigna, what the fuck do they have to do with anything?
602000	605000	Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
605000	615000	The holiday party had a tabletop board and card game creator and like logic, even even if you're not a programmer yourself.
615000	631000	Your ability to create design rules is just as important for for balancing, for fairness or for even tipping the scales and making knowing how to make something demonstrably significantly hard.
631000	643000	So it's it's it's a production like it's not it's not as literal as when I my my very first job was working for a newspaper whenever whenever I would tell someone that, oh, you're a writer.
643000	649000	No. Oh, you edit. No, I fix the computers of the people that do.
649000	652000	Well, yeah, and it's important for sure. For sure.
652000	660000	No, that's that's you know, it's you know, when you see these companies, like if you were to go to like Blizzard's website, they're always hiring for people.
660000	663000	Right. So you could see like what kind of roles is Blizzard trying to fill right now?
663000	667000	They're always going to have somebody that's like a project manager. And like, what does that person have to do?
667000	674000	Basically, corral all the cats, you know, and make sure that the project manager will be responsible for making sure that the game actually comes out when they say it's going to come out.
674000	680000	Organization like proper organization of people and tasks is a huge is an incredible skill.
680000	683000	For sure. Anyway, great chat.
683000	689000	Well, welcome back to the show, Jason. And it's good to have you here. And please feel free to chime in as necessary on our stories tonight.
689000	695000	I should ask you real quick, though, because we were talking about this a little bit at lunch TwitchCon this year. Is that something you're going to go?
695000	701000	I do already have well, I don't have my tickets yet. They haven't even frickin gone on sale. I have a hotel room, though.
701000	707000	And yes, when to as soon as tickets go on sale, I absolutely will be. I will be once again in your backyard in San Jose.
707000	711000	But I told you my problem with the weekend. Why are they doing Halloween weekend? Seriously?
711000	715000	Because they that's been their time slot. I know that are the weekend before.
715000	719000	I know at least one couple that's getting married Halloween weekend and then there'll be a Rocky Horror thing for sure.
719000	727000	So I'm a little I want to go like really big because now that I actually do more streaming, I actually want to and like I know people that are going to be there.
727000	729000	They're going is like, fuck, I really want to meet these people.
729000	735000	So what you're saying is we need the hyperloop to be done in the next four months so you can just get down there in half an hour.
735000	740000	Can you can you give Elon Musk a call? I mean, I am one of those tunnels. I am one of his customers.
740000	745000	I have some cloud, doesn't it? Perhaps. Perhaps.
745000	750000	Oh, well, I was going to ask you this real quick and then we'll get into news with the Twitch stuff.
750000	755000	You don't really do a lot of broadcasting, right? So is this like a similar thing to the game development?
755000	759000	What what do you do? Because you you've always been like a big supporter of Twitch and streaming and all that.
759000	764000	What what is your role in that? I am not a game developer. I'm developer adjacent.
764000	768000	I am not a Twitch broadcaster. I am broadcasting adjacent. I am a Jason.
768000	772000	Jason, you're broadcasting adjacent. Jason, come on.
772000	776000	Come on. I was literally picking up the microphone to make that joke.
776000	785000	That's pretty funny. OK. Anyway, I I have dabbled in streaming to kind of understand, especially like OBS has some really.
785000	791000	It's a it's a it's it's a language that you need to learn. It's a it's a way of putting things together that you need to learn.
791000	797000	And I I've been a tech support person my entire professional my entire life period.
797000	802000	And so that's just kind of the role that I take on. I'm a community member for friends.
802000	806000	I know I have a couple of IRL friends that stream a coworker.
806000	813000	A former coworker was a gate was my gateway drug into Twitch. And by referral, friends of friends and all that kind of stuff.
813000	817000	I go in and I help people out and I make friends by reference.
817000	824000	And I, you know, I meet new people. TwitchCon especially has has exemplified that.
824000	830000	So I'll take part and be a community member and provide knowledge and insight as possible as necessary.
830000	839000	Really rad. And I think, you know, especially for the larger streamers, which is not something I've had to deal with personally, because I'm you know, I'm still kind of I'm a affiliate, but I'm I'm still kind of small fry.
839000	849000	Right. You know, I'm a small French fry, not a jumbo size. But like those guys that are like partners and stuff like they need like teams to be able to just moderate their channels to like take the garbage out basically.
849000	852000	And sometimes it's kind of a thankless job sort of thing, you know?
852000	858000	Yep. So, yeah, you're you're doing a very important role there with all that. So. All right. Awesome. Great.
858000	864000	If you guys want to ask Jason any questions, you can over at live.vognetwork.com.
864000	872000	In fact, actually, Bobby Black Wolf is speaking up going, maybe I need to talk to Jason because I'm fighting OBS for some stuff with plugins or browser source stuff.
872000	876000	So I guess the consulting door is open. All right.
876000	880000	I am reachable on the Internet. I go by VX JasonXV.
880000	888000	That's right. And actually, funny enough, like OBS, you were kind of talking about like getting that software, you know, it's not just for streaming.
888000	892000	You can make regular movies with that, like record things.
892000	902000	And I've actually used like so for my dumb Facebook game that I got way too involved with earlier this month, you have to record these little like, you know, like like they would do on the TV show.
902000	905000	It's just like them sitting there talking shit about everybody.
905000	910000	So that's what you have to do is you have to record yourself talking shit about everybody for like five minutes every every game round, basically.
910000	919000	So I used OBS to do it so I could use my green screen to like pretend that I was in the forest or like actually people started requesting like, could you do one in the Grand Canyon?
919000	923000	So I did it when it was in the Grand Canyon. And so like I would use my green screen. That was all through OBS.
923000	929000	So I would record little things in OBS and I would use good old Windows Movie Maker to string it all together.
929000	936000	But actually, well, but then I learned like, how do I step up my game? And there's some free video editing program that's like really big Redfish or something.
936000	940000	I don't remember the name of it now. Red Lantern. I don't remember what it's called.
940000	942000	Red Lantern is a very angry.
942000	945000	I don't know. I don't I don't think that's really somebody in chat will yell it out.
945000	950000	But it's a it was a movie editing thing that's free. And I actually started to learn like how to use it.
950000	955000	And like it was like, God, this ridiculous fucking game is teaching me these like real life skills. What the fuck?
955000	961000	If you want as well, I would be more than happy to bring over my Mac and let you use iMovie.
961000	962000	Oh, yeah.
962000	964000	iMovie will work on your iPhone.
964000	971000	Now, if I shoot films on my phone, which I have done, I definitely use iMovie for that because it's super simple.
971000	975000	And it will migrate over into the desktop version.
975000	980000	Yeah, that's that's with all with the cloud and all that good stuff. Yes, of course, of course. Anyway.
980000	982000	All right. Well, let's move on.
982000	986000	We've got to get into gaming and we're going to get into, of course, our gaming weeks.
986000	989000	But first, we actually have a kickoff topic. I know we were like 20 minutes in the show.
989000	993000	We've got to get to our kickoff topic, which has to do with Pokemons.
993000	996000	That's right. E3 is just around the corner next week.
996000	1000000	Actually, we're going to have kind of a different a very different O.L.R. show.
1000000	1003000	So we're still debating. And maybe you guys can have a say with this.
1003000	1005000	We are considering one of two options.
1005000	1009000	We're either going to cut our show short so that Bethesda's press conference, we can kind of go watch that.
1009000	1011000	Then come back and give our thoughts.
1011000	1018000	But Loki is kind of suggesting that maybe we do something that I said we'd never do and actually do the live commentary this year.
1018000	1020000	Sure. Let's do it. All right.
1020000	1025000	So that may be playing live. We complain complaining live or say that's really cool.
1025000	1031000	No, I think I think less less cynicism, more optimism would be the optimistic.
1031000	1038000	I'm still hoping for another Elder Scrolls game, even if it's like some stupid like, oh, hey, we're remastering Oblivion now.
1038000	1041000	I'll take that. Yeah, we'll see that.
1041000	1046000	Maybe what we'll do, maybe I am thinking, all right, some folks are saying live commentary worth a shot.
1046000	1049000	Screw Bethesda. They're going to be let down. What I might do.
1049000	1052000	And so this would be important for the podcast folks.
1052000	1056000	What I'll probably do is we'll still do it live for those that want to listen.
1056000	1058000	They can and those that don't want to don't have to.
1058000	1064000	And then what we'll do for the podcast is we'll make that section of the show like a special download on our social media.
1064000	1068000	But we won't actually be part of the regular podcast. So that that's kind of where my head's at right now.
1068000	1070000	We'll let you all know what to expect next week.
1070000	1074000	But anyway, my point was with E3 literally around the corner is next week.
1074000	1079000	E3 is next. Well, you know, a week from next next business.
1079000	1083000	We next business. Well, no, you are right. It is next week because of all the keynote.
1083000	1085000	Yeah, yes, that's true. Oh, yeah, that's true. The keynotes are starting on Saturday.
1085000	1091000	Is your whole lesson of discussion? Yes. Six days away when the first keynote is going to be first out the gate.
1091000	1098000	So anyway, but we have leaks are starting to show up, which are getting confirmed by some of the publishers.
1098000	1104000	We'll talk about that a little later in the show, but also some people wanting to get the jump on some of the announcements.
1104000	1109000	And the Pokemon Company was one of those companies that wanted to get the jump on those announcements.
1109000	1114000	They did a little thing in Japan during this week this week.
1114000	1118000	So they talked about the latest of what's going on with Pokemon.
1118000	1123000	So the first thing that they announced is that they have a little side game called Pokemon Quest.
1123000	1127000	And Pokemon Quest came out for the Nintendo Switch for free this week.
1127000	1131000	And it is slated for mobile in about a month. It'll be coming out on iOS and Android.
1131000	1135000	You can download it on the switch right now. It's very obvious it's a mobile game.
1135000	1137000	It's all touch screen. It is. It is all touch screen.
1137000	1144000	I mean, you can't if you dock it or even if you are still in handout, you can use the little controllers to move around.
1144000	1147000	I didn't even realize this until I was streaming it earlier this week, actually.
1147000	1152000	And Bobby or somebody chimed in and said, did you know you can use L and R to change at the bottom?
1152000	1154000	I didn't even realize that.
1154000	1161000	Or you could just do what I do and just let the game play itself because it ends up beating levels that I can't do on my own.
1161000	1162000	So I'm like, eh, fine.
1162000	1164000	That may not be a bad idea, actually.
1164000	1170000	Anyhow, the little free to play thing came out and it's basically blockymon.
1170000	1172000	Like they look like very blockymon.
1172000	1173000	Cubivore Pokemon.
1173000	1178000	It is cubivore Pokemon. Well, when I first saw it, I was like, oh shit, here's Pokemon's Minecraft.
1178000	1180000	But it actually is nothing like that at all.
1180000	1184000	It's more of Crossy Roads. I was just gonna say Crossymon.
1184000	1186000	Crossy Roads Pokemon.
1186000	1187000	That's a good way of putting it.
1187000	1196000	So anyway, the thing about it is that, you know, you can't really, like, you're playing a story mode-esque sort of thing by yourself.
1196000	1200000	But you're not trading with friends. You're not interacting with friends.
1200000	1201000	You can't see how friends are progressing.
1201000	1212000	For a mobile game, well, what will be a mobile game, you know, for what's right now on the Switch, there's really no sense of competition with your friends whatsoever.
1212000	1215000	It's a shockingly antisocial mobile game.
1215000	1222000	Yes, and so therefore, all the free to play elements are just like, you know, pay this money to get items or just sit there and wait.
1222000	1224000	It's like that Harry Potter game.
1224000	1225000	Like you have energy.
1225000	1230000	Yeah, it's that whole thing, which is a little bit eh, but it is free.
1230000	1232000	So, you know, there is that.
1232000	1236000	But for me, I think it's one of those things where it's like, I played it a few times this week, and I'm done.
1236000	1238000	You know, that was cute.
1238000	1239000	Next.
1239000	1244000	You know, meanwhile, these other games are coming out, and I don't have the time to check out my silly little Pokemon.
1244000	1255000	Maybe when it's on mobile, so I can do it from places like, you know, a doctor's office or a waiting room or sitting at the airport or something, like, maybe it would make more sense in those places.
1255000	1260000	Which I guess technically you could use the Switch in those places too, but I just, I don't take my Switch with me everywhere.
1260000	1262000	I take my mobile phone with me everywhere.
1262000	1264000	So it's going to make more sense there.
1264000	1267000	But, Loki, I couldn't help but notice you have been playing it.
1267000	1272000	I noticed that was the game that was on your Switch, so that kind of surprises me.
1272000	1273000	You're into Pokemon Quest?
1273000	1275000	Yeah, it's fun. I've played it for a few hours already.
1275000	1277000	How far are you right now?
1277000	1284000	To like the, not the, like the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels, because they unlock three at a time.
1284000	1285000	So I'm to there.
1285000	1286000	Wow, okay.
1286000	1289000	I haven't got any evolutions or anything, but I have a shit ton of Pokemon though.
1289000	1292000	Okay, wow, okay. You just keep, you keep using the little cooking thing?
1292000	1295000	Do you just let it cook whatever it wants, or do you actually...
1295000	1297000	No, I looked up online how to, like, do those.
1297000	1298000	Oh, okay. I was like, there's got to do it.
1298000	1302000	But, I mean, it's easy to figure out too. It's just like, okay, all red, all blue, all, you know.
1302000	1303000	Oh, okay.
1303000	1304000	It's not that hard.
1304000	1305000	Alright.
1305000	1306000	That's really smart.
1306000	1309000	And Bobby wants to know, have you hacked it yet, Loki?
1310000	1314000	Um, I paid money to unlock some stuff, because I thought it was worth...
1314000	1316000	You gave those people money?
1316000	1320000	It's a game, yeah. I'm supporting the game, because I played it for like eight hours.
1320000	1322000	So I'm like, okay, well, I think it's...
1322000	1323000	No, I just...
1323000	1324000	Throw them some money, so I did it.
1324000	1329000	I would not have thought that Pokemon Quest on Switch, out of all of the things out there,
1329000	1332000	would have been the thing to finally get you to open up, well, I mean, I know you've opened it up before,
1332000	1334000	but would be something to get you to open up your wallet.
1334000	1336000	I'm just, I'm pleasantly surprised, that's all.
1336000	1338000	I just figured I'd throw them some money.
1338000	1339000	Alright, fair enough.
1339000	1340000	So there you go.
1340000	1341000	Headline of the week, y'all.
1341000	1343000	Loki spent money on Pokemon Quest.
1343000	1349000	Alright, so Pokemon Quest is out, but that's not the thing people really wanted to know about.
1349000	1353000	People wanted to know about, where's the real game coming out on Switch?
1353000	1356000	And Nintendo had kind of two answers for that.
1356000	1362000	In a sense, they had a literal two answer with, let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee.
1362000	1365000	Which was a game, I think they leaked, these were leaked a while ago.
1365000	1371000	Yeah, the leaks turned out to be pretty legit, because those were the leaked titles that came out.
1371000	1373000	And so, yeah, I mean, that would not be a thing.
1373000	1377000	I think most people would guess, is that Eevee was now a starter Pokemon of sorts.
1377000	1383000	Which, I mean, that makes people very happy, I'm sure, because Eevee is, you know, people love Eevee and the Eeveelutions.
1383000	1385000	So, that's really cool.
1385000	1389000	And then Pikachu, of course, has always been a bit of the mascot of the Pokemon series,
1389000	1391000	thanks in no small part to the cartoon.
1391000	1398000	So anyway, these games were confirmed, they will be coming out for the Switch, but they're not your traditional Pokemon RPG.
1398000	1404000	In fact, these games look like they are, I mean, I guess the easiest way to say it,
1404000	1411000	would be it's a bit of a hybrid of Pokemon Go and the more traditional Pokemon RPGs.
1411000	1417000	What I mean by that is that it looks like you will be catching Pokemon with a very similar ball throwing type of mechanic
1417000	1420000	that you use on the mobile phones when you play Pokemon Go.
1420000	1425000	In fact, speaking of Pokemon Go, there does appear to be a way that you will be able to bring in monsters
1425000	1429000	that you've caught in Pokemon Go into your Let's Go game.
1429000	1433000	No word yet if that's like an isolated area, because if you look really closely at the trailer,
1433000	1436000	you see it mention something called Go Park or something like that.
1436000	1441000	So it's unknown if it's like something you bring into the full game or just like this one mode that kind of works with it.
1441000	1447000	And Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee is going to have their own little Bluetooth peripheral.
1447000	1449000	It's a little Pokeball.
1449000	1452000	And you can also bring them back into Pokemon Go too.
1452000	1458000	Yes, yes, apparently. So yeah, that's got a lot of Pokemon Go players pretty excited.
1458000	1464000	So anyway, the accessory is a little Pokeball and then I guess it makes, I don't know, makes a little Pokemon noises as well.
1464000	1468000	It's Pokeball Plus that they are saying will be available in November.
1468000	1471000	For a day and then gone for three months.
1471000	1474000	That's fucking generous. For five minutes and then it will be gone.
1474000	1476000	That's a portion of the day.
1476000	1480000	If you want one of these things, you better be ready to fight.
1480000	1485000	Because we all know Nintendo cannot keep these types of things on the shelves for shit.
1485000	1488000	We don't know how to supply our vendors.
1488000	1494000	I'm just telling you all, so that when this happens, we can say, oh yes, we knew this was coming.
1494000	1498000	This is going to be the thing that you're not going to be able to fucking find, but you're going to want it.
1498000	1501000	Oh no, customer fainted.
1502000	1511000	Trainer used eBay. It's super effective, but you now have zero dollars.
1511000	1514000	Breaks list, use scalper.
1514000	1518000	So anyway, so Pikachu and Eevee.
1518000	1524000	But I say it looks like it's kind of a hybrid because when you look at the battle, the battle doesn't look like Pokemon Go at all.
1524000	1528000	Because the battle is just mash the screen as fast as you can type of thing.
1528000	1533000	But in this one, you can clearly see that the Pokemon comes out and you can choose one of three moves.
1533000	1537000	Like there's a little screenshot with Pikachu being able to use Thunder Shock or Quick Attack.
1537000	1540000	And he's limited to how many times he can do it, just like in the games.
1540000	1543000	So it does seem like there is a little bit of a hybrid there.
1543000	1547000	So you might catch your Pokemon like Pokemon Go, even though you are on the Switch.
1547000	1549000	It's a single player experience.
1549000	1560000	But I got to admit, as somebody who loves Pokemon Go, who appreciates the single player games but never seems to have the attention to completely get through them,
1560000	1565000	I'm looking at this going, wow, this seems like a really kind of perfect blend of the things I'm into.
1565000	1570000	And I understand there's people out there that just for whatever reason, they don't go outside as often.
1570000	1577000	And so this is a chance to play a game like Pokemon Go, but from the comfort of their own home or what have you.
1577000	1579000	So, I mean, that's really cool, too.
1579000	1586000	But, I mean, just as, I guess, for no other better term, but a filthy fucking casual when it comes to Pokemon.
1586000	1588000	Like, I'm like super into this.
1588000	1592000	So it's interesting to me to watch some of the, you know, reaction over on Twitter.
1592000	1594000	You've got some people that are like into it, like I am.
1594000	1597000	Some people that think it's trash.
1597000	1600000	You know, they're like, pass, you know, whatever this is.
1600000	1607000	Now, if you're one of those people that's like, pass, well, the good news is for you, they confirmed this is not Gen 8.
1607000	1611000	Pokemon Gen 8 is coming in 2019.
1611000	1612000	But...
1612000	1615000	So the next Pokemon mainline game is a year away.
1615000	1618000	It'll be what, like holiday 2019.
1618000	1621000	But that is, again, and I talked about this on a previous episode.
1621000	1626000	If you look at the number of years between mainline Pokemon gens, you should have expected 2019.
1626000	1633000	But, this game is going to be the way to unlock one of the Gen 8 Pokemon before the game.
1633000	1635000	Ah, I see. Okay, I didn't realize.
1635000	1639000	Now, I heard that there was going to be an extra Pokemon in this game.
1639000	1641000	And it's going to be a brand new Pokemon.
1641000	1648000	Yeah, so the thing, and also if you didn't already pick this up, the thing about Let's Go Pikachu, Let's Go Eevee is that it is Gen 1.
1648000	1650000	It's Kanto Pokemon only, basically.
1650000	1652000	And it's only using one Joy-Con.
1652000	1655000	It's controlled completely with like the analog stick, basically.
1655000	1658000	I'm also still kind of curious how that's going to work with Pokemon Go.
1658000	1662000	If Go has three generations, and I would think by the holiday...
1662000	1664000	Probably only port over certain Pokemon.
1664000	1667000	Yeah, maybe. Maybe only certain ones are going to be able to go back and forth.
1667000	1669000	We'll have to really see how that all shakes out.
1669000	1677000	Or maybe if these games, like Pokemon Go, are built to expand to Gen 2, Gen 3, Gen 4.
1677000	1681000	I mean, it would probably make more sense to Nintendo to sell those things separately.
1681000	1683000	But they could also be awesome DLC.
1683000	1687000	I mean, would you guys pay for DLC that was Gen 2, Gen 3, and so forth?
1687000	1688000	If the game's good.
1688000	1689000	Yeah, if the game's good.
1689000	1694000	I think it looks cool. I'm excited to get it for my kids because, you know, my youngest son is really small.
1694000	1696000	He plays Super Mario Odyssey.
1696000	1699000	He doesn't really understand everything in it and gets stuck a lot.
1699000	1702000	But my oldest son beat Super Mario Odyssey, so...
1702000	1703000	Nice.
1703000	1705000	I was surprised having played through the whole...
1705000	1707000	You know, I'm just surprised he did that.
1707000	1712000	But like, it would be nice to have a game that they could both play together that is pretty easy to control.
1712000	1714000	So, I'm down with that.
1714000	1716000	bonds006 in chat says,
1716000	1721000	This is how Ninty and Game Freak is gonna get me to buy a Switch. Damn you, gaming god.
1721000	1723000	That's over at live.vognetwork.com.
1723000	1728000	You know, I'm in a group of Pokemon Go raiders and you have all sorts of different levels of gamers in there.
1728000	1732000	And there's some people that don't really play a lot of console games.
1732000	1734000	But some of the folks in there are talking about,
1734000	1736000	So, how much is it to get a Switch?
1736000	1738000	Like, what other games are on the Switch?
1738000	1741000	So, like, if I wanted to get it for this game, what else would I be able to play?
1741000	1745000	You know, like, they're asking those types of questions where some people are thinking about it.
1745000	1747000	Like, especially because it has the Go functionality.
1747000	1752000	And, like, if you're not a Pokemon Go player, one thing you need to understand,
1752000	1755000	there are still a lot of people playing Pokemon Go.
1755000	1761000	And I don't... At least from my perspective, there's a lot of older folks that are playing.
1761000	1765000	When I say older, I kind of have to loop myself into that crowd because I'm also in my 40s.
1766000	1774000	But I notice, like, there's definitely a crowd of, like, late 30, 40, 50-year-olds that are, like, super into Pokemon Go.
1774000	1777000	Because that's why I keep running into it all these raids.
1777000	1782000	It's a very interesting... Like, the core audience right now for Pokemon Go is very interesting to me.
1782000	1785000	Yes, there's kids that do it too, but I think there's also...
1785000	1788000	Like, I see a lot of parents who bring their kids.
1788000	1791000	And then I think a lot of kids are just kind of off doing their own thing.
1791000	1794000	They're not necessarily trying to get shiny Ho-Os and things like this.
1794000	1798000	But, like, when it comes to the raids and the hardcore stuff, like, I notice a lot of, like, older people.
1798000	1800000	And I think folks that are just like,
1800000	1804000	So, okay, well, like, if I got a Nintendo Switch, it might help me in this game.
1804000	1806000	Like, I'll consider it.
1806000	1809000	Like, it's, like, super interesting to me.
1809000	1811000	That's the most expensive DLC I've ever heard.
1811000	1813000	I know, right? But there's people that'll do it.
1813000	1815000	Like, people are just going, like...
1815000	1818000	And plus... Oh, man, the best part, I don't even think I should get into it here on OLR.
1818000	1824000	But, like, some of the drama that comes up between, like, grown-ass men and women about, like...
1824000	1828000	And I told that motherfucker he needs to stay off my fucking gym until I get my coins.
1828000	1831000	And if that motherfucker knocks me off that gym before I get my fucking 50 coins,
1831000	1834000	I'm gonna go to every gym in this goddamn neighborhood and look at that motherfucker and I'm gonna knock him off.
1834000	1836000	Like, that...
1836000	1840000	I wish I could say I'm exaggerating a conversation that I've overheard. I am not.
1842000	1845000	Like, Pokemon Go has its own set of drama.
1846000	1848000	But I don't want to scare people off from Pokemon Go either.
1848000	1851000	You can stay... It's very easy to stay away from that and turn that off.
1851000	1853000	But I'm just saying, like...
1853000	1856000	It's, like, you know that's, like, the equivalent, like, a dollar worth of, like...
1856000	1862000	Yeah, these are grown-ass men and women who fucking fight about gym control.
1863000	1865000	Mommy fainted.
1866000	1869000	And, okay, thank you. Thank you. Chatter's backing me up.
1869000	1872000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, I believe that conversation happened.
1872000	1875000	Bonds006 says, yes, the gym battle drama gets real.
1875000	1879000	Actf says, I have friends that are getting back into Pokemon Go because of this new game.
1879000	1882000	Yeah, that's kind of the general vibe I've been getting on Twitter, too,
1882000	1884000	is that I've seen a lot of people that are suddenly like,
1884000	1889000	I'm gonna reinstall Pokemon Go and see what I've missed because I need to be prepared for this Switch game.
1889000	1891000	You've missed a lot.
1891000	1895000	They've been... I gotta say, the quest is something that they've done in all these different events each week.
1895000	1897000	Really helping.
1897000	1899000	So, I mean, love it or hate it,
1900000	1906000	there's no denying that Pokemon Go is, like, transforming Pokemon and therefore Nintendo.
1906000	1908000	I mean, the fact that this game is happening.
1908000	1911000	And I gotta say, I'm super fucking excited for it.
1911000	1912000	And all those people that...
1912000	1913000	I'm here for it.
1913000	1915000	Yeah, no, seriously, like, for all the people that are just like,
1915000	1917000	oh, I hate this and stuff, think about it this way.
1917000	1920000	You're getting all these people that are gonna be more into Pokemon.
1920000	1923000	Now this is kind of the next step to a traditional Pokemon RPG.
1923000	1928000	So when the new Pokemon RPG comes out, that's even more people that'll play it.
1928000	1930000	I don't see how there's a downside to this.
1930000	1931000	Yeah.
1931000	1933000	Jamie, you've been a little quiet.
1933000	1936000	I know you're not as into Pokemon Go.
1936000	1940000	Well, you play here and there, but what are your thoughts on this whole, like, direction for Let's Go?
1941000	1943000	I was actually kind of excited.
1943000	1944000	Yeah?
1944000	1948000	Yeah, I mean, it's the first new Pokemon game I've been super interested in, so...
1948000	1951000	And even Dan, who's like, eh, Pokemon, whatever,
1951000	1954000	he's, like, really liking that controller.
1954000	1956000	The Pokeball controller.
1956000	1957000	Yeah, it is pretty cool.
1957000	1959000	I like how it kind of glows.
1959000	1961000	Like, it reminds me, what was that old, like, 80's cartoon,
1961000	1963000	where when the little robot talks, it would glow?
1963000	1966000	It's what it looks like with the little Pokeballs doing.
1966000	1967000	Mmm.
1967000	1970000	But, I mean, the whole concept is very interesting,
1970000	1972000	and I was even super excited.
1972000	1974000	I was like, you know, I think I found a Pokemon game that I want.
1974000	1975000	Nice.
1975000	1977000	But I would get the Eevee one.
1977000	1979000	Well, that's fine, because I've pre-ordered Pikachu.
1979000	1983000	Because, I don't know what it is, but every gamer I know,
1983000	1986000	and I don't know what it is, has pre-ordered Eevee.
1986000	1991000	I did not realize that Eevee was, like, the unofficial, like, LGBTQ plus mascot.
1991000	1992000	Um, but...
1992000	1994000	I just think Eevee's cuter.
1994000	1998000	Eevee is cute, but I got Pikachu because, A, I'm old school and hipster,
1998000	2000000	and Pikachu's what got me into, like, the anime and stuff.
2000000	2003000	No, but for real, if all these people I know are getting Eevee,
2003000	2005000	then I'm gonna get Pikachu, so I have people to trade with.
2005000	2009000	Because Pikachu's got some weak-ass evolutions is why I would go with, you know...
2009000	2011000	You know what, but he's fucking cute, so shut up.
2011000	2014000	The first thing I'm gonna do, though, with my Eevee is make it a Flareon.
2015000	2016000	If you can, though.
2016000	2017000	Flareon was first gen.
2017000	2019000	Oh, yeah, sorry. Flareon was gen one. Yes, sorry, sorry.
2019000	2022000	I don't know why my brain went to, when you said Flareon,
2022000	2024000	my brain brought up a picture of an Umbreon.
2024000	2026000	Because it's gonna be my little flame name.
2026000	2027000	Yeah.
2027000	2031000	There you go. See, Bobby Blackwolf in chat, that's the key to a happy marriage.
2031000	2032000	Bobby Blackwolf says,
2032000	2035000	My wife has told me she's getting Eevee. I'm getting Pikachu.
2035000	2037000	Do you like, by the way, there was no discussion there.
2037000	2040000	It was just, my wife told me she's doing this.
2042000	2043000	As it normally goes.
2044000	2046000	Is that right, right, Jamie? All right.
2046000	2049000	Actually, even, you know, Alan is super into Pokemon Go,
2049000	2051000	and I think he's kind of, like, looking at this going,
2051000	2054000	huh, huh, so is this something that'll help me, too, if you get this?
2054000	2058000	Or, you know, are we gonna have to get him his own Nintendo Switch?
2058000	2060000	Help me, God. All right, anyway.
2061000	2063000	So, yeah, I'm really excited about those games.
2063000	2067000	And then, of course, gen eight, as we mentioned, at some point next year.
2067000	2070000	So, for those that aren't feeling this Go thing, you know,
2070000	2073000	you can wait till next year for the RPG.
2073000	2074000	So, you got that.
2074000	2076000	So, anyway.
2076000	2079000	Jason, what are your thoughts on the Pokemon Let's Go?
2079000	2084000	When I was younger, I told myself that I would get back into Pokemon
2084000	2088000	when the technological sophistication is...
2091000	2093000	...sufficiently upgrades.
2093000	2097000	Somehow, I told myself that was Diamond. Pokemon Diamond.
2097000	2100000	And, yeah, it had, like, system to system,
2100000	2104000	the cave mechanic that I barely even remember the details to.
2105000	2110000	But I've touched, I played maybe an hour and a half of Diamond
2110000	2111000	and never again.
2111000	2113000	Well, to be fair, that's, like, gen four, right?
2113000	2115000	That's, like, the worst gen.
2115000	2119000	I couldn't say because I just didn't really make any progress on it.
2119000	2122000	I know Bulbasaur, Twirtle, Charizard,
2122000	2124000	Charizard, Charmander weren't the starters.
2124000	2125000	Nope.
2125000	2129000	But, yeah, like, for, I don't even remember the logic
2129000	2131000	that went into that decision.
2131000	2132000	This is significant.
2132000	2133000	This is new.
2133000	2134000	This is interesting.
2134000	2137000	Yeah, I sank in, I don't know how many hours,
2137000	2142000	twenty-something, probably mid-twenties level of Pokemon Go.
2142000	2144000	Unaligned, thank you very much.
2144000	2147000	I never chose a team, which probably means, like,
2147000	2149000	the game isn't going to be available to me.
2149000	2152000	Anyways, yeah, I enjoyed Pokemon Go.
2152000	2155000	I'm keeping an eye on this kind of stuff because it is very interesting to me.
2155000	2161000	It is a very significant part of my pre-teen and teenage years,
2161000	2164000	but certainly kind of the formative teenage years,
2164000	2168000	and with all of these new features and possibilities
2168000	2171000	and Pokemon Company and Game Freak and everybody
2171000	2174000	starting to be able to actually take advantage of them.
2174000	2176000	It looks very interesting.
2176000	2180000	Nothing like, I think buying it is inevitable.
2180000	2182000	I'm not over the hump quite yet,
2182000	2186000	but it's something that I am certainly keeping an active eye on.
2188000	2190000	Yeah, there's something to be said, too,
2190000	2193000	because you mentioned that I just remember the starters weren't
2193000	2195000	Bulbasaur, Charmander, that whole thing,
2195000	2199000	but yet this is going back to a Gen 1 kind of reboot,
2199000	2203000	and I think maybe part of the reason for that is to get those people.
2203000	2205000	It's just like Pokemon Go did.
2205000	2207000	Hey, remember Pikachu and Bulbasaur and all this stuff
2207000	2209000	you remember from when you were a kid?
2209000	2212000	I think there's something about that particular first generation,
2212000	2215000	even though I know some people are burned the fuck out on reboots
2215000	2217000	and all that stuff.
2217000	2219000	Folks, there are like 800 Pokemon.
2219000	2222000	Can we stop with the first 150?
2222000	2227000	Not to mention only being limited to 150 and not,
2227000	2229000	oh god, there's so damn many.
2229000	2233000	Right. So anyway, alright.
2233000	2236000	Well, there's some thoughts on Pokemon Let's Go.
2236000	2238000	Hopefully we'll get some of your thoughts later in the show,
2238000	2241000	either in our mailbag or, of course, there's also our Skype line
2241000	2242000	at Orange Lounge Radio.
2242000	2244000	But for now, before we get into the news of the week,
2244000	2246000	we want to get to our gaming weeks.
2246000	2248000	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
2248000	2250000	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
2250000	2253000	I bought some games.
2253000	2257000	I haven't started them yet because Steam had a couple of things on sale.
2257000	2260000	One of them, well, great, now my Steam is trying to update
2260000	2262000	so I can't look at what they are.
2262000	2264000	And I put my receipts away.
2264000	2266000	I'll get my receipts in a second.
2266000	2272000	I did play, I'm starting to try to actively level in Pokemon Go again.
2272000	2277000	And, of course, you know I like my idle pouring.
2277000	2279000	Okay, so the game that I bought was,
2279000	2283000	I bought Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines for five bucks.
2283000	2285000	And I bought the Dark Souls Remastered
2285000	2288000	because it's on sale for 20 bucks right now.
2288000	2291000	And I know I bought something else, but, oh yeah,
2291000	2295000	I bought Shatter based on recommendation from a couple of the listeners.
2295000	2297000	So, we'll see if I like it.
2297000	2299000	Actually, no, I had already bought it, but someone,
2299000	2301000	I think it was Rage Nator, told me that I'd like the soundtrack,
2301000	2303000	but it wouldn't let me buy the soundtrack for myself.
2303000	2304000	It was really weird.
2304000	2310000	The Steam's DLC, I mean, for every other kind of DLC,
2310000	2312000	it makes sense that you would have to have the base game,
2312000	2315000	but just because of the way that you have to have the game
2315000	2318000	to download the soundtrack, yeah, it's a mess.
2318000	2325000	Yeah, so with that then, I was, since I had to get a new phone,
2325000	2330000	I went back to go finish playing the new Puzzle Bobble game.
2330000	2333000	Yeah, I have to start completely over on Puzzle Bobble,
2333000	2337000	and I was like on stage 80 when I quit, when I had to replace my phone.
2337000	2340000	So, a little bit aggravated by that.
2340000	2344000	Apparently a set of Corsos on sale for 15% off, so that's cool.
2345000	2348000	If you like your car games.
2348000	2351000	And Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons is on sale for $2.99.
2351000	2353000	I'm buying it right now.
2353000	2356000	So, anyway, it's really been kind of a busy week
2356000	2359000	because I did just come back from DragCon before that,
2359000	2362000	and then all of the Bay Area stuff I've been doing.
2362000	2368000	Probably this month is not going to be a very great gaming time for me
2368000	2373000	because I have two Pride events, sorry, three Pride events.
2374000	2377000	Are you doing Sacramento Pride this coming weekend?
2377000	2378000	I'm doing Sacramento Pride.
2378000	2380000	I may actually go after all. I know I said I wasn't going to go,
2380000	2383000	but one of my friends was like, we should go, we should go.
2383000	2384000	And I'm like, all right.
2384000	2386000	If we have a booth, I'll let you know.
2386000	2390000	But, yeah, I'm doing Sacramento Pride, Rainbow Festival, and San Francisco Pride.
2390000	2394000	So, it may be just mostly Pokemon for this month.
2394000	2395000	That's all right.
2395000	2396000	Yeah.
2396000	2397000	That's still a game.
2397000	2399000	That's going to be me next month
2399000	2402000	because next month I'm going to be in rehearsals for,
2402000	2403000	I guess I can say this now,
2403000	2408000	I'm going to be in Clue the movie here locally on July 28th.
2408000	2409000	Kermit flail.
2409000	2410000	Kermit flail.
2410000	2411000	At the Colonial.
2411000	2415000	And I think the reason why people like Jamie are taking a particular interest
2415000	2419000	in what's happening here, I'm going to be playing Mrs. Peacock.
2420000	2424000	So, if you've ever seen Clue the movie, you know that Mrs. Peacock,
2424000	2426000	like she starts the movie like she's kind of normal
2426000	2429000	and then she kind of goes like completely neurotic.
2429000	2434000	So, I remember about 10 years ago, I saw a stage adaptation of the movie Clue.
2434000	2436000	I think it was totally bootleg and probably would have got shut down
2436000	2438000	if Paramount found out about it.
2438000	2440000	But that was the first idea where it planted in my head
2440000	2445000	where Mrs. Peacock is like 15 times funnier as a drag queen.
2445000	2448000	And so, I was kind of like, all right, like acting goals.
2448000	2452000	So, here we are, July 28th, acting goals.
2452000	2453000	I'm going to play Mrs. Peacock.
2453000	2457000	So, I'm like actually like super excited about it.
2457000	2460000	But now I'm realizing like, oh God, I have to shave my beard.
2460000	2464000	I'm going to miss my beard and I have to shave lots of other stuff too.
2464000	2467000	But thankfully, Mrs. Peacock's dress is pretty big.
2467000	2470000	So, I won't have to go too crazy. But yeah, I'm excited about it.
2470000	2472000	This means no tucking.
2472000	2475000	Yeah, that's one of the big reasons.
2475000	2478000	And let me tell you, it's a big reason. No, I'm kidding.
2478000	2481000	It's one of the big reasons why I was willing to play a part like that
2481000	2483000	is because the dress is pretty conservative.
2483000	2486000	So, I didn't have to like go like all out, you know what I mean?
2486000	2488000	So, but it'll be fun. It's going to be a good time.
2488000	2491000	I'm pretty handy with hot glue so I can help make a fascinator.
2491000	2492000	Not when it comes to that.
2492000	2496000	I meant the fascinator. Her weird hat thing that she's...
2496000	2500000	Is it just me or we went for the topic of tucking to where Jamie goes,
2500000	2502000	I have a hot glue gun. No!
2502000	2506000	No, everyone knows that you use boat tape to tuck, okay?
2506000	2508000	Yes, I'm aware, yes.
2508000	2511000	Or a friend of mine uses gaff tape.
2511000	2512000	Yes, anyway.
2513000	2514000	Not duct tape.
2514000	2519000	Hey, for someone who don't have the junks, she knows a bit about tucking, okay?
2519000	2520000	You can, you can, you know what?
2520000	2523000	And if you want to hear more, there's a YouTube for it.
2523000	2525000	There's all sorts of YouTubes for everything.
2525000	2530000	So, go enlighten yourself if you are curious how that part works.
2530000	2532000	But meanwhile, we are a video gaming podcast.
2532000	2535000	So, I'm going to take it over to Loki for how was your gaming week?
2535000	2540000	This week, I played a lot of stuff on the Switch.
2540000	2544000	So, I finished... I don't remember if I beat Mario Odyssey this week or last week,
2544000	2548000	but I finished Mario Odyssey, just the regular storyline.
2548000	2551000	So, now it's, of course, getting all the Power Moons and everything.
2551000	2554000	So, now I have all of the Power Moons in the Sand Kingdom.
2554000	2556000	Actually, all but one.
2556000	2561000	One which is following this taxi around, which that's pretty super easy to get.
2561000	2563000	So, I'm not worried about that right now.
2563000	2566000	And then, let's see what else.
2566000	2569000	I picked up a few games on the Switch as well.
2569000	2571000	So, they had some sale with some of their LEGO games.
2571000	2573000	And so, I picked those up.
2573000	2576000	So, I've got LEGO Worlds, which my kids have been playing a lot.
2576000	2578000	And that's kind of... Yeah, it's been a while since I played LEGO Worlds,
2578000	2582000	because I was in when it was in early access, when I first got released.
2582000	2587000	And so, I played it back when it was just being made.
2587000	2590000	And it was very early and rough around the edges.
2590000	2593000	Now, it's completely different. So, I'm kind of interested in it.
2593000	2595000	It's all right.
2596000	2599000	And of course, the LEGO Ninjago game, because that was half off as well,
2599000	2601000	because I like the movie.
2601000	2603000	And what else?
2603000	2606000	The Pokémon Quest game, I've been playing quite a bit of that.
2606000	2609000	Pokémon GO, I've been playing more of that,
2609000	2614000	just because they've had a lot of their stone and earth types.
2614000	2619000	And so, I've been trying to just level up some of the ones I don't have yet.
2619000	2622000	Fucking lack of fucking shinies is driving me crazy.
2622000	2626000	I have not gotten a shiny anything since...
2631000	2634000	What was the Dragon Water one?
2634000	2635000	Dratini?
2635000	2638000	Dratini, yeah, since Dratini. That's the last shiny that I got.
2638000	2639000	Wow.
2639000	2642000	And I played quite a bit. I mean, I don't know.
2642000	2647000	I know, me too. I run my gacha a lot, and I'm just not getting my needs met.
2647000	2651000	Yeah, so to me, I don't even know that there's shinies, because I never get them.
2652000	2654000	And then what else?
2654000	2656000	Yeah, I think that's about it.
2656000	2659000	I picked some stuff up on Steam. I don't remember what it was, though.
2659000	2661000	It was just a Humble Bundle.
2661000	2663000	So whatever that last one was, I think it was the multiplayer one.
2663000	2667000	I think I wanted it just for this stick fight game, because that game's awesome.
2667000	2671000	Same guy as it did, you know, the Total Epic Battle Simulator,
2671000	2675000	and Cluster Trucks, and stuff like that.
2675000	2677000	So I wanted to support them, and the game looks awesome.
2677000	2678000	I watched some people play that.
2678000	2682000	Cluster Truck is fucking fantastic.
2682000	2683000	It is a great game.
2683000	2691000	I lament not playing it more, but the fact that I've played it since its official release...
2691000	2694000	Oh god, what was that? End of 2016 or something like that?
2694000	2695000	Yeah, it was more like that.
2695000	2696000	All sorts of fun.
2696000	2698000	But yeah, I mean, I had finished everything.
2698000	2703000	The only thing I don't have on that is I haven't played the PC version enough to where I've gotten...
2703000	2710000	They had Halloween special levels and stuff like that that I wanted to try out, and I don't have those yet.
2710000	2712000	So I had to play through that.
2712000	2716000	And then I did play a little bit more Bloodstained Curse of the Moon,
2716000	2719000	and I think that was it.
2719000	2724000	It was mostly Switch stuff, just because it's very convenient to play that, especially after my kids go to bed,
2724000	2727000	because I just pop it off the dock and away I go.
2727000	2730000	So that's been my week.
2731000	2734000	Alright, Jason, you want to tell us about your gaming week?
2734000	2738000	I have been eyeballing the Switch for a while.
2738000	2742000	I was in San Diego in, well, April now.
2742000	2744000	It's June, so not last month.
2744000	2751000	I was in San Diego in April, and on the way back, visited a friend of mine in Arizona that had one,
2751000	2764000	and beat the entirety of Odyssey with a modicum of Power Moon chasing, finding, puzzling.
2764000	2770000	I beat the entirety of the story, kind of rushed it towards the end, but I legitimately beat that game.
2770000	2776000	And as I expected, everything about the Switch's design is phenomenal.
2776000	2782000	You see the underpinnings of what the Wii and the Wii U brought,
2782000	2788000	and they turned it into such a great presentation package.
2788000	2795000	So many things that they're doing with Labo and other accessories,
2795000	2799000	and all of the wireless capability of the Switch is phenomenal.
2799000	2803000	All of this I'm putting together to say, I own a Switch!
2803000	2809000	So, my gaming week has been playing Odyssey on my own system,
2809000	2817000	over again doing a lot more Power Moon hunting, and that's the only retail title I owned.
2817000	2825000	I've been a fan of 2020 Super Baseball since it's existed, both in arcade and on the SNES,
2825000	2828000	and seeing that on the store, I picked that up immediately.
2829000	2835000	I touched on Pokemon Quest just to see how it played, get a feel for those mechanics.
2835000	2842000	It was kind of interesting, yeah, but getting most of the way through Odyssey again,
2842000	2853000	a little bit of downtime, my brain is wiped from the 48 hours of driving that I've been doing.
2853000	2862000	Working mostly in Odyssey and Downtime, I actually read Ready Player One.
2862000	2867000	That's gaming related. I hadn't read that back in the day.
2867000	2868000	Did you see the movie already?
2868000	2869000	Yes, I caught the movie.
2869000	2871000	It's completely separate.
2871000	2886000	Yeah, it is, but I think thematically, with the intent of the base ideas that went into the book,
2886000	2894000	they took the important bits and then made, not better references, certainly different references,
2894000	2896000	more modern references than the movie.
2896000	2900000	I enjoyed the movie and I read the entire book, and that was great.
2901000	2906000	Gaming Week has been reading Ready Player One, catching up on Odyssey,
2906000	2910000	a little bit of dabbling of some other stuff, some other random stuff on the store,
2910000	2914000	and I think that's pretty much it.
2917000	2924000	Because I'm not on a weekly basis, I have been playing Borderlands with two friends of mine
2924000	2931000	for quite a few months now, once a week on Sundays every week when I'm not traveling,
2931000	2936000	and I have officially beaten Borderlands 2 for the first time all the way through, finally.
2936000	2937000	Nice.
2937000	2941000	And so we started, we were kind of back and forth between the DLC and the pre-sequel and all that kind of stuff.
2941000	2946000	We'll get to it eventually, but we're actually doing True Vault Hunter mode,
2946000	2949000	which, because I had never beaten, I never did that either,
2949000	2953000	so seeing mostly the name renames more than anything else,
2953000	2959000	but even some of the quirks of making armored racks and armored psychos
2959000	2966000	and a lot of those things even worse and even harder and more frustrating to deal with has been really interesting.
2966000	2970000	So Borderlands 2 for the past couple weeks with some friends of mine,
2970000	2975000	and yeah, fill in time where possible and when not traveling.
2975000	2979000	Alright, well that's fun. Borderlands Friends, that's a nice little weekly thing to do.
2979000	2982000	I need to play through the pre-sequel still. I'm hoping for three this year.
2982000	2984000	Yup, yup. I'm hoping for three.
2984000	2988000	I think that's a pretty safe bet that that'll happen, but we'll see.
2988000	2992000	Anyway, my Game of the Week, I'll try to keep it fast since we've had a lot of Game of the Weeks,
2992000	2998000	but I've been playing more Pokémon GO. I got my Latias so I can calm down about having my Pokédex very filled,
2998000	3002000	although one of my friends is visiting Texas right now, so he just sent me a picture.
3002000	3007000	He just caught a Corrosola, so I'm a little jealous. These region locked stupid Pokémon,
3007000	3011000	but oh well, one of these days I'll catch some region locks of my own.
3011000	3016000	Let's see, I've also been playing on the Switch. I also was playing Pokémon Quest a little bit.
3016000	3020000	I've been continuing in Hyrule Warriors, which I think I was playing after the show last week,
3020000	3025000	and still having a good time playing that, but all these other games that are coming out that are getting my attention,
3025000	3031000	including, I finally got my code on the Switch so I could play Bloodstained Curse of the Moon on the Switch,
3031000	3036000	so I actually did a stream of that for probably a good hour, hour and a half earlier this week,
3036000	3039000	and I played through like, I don't know, six or seven levels.
3039000	3043000	I got all the way to the boss with the, that's kind of like the succubus girl that has little umbrellas,
3043000	3045000	like that was the last thing I beat.
3045000	3047000	Yeah, so I was trying to explain it to my kids.
3047000	3050000	Why is there bathtub red? I'm like, it's blood.
3050000	3056000	Because it's full of heart candy, you know, I don't know, you just have to kind of, yeah.
3056000	3061000	So anyway, I like, you know, especially, it's funny because as I was playing through the stream,
3061000	3064000	I was like, you know, oh my god, this is just like Castlevania, this is just like Castlevania,
3064000	3066000	like these monsters are just like Castlevania.
3066000	3067000	Exactly, yeah.
3067000	3071000	I do like those like small little subtle things that they change, like the different candle colors,
3071000	3074000	so you know if it has a weapon in it type of thing.
3074000	3078000	I really like the character switching mechanic, like the old dude that's an alchemist,
3078000	3084000	like some of his attacks are badass, like that ice thing saved my ass, I don't know how many times.
3084000	3087000	So, and I remember there's even one of these boss fights I was doing.
3087000	3090000	Oh yeah, it was the painting, the painting that fucking like ate one of my characters.
3090000	3093000	I was like, what the fuck? The painting just like one shot at me.
3093000	3096000	So I was like, fuck this, so I played the old guy and I just shot it with an ice beam,
3096000	3100000	and then just walked up to him and went, beep, with the little rod and the painting shattered.
3100000	3101000	I was like, well that made it easy.
3101000	3106000	So anyway, I like that variance between the different characters and thought that that was really cool.
3106000	3110000	And I've been playing on the simple mode, I've been playing in casual mode,
3110000	3113000	or sometimes as we call it here on the show, Bobby Black Wolf mode.
3113000	3117000	It's not, there's nothing wrong with it, it's just you have infinite continuous, so what?
3117000	3119000	Exactly, so what? It's still the same thing.
3119000	3124000	It's funny because I haven't played this game yet, I bought it and I'm going to play it after the show,
3124000	3129000	and it's called Just Shapes and Beats, which is a game that Jason referenced in the introduction there.
3129000	3133000	Just Shapes and Beats has been shown at conventions for like years and years now,
3133000	3137000	and I remember like the Mortal Kombat theme was always like a song.
3137000	3140000	Did the Mortal Kombat theme even make the final game? I don't think it did.
3140000	3141000	I don't think so.
3141000	3143000	I think it's just like, yeah, I think it's just like other bit tunes.
3143000	3145000	I guess Bobby would know because he's been playing.
3145000	3148000	It sure was a highlight, yeah.
3148000	3150000	Well because everybody knows that song.
3150000	3157000	If not all three PAX outs that I've been to 2016, 2017, 2018, it was absolutely 2017 and 18,
3157000	3163000	and when you get kind of towards the middle of the show floor, test your mind.
3167000	3174000	And so I saw it at MAGFest, I think both times I was at MAGFest I saw it, so kind of a similar thing really.
3174000	3180000	I mean, I make fun of it, but you know, hats off to them for putting something, for being able to get it together,
3180000	3183000	and consistently having a crowd and getting it out the door.
3183000	3187000	Well anyway, the thing with that game, Just Shapes and Beats, I noticed because I haven't played it yet,
3187000	3191000	but I went through to configure the options just to make sure that when I broadcast it after the show tonight,
3191000	3193000	because Bobby and I are going to do a co-stream after the show tonight,
3193000	3196000	I want to make sure that when I broadcast it, it's going to look fine.
3196000	3200000	So I was going through different options, and I noticed one of them was about a casual mode,
3200000	3206000	and it said something about, in this mode you have two times more health to help you basically get through the story mode and stuff,
3206000	3210000	and it said something like, there's no judgment in playing this mode, just have a good time with a little heart emoji,
3210000	3213000	and I thought that was really funny, so I like that they did that.
3213000	3220000	Anything that talks about a casual mode will always remind me of my Devil May Cry 3,
3220000	3226000	that I was just horrendously terrible at it, so much so that I unlocked easy mode,
3226000	3228000	and I turned off the game and never played it again.
3228000	3232000	You know what, there's so many people that will go to the park and play basketball on casual mode,
3232000	3237000	or play baseball on casual mode, so you know what, sometimes you're going to play a video game on casual mode.
3237000	3243000	And that's also why basketball was created, because they could just land shots all day if they just didn't have to run around all the time.
3243000	3245000	Oh my god, alright.
3245000	3249000	Is it the 90s yet? Have we traveled back yet?
3249000	3250000	Dated reference.
3250000	3254000	Bonds006 in chat says, I own the term filthy casual, I play all my games on casual.
3254000	3256000	Hey, no shame in that.
3256000	3262000	Well, my thought with Bloodstained 2 is that knowing it's like an 8-bit version, I'm like, it's not going to be that long of a game,
3262000	3268000	so once I play through it on casual and I beat it on casual, if I like it enough, then I'll go through and play it on normal now.
3268000	3272000	And it's like, okay, now I'll kind of know what to expect, and I think I'm actually kind of glad I did it that way,
3272000	3276000	because there are things like the branching paths and the upgrades,
3276000	3280000	and there are things where I'm like, okay, I'm glad I kind of know this in advance of playing it on normal mode.
3280000	3281000	I think that will help.
3281000	3286000	So, anyway, that's enough for my gaming week and what I have been playing this week.
3286000	3289000	By the way, though, it did come to my memory this week.
3289000	3294000	I recalled that we had talked about a Minecraft Realms for VoG.
3294000	3296000	We got distracted with all this other stuff.
3296000	3297000	Oh yes, I have not forgotten.
3297000	3300000	So that is something that I want us to hopefully get underway this week,
3300000	3306000	so stay tuned to our Discord for all the details over at vognetwork.com slash Discord,
3306000	3309000	and once we have something up and running, I'll be sure to post more information there,
3309000	3312000	but that is something I'd like us to do this summer for all the Minecraft players.
3312000	3314000	Are we going to do survival or creative?
3314000	3318000	I think we're going to do survival so that there is actually a game.
3318000	3320000	I won't play then.
3320000	3322000	Oh, but it'll be easy survival.
3322000	3324000	But I don't like survival mode at all.
3324000	3332000	All right, well, creative is just, I mean, there's no reason we can't have two realms,
3332000	3334000	but if I'm paying for it, I'm going to pay for the survival realm.
3334000	3336000	I'll just play by myself.
3336000	3338000	All right.
3338000	3343000	Yeah, I think just with creative, it's cool because it's art on a canvas,
3343000	3346000	but I don't think there's as much.
3346000	3349000	And I think when you did yours, yours was on creative, right?
3349000	3353000	It started off survival, and then we just went creative
3353000	3357000	because we were going to do a lot more stuff in there.
3357000	3361000	Bobby Blacko says, is there a survival peaceful where there's survival mode,
3361000	3363000	but there's no creepers?
3363000	3364000	We'll look into that.
3364000	3365000	Yes, you can do that.
3365000	3368000	Yeah, because creepers are fucking annoying anyway.
3368000	3371000	Just no creepers specifically or is that PvP?
3371000	3377000	I think you can turn PvP on and off, but I think there's a mode where it's still like,
3377000	3382000	the thing is though, in crafting mode, you have access to anything when you want.
3382000	3386000	Peaceful though, I don't remember if there's animals though with peaceful.
3386000	3387000	I don't remember.
3387000	3389000	We'll look into it. We'll figure it out.
3389000	3393000	Creepers aren't that bad. You'll just get used to not having to deal with it.
3393000	3400000	You can turn off creeper, I think where you can turn it off where the explosions don't break anything.
3400000	3401000	They just hurt you.
3401000	3402000	Yeah, that's the annoying part.
3402000	3405000	I think you can turn that off, I think.
3405000	3407000	We'll look into it this week.
3407000	3410000	Alright, anyhow, that is enough though for our gaming weeks.
3410000	3415000	As far as announcements go, next week will be a little bit of a shorter slash different show
3415000	3419000	because E3 is going to start on Saturday and run through,
3419000	3422000	let's see, we have preferences on Sunday and then Monday,
3422000	3427000	and then the actual show starts Tuesday as well as the last press conference,
3427000	3430000	or in this case Nintendo Direct, is Tuesday morning.
3430000	3433000	So there will be lots and lots coming through E3,
3433000	3436000	but we'll kind of be in the midst of that when we do our show next week.
3436000	3440000	In two weeks, we will be celebrating 16 years of Orange Lawns Radio.
3440000	3443000	This show is old enough to drive right off a cliff.
3443000	3448000	That is where we're at with 16 years of Orange Lawns Radio.
3448000	3454000	And then we will be off the week of the 24th.
3454000	3459000	It's a good thing that this show ends in the 9 o'clock hour Pacific
3459000	3463000	because when you're 16 on your provisional license, you can't drive after 10.
3463000	3464000	Oh, is that true?
3464000	3465000	Depends on where you are.
3465000	3466000	Yeah, it depends on where you are.
3466000	3467000	Is that not US-wide by now?
3467000	3469000	That's not US-wide.
3469000	3473000	Well, keep in mind, in Mississippi, permit age is 14.
3473000	3474000	Yeah.
3474000	3475000	Oh, wow.
3475000	3476000	You get your license when you're 15,
3476000	3481000	but I don't think it's required yet to have driver's ed to get it at 15.
3481000	3483000	They've changed a lot in California.
3483000	3487000	I think even when you have your license, like 16, 17, 18,
3487000	3492000	you can't have other kids in the car or something weird.
3492000	3493000	They have some really weird lawyer.
3493000	3495000	Yeah, those are the same rules.
3495000	3499000	At least for me, when I had my provisional license,
3499000	3501000	because I'm the youngest one in the room,
3501000	3505000	for me, when I went through the driver's license process growing up in New Mexico,
3505000	3510000	obviously, with your permit, you had to have an adult, a parent.
3510000	3512000	I think it was any adult, not just a parent.
3512000	3517000	But with a provisional license, you could not drive after 10 before 6
3517000	3519000	with more than one other friend.
3519000	3523000	All of these can be overridden with a parent in the car.
3523000	3528000	And I think the only other requirement is that you're supposed to have,
3528000	3531000	like, 50 hours of driving by the time you get your actual license.
3531000	3535000	I remember getting pulled over at 2 in the morning once when I was 16,
3535000	3537000	but I had legit, because my dad worked for the railroad,
3537000	3539000	so he was on call 24 hours a day.
3539000	3542000	I had legit taken my dad to work at 1 in the morning
3542000	3545000	so I could use the car on the weekend for something else.
3545000	3547000	I got pulled over, and I was by myself,
3547000	3549000	and I think the cop was more concerned with, like,
3549000	3552000	what the hell is he doing out at 2 in the morning by himself?
3552000	3553000	Give me your fake ID.
3553000	3554000	Yeah, right?
3554000	3555000	Just take it with you.
3555000	3558000	Anyway, no, they didn't have quite those same rules when I was 16.
3558000	3559000	Anyway, all right.
3561000	3564000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio
3564000	3568000	at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, magazine.
3568000	3570000	Uh, let's move on.
3570000	3571000	Let's talk about news.
3571000	3574000	We got gaming news to get to, starting with Loki.
3574000	3575000	Let's get into news.
3575000	3576000	Do we have news? Okay.
3576000	3577000	A few things.
3577000	3579000	I guess we'll get to that, finally.
3579000	3585000	So, we talked about how PUBG was kind of a little upset
3585000	3588000	that there was this competitor, Fortnite,
3588000	3591000	that was, you know, coming out
3591000	3593000	and just kind of taking over the market
3593000	3595000	that they had kind of built up a little bit
3595000	3597000	with the whole battle royale genre.
3597000	3600000	And, you know, their complaints before were like,
3600000	3602000	well, hey, they're ripping us off
3602000	3607000	because, you know, this uses a frying pan in this game,
3607000	3610000	and actually, I think this lawsuit was similar.
3610000	3613000	They were doing it against mobile games as well,
3613000	3614000	like some mobile knockoffs saying that,
3614000	3616000	oh, yeah, they use a frying pan.
3616000	3619000	They use the phrase, you know, winner, winner, chicken dinner
3619000	3621000	or some other bullshit like that,
3621000	3626000	and basically the whole concept of the battle royale gameplay.
3626000	3630000	Well, now they have strangely enough decided
3630000	3634000	that they're going to sue Epic Games over Fortnite.
3634000	3636000	Just to put some things in perspective,
3636000	3639000	I'm looking at Twitch right now, the rankings live on Twitch.
3639000	3644000	So, Fortnite is currently the number two ranked game on Twitch
3644000	3648000	with 224,149 viewers.
3648000	3650000	IRL is number one right now.
3650000	3652000	I don't know what's going on IRL, but yeah.
3652000	3655000	Fortnite is number two, and then Player Unknown Battlegrounds,
3655000	3659000	which used to be, like I would see it number one all the time, number 15.
3659000	3663000	That is on my phone right now looking at the Twitch app.
3663000	3668000	So, I mean, their main complaint is that, you know, one,
3668000	3673000	that it's unfair because they were licensing the, you know,
3673000	3676000	Epic's game engine to basically build their game,
3676000	3679000	and because they were using the Unreal Engine,
3679000	3682000	they felt that, oh, because they were familiar with our game,
3682000	3684000	so they just straight up copied it,
3684000	3689000	and now they're profiting off of this thing that we came up with.
3689000	3693000	I don't know. To me, it seems kind of ridiculous,
3693000	3696000	but let them try, I guess.
3696000	3698000	They are suing them, though, in Korea,
3698000	3700000	which is kind of interesting that they're not doing that in the US.
3700000	3702000	I'm wondering maybe if their laws are a little bit different there,
3702000	3706000	or what's going to count as, you know, copyright or whatever.
3706000	3710000	But, yeah, so that's something that they're doing,
3710000	3713000	and what's kind of weird, though, about that is, like, okay,
3713000	3717000	you're suing the company that you're using their game engine.
3717000	3721000	I mean, you don't think that there's going to be any sort of negative consequence
3721000	3723000	to doing something like that.
3723000	3725000	I mean, that doesn't seem like a very smart thing to do,
3725000	3730000	but they're going to try, and I think they're going to fail,
3730000	3733000	but they're going to try, and we'll see what happens,
3733000	3736000	but ultimately they're probably going to fail.
3736000	3740000	Yeah, I don't really see it. Well, this lawsuit is not in America.
3740000	3742000	It's not. It's in Korea.
3742000	3745000	And it's just such a stretch. Like, I get it, the gameplay is similar,
3745000	3748000	but then that's kind of going back way, way back, like,
3748000	3751000	Street Fighter clones, Doom clones.
3751000	3755000	First off, you didn't invent the battle royale genre, one.
3755000	3758000	I mean, there were games that were out way before PUBG
3758000	3760000	that were basically the same type of game.
3760000	3762000	And the Romans existed.
3762000	3764000	Yes. Right.
3764000	3767000	You know, like, H1Z1, King of the Kill, very similar gameplay.
3767000	3770000	And honestly, I think that would be the defense's angle right there,
3770000	3773000	is that you didn't invent it either. Done.
3773000	3776000	Using a frying pan as a weapon in the game, not iconic to your game.
3776000	3779000	Yang did that in Final Fantasy IV, thank you, thanks to his wife.
3779000	3781000	Princess Peach did it in Super Mario RPG.
3781000	3783000	And it's been used in books.
3783000	3785000	There you go.
3786000	3788000	I'm sorry, am I the only one that read Dragonlance?
3788000	3790000	And it's been used in the kitchen.
3790000	3791000	Exactly.
3791000	3794000	And on top of that, a lot of the assets that are used in PUBG
3794000	3796000	are straight out of the Unreal store.
3796000	3800000	Like, there's not really a cohesive style to the game,
3800000	3804000	whereas Fortnite has this unique art style, unique gameplay,
3804000	3806000	there's the whole building portion of that.
3806000	3808000	It's very different.
3808000	3811000	It seems like such a stretch to try to...
3812000	3815000	The goal of seeing that their game copied yours
3815000	3818000	just because their game is doing better than yours right now.
3819000	3820000	Thank you, Ninja.
3820000	3822000	You know what? Karma's gonna come up.
3822000	3824000	It's gonna catch up to you.
3824000	3827000	And it's gonna bite you in the ass, especially when it's the company
3827000	3829000	that you're licensing their fucking game.
3829000	3831000	I know, I was gonna say, I am really surprised
3831000	3834000	that we have not seen Epic make a move where it's like,
3834000	3836000	you know what, due to ongoing litigation,
3836000	3839000	we have to suspend your license because of this litigation.
3839000	3842000	I'm really surprised Epic hasn't made a move like that yet.
3842000	3843000	Maybe it's coming.
3843000	3846000	Maybe that's something they could subtly do during E3
3846000	3849000	and it might get lost with all the other news going on,
3849000	3850000	but we'll see.
3851000	3852000	But, I mean...
3852000	3854000	I mean, the PUBG fans would certainly notice
3854000	3855000	and make a fuss about it.
3855000	3856000	We'll see.
3856000	3858000	I'm just curious to see what will happen,
3858000	3861000	but I just think that you gotta...
3862000	3863000	It's not a direct clone.
3863000	3864000	It's not like we're seeing like,
3864000	3866000	oh, look at this, this is a mobile game
3866000	3868000	that looks like it's PUBG.
3868000	3870000	It's just something different.
3870000	3871000	They're calling it something different
3871000	3874000	and copying the unique style of the game,
3874000	3877000	but this game is very general and kind of bland looking
3877000	3879000	and that's to its detriment, unfortunately.
3879000	3880000	Yeah.
3880000	3881000	So, we'll see.
3881000	3883000	Speaking of Fortnite,
3883000	3887000	there's rumors that it's coming to the Switch,
3887000	3889000	and this is from a couple different sources,
3889000	3893000	one being that there is this document posted on 4chan,
3893000	3895000	so take that as you will,
3895000	3897000	but allegedly it's like a leaked...
3897000	3899000	I'm bringing in the truck full of salt.
3899000	3900000	A leaked...
3900000	3907000	It's allegedly a leaked piece of material from E3
3907000	3909000	and advertising materials, something like that,
3909000	3911000	talking about games coming out to the Switch.
3911000	3915000	However, there is also a second source, though,
3915000	3916000	which is the Korean ratings board
3916000	3918000	that mentions it on the Switch,
3918000	3920000	so maybe that's a little bit more legit,
3920000	3922000	but we'll see.
3922000	3926000	It wouldn't be a big jump to say that it's coming to the Switch.
3926000	3929000	I would imagine that that would do well there.
3929000	3932000	So, we'll have to wait and see what happens.
3932000	3934000	Only a couple weeks.
3935000	3936000	All right.
3936000	3937000	Yeah, I'm pretty...
3937000	3938000	Do you think it's...
3938000	3939000	I think it's absolutely happening.
3939000	3940000	I think it's legit.
3940000	3941000	Yeah.
3941000	3943000	I don't see why not.
3943000	3944000	All right.
3944000	3945000	Yeah, Dark Tetsuya says,
3945000	3947000	normally I wouldn't put a lot of stock in that rumor,
3947000	3949000	but the Korean rating board thing is interesting.
3949000	3951000	Well, also, if you think about Nintendo,
3951000	3952000	it's a good way to sell that,
3952000	3954000	hey, multiplayer pass.
3954000	3955000	Oh, good point.
3955000	3956000	Good point.
3956000	3957000	Nintendo is trying to load up
3957000	3959000	on all the stuff that's multiplayer online.
3959000	3962000	Although, games go on PC and play it for free,
3962000	3963000	but, you know...
3963000	3965000	And you can't stream Fortnite as easily from the Switch.
3965000	3967000	I mean, well, I mean, if you have a card like I do,
3967000	3969000	it's super easy, but, you know,
3969000	3971000	not as built in.
3971000	3972000	Anyway.
3972000	3974000	All right, well, over on the Microsoft side of things,
3974000	3976000	Microsoft taking a little heat this week
3976000	3980000	because they have laid off Xbox support staff,
3980000	3983000	and the new plan for folks that need Xbox support
3983000	3986000	used volunteers from the Xbox Ambassadors program.
3986000	3988000	Now, well, before you go too crazy with this,
3988000	3990000	it's not like they closed their whole call center
3990000	3991000	or anything like this.
3991000	3993000	Here's what actually happened.
3993000	3996000	Microsoft let go of 12 people from the Xbox support teams.
3996000	3999000	It's not like the entire existence of their support staff.
3999000	4002000	But, I mean, it's still worth noting,
4002000	4004000	like, they let paid people go
4004000	4007000	to basically have volunteers do what they were doing.
4007000	4009000	It sounds like a lot of these folks
4009000	4012000	were inquiries that went to Twitter.
4012000	4015000	It's like, you know how Xbox has a pretty active Twitter account
4015000	4018000	that will help people that are complaining about different things?
4018000	4022000	It sounds like a lot of the staff came from this area.
4022000	4025000	So Xbox Ambassadors now will be the ones
4025000	4027000	that will be able to help.
4027000	4030000	They will earn points and get entered into competitions
4030000	4032000	for a chance to win prizes.
4032000	4036000	So, apparently, too, just to put salt in the wound, I guess,
4036000	4039000	Microsoft asked the staff,
4039000	4041000	the staff that they ended up letting go,
4041000	4045000	to train Xbox Ambassadors and increase their input,
4045000	4047000	which is always a little bit of a red flag.
4047000	4049000	I mean, sometimes, you know, cross training is inevitable
4049000	4051000	no matter what industry you do.
4051000	4053000	But sometimes if it's like, wow,
4053000	4055000	I'm showing every function of my job to somebody else,
4055000	4058000	that may not always be the best sign.
4058000	4060000	Every case is different, I suppose,
4060000	4062000	but certainly that was probably the first sign
4062000	4064000	that something's up there.
4064000	4066000	Anyway, Microsoft, of course, is not specifically responding
4066000	4068000	on anything about the layoffs specifically,
4068000	4071000	but in an interview that they did with the big gaming website,
4071000	4073000	they said that we continue to have a number
4073000	4075000	of highly trained customer support agents
4075000	4078000	plus community ambassadors available to help customers
4078000	4080000	with their needs.
4080000	4083000	It's never good to skimp on your communication anywhere,
4083000	4086000	but I feel like Twitter, being such a first line,
4086000	4091000	is an especially bad place to get rid of
4091000	4096000	full-time, compensated, you know, talented individuals
4096000	4100000	and open it up to any aspect of community management.
4100000	4104000	Maybe. I don't know.
4104000	4107000	That particular role strikes me as a little...
4107000	4109000	That particular medium for the role strikes me
4109000	4111000	as a little strange.
4111000	4113000	Bobby and Chad confirming they had an active Twitter account,
4113000	4116000	they've stopped responding pretty much altogether,
4116000	4118000	so it sounds like pretty much anybody who was using that Twitter
4118000	4120000	was probably part of this.
4120000	4122000	So, you know, that's unfortunate for those guys.
4122000	4125000	What? Who messes with tweets to one account doesn't scale?
4125000	4127000	I'm surprised.
4127000	4129000	But...
4129000	4131000	Well, I mean, I kind of thought Microsoft
4131000	4133000	would have learned this lesson before
4133000	4136000	about what happens when you dial back on community engagement.
4136000	4140000	You get something like the Xbox One unveiling.
4140000	4142000	Now, granted, I realize this is a different scenario
4142000	4145000	because we're talking a little more like support and help,
4145000	4148000	but still, like, I'm a little surprised to hear
4148000	4150000	that Microsoft wants to cut corners
4150000	4153000	because I feel like that has not benefited them in the past.
4153000	4154000	But no one plays games anymore.
4154000	4156000	Everyone's watching TV and sports and sports
4156000	4158000	and TV and TV TV.
4158000	4159000	Well, I mean, but if they can't...
4159000	4160000	Here's the thing, though.
4160000	4163000	If people can't figure out how to fix their Xboxes
4163000	4164000	and they're complaining about it on Twitter
4164000	4166000	and nobody is, like, actively helping them,
4166000	4168000	then they're going to continue to complain to their friends
4168000	4169000	and the other people they follow on Twitter.
4169000	4171000	I mean, I just always felt like
4171000	4173000	when Microsoft is, like, actively seeking out
4173000	4176000	the people having problems with Xbox stuff
4176000	4177000	and they're replying to them,
4177000	4179000	they're trying to cut these issues off
4179000	4181000	before they grow and they escalate
4181000	4182000	and they turn into,
4182000	4184000	now I'm going to tell all my friends about
4184000	4186000	how shitty, you know, Microsoft is, you know?
4186000	4187000	I don't know.
4187000	4188000	At the end of the day,
4188000	4190000	will this have a gigantic impact on things?
4190000	4193000	I don't know, but, hmm.
4193000	4197000	So, anyhow, Bobby is also kind of saying, like,
4197000	4199000	they had several Twitter accounts,
4199000	4201000	like Xbox Support One and Two,
4201000	4203000	but basically they replaced those accounts
4203000	4204000	with ambassadors' personal accounts
4204000	4208000	that use the hashtag, hashtag XboxAmbassadors.
4208000	4209000	Wow.
4209000	4211000	Rageinator says, I'll help you right now.
4211000	4212000	Did you try turning your system off
4212000	4214000	and then not back on again?
4214000	4215000	Oh, that should just be,
4215000	4216000	there should be a Twitter robot.
4216000	4218000	How many flashing lights do you see?
4218000	4220000	Oh, my God, this would be a genius Twitter robot.
4220000	4221000	You ready?
4221000	4224000	Whenever somebody writes a complaint to Xbox Support,
4224000	4225000	it just automatically replies,
4225000	4227000	have you tried turning it off and then on again?
4227000	4229000	Hashtag XboxAmbassadors.
4229000	4231000	Hashtag XboxIp.
4231000	4233000	I think that's funny.
4233000	4234000	I think that's hilarious.
4234000	4238000	Hashtag the XboxCrowd, the XCrowd.
4238000	4239000	Let's see.
4239000	4241000	SS2100Matt says, they were pretty hush-hush
4241000	4244000	about that hacking problem you had back in the day, Rob.
4244000	4245000	That was before,
4245000	4247000	the hacking problem was before their Twitter.
4247000	4251000	The 990 gig thing that came up,
4251000	4254000	I think they did try to reach out to me on Twitter,
4254000	4256000	but they, like, couldn't help me.
4256000	4257000	They couldn't figure it out.
4257000	4258000	They, like, couldn't help me.
4258000	4260000	They couldn't figure out what the hell the problem was.
4260000	4261000	So it was weird.
4261000	4264000	Yeah, they didn't really want to, like, admit anything.
4264000	4266000	So it was kind of weird there.
4266000	4267000	Anyway.
4267000	4271000	So that's something that's happening.
4271000	4274000	So, you know, if you have strong feelings about that,
4274000	4276000	I suppose you could tweet Microsoft,
4276000	4278000	but I'm not sure it's going to change anything.
4278000	4284000	So just hopefully this doesn't lead to a series of more bad decisions.
4284000	4289000	If you tweet at a support account and nobody's there to read it,
4289000	4291000	did you really say anything at all?
4291000	4293000	Maybe I'll send that tweet right now to Xbox support.
4293000	4298000	I'm surprised that we're not having Cortana field these tech questions.
4298000	4299000	Make sure to hashtag your question.
4299000	4300000	That could be the robot.
4300000	4301000	That could be the robot.
4301000	4305000	But instead of, like, Cortana, it's like,
4305000	4310000	God, what is that web series with Donard Duck and,
4310000	4313000	you know what I'm talking about, Darcy.
4313000	4315000	The Rupaz drag rez.
4315000	4319000	Like, all the, like, gooby is based off, like, a Disney thing with gooby
4319000	4321000	and Donard Duck and stuff.
4321000	4322000	Oh, yeah.
4322000	4323000	Right, okay.
4323000	4324000	Somebody knows what I'm talking about.
4324000	4325000	Or Miss Effect.
4325000	4326000	Yeah, yes.
4326000	4327000	Like, that whole thing, yes.
4327000	4331000	There should be, like, a core Cortana or something.
4331000	4332000	Core Ann.
4332000	4333000	Core Ann.
4333000	4334000	Perfect.
4334000	4336000	Core Ann is the boss.
4336000	4338000	Is the boss that just replies to everybody going,
4338000	4340000	have you tried turning it off and then on again?
4340000	4341000	Yeah.
4341000	4345000	Core Ann.
4345000	4349000	And the Avatar is just a picture of Courtney Cox from Friends,
4349000	4353000	but, like, dyed blue.
4353000	4356000	We live in the modern age of the internet where that is something
4356000	4357000	that could be possible.
4357000	4358000	That's it.
4358000	4359000	Gooby Dolan.
4359000	4360000	Dolan, Dolan, that was it.
4360000	4361000	Thank you, Act F.
4361000	4362000	You win.
4362000	4363000	You know what I'm talking about.
4363000	4365000	All right.
4365000	4367000	Sorry, I'm in love with this idea.
4367000	4370000	Like, does anyone know how to program a Twitter bot?
4370000	4373000	Like, Bobby, I know there's so much work to be done at Vodka Network,
4373000	4377000	but do you know how to make a Twitter bot?
4377000	4379000	Jason, do you know how to make a Twitter bot?
4379000	4381000	I could look something up.
4381000	4383000	This is Gaming Adjacent, so.
4383000	4385000	We need Core Ann to happen.
4385000	4387000	Gaming Adjacent.
4387000	4388000	All right.
4388000	4390000	Meanwhile, let's get into some other stories.
4390000	4391000	Dark Saga.
4391000	4396000	Oh, this one made me angry and then made my heart warm.
4396000	4399000	So, there is a streamer who goes by Ann Munition.
4399000	4408000	She plays some of the war games like, was it Rainbow Six
4408000	4412000	and a few of the other ones like that, PUBG, God of War, Overwatch.
4412000	4417000	She was playing Rainbow Six offline with a bunch of guys,
4417000	4421000	and then they didn't know who she was, and she was a pretty big streamer.
4421000	4424000	So, when they asked if she was a woman, she said yes.
4424000	4427000	And the moment she confirmed it,
4427000	4430000	they laid into her with some really hateful shit,
4430000	4434000	like calling her, you know, you try to use gamer girl like it's an insult,
4434000	4436000	and then called her, and this is a quote
4436000	4438000	because I would never use this term, a tranny bitch.
4438000	4440000	And then said, we're not treating you like this,
4440000	4443000	we're not being like this because we don't like women,
4443000	4445000	we're being like this because you're shit.
4445000	4449000	And the same person telling her, I hope you die.
4449000	4454000	And all she did the whole stream was just play the game,
4454000	4456000	play square, called the shots when they need it,
4456000	4459000	when she would do well, they said she was kill stealing,
4459000	4462000	and then when she died, they would just fuss at her for it.
4462000	4466000	So she saved the whole thing and uploaded it.
4466000	4472000	Uploaded, made it public, called them all the fuck out.
4472000	4475000	And one of the players went back and said,
4475000	4477000	I'm extremely sorry for the way you feel.
4477000	4481000	Which is number one, the bullshit, I'm sorry you feel that way.
4482000	4486000	No, it should have been, I'm sorry for being human garbage.
4489000	4491000	And he said, you know the words I use,
4491000	4493000	we're meaningless and have no substance.
4493000	4497000	And her response was, I appreciate that you wanted to apologize,
4497000	4500000	but man, you went hard just because you heard a woman's voice.
4500000	4503000	You called me a fucking tranny bitch and told me to kill myself over nothing.
4503000	4506000	All I did was exist.
4506000	4508000	And she's like, and I'm going to read this quote here,
4508000	4510000	I don't necessarily want to crucify people.
4510000	4514000	When I feel there's a potential for them to walk away from the subject thinking,
4514000	4515000	wow, I messed up.
4515000	4519000	I did something really awful and it came back to bite me, I won't do it again.
4519000	4525000	But, and she's basically like, yeah, there's consequences for this.
4525000	4529000	Which actually, I am super inspired by this,
4529000	4534000	to the point that I want to go out and play these games,
4534000	4537000	and catch people in the act, and go public with their names.
4538000	4544000	I just, this kind of begs the question, like why, I don't know what platform she's,
4544000	4548000	I mean if she's playing these on PC, then unfortunately the downside of PC
4548000	4550000	is a little bit more of a no man's land.
4550000	4552000	There's no moderation is my point.
4552000	4554000	I'm not saying it makes it right, I'm absolutely not saying that,
4554000	4556000	I'm just saying it's harder to moderate.
4556000	4559000	But if she's playing these games on Xbox Live, or PlayStation Network,
4559000	4563000	or Nintendo, you know, which these games aren't.
4563000	4565000	Rainbow Six on Nintendo, please.
4565000	4566000	They can't do that.
4566000	4568000	No, she's playing on PC it looks like.
4568000	4571000	But my point is, Nintendo would have the same responsibility no matter what.
4571000	4574000	Okay, then sadly, you know, because my question...
4574000	4577000	But those games themselves, their rooms should be moderated.
4577000	4579000	That's true, the game makers should be doing something,
4579000	4582000	because somebody is kind of hosting those servers.
4582000	4585000	My, I guess my question at the end of the day is like,
4585000	4589000	why aren't these fuckers getting banned, or dealt with, you know,
4589000	4593000	because like, look, I've had my share of completely unpleasant matches in Overwatch,
4593000	4595000	and I just play Quick Play for fuck's sake.
4595000	4599000	And I've seen people be really fucking mean in Overwatch.
4599000	4604000	And it's like, and it is PC, so Blizzard thankfully has, you know,
4604000	4607000	they've committed to trying to do some better stuff.
4607000	4611000	But they're saying it's taking away from the development of future stuff,
4611000	4614000	like they're having to deviate, I know that's kind of where my head is at.
4614000	4615000	Hire more people.
4615000	4616000	Yeah, right.
4616000	4617000	Be less shitty.
4617000	4619000	Don't outsource to Xbox ambassadors.
4619000	4623000	Oh no, we'll get less, we'll get less, you know, Overwatch skins.
4623000	4627000	The whole thing, to go back to the point, is,
4627000	4629000	and she also goes on record saying,
4629000	4632000	I'm sick of sweeping this behavior under the rug and pretending it's all fine and dandy.
4632000	4636000	It's easy to sweep things under the rug, it's harder to ask people to be better.
4636000	4640000	Especially when so many people are just resigned to accept the fact that
4640000	4643000	online gaming and toxicity goes hand in hand.
4643000	4647000	To go back to what you were saying about playing on PC.
4648000	4650000	It shouldn't go hand in hand.
4650000	4654000	And honestly enough, I want to hold these people accountable.
4654000	4656000	I want to fucking hold them responsible.
4656000	4658000	I want people to know that these people are garbage.
4658000	4661000	And if you see these tags, ostracize them.
4661000	4663000	Let me ask this tough question though,
4663000	4670000	as much like I get that from an immediate, I feel like some justice has been done in this scenario,
4670000	4673000	but at the end of the day, what does that really change for those people?
4673000	4677000	These people need to lose their privilege of being able to play the game online.
4677000	4679000	And unfortunately, you can't do that.
4679000	4682000	At the very least, just like we had that one person go back and say,
4682000	4684000	I'm sorry that I was that way.
4684000	4687000	Well, he clearly got some shit over it.
4687000	4689000	Or he probably wouldn't have apologized.
4689000	4692000	People like that don't apologize until they're fucking caught.
4692000	4698000	And when they're caught, like all these, you know, asshole men who are being accused of harassment,
4698000	4701000	and they're like, oh, I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah.
4701000	4703000	Yeah, you got caught, bitch.
4703000	4707000	More of them need to get caught and made a public example of.
4707000	4709000	I just don't understand why, like I get it.
4709000	4711000	You don't understand because it doesn't happen to you.
4711000	4713000	Okay, let's not do this.
4713000	4714000	Let's not.
4714000	4716000	You didn't let him finish his thought, to be fair.
4716000	4718000	Yeah, well, I get interrupted all the time.
4718000	4719000	All right, finish your thought, Logie.
4719000	4722000	No, what I understand is like, I get it, there's dicks out there online.
4722000	4726000	I mean, but there's also functions to mute them as well.
4726000	4729000	And I get it, yeah, maybe one gender gets it more than the other,
4729000	4734000	but you can also just mute them and block them and then that's the end of that.
4734000	4739000	You shouldn't have to, especially when you are playing a cooperative game
4739000	4741000	and you need to fucking hear what the other people are doing,
4741000	4743000	or else it's not a very cooperative game.
4743000	4745000	Yeah, I got to agree with that.
4745000	4748000	In a co-op sense, like when you're muting somebody, it's harming the game
4748000	4750000	because maybe the other team isn't having garbage.
4750000	4751000	Here's my thing.
4751000	4754000	Here's what I honestly think needs to happen is what the decent individuals,
4754000	4758000	and I think, you know, the men in this room would consider themselves decent individuals.
4758000	4759000	Yes, they're all decent.
4759000	4763000	I think many of the men listening are very decent individuals and so forth.
4763000	4768000	So here's my thing is that the other thing that kind of blows my mind in this scenario
4768000	4772000	that happened with this gal that was playing online is that when these comments were made,
4772000	4775000	nobody said anything there and then.
4775000	4778000	And I'm not saying she has to always be the one to do it.
4778000	4784000	Why didn't any of the other bros say, dude, not cool, it's 2018, grow the fuck up.
4784000	4786000	Because they are equally garbage.
4787000	4789000	Or chicken shit, you know.
4789000	4793000	And that's my thing is that I think it's up to the other people.
4793000	4797000	It's just like, you know, when we talk about some of these greater complications in society,
4797000	4805000	you know, so forth, usually it takes that person in the position of privilege, so to speak, to call out.
4805000	4810000	Because the unfortunate thing is it doesn't always happen when the oppressed is calling out.
4810000	4815000	It takes the person from the position of privilege to say, hey, wait a minute, this shit needs to stop.
4815000	4821000	In order for change to like for people to kind of, you know, the oppressor to stop and think about what they're doing.
4821000	4822000	Does that make sense?
4822000	4828000	But anyone who is so weak willed as to go along with it is part of the problem.
4828000	4835000	They are equally, they are complicit in this behavior, even if they sat there and quietly said nothing.
4835000	4840000	Now, she was taking the high road because she was the one being targeted.
4840000	4845000	She kept, and I think it was because, you know, she was recording this too publicly out them.
4845000	4849000	She had to be the one to play it straight.
4849000	4853000	And kudos to her for calling it out, for making it public.
4853000	4857000	Because we need more people to stand up and make it public and hold these people accountable.
4857000	4861000	I have to admit, though, you know, I'm looking at Bobby in our chat room.
4861000	4863000	I'm quoting him a lot tonight, but he's saying some good stuff.
4863000	4868000	And honestly, I have to be honest, I'm in a similar place to where Bobby's at because something that Bobby says,
4868000	4870000	that's why I never play online.
4870000	4874000	I have better things to do in my time rather than be in a place with people being assholes.
4874000	4876000	My time is more valuable than that.
4876000	4878000	I have to kind of agree.
4878000	4881000	That's why I don't play a lot of these games online.
4881000	4887000	But also taking yourself out of that situation doesn't help alleviate it either.
4887000	4892000	It contributes again to the problem because they're pushing out the people who are talking against them
4892000	4895000	who aren't willing to take a stand.
4895000	4899000	Yeah, but I sort of feel like I don't want to jump in this garbage pool in the first place.
4899000	4903000	This is part of the reason why I don't like to go on Xbox Live with non-friends.
4903000	4907000	I kind of feel like, you know, Microsoft kind of needs to moderate this.
4907000	4912000	The people that are interested, maybe if that gets better, maybe I'll consider going in in the future.
4912000	4915000	But otherwise, it's a waste of my time.
4915000	4918000	Look at it in terms of history.
4918000	4923000	Let's say that it's in the 60s during the protests against Vietnam.
4923000	4925000	A lot of people said, I don't want to be involved in this.
4925000	4927000	Okay, hold up though. Hold up though.
4927000	4929000	I know where you're going with this thought.
4929000	4932000	So I'm just going to say, does this mean you're going to start playing Rainbow Six online?
4932000	4934000	I might.
4934000	4937000	I will be very interested to see if you stick with that.
4937000	4939000	I have to put my money where my mouth is.
4939000	4944000	I mean, I have to practice a little bit and actually be good enough to play online.
4944000	4947000	But I mean, if that's what it comes to, I would do it.
4947000	4951000	You know, that's why I'm an activist and other things that are important to me.
4951000	4953000	You can't just...
4953000	4955000	It's...
4955000	4957000	Real heart, what is it?
4957000	4960000	The true evil is when good men do nothing.
4960000	4963000	All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.
4963000	4965000	That's the quote.
4965000	4967000	So if you do nothing, it's going to persist.
4967000	4971000	If you want things to change, if you don't like how something is,
4971000	4974000	you have to get in the middle of it and you have to fucking make it change.
4974000	4977000	Nothing changes until you make it change.
4977000	4980000	Even if you die without seeing the change,
4980000	4983000	you got in there and made the fight, and that means that the next generation to pick it up
4983000	4985000	is going to take up where you left off.
4985000	4987000	That's why, I mean, if we want to look...
4987000	4990000	I know it's just a game, you know, playing games online,
4990000	4992000	but look at it in the higher context.
4992000	4996000	You know, if you're willing to take a step out for this,
4996000	4998000	you know, an easy thing,
4998000	5001000	what's to say that there won't be a bigger, you know,
5001000	5003000	that when it comes time for a bigger stand,
5003000	5005000	that the same behavior might not happen
5005000	5008000	because it's easier to just take yourself out of the equation.
5008000	5011000	We have some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5011000	5014000	Shehulk says, I've met a lot of cool people online playing games,
5014000	5016000	but every once in a while a person cheats or is a loser.
5016000	5018000	I block them forever.
5018000	5020000	ActDeft in chat says, and people complain.
5020000	5022000	Splatoon 2 not having proper voice chat.
5022000	5025000	To be fair, ActDeft, like, I think when that topic has come up,
5025000	5028000	I think there is certainly some complaining in that regard,
5028000	5030000	but then there's also that whole, like,
5030000	5032000	well, if it was there, would I use it anyway?
5032000	5033000	I don't know.
5033000	5036000	And then Bonds006 says, I want to play Dark Sakura.
5037000	5039000	Team OLR on RB6.
5039000	5041000	So, hey, you might have some good dudes.
5041000	5043000	That means I have to actually buy the game.
5043000	5045000	Or it doesn't necessarily have to be that game.
5045000	5047000	Believe me, there's lots of toxic games out there.
5047000	5049000	There's other games that I can play that I'd be good at.
5049000	5051000	Don't you already own Overwatch?
5051000	5053000	It makes me motion sick.
5053000	5055000	Fortnite. It's third person.
5055000	5057000	I could do Fortnite.
5057000	5059000	That might be a great place to start.
5059000	5061000	But Fortnite's a good candidate too.
5061000	5063000	I'll do Fortnite. No problem.
5063000	5065000	I bet there's a lot of people that would love to play Fortnite with you.
5065000	5067000	I just, you know...
5067000	5069000	It's...
5069000	5071000	Oh, God. I'm just...
5071000	5073000	It's something that's very... Activism itself...
5073000	5075000	I get it, girl. Let it out.
5075000	5077000	...is very near and dear to my heart. Sure.
5077000	5080000	And when I see people not willing to fix something,
5080000	5082000	but they're willing to complain about it,
5082000	5084000	you can't complain about shit
5084000	5086000	if you're not going to fucking do something about it.
5086000	5088000	It's like voting.
5088000	5090000	If you don't vote, you have no right to complain.
5090000	5092000	I just, I think in this particular case,
5092000	5094000	it's more complicated than that, because from my perspective,
5094000	5096000	Jamie, you're saying you need to play this game
5096000	5098000	that you have no interest in playing.
5098000	5100000	It's not the no interest in playing thing.
5100000	5103000	It's people play the games,
5103000	5105000	but they don't put themselves in that environment.
5105000	5107000	And I can understand keeping yourself out of something
5107000	5109000	if you just don't enjoy it.
5109000	5111000	But the fact of the matter is that
5111000	5113000	when you know that there's a group out there
5113000	5116000	who wants to enjoy the game online in that capacity,
5116000	5119000	and you could be in a position to help them enjoy that game,
5119000	5121000	why aren't you helping?
5121000	5123000	I would say, though, in some cases,
5123000	5125000	especially MMOs are the thing that's near and dear to me,
5125000	5128000	and I have been the type to, you know,
5128000	5132000	I kind of give it back to them in MMOs,
5132000	5135000	because my character's a sassy little lala
5135000	5137000	that when somebody mouths off, I mouth her off back to them.
5137000	5139000	I do it in WoW.
5139000	5141000	When I'm playing WoW and I have a piece of shit
5141000	5143000	in one of my parties, I vote kick them.
5143000	5145000	So there are places.
5145000	5147000	And I post screenshots.
5147000	5149000	But I think just when it comes to stuff like this Rainbow Six
5149000	5151000	and all this stuff, it's like, that's just a pool
5151000	5153000	I am not interested in jumping in.
5153000	5156000	And I would just hope that maybe some of the dudes in there,
5156000	5158000	because there probably are a lot of decent dudes
5158000	5160000	that are playing Rainbow Six,
5160000	5162000	can kind of be the ones to start that change.
5162000	5164000	Because there are so many games out there,
5164000	5166000	and the industry is so huge,
5166000	5168000	that change is going to have to come from multiple angles anyway.
5168000	5170000	I totally am planning on going ahead
5170000	5172000	and hopping in on games that I like.
5172000	5174000	And I'm going to stream them,
5174000	5176000	and I'm not going to tell them I'm streaming them.
5176000	5178000	Because why do they have to know if I'm streaming it?
5178000	5180000	I'll wait until the game's done, and they'll say,
5180000	5184000	watch the stream of your behavior at this.
5184000	5188000	Because I'm ready to start calling these fuckers out.
5188000	5190000	Bonds006 says,
5190000	5193000	we need to have an official OLR online game squad team group, etc.
5193000	5195000	Let's make it happen.
5195000	5197000	Or at least at the level of VOG, too.
5197000	5199000	We've been talking about that for a while.
5199000	5201000	We need the OLR me, or the VOG thing.
5201000	5203000	But the other thing, too, is that
5203000	5206000	it's something I've already been doing on social media,
5206000	5208000	like Facebook.
5208000	5211000	If I've gotten a message from someone being scum,
5211000	5213000	and thankfully I haven't gotten any yet,
5213000	5215000	because some of these people have learned,
5215000	5217000	I've posted it, I've gone and found their parents
5217000	5220000	and sent them links to how their children are behaving,
5220000	5222000	I got apologies real quick.
5222000	5224000	Because I don't care if you're going to be shit.
5224000	5227000	I'm going to call you on being shit. Sorry.
5227000	5230000	I am not going to sit here quietly and let people...
5230000	5233000	And some people on Facebook do need a spanking.
5233000	5235000	But I'm not going to sit here quietly
5235000	5237000	and let myself be an oppressed party.
5237000	5239000	Fuck you. I'm going to stand up for myself.
5239000	5242000	Bonn 2006 in chat says we can each do our bit,
5242000	5244000	as Jamie is saying.
5244000	5245000	Yes.
5245000	5247000	Alright. Anyway. Let's move on.
5247000	5249000	We've got lots more gaming news.
5249000	5251000	We're an hour and a half into part A.
5251000	5253000	Let's try to get the rest of this gaming news.
5253000	5255000	But it's good stuff tonight. Loki, what do you have for us?
5255000	5257000	So this is kind of cool. I watched this video,
5257000	5260000	and it's basically this guy who...
5260000	5263000	He actually hacked...
5263000	5265000	Most people, when they emulate stuff,
5265000	5268000	you're thinking like you're emulating the hardware
5268000	5272000	and running the ROMs like NES emulator.
5272000	5274000	We're taking emulating hardware,
5274000	5276000	we dump the ROMs and we run it
5276000	5279000	so that it runs on fake hardware, basically.
5279000	5283000	Well, this guy, programmed by the name of Tom Murphy,
5283000	5286000	otherwise he's known online as Tom7,
5286000	5288000	he worked on a slightly different route.
5288000	5293000	Instead of emulating the NES, he emulated the cartridges.
5294000	5298000	So basically what he did is he threw in a Raspberry Pi 3 Mini
5298000	5300000	inside of a cartridge,
5300000	5303000	and he got it to interact with the cartridge slot
5303000	5306000	in a way that he was able to output to the NES.
5306000	5310000	And so he outputted this presentation that he made,
5310000	5315000	and he even outputted Super Mario World
5315000	5318000	in an SNES emulator running on an NES.
5319000	5321000	Which is pretty awesome.
5321000	5324000	So, really neat, but...
5324000	5327000	I think he has the code online to actually try that as well.
5327000	5330000	But, really cool.
5332000	5336000	Alright, so how can I do that at my house?
5336000	5339000	I guess you have to have a Raspberry Pi 3 and be very smart.
5340000	5343000	Because you have to completely wire a cartridge or something like that, right?
5343000	5348000	Yeah, basically he wired the output from the Raspberry Pi 3
5348000	5351000	to the cartridge slots to work...
5351000	5355000	It went very in-depth in the video, so definitely check it out online.
5355000	5358000	His YouTube account...
5358000	5360000	Let's see here...
5360000	5363000	Looks like it's like Ampersand or it's...
5363000	5367000	Yeah, Tom7 is what he's...
5367000	5370000	Oh, Suckerpinch is his name on YouTube.
5370000	5372000	So he's looking for Suckerpinch.
5372000	5374000	I think it is kind of a neat concept, though.
5374000	5377000	So, DarkTusuya says, I watched the whole video. It was amazing.
5377000	5382000	Yeah, so he has a making of the reverse NES emulation process.
5382000	5387000	And it was interesting because he basically talked about how the cartridges worked and everything.
5387000	5391000	And how he had to make his own security chip and everything.
5391000	5393000	It was just really interesting.
5393000	5396000	And just being that you can use a Raspberry Pi to do that.
5396000	5398000	Pretty awesome.
5398000	5401000	Alright, well, let's get into talk about some E3 leaks
5401000	5404000	and some things that are getting announced a little bit in advance of E3.
5404000	5410000	So, Assassin's Creed Odyssey has apparently been confirmed thanks to a keyring.
5410000	5413000	That's right, there was a keyring that showed up.
5413000	5416000	I don't know if it was on a shelf or what the deal was.
5416000	5419000	But apparently the merchandise was posted by a French site.
5419000	5421000	A little collectible that showed Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
5421000	5425000	The little logo and a little Greek Spartan helmet on a keychain.
5425000	5430000	So, this led the official Assassin's Creed account to then tweet a couple days ago.
5430000	5434000	See you at E3 with an official little quick teaser there.
5434000	5438000	So, certainly this was kind of a spoiled announcement, I think.
5438000	5442000	But at the same time, is it a shock that there's a new Assassin's Creed game coming?
5442000	5444000	No, they said that they were doing one this year, I think.
5444000	5446000	So, that's not a shock.
5446000	5448000	Maybe the Greek thing is a little bit of a surprise.
5448000	5454000	But, hey, since God of War went to the Nordic gods this time, if I'm not mistaken.
5454000	5456000	Well, they've been mixing it up.
5456000	5458000	I mean, they did the whole pirate thing for a while.
5458000	5462000	They did Ancient Egypt last time, so now Greece.
5462000	5464000	Sure, they're just mixing it up.
5464000	5467000	I was still waiting for Feudal Japan.
5467000	5473000	I know they had the spin-off Assassin's Creed that was like that, but that was more of a 2D game.
5473000	5477000	I'd be more interested in the actual Feudal Japan one.
5477000	5486000	Having not played the Assassin's Creed series, it makes me feel very strange.
5486000	5491000	The sheer number of Assassin's Creed games I have in my library on my Xbox One.
5491000	5496000	Because, what, three of them have been games with gold?
5496000	5499000	Yeah, I think one of them is right now.
5499000	5503000	Yeah, it was. Second half of May.
5503000	5505000	It was a game series I could just never get into.
5505000	5508000	Like, I purchased the first Assassin's Creed and I just like...
5509000	5513000	I haven't never been into Assassin's Creed.
5513000	5517000	I played two hours of the first one and it just didn't grab me.
5517000	5520000	And then two, three, four, Black Flag, China.
5520000	5524000	But some people love them. It's just different.
5524000	5527000	It might be just so many, so fast.
5527000	5530000	And it could be just that style of gameplay, because Dishonored is the same thing for me.
5530000	5532000	I can't get into Dishonored either, and I tried with that.
5532000	5536000	It's a similar type of gameplay, that stealth action type stuff.
5536000	5540000	That's me in Monster Hunter. I feel like Monster Hunter is a game I should really be into and love.
5540000	5544000	And I have so many friends that are super into it, but I've tried it and I'm not feeling this the same way.
5544000	5546000	I don't know what it is. I'm just not feeling it.
5546000	5548000	But that's different.
5548000	5550000	Different games for different people.
5550000	5552000	Different jokes for different folks.
5552000	5554000	I suppose, if you want to put it that way.
5554000	5556000	Anyway, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in the news?
5556000	5558000	Oh, I have some stuff.
5558000	5562000	You know, last week we talked about that game, Active Shooter,
5562000	5568000	where you play as either the police responding to an active shooter or the shooter itself, going into a school.
5568000	5572000	Well, the online petition has been successful.
5572000	5580000	And Valve has taken the game off of the Steam store.
5580000	5586000	Also because the developer has a history of bad behavior.
5586000	5598000	But it also, of course, gained some pretty big attention after two of the families that had students killed in the February attack in Parkland
5598000	5604000	said it was despicable and horrific and really called them out for it.
5604000	5620000	Steam got some really bad PR over this by folks who had been involved in either school superintendents or people involved in the education system or local law enforcement.
5620000	5626000	Really started calling them out, so Steam jumped in and said, nope, it's gone.
5626000	5632000	So they emailed the media and said that it was taken down ahead of the June 6th release.
5632000	5648000	And the developer, who is calling himself Ata Berdyev, has a history of being a troll, abusing customers and publishing copyrighted material and doing user review manipulation.
5648000	5654000	So they're not going to do business with people who act that way toward their customers.
5654000	5661000	He's an asset flipper, so he's been known to do a lot of really shitty games that have been on Steam.
5661000	5670000	The one that got him in trouble last time was he put up a Pickled Rick game, which of course rips off Rick and Morty.
5670000	5677000	But he's done several other asset flip games on there and then basically manipulated systems to try to get him.
5677000	5679000	He kept coming back on there.
5679000	5683000	It wasn't him this time publishing it, but it was him and his friend, I guess, publishing it.
5683000	5689000	And they just found out because he used the same bank account as his other companies that he has the same dude.
5689000	5697000	Well, someone who said his name was Arthur Belkin says that Ata was his friend and that the games were his.
5697000	5703000	So he's waiting for Steam to reply, but basically it needs to be taken down anyway.
5703000	5705000	Nah, he's not coming back.
5705000	5707000	Well, never say never.
5708000	5712000	Next time he'll come back wearing glasses and a suit and he'll just look different.
5712000	5716000	But also this guy said that everything was bad sarcasm.
5716000	5721000	Sorry, but English is my third language. No.
5721000	5725000	Yeah, that's not really an excuse for the game though.
5725000	5728000	No, you're... bye bitch.
5728000	5730000	Yeah, some of those things say it all in every language.
5730000	5732000	Hold the garbage accountable.
5732000	5735000	Alright, moving on. Loki.
5735000	5742000	Yes, so there was another announcement that was teased with a very long Twitch stream of a screen and a bobblehead.
5742000	5745000	But finally Fallout 76 was announced.
5745000	5751000	And it's not clear exactly what the game's going to be about aside from Vault 76.
5751000	5757000	But that there's been some artwork that they're painting down in LA.
5757000	5762000	Because traditionally when E3 rolls around they tend to paint artwork on that one...
5762000	5765000	I don't know if it's like a hotel building or something like that that's right there.
5765000	5770000	Oh, it's everything in that area. Like, you know, the banners go up on the convention center itself.
5770000	5773000	The nearby hotels, parking lots, all the buses.
5773000	5776000	The picture that they have for it though has multiple Vault boys on there.
5776000	5782000	So the thought is that it's a co-op or online type of game but they haven't really said what it was yet.
5782000	5786000	Doesn't mean that they're stopping from taking pre-orders of course.
5786000	5789000	Before we even know what the hell the game's about.
5789000	5791000	Yeah, it's coming.
5791000	5796000	And then of course the game is under development by Bethesda Game Studios.
5796000	5802000	And then also a company, Battlecry Studios, is working on it as well.
5803000	5808000	So it'll be interesting to see. And I guess we're going to find out about it in June 10th.
5808000	5809000	For sure.
5809000	5811000	We can hardly wait.
5812000	5815000	Yeah, I'm excited for E3 too.
5816000	5818000	Especially because it seems like there's all these big games.
5818000	5820000	And obviously Fallout is another one of those things.
5820000	5824000	I personally don't super get into Fallout because I own Fallout 3.
5824000	5826000	And I just never really like super...
5826000	5827000	You have Fallout 4.
5827000	5829000	Oh, no idea. I have Fallout 4. I get them all confused.
5829000	5831000	I have Fallout 3 and I have Fallout 4.
5831000	5834000	And I think I have another Fallout 2.
5834000	5839000	But anyway, I can't get into them the same way I get into Elder Scrolls.
5839000	5840000	You should. It's really good.
5840000	5841000	I know. I know. It's so weird.
5841000	5844000	Anyway, I'll be curious about this new one.
5844000	5847000	But I mean, just between this and Borderlands.
5847000	5850000	I'm going to be more into Borderlands than Fallout.
5850000	5852000	But it's been a long time.
5852000	5855000	I've been getting that itch to play Borderlands again.
5855000	5857000	Well, I think a lot of people are getting there too.
5857000	5858000	So, alright.
5858000	5861000	Well, maybe you've got the itch for a classic video game.
5861000	5866000	And get this, apparently Intellivision is going to be making a comeback.
5866000	5867000	Now, I know Intellivision...
5868000	5871000	They've done the Intellivision Lives and they have an Intellivision Flashback.
5871000	5873000	I actually own the Intellivision Flashback.
5873000	5875000	Like they have Atari Flashback and so forth.
5875000	5879000	But Intellivision is kind of going through another sort of shift, if you will.
5879000	5882000	And it's thanks to Tommy Tallarico.
5882000	5885000	Who we actually had on this show years ago in Video Games Live.
5885000	5889000	I'm Facebook buddies with him and he's been posting these cryptic hints.
5889000	5891000	And then finally he's like, here's the news.
5891000	5893000	Really? He didn't accept my friend request and I tried to add him.
5893000	5895000	Or he had hit his limit.
5895000	5896000	I think it is the time my friend requested him.
5897000	5900000	So, anyway. I'm not his friend. But you guys are. That's alright.
5900000	5901000	So, here's the deal.
5901000	5906000	Is that Tommy has apparently acquired the rights to Intellivision.
5906000	5910000	So, Intellivision Entertainment is going to be now the name of the company.
5910000	5912000	And Tallarico did a little interview about this.
5912000	5915000	Of course, he's not just the musician who did Video Games Live.
5915000	5917000	But he has done video game development as well before.
5917000	5920000	And of course he's done, you know, TV and some commentary due to that.
5920000	5924000	Of course, Intellivision Productions came from Keith Robinson.
5924000	5926000	Who unfortunately passed away in 2017.
5926000	5931000	Which, you know, I remember meeting Keith Robinson years ago at an E3.
5931000	5936000	Around the time, I think, Intellivision Lives was coming out on like the Xbox or something.
5936000	5937000	Or the Xbox 360.
5937000	5938000	The Xbox.
5938000	5940000	It was like the original Xbox, yeah.
5940000	5941000	I think.
5941000	5942000	So, yeah.
5942000	5943000	Well, no, no, no. That would have been like...
5943000	5944000	It may have been both.
5944000	5947000	Because the Xbox 360 was out because we were playing...
5947000	5950000	Yeah, I feel like it came out on 360 and like PS3.
5950000	5952000	I feel like it came out on...
5952000	5955000	So like there was that whole little collection there.
5955000	5956000	I think I...
5956000	5957000	Did they bring my 360?
5957000	5959000	I know I was playing...
5959000	5962000	Because that was the year that they did demos for like the E3 stuff.
5962000	5964000	So they had...
5964000	5968000	Lost Planet, I think, was one of the demos that you could play.
5968000	5971000	Before, you know, it was the same one that was on the show floor.
5971000	5974000	MXC says it was PS2 and Xbox that that came out on.
5974000	5976000	So I guess it was kind of a little bit of an older game.
5976000	5977000	But I feel like they were doing...
5977000	5979000	They were trying to do more stuff with later games.
5979000	5980000	But anyway.
5980000	5982000	So Intellivision Entertainment is out.
5982000	5987000	And so they are looking at doing a new Intellivision console.
5987000	5990000	But Tommy Tallarico kind of wants to take a different approach.
5990000	5993000	Doesn't want to necessarily do the same thing that like the Atari relaunch is doing,
5993000	5995000	which we'll talk about in the second half of the show tonight.
5995000	5997000	But Tommy said in an interview,
5997000	6000000	I see a huge gaping hole in the market now with families in the home.
6000000	6001000	We will be focused.
6001000	6004000	We will not try to compete with Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.
6004000	6006000	That would be insane.
6006000	6008000	And we would need one billion.
6008000	6011000	So they're going to come out with more details on October 1st.
6011000	6013000	There's also a new website you can get into as well.
6013000	6015000	So it sounds like...
6015000	6016000	And he says we are in the middle.
6016000	6018000	We won't run Netflix.
6018000	6019000	We're not trying to do 3D.
6019000	6023000	I was going to say I hate to be the one to say the terrible O word,
6023000	6026000	but it sounds a lot like the Ouya.
6026000	6027000	Well, you know what?
6027000	6031000	I think there was a lot in concept that maybe could have been better about the Ouya.
6031000	6035000	And so maybe a second go at it is what this needs or what have you.
6035000	6038000	And it'll have the classic Intellivision library to back it up.
6038000	6040000	But it sounds like from what Tommy is saying,
6040000	6043000	maybe they're going to try to put out a console that's like 50 bucks,
6043000	6046000	something that's a lot cheaper, maybe $99.
6046000	6048000	I don't know where they'll go with it.
6048000	6051000	They'll try to put something out that's really cheap
6051000	6055000	that just plays simple kid-friendly type of games,
6055000	6059000	which maybe isn't for you and me, but that's okay.
6059000	6063000	Maybe the goal is the parents can play the games they remember from Intellivision.
6063000	6069000	Well, I mean, if you think about it, imagine a homebrew version of the SNES classic.
6069000	6075000	You're running SNES type games on that type of hardware for that price point.
6075000	6078000	That doesn't sound terrible.
6078000	6084000	I mean, think about if Nintendo had the forethought to put networking in their SNES classic
6084000	6087000	and have a storefront where you can purchase more games.
6087000	6091000	It would have been cool if they had called it Satellaview.
6091000	6092000	Or that, yeah.
6092000	6094000	And harking back to that.
6094000	6098000	So anyway, I'm very curious to see what Tommy comes up with with this.
6098000	6100000	And hopefully we'll get...
6100000	6102000	It sounds like he's taking the right approach,
6102000	6105000	where he's like, look, we're not trying to compete with Nintendo in this stuff.
6105000	6107000	We're looking at a different market.
6107000	6109000	And so maybe this is a kid's bedroom console.
6109000	6110000	I don't know. We'll see.
6110000	6111000	So good luck.
6111000	6114000	SG100Matt in chat says, I think he'll do a good job with this console.
6114000	6118000	He's a smart businessman, and we'll get the right people to work on this.
6118000	6122000	Tigerclaw says, so expect those Intellivision consoles at your local dollar stores.
6122000	6125000	Well, I don't know.
6125000	6128000	I don't want to be that pessimistic about it,
6128000	6133000	but maybe some of the games will show up at dollar stores.
6133000	6136000	But honestly, is that such a bad thing?
6136000	6139000	I mean, if there's a way to make some of these games for pennies on the dollar,
6139000	6144000	then maybe dollar store sales is not actually the end of the world.
6144000	6146000	So anyway, we'll see.
6146000	6147000	We'll see.
6147000	6150000	Dartatia also says, video games live wouldn't suffer because of this new system.
6150000	6153000	He'll still be doing that, too, from the sound of it.
6153000	6157000	Well, you know, you can run multiple businesses.
6157000	6160000	Again, it's just like Gwyneth was pointed out in an earlier comment.
6160000	6162000	If you have the right people that are doing it,
6162000	6165000	you can still kind of do whatever you need to do.
6165000	6170000	Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane and take a look at a classic.
6170000	6172000	Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault
6172000	6175000	and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking this game out.
6175000	6178000	And maybe it's not as old as the Intellivision this week,
6178000	6180000	but it's still a classic.
6180000	6183000	I mean, when gaming's been around for years and years and years,
6183000	6184000	you've got a lot of shit to choose from.
6184000	6187000	But the rule around here is generally ten years old.
6187000	6191000	We blur the line a little bit, but ten years older or more.
6191000	6194000	So Dark Soccer, I know this is probably more like 20 years old.
6194000	6198000	What is the classic game of the week this week?
6198000	6200000	Marvel Super Heroes.
6200000	6204000	A fighting game developed by Capcom that was released in the arcade in 1995
6204000	6207000	and was a CPS2 arcade system game.
6207000	6210000	It got ported to...
6210000	6211000	Stupid ads.
6211000	6213000	I thought this thing had ad block.
6213000	6216000	You need the ad block for YouTube specifically.
6216000	6217000	I guess so.
6217000	6218000	Okay, here's the actual music.
6218000	6222000	Plus I picked one of my favorite characters to play in this, Shuma Gorath.
6222000	6226000	Or as Dan and I just kept calling him Shumachan.
6226000	6229000	But anyway, this is a cute little god of destruction and chaos.
6229000	6232000	Cute is an interesting word to describe it.
6232000	6234000	I love the poses though for Shuma Gorath in this game.
6234000	6239000	It also has one of my favorite ever attacks, chaos dimension.
6239000	6241000	But I'll get to that anyway.
6241000	6246000	So later on it was ported to the Sega Saturn and Playstation in 1997.
6246000	6248000	The Saturn version being the good one.
6248000	6254000	And then it also was included in the Marvel vs. Capcom Origins collection.
6254000	6258000	Where, of course, Marvel vs. Capcom was also released as well.
6258000	6264000	It came out digitally for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012.
6264000	6268000	It is loosely based on the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.
6268000	6271000	And it is the second Capcom fighting game.
6271000	6274000	The first one being X-Men Children of the Atom.
6274000	6277000	And then succeeded by the Marvel vs. Capcom series.
6277000	6282000	And one thing about this is that it was dedicated to Jack Kirby.
6282000	6286000	Because they based all the characters in the game off of Jack Kirby's original design.
6286000	6288000	The ones that he had the hand in.
6288000	6292000	I read his autobiography too.
6292000	6296000	And if you haven't read Jack Kirby's autobiography you really should.
6296000	6298000	But going further.
6298000	6301000	It is a fighting game.
6301000	6303000	Did I say fighting and lightning for some reason?
6303000	6305000	It's a fighting game.
6307000	6310000	It has superheroes and villains from the Marvel universe fighting against each other.
6310000	6313000	But they use attacks to knock down the opponent.
6313000	6316000	And of course possess more life than them at the end of it.
6316000	6319000	And they also have this different mechanic in it.
6319000	6321000	They have the infinity gems.
6321000	6324000	So the power, time, space, reality, soul and mind.
6324000	6327000	And you can knock them out of opponents during arcade mode.
6327000	6331000	Or fill certain criteria in versus mode.
6331000	6333000	Like just getting the first hit.
6333000	6335000	Or doing different things.
6335000	6338000	But when you use the gems in battle you get enhanced effects.
6338000	6341000	So for example if you use the time gem you get super speed.
6341000	6343000	Power of course.
6343000	6345000	Power.
6345000	6347000	Different ones can be life.
6347000	6349000	Things like that.
6349000	6353000	And also certain fighters will get extra benefits from using certain gems.
6353000	6359000	Like Spiderman using the power gem will let him create a doppelganger to do extra damage during his attacks.
6361000	6369000	And so basically the main antagonist of the game being an infinity gauntlet storyline would be Thanos.
6369000	6375000	And see I thought that with Infinity War having recently come out I thought that this game would be appropriate.
6375000	6386000	So the characters in the game are, and by the way some of them are only available in the Japanese version.
6386000	6390000	They were hidden characters in the Japanese version and they were unlockable in Origins.
6390000	6392000	And then of course there is boss characters.
6392000	6395000	So Thanos is the unlockable boss character.
6395000	6399000	And for a hidden character you actually have Anita.
6399000	6403000	As in Donovan's little wanderer.
6403000	6405000	You know the little girl who hangs out with him from Darkstalkers.
6405000	6408000	And Doctor Doom was also an unlockable boss.
6408000	6411000	Other than that you had Blackheart.
6411000	6417000	I don't know I really wasn't too into some of those characters in the 90's.
6418000	6427000	But I remember Blackheart was in, it was like Punisher, Wolverine, and somebody else doing a crossover for that.
6427000	6435000	But also Captain America is in it, Hulk is in it, Iron Man, Juggernaut, Magneto, Psylocke, Shuma Garak, Spiderman, and Wolverine.
6435000	6442000	Which I don't understand that if all of these characters are in it why the fuck was Doctor Strange not in it.
6442000	6446000	But go ahead and ask Marvel that.
6446000	6451000	So it did include four of the characters that were in X-Men Children of the Atom.
6451000	6455000	Who were considered to be the most popular so it was Wolverine, Juggernaut, Magneto, and Psylocke.
6455000	6459000	So yay Psylocke was one of my regulars in this game.
6459000	6469000	And then of course the home conversions were revealed at E3 1996 with Stan Lee there at the time.
6469000	6474000	It is one of the best fighting games I think I have ever played.
6475000	6482000	Great graphics, wonderful music, and then of course the Saturn version is of course practical perfection.
6482000	6489000	Because it does use the 4 meg RAM cartridge so that you get near arcade quality performance from it.
6489000	6497000	You're missing some frames of animation, but it really is about as great as the arcade version as you could get the day it came out.
6497000	6502000	Playstation 1 of course was lacking because it didn't have the memory to accommodate so many characters.
6502000	6506000	And of course the Sega Saturn much better for anything 2D.
6506000	6515000	And of course Saturn Magazine gave it a 95% for being a wonderful conversion.
6515000	6525000	And it was considered the 16th best Marvel video game by Geek Magazine in 2013 for quote it's chaotic yet insanely fun gameplay.
6525000	6531000	And it's considered one of the top 25 best 2D fighting games of all time.
6531000	6534000	Because the gem collecting mechanic still keeps the game fresh.
6537000	6540000	Now a little story about this game.
6540000	6550000	When I was a student at the University of South Alabama we had at this little, I mean the place has long gone since then.
6550000	6555000	But it was a deli that had been around since like the 70's called Solomon's.
6555000	6558000	And now it's like some barbecue joint.
6558000	6562000	But Solomon's had this bar but they also had an arcade next door to the bar.
6562000	6573000	And to the side also of the deli that had import arcade cabinets as well as ROM hacks.
6573000	6575000	Just you know bootlegs and what have you.
6575000	6579000	So I got to play this game pretty much the week after it came out.
6580000	6586000	And I remember saying you know I only need 3 hours of sleep.
6586000	6591000	And going to Solomon's at 4 in the fucking morning to play this.
6591000	6596000	And one of the still beta editions of Mortal Kombat 2.
6596000	6599000	And that was like my jam. Lots of pinball too.
6599000	6602000	But I have very fond memories of this game.
6602000	6606000	And of course my first character on this game was Psylocke.
6606000	6608000	My second was Shumacrath.
6608000	6613000	So memories. It's a great game. Did you guys play it too?
6613000	6618000	No I didn't really get into the Marvel side of the fighting games until Marvel vs Capcom.
6618000	6622000	When Storm was in it and you know I would always play Storm or Chun-Li usually like that.
6622000	6627000	So I think I kind of missed this one. I don't remember this being in any arcades near me. That was the problem.
6627000	6629000	And they had a missed opportunity with this game.
6629000	6634000	Because if they really wanted it to be more true to you know the Infinity Gauntlet stories.
6634000	6640000	You should have had Gamora. You should have had Nebula. You should have had you know Doctor Strange involved in it.
6640000	6643000	You know Dormammu maybe. You know.
6643000	6649000	We actually need a remake to this.
6649000	6652000	Well and I understand they tried to do that with the Marvel vs Capcom.
6652000	6655000	But that's bullshit. It means it's just a flat Marvel game.
6655000	6663000	The 2D fighting game that has the actual characters involved in the Infinity Gauntlet original storyline.
6663000	6668000	Because the Infinity Gauntlet storyline is fucked up because it had Nebula getting the gauntlet.
6668000	6671000	And if they do that in the movies I'm just going to laugh.
6671000	6673000	Well.
6673000	6675000	I haven't seen it yet.
6675000	6676000	I do the next movie.
6676000	6677000	Alright who knows. Anyway.
6677000	6680000	Yes Nebula had the gauntlet and made Thanos her bitch.
6680000	6681000	But.
6681000	6682000	She also had hair.
6682000	6684000	But that you are simply talking about the comics.
6684000	6685000	About the comics.
6685000	6686000	We don't know what they'll do in the movies.
6686000	6687000	About the comics.
6687000	6692000	I haven't even seen the movie because I'll be perfectly honest Infinity Gauntlet was really not one of my favorite storylines.
6692000	6693000	Uh huh.
6693000	6695000	You know Secret War was another one I didn't like.
6695000	6697000	It was from that same general era.
6697000	6700000	The stuff that I liked was like Extinction Agenda and Inferno.
6700000	6702000	All the X-Men separate storylines.
6702000	6705000	Alright.
6705000	6706000	Well there it is.
6706000	6707000	Classic game of the week.
6707000	6708000	Marvel Super Heroes.
6708000	6713000	The arcade game but also ported faithfully down to Sega Saturn.
6713000	6715000	And the Playstation.
6715000	6718000	More people had a Playstation.
6719000	6722000	It was where we just patted the Playstation people in the head and said oh you poor dear.
6722000	6723000	You get it too.
6723000	6726000	But remember Saturn sold very well in Japan.
6726000	6727000	That's true.
6727000	6733000	And if we had gotten in the US if they had marketed as well as they did in Japan and got us those 4 meg RAM carts.
6733000	6737000	They could have charged 100 bucks a game and people would have said here take all of my money.
6737000	6742000	Yeah well considering that Neo Geo was giving you arcade perfect stuff it was way more money.
6742000	6747000	Yeah you could have gotten close to perfection with the Saturn for a fraction of the cost.
6747000	6748000	Alright.
6748000	6751000	Well we're going to take a quick break but when we come back we have lots more news.
6751000	6752000	We have your emails.
6752000	6759000	We also have some stories on free games coming out if you are subscribers to Xbox Gold or Playstation Plus.
6759000	6761000	We'll talk about some backwards compatibility.
6761000	6765000	We'll talk about Atari's retro stuff and maybe some more Street Fighter stuff as well.
6765000	6767000	So we're going to take a quick break.
6767000	6768000	Don't go anywhere.
6768000	6771000	We've got more of Orange Lounge ready to come right after this.
6771000	6780000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.
6780000	6784000	Episode number 733 of our show already in progress.
6784000	6790000	For this June 3rd of 2018 kind of the eve of E3 and as we talked about in the first half of the show.
6790000	6795000	Quite a few things already kind of slipping through the cracks thanks to various leaks.
6795000	6796000	Be they intentional or not.
6796000	6799000	We talked about Pokemon Let's Go.
6799000	6802000	We talked about Fallout 76, Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
6802000	6807000	And we have more to talk about in this part of the show as well as your calls in a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6807000	6809000	All one word on Skype.
6809000	6813000	But before we get there we have some rapid fire news to get into.
6813000	6815000	Of course Jason also joining us in the studio.
6815000	6816000	I need to give him a shout out as well.
6816000	6817000	Hello. Hello.
6817000	6818000	Good to have you as always.
6818000	6819000	Hope you have a good time so far.
6819000	6820000	Alright.
6820000	6823000	Let's get into rapid fire news and we'll do Loki.
6823000	6824000	Yeah.
6824000	6825000	Let's talk a little bit about Mayman 11.
6825000	6828000	The game that I forgot was coming out but it is and it looks awesome.
6828000	6829000	Oh yeah.
6829000	6830000	I didn't forget it was coming.
6830000	6831000	It's just one of those.
6831000	6832000	I'm going to believe it when I see it.
6832000	6834000	And so this week they kind of showed it a little more.
6834000	6835000	Yeah.
6835000	6836000	They showed it a bit more of the game.
6836000	6841000	It looks very similar as far as gameplay wise to the original Mega Man.
6841000	6844000	And of course much nicer looking.
6844000	6853000	They showed off some of the new boss characters in there including Block Man and was it Fuse Man I think it was called?
6853000	6855000	Or Spark Man or something like that.
6855000	6856000	That's right.
6856000	6857000	Fuse Man.
6858000	6859000	It's Fuse Man.
6859000	6860000	Yeah.
6860000	6865000	But it looked pretty cool and they have like a time slow ability that you have now too as well.
6865000	6871000	But the game is going to be coming out October 2nd on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.
6871000	6873000	So you can check it out then.
6873000	6878000	If you're getting it on the Switch they even have a version that has an amiibo because everything has an amiibo.
6878000	6879000	Because of course it does.
6879000	6882000	But it's not the existing Mega Man amiibo.
6882000	6883000	It's a new amiibo.
6883000	6884000	It's a new Mega Man amiibo.
6884000	6886000	It's the amiibo edition.
6886000	6898000	So it's got the game, the new amiibo, a Dr. Wily logo adhesive patch and a set of stickers and the stage select microfiber cloth.
6898000	6901000	You can wipe your dirty Switch off.
6901000	6905000	Because your Switch has been very very dirty.
6905000	6906000	Very dirty.
6906000	6908000	It needs to be rubbed down by Dr. Wily.
6908000	6915000	And of course as everybody's favorite retailer it is a GameStop exclusive.
6915000	6917000	Because of course it is.
6917000	6919000	That makes me so angry.
6919000	6920000	Whatever.
6920000	6921000	Yeah.
6921000	6922000	Alright.
6922000	6925000	And then of course it's that time again.
6925000	6929000	It's that time to see what new games are going to be coming out for the month of June.
6929000	6934000	As part of the mandatory multiplayer passes that you have to pay for.
6934000	6936000	But you can forget stuff.
6936000	6944000	So for Xbox we've got starting June 1st, Assassin's Creed Chronicles Russia.
6944000	6946000	And that's for the whole month of June.
6946000	6951000	And then of course starting June 16th through July 15th you're going to have SMITE the gold bundle.
6951000	6955000	And then the Xbox 360 compatible games that are going to be released around that time.
6955000	6962000	Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for the 1st through the 15th and through the 16th and the 30th.
6962000	6965000	Lego Indiana Jones 2 the adventure continues.
6965000	6967000	Isn't SMITE free to play?
6967000	6970000	It might be like a gold pack that you're getting.
6970000	6973000	Yeah I figured they're probably like what?
6973000	6975000	Like XP boosters?
6975000	6976000	Some like that.
6976000	6977000	Characters.
6977000	6983000	They've done this before because they gave away killer instinct in games with gold which is also free to play.
6983000	6987000	But what the games with gold stuff was like you got all the season 1 characters.
6987000	6990000	I think at one point they even gave you all the season 2 characters.
6990000	6994000	So you got some of the stuff that most people would pay money for.
6994000	6997000	I'm also fucking garbage at Xbox One Killer Instinct.
6997000	7000000	Yeah Xbox One Killer Instinct is like a totally different game.
7000000	7004000	I like it a lot but it's very different from the old school ones.
7004000	7008000	And then on the Playstation side of things for Playstation Plus.
7008000	7012000	On Playstation 4 we're getting XCOM 2 and Trials Fusion.
7012000	7014000	I do like me some Trials so that's worth it.
7014000	7016000	Except I already bought it.
7016000	7022000	Playstation 3 is getting Zombie Driver HD and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier.
7022000	7026000	I thought they stopped doing Playstation 3 games.
7026000	7028000	Or maybe I'm thinking Playstation 3.
7028000	7032000	They will be stopping that I think but they gave like a year notice on that.
7032000	7034000	So it's like stopping in April 2019.
7034000	7035000	It's a ways out.
7035000	7036000	Okay.
7036000	7038000	Don't quote me on that date but it's a ways out.
7038000	7043000	And then on the Vita, Atomic Ninjas, and Squares.
7043000	7051000	I don't know if any of these are like multi-platform games because usually there's a few of those on Playstation 3 and stuff.
7051000	7053000	That end up being like multi-platform.
7053000	7054000	Yeah.
7054000	7055000	But check those out.
7055000	7058000	Kaishudo confirming the date is March 2019.
7058000	7061000	I was really close so April would be the first month without it.
7061000	7062000	Anyway.
7062000	7063000	Let's see.
7063000	7067000	Also Needlecrash is in chat talking about Mega Man 11 saying yay Mega Man 11.
7067000	7072000	And mentioning that the Japan versions or the Japanese versions have better editions.
7072000	7077000	So if you want the Amiibo you could import it if you don't want to do Gamestop.
7078000	7082000	Of course that's going to be way more money but you'd be getting a Japanese edition.
7082000	7085000	They're a little different in their configuration so maybe that's an alternative.
7085000	7086000	So I like that.
7086000	7087000	Yeah.
7087000	7088000	Some outside the box thinking.
7088000	7089000	I like that.
7089000	7090000	Good deal.
7090000	7091000	Alright.
7091000	7093000	Kaishudo says I love the Gamestop.
7093000	7094000	This makes me smile.
7094000	7096000	I'm glad someone's smiling.
7096000	7097000	Alright.
7097000	7098000	Moving on.
7098000	7101000	Also in Microsoft news, what about backwards compatibility?
7101000	7104000	That's still a thing that is growing and continuing.
7104000	7108000	So this is pretty cool because it's a lot of Rockstar stuff so I think Loki you're going
7108000	7109000	to be really into this.
7109000	7110000	Because it's all the same engine.
7110000	7111000	Yeah.
7111000	7112000	Right.
7112000	7116000	So apparently starting June 7th you will be able to play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,
7116000	7121000	Midnight Club LA, and ooh this is one that I bought because it was an early 360 release.
7121000	7124000	Rockstar Games Table Tennis.
7124000	7125000	That's right.
7125000	7129000	All of them will be available to play now on the Xbox One thanks to backwards compatibility.
7129000	7133000	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be the enhanced version released on Xbox 360 with the increased
7133000	7138000	resolution and draw distance even if you use the original Xbox disc.
7138000	7142000	So that's pretty cool that the original disc will actually trigger the enhanced version.
7142000	7144000	The original disc with the downloaded patch.
7144000	7147000	Well yeah because all the disc does is unlock the download.
7147000	7148000	Yep.
7148000	7149000	That's all it's doing.
7149000	7153000	And then the Midnight Club LA will be the complete edition.
7153000	7157000	Oh I'm sorry the initial release and the complete edition will be available.
7157000	7158000	So neat.
7158000	7162000	They say there was a native 4K update for Red Dead Redemption when they did that but
7162000	7166000	no similar improvements to these at least not yet.
7166000	7170000	Who can't wait for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie?
7170000	7172000	Well it's happening.
7172000	7174000	I'll probably see it at some point.
7174000	7179000	Whether you like it or not Sonic the Hedgehog is becoming a movie and they were trying to
7179000	7187000	get Paul Rudd to be in it but it sounds like they have actually cast James Marsden from
7187000	7191000	Westworld and I believe he was Cyclops in X-Men if I'm not mistaken or like the early
7191000	7192000	X-Men movies right?
7192000	7193000	Yes.
7193000	7194000	That was him.
7194000	7195000	That was him.
7195000	7196000	So he's a little older now.
7196000	7197000	Dick Cyclops.
7197000	7202000	And his now his movie career consists of running around with blue hedgehogs.
7202000	7206000	But is he going to be Sonic or is he just going to be like one of Sonic's wonderful
7206000	7207000	friends?
7207000	7208000	He is the star.
7208000	7212000	He is possibly a buddy cop type of role it sounds like.
7212000	7213000	Sonic's human friend.
7213000	7214000	Yes.
7214000	7216000	Sonic shitty human friends.
7216000	7222000	This honestly it's sounding more and more like a cross between Detective Pikachu and
7222000	7226000	what is that R rated movie about the puppets that's coming out?
7226000	7227000	No it's not like that.
7227000	7233000	No I would say if anything because it's blue it reminds me a lot of the Smurfs as in it
7233000	7237000	would be shitty but I still kind of want to see it because Neil Patrick Harris is in it
7237000	7240000	but that's really the only reason I'd ever want to see that movie.
7240000	7244000	And since I do say Detective Pikachu it shouldn't be forgotten that that movie is still happening.
7244000	7247000	There is a Detective Pikachu movie coming out too.
7247000	7254000	So it's Ryan Reynolds though it's not it's not Danny DeVito but I hope that Ryan Reynolds
7254000	7257000	will be as dirty as Danny DeVito and I believe that he could do that.
7257000	7259000	I'm sure I'm sure.
7259000	7260000	Good times.
7260000	7261000	I believe in Ryan Reynolds.
7261000	7263000	He's my current lord and savior.
7263000	7266000	I'm still a little apprehensive about the fact that they're doing a clue movie with
7266000	7269000	Ryan Reynolds because you all know clue is near and dear to my heart but it's going to
7269000	7270000	be R rated.
7270000	7271000	Yeah.
7272000	7273000	They could go places.
7273000	7275000	I need everybody to stop saying remake.
7275000	7276000	Literal flames.
7276000	7279000	Literal flames on the side of my face.
7279000	7284000	Every clue that comes out is a new clue because it's different every which way.
7284000	7285000	It's true.
7285000	7287000	This is a re-imaging.
7287000	7289000	Re-imagining of the board game in a movie form.
7289000	7290000	Right.
7290000	7291000	Yes.
7291000	7293000	Just like how there was the VCR game that was different.
7293000	7296000	But if we have nods to Madeline Kahn.
7296000	7300000	I would be fine if they do like a nod and have somebody in the movie doing the whole
7300000	7302000	flames on the side of my face.
7302000	7305000	Like I think they're almost required to do a nod.
7305000	7308000	Or if they do an opposite like I went cold.
7308000	7311000	Cold like the depths of hell.
7311000	7312000	If you read Dante.
7312000	7313000	I'm just thinking.
7313000	7314000	Maybe.
7314000	7315000	I don't know.
7315000	7316000	Yeah.
7316000	7317000	Something a little more in your face.
7317000	7319000	Or like a character named Yvette or Wadsworth.
7319000	7320000	Like they can call the butler Wadsworth.
7320000	7321000	I don't care.
7321000	7322000	Anyway.
7322000	7323000	Let's move on.
7323000	7324000	Sorry.
7324000	7325000	Away from clue.
7325000	7326000	Yeah.
7326000	7327000	Well we did bring this up before.
7327000	7331000	But it's of course gotten larger attention so I did want to bring it up.
7331000	7336000	Ted Dabney who is one of the co-founders of Atari died at the age of 81.
7336000	7340000	Which is not a bad run.
7340000	7344000	Started the whole thing with you know wanting to do.
7344000	7348000	You know of course the Nolan Bushnell who created Pizza Time Theater.
7348000	7353000	Had the idea for the Pizza Time Theater way way back when.
7353000	7357000	But it's one of those ideas that came about and led to.
7357000	7360000	You know they couldn't start the pizza place.
7360000	7363000	But they began the partnership that led to Atari.
7363000	7364000	Right.
7364000	7365000	So.
7365000	7367000	So even though we had addressed this last week.
7367000	7371000	It's worth noting that like you're seeing this now on places like the BBC.
7371000	7373000	And like these very large websites.
7373000	7374000	I'm reading it off of NPR.
7374000	7375000	Yeah.
7375000	7376000	Or NPR.
7376000	7379000	Like these very big places are kind of picking this up.
7379000	7380000	Like I even noticed it on Twitter.
7380000	7383000	Like one of my friends that does a lot of like media stuff.
7383000	7385000	Posted a tweet about it like Tuesday or Wednesday.
7385000	7388000	And I kind of wanted to reply and be like this.
7388000	7389000	He actually passed away like a few days ago.
7389000	7391000	But I didn't want to be that bitch.
7391000	7392000	You know I was like OK if people are.
7392000	7395000	It's taking its time for people to kind of recognize it's happening.
7395000	7396000	And so.
7396000	7397000	And the thing that's kind of what you saw happen.
7397000	7401000	About the NPR article is it does go a little bit into more of who he was as a person.
7401000	7403000	It was cancer that got him.
7403000	7409000	But what I didn't know about him is that I mean apart from just being an electrical engineer and co-founding Atari.
7409000	7410000	He was a Marine.
7410000	7418000	So I actually got call outs from a few buddies of mine who had been retired Marines.
7418000	7421000	So that was kind of actually how I found the NPR article.
7421000	7422000	OK.
7422000	7423000	So.
7423000	7424000	Interesting.
7424000	7425000	But yeah.
7425000	7426000	I.
7426000	7428000	I think it's you know.
7428000	7432000	He's he's one of our co-founders and actually this NPR article is totally worth reading.
7432000	7435000	I'm not going to go like super more in depth on it.
7435000	7442000	But it's a reason why since you know they set up their first pong in the Andy Capps Tavern in Sunnyvale.
7442000	7446000	We would do Atari party every so often in Sunnyvale instead of Davis.
7446000	7449000	So I'll link the article in the chat room.
7449000	7450000	It's totally worth reading.
7450000	7451000	It's definitely going to be a lot more.
7451000	7455000	Actually I'll be linking this on my Jamie Summers Facebook.
7455000	7459000	So definitely worth reading the whole article.
7459000	7460000	All right.
7460000	7465000	And also one of my favorite characters who I keep going didn't he die in the first Soul Calibur.
7465000	7468000	Maxie is back.
7468000	7484000	I won't be happy though with Maxie is not voiced by Hayashi Nobutoshi who was his original voice actor who was also Knuckles in Sonic Adventure and Toski in Fushigi Yugi and Basara in Macross 7.
7484000	7487000	Just one of those voices you know really good voice really good singer.
7487000	7491000	But yeah he's back in it and he better be voiced by the same guy or else I will be upset.
7491000	7493000	That's it.
7493000	7494000	All right.
7494000	7501000	We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates some games you might be playing a little sooner than Soul Calibur 6 here on the Eve of E3 coming up.
7501000	7503000	Yeah there's actually some stuff coming out.
7503000	7509000	So we've got Blaze Blue cross tag battle that's on PC the Switch and PlayStation 4.
7509000	7513000	A game called Happy Birthdays that's on the Switch.
7513000	7521000	Nobunaga's Ambition looks like Taishi and that's on PC and PlayStation 4.
7521000	7525000	Onrush which is on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7525000	7530000	Shaq Fu the a legendary born on PC the Switch PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7530000	7538000	The Elder Scrolls Online Somerset that expansion is coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One I imagine on PC as well.
7538000	7543000	Vampire on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7543000	7552000	Warhammer 40,000 The Inquisitor and Martyr that's on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7552000	7555000	Flashback Remastered Edition on the Switch.
7555000	7557000	The Banner Saga 2 on the Switch.
7557000	7559000	And then as we talked about last week.
7559000	7566000	Muv Luv on the Vita and Muv Luv Alternative on the Vita.
7566000	7573000	And then finally and last but not least for this week Sushi Striker the weight of the Sushido on the Switch and 3DS.
7573000	7574000	That's it.
7574000	7577000	I feel like Nintendo's trying to push that game way harder than it deserves.
7577000	7579000	But I guess I can't hate till I try it so.
7579000	7580000	Hate which one?
7580000	7581000	The Sushido game.
7581000	7582000	Oh.
7582000	7583000	Yeah anyway.
7583000	7587000	Alright moving on to Japan and let's check out some of the releases there.
7587000	7593000	Hey on the PlayStation 4 Life is Strange Before the Storm gets its Japanese release this week from Square Enix.
7593000	7595000	June the 7th is when that will be out.
7595000	7601000	Fate Xtella Link is out from Marvelous in a regular and a limited edition in Japan this week.
7601000	7606000	As well as a game called Little Nightmares in a deluxe edition is also out this week.
7606000	7609000	But that is about it at least for the PlayStation 4 releases in Japan.
7609000	7611000	I should point out though there is.
7611000	7613000	Excuse me.
7613000	7618000	There is some sort of special PlayStation 4 like a new bundle that's coming out on the 8th.
7618000	7619000	It is a new.
7619000	7622000	It's a very pretty like blue.
7622000	7624000	It's called the Days of Play edition.
7624000	7627000	I don't know if we're getting one like that here but it's a really pretty blue like.
7627000	7631000	If Shane saw this I think he would import it from Japan because you know he loves the color blue.
7631000	7637000	And it's a really like pretty blue with the gold like PlayStation logo in it with all the little other X's nose.
7637000	7639000	And the controllers are really pretty too.
7639000	7642000	I might have to like send him that link and see what he thinks about that.
7642000	7644000	Anyway.
7644000	7647000	Also on other systems I'm not sure if the Vita.
7647000	7651000	The Vita also has that Fate Xtella Link and that's the only real release on the Vita this week in Japan.
7651000	7653000	But hey they're still getting something in Japan.
7653000	7657000	And then on the Nintendo Switch this week that Little Nightmares game is on the Switch.
7657000	7659000	Otherwise that is really it.
7659000	7662000	It's a little slower for releases than it is here.
7662000	7663000	Dark Sakura.
7663000	7665000	What about Europe?
7665000	7669000	In Europe we have on the 5th Elder Scrolls Online Summer Set.
7669000	7671000	Actually a game exclusive.
7671000	7673000	The retailer.

7690000	7694000	Flashback 25th Anniversary Edition for Switch on June 8th.
7694000	7697000	Also on June 8th is Sushi Striker The Way of Sushido.
7697000	7698000	That name.
7698000	7701000	Okay first of all Sushido would mean the way of sushi.
7701000	7703000	Don't call it the way of the way of sushi.
7703000	7704000	Stupid.
7704000	7706000	It's like saying chai tea.
7706000	7707000	ATM machine.
7707000	7709000	USB bus.
7709000	7710000	Chai tea.
7710000	7712000	Chai means tea.
7712000	7713000	But I love chai tea.
7713000	7715000	Bitch don't make me.
7715000	7721000	Hey next time I drink a cup of chai tea you should walk up to me and go hey nice tea tea.
7721000	7722000	Girl.
7726000	7728000	I'm way too easily amused.
7728000	7729000	Alright.
7729000	7731000	Or like when I see yakitori chicken.
7731000	7732000	Uh huh.
7732000	7734000	Yakitori means chicken.
7734000	7735000	On a skewer.
7735000	7737000	Specifically chicken on a skewer.
7738000	7739000	Alright.
7739000	7741000	Chicken on a skewer chicken.
7741000	7746000	If that's it for the UK releases then I'm gonna direct Dark Soccer to the mail bag.
7746000	7748000	The bag of mail.
7748000	7750000	Which I had to prune.
7750000	7752000	Yes Dark Soccer went in there and uh.
7752000	7753000	This is working.
7753000	7759000	Yes it actually I just a quick off the record since Jason was here I was like Jason.
7759000	7760000	Jason.
7760000	7761000	Jason.
7761000	7762000	Jason.
7762000	7763000	Jason.
7763000	7766000	I was like Jason our website's been doing all this stuff and he went oh click click click click click.
7766000	7767000	Done.
7767000	7768000	Done.
7768000	7769000	So hopefully that won't bother us again.
7769000	7775000	Okay so this one is actually a code for a game for someone who has Xbox Live.
7775000	7776000	I saw that.
7776000	7778000	So I don't have it so.
7778000	7779000	Um.
7779000	7780000	Whichever one of you guys.
7780000	7782000	It was Street Fighter something right?
7782000	7784000	Street Fighter 4 arcade code.
7784000	7787000	I don't think I have that on Xbox One if I don't have it I'll take it.
7787000	7788000	Then it's yours I'll leave it in the inbox.
7788000	7789000	Who sent that to us?
7789000	7790000	Rababa.
7790000	7791000	Thank you Rababa.
7791000	7792000	Rababa.
7792000	7793000	Rababa.
7793000	7794000	Rababa.
7794000	7799000	I've been listening to Rababa since he came back from Japan and gave me my Anpanman plushie.
7799000	7802000	Rababa needs a theme song.
7802000	7803000	Okay.
7803000	7804000	Rababa.
7804000	7805000	Rababa.
7805000	7806000	Rababa.
7806000	7807000	Rababa.
7807000	7808000	Rababa.
7808000	7809000	Rababa.
7809000	7810000	Rababa.
7810000	7811000	Rababa.
7811000	7812000	Rababa.
7812000	7813000	Rababa.
7813000	7814000	Rababa.
7814000	7815000	Rababa.
7815000	7816000	Rababa.
7816000	7817000	Rababa.
7817000	7818000	Rababa.
7818000	7819000	Rababa.
7819000	7820000	Rababa.
7820000	7821000	Rababa.
7821000	7822000	Rababa would like to take back this email.
7822000	7823000	That's right.
7823000	7825000	That's the actual email that's content for us.
7825000	7826000	Hey, OLR.
7826000	7828000	It's been a long time since I wrote you guys an email.
7828000	7831000	I just wanted to get your thoughts on Mega Man 11.
7831000	7833000	Two new bosses were officially revealed this week.
7833000	7834000	Block Man and Fuse Man.
7834000	7837000	They look pretty innovative and I like their designs as well.
7837000	7842000	I already have my premium edition on pre-order from Play Asia since Japan gets the good shit
7842000	7843000	and we don't.
7843000	7848000	I also noticed that you can't get the Mega Man amiibo on pre-order anymore from overseas
7848000	7852000	since it's sold out everywhere unless you buy the Switch bundle that comes with it.
7853000	7854000	Okay, I'll stop there.
7854000	7856000	So what do we think about Mega Man 11?
7856000	7859000	I think, yay, it's a fun Mega Man game and I'll probably have it.
7859000	7860000	Same.
7860000	7866000	I appreciate that with Mega Man 9 and 10 they went back to that old school Mega Man look
7866000	7867000	and they really made it look like.
7867000	7871000	But I think people have been waiting for a game like this where it's that old school
7871000	7875000	2D but definitely with the tricks that you can do in a new school environment.
7875000	7878000	Who am I kidding?
7878000	7879000	I'm gonna fucking buy it.
7879000	7884000	Even though I'm sure the game is gonna be fucking hard as a lot of Mega Man games are,
7884000	7885000	I'll buy it.
7885000	7886000	You know?
7886000	7887000	Whatever.
7887000	7888000	9 and 10 wrecked me.
7888000	7890000	9 and 10 were a disaster.
7890000	7895000	I'm not saying they were bad games, they were actually great games, but when I played them
7895000	7897000	it was sad.
7897000	7903000	Hey, remember how you couldn't dash or charge special weapons and all of these things from
7903000	7905000	the X series that you don't get anymore?
7905000	7907000	Go back to the 90s.
7907000	7909000	I want a new X.
7909000	7910000	That's what all this makes me do.
7910000	7912000	It makes me want a new Mega Man X.
7912000	7913000	We'll get there eventually.
7913000	7915000	What was the last X game?
7915000	7916000	X8?
7916000	7917000	X8?
7917000	7918000	Sounds right.
7918000	7919000	Yeah.
7919000	7920000	But...
7920000	7922000	They just have to get through re-releasing everything.
7922000	7926000	They have to get through extending the classic series and then they'll start extending the
7926000	7927000	X series.
7927000	7929000	My eyes are gonna hurt from all the rolling that they're doing.
7929000	7933000	And then the XE and the battle network and then they'll make another sequel to ZX.
7934000	7939000	Oh, DarkTight2U in chat points out over at live.vognetwork.com, I did hear Mega Man 11
7939000	7941000	will have a casual mode.
7941000	7943000	Yay for Bobby Black Wolf mode.
7943000	7944000	Yay.
7944000	7945000	Because I love those modes.
7945000	7949000	Although, with what I heard about Curse of the Moon, it might not mean a lot.
7949000	7952000	Look, the thing about Curse of the Moon, it gives you unlimited lives.
7952000	7958000	Yes, I wiped on that boss, but it let me start all over again on the screen before the boss.
7958000	7960000	That's typical Castlevania, too.
7960000	7962000	But I mean, I died.
7962000	7965000	I lost everybody and it still let me start there.
7965000	7967000	So, yeah.
7967000	7969000	I'm a big fan of casual mode.
7970000	7972000	So, to continue this email.
7972000	7974000	E3 starts in a few days and I'm wondering what your predictions are.
7974000	7976000	For me, I'm hoping of the following.
7976000	7978000	Onimusha Collection is announced.
7978000	7980000	PS4 to be backwards compatible.
7980000	7982000	Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
7982000	7984000	Final Fantasy 7 remake footage.
7984000	7986000	Nintendo Switch online plans.
7986000	7987000	Bayonetta 3 info.
7987000	7988000	Mega Man X9.
7988000	7990000	A man can only dream.
7990000	7992000	I truly hope you are all doing well.
7992000	7995000	I haven't had the time to hear you guys lately due to life.
7995000	7996000	But that's how it goes.
7996000	7999000	Be well, keep up the good work, and happy Pride Week.
7999000	8001000	And that comes from Needle Crash.
8001000	8004000	Well, welcome back. Happy Pride to you as well.
8004000	8007000	And let's see, E3 predictions.
8007000	8009000	Week? We get a month.
8009000	8011000	I guess that would be the time.
8011000	8012000	I know, that's right.
8012000	8013000	We do get a month.
8013000	8015000	Well, actually, here in SAC, it's this coming weekend.
8015000	8017000	But then I'm going to Chicago Pride.
8017000	8019000	I'm such a selfish bitch, I'm doing it twice.
8019000	8021000	I'm going to San Francisco Pride.
8021000	8023000	When you're in Chicago for Pride.
8023000	8025000	You're doing charitable work, though.
8025000	8027000	Well, but I would have been there anyway.
8027000	8030000	So anyway, as far as the E3 predictions go,
8030000	8033000	I think Bayonetta 3 info is a really good, safe bet.
8033000	8036000	As well as some of those other things that were named.
8036000	8038000	There's one other one that he named that I was like,
8038000	8040000	oh yeah, that's probably for sure going to happen.
8040000	8043000	I thought that Tekken vs. Street Fighter was a very interesting prediction
8043000	8046000	because that has seemed to kind of disappear altogether.
8046000	8049000	So I would like to see that make a resurgence as well.
8049000	8052000	Maybe they're hoping we'll forget about it before they re-announce it.
8052000	8054000	And maybe now that Street Fighter V is a little bit like,
8054000	8057000	and Tekken 7, both are kind of like, you know, doing their thing.
8057000	8059000	Maybe now's a good time for that to happen.
8059000	8061000	So that's a really good call.
8061000	8063000	As far as other stuff I'd like to see,
8063000	8066000	from the Nintendo camp, I mean, I would like to see
8066000	8069000	what great big holiday hit they have in store.
8069000	8072000	I think there's a lot of people really hoping for a new Animal Crossing.
8072000	8075000	I would love for you guys to be pleased.
8075000	8079000	But I really would put that expectation on the lowest possible setting.
8079000	8081000	I really want it though.
8081000	8084000	I know, but wanting it, like, I've wanted F-Zero for how many years?
8084000	8087000	Or as my husband likes to say, how does it feel to wand?
8087000	8089000	Yeah, here's the thing with Animal Crossing.
8089000	8092000	That mobile game is still too fresh.
8092000	8095000	So I would say, you know, keep bugging the shit out of Nintendo
8095000	8098000	and tweeting at them and stuff. Let them know the demand is there.
8098000	8100000	But don't be surprised if that's a next year thing.
8100000	8103000	But as far as Metroid Prime 4 goes,
8103000	8106000	now that I would like to hear some more things about.
8106000	8109000	Otherwise with E3, gosh,
8109000	8112000	I still am going to go by my old standby
8112000	8116000	that I think one of these years Microsoft is going to be the first one to say
8116000	8119000	you no longer have to pay to play online anymore.
8119000	8122000	That's my old standby prediction I'm convinced they're going to do.
8122000	8125000	Which seems weird, especially in the face of Nintendo
8125000	8127000	holding up that mantle now.
8127000	8130000	I know, but Microsoft has to make a big fucking move.
8130000	8131000	They have to be bold.
8131000	8134000	They're going to have to make a big fucking move to get people to talk about them again.
8134000	8136000	And I think that would be one of the things that would do it.
8136000	8140000	Another thing, though, about making a free-to-play model for online gaming
8140000	8143000	is the fact that there will be less...
8143000	8146000	If they have to shut down a server or something,
8146000	8149000	that will already lessen, I guess, some of the blow on that one
8149000	8151000	because no one's paying for it.
8154000	8157000	I was going to ask how...
8158000	8163000	I know the Games for Windows program ended a long time ago,
8163000	8169000	but for games that exist both on PC and Xbox One,
8169000	8173000	gold isn't a thing in the PC universe.
8173000	8177000	Correct. And you see where my thought process is going with this.
8177000	8181000	Yeah, I was leading down the same path with the big unification,
8181000	8185000	the big one ecosystem for multiple systems thing.
8186000	8190000	I don't want to repeat myself too bad, but Microsoft has these other perks.
8190000	8194000	They could still have a gold program that gives you the free games.
8194000	8198000	Microsoft has that very rich Netflix-style thing that they're offering,
8198000	8200000	the game password, whatever it is, separately.
8200000	8202000	They could start to move some of that into the gold and what have you.
8202000	8205000	I'm just saying, as far as paying to play online,
8205000	8209000	Microsoft being a company to take that off the table would be a huge fucking move.
8209000	8212000	And I don't want the Xbox and Microsoft fans to get mad at me
8212000	8214000	that I'm saying, oh, Microsoft's got to make a move.
8214000	8217000	But you guys know the reality is they are getting lost
8217000	8220000	amongst competing with PlayStation 4,
8220000	8223000	competing against themselves on PC.
8223000	8227000	And then obviously, Microsoft doesn't really compete with Nintendo,
8227000	8230000	but Nintendo's just got so much of that gaming buzz right now.
8230000	8232000	And hey, the phrase goes, you snooze, you lose.
8232000	8236000	Yeah, but if Microsoft made a big fucking move.
8236000	8238000	So I think that's another thing for E3.
8238000	8243000	I think that Microsoft is going to do something to make our jaws drop.
8243000	8248000	And even if it's not necessarily that, there's going to be like another,
8248000	8251000	here's another classic standby prediction that you all think is fucking stupid,
8251000	8254000	but I'm going to say it again, Minecraft 2.
8254000	8257000	I think it's going to be, well, Halo 6 is probably what they're going to bring.
8257000	8259000	I just think that is not jaw-dropping.
8259000	8262000	Halo 6 is just, oh, okay, yeah.
8262000	8265000	Halo 6, Royale, Battle Royale.
8265000	8266000	Yeah, okay, sure.
8266000	8268000	We got Minecraft 2.
8268000	8269000	What's that?
8269000	8272000	We got Minecraft 2 times 2 plus K.
8272000	8274000	Oh, Minecraft 4K.
8274000	8276000	Did that finally come out?
8276000	8277000	No.
8277000	8279000	No, I think the patch is like any day now, though.
8279000	8281000	I think it's supposed to be around E3.
8281000	8282000	So that's finally coming.
8282000	8284000	Microsoft 2 squared, 2 squared K.
8284000	8287000	Maybe they will announce that that comes out, but you know.
8287000	8289000	What would a Minecraft 2 be?
8289000	8294000	Kaishudo says Microsoft can make a huge move and just cancel the Xbox One.
8294000	8297000	For some reason, as you were starting your buildup,
8297000	8299000	I thought that's actually what you were going to say,
8299000	8301000	and it made no sense to me.
8302000	8304000	Microsoft's not going to cancel Xbox One.
8304000	8305000	Yeah, no, absolutely not.
8305000	8308000	No, they're not ready to get out of living room business yet.
8308000	8312000	I think this is a better prediction, what TigerClaw says in chat.
8312000	8315000	How about if Microsoft announces a new Battletoads?
8315000	8319000	You know, they have been teasing that genitalia for, I don't know,
8319000	8322000	how many years on the concept of a new Battletoads game,
8322000	8324000	and we know, like, what was the thing where, like,
8324000	8327000	Aaron Greenberg fucking went out there in a fucking Battletoads jacket,
8327000	8330000	or one of those Xbox executives went out there in a fucking Battletoads jacket
8330000	8332000	and was like, announce it already, you fuck!
8332000	8336000	Like, he just won't do it.
8336000	8338000	So, maybe this will be the year.
8338000	8341000	He's like, you know, hey, we'll put it in Ready Player One.
8341000	8343000	We'll go ahead and put it as a playable character.
8343000	8344000	It wasn't an inoculancing.
8344000	8345000	Just fucking announce it, bitch.
8345000	8346000	Like, just stop it.
8346000	8347000	Stop teasing me.
8347000	8349000	They have the collection that has it in there.
8349000	8350000	Maybe this is the year.
8350000	8351000	This is the year for Battletoads, maybe.
8351000	8353000	We're bringing you Battletoads.
8353000	8355000	Backwards compatibility.
8357000	8358000	I can't fit this.
8358000	8362000	I can't fit this cartridge into the CD drive.
8362000	8364000	Why isn't this working?
8365000	8366000	Alright.
8367000	8370000	Microsoft's big thing now is the 4K gaming.
8370000	8371000	That's where they're gonna go all in.
8371000	8375000	The 4K on the Xbox One X is superior to the 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro,
8375000	8377000	so I hope they just own it.
8377000	8378000	And so maybe that'll be their thing,
8378000	8379000	is they're just gonna say,
8379000	8382000	we've got this in 4K, we've got this in 4K.
8382000	8385000	You know, developers, developers, developers in 4K.
8386000	8389000	Can I please have my Crackdown 3 already?
8389000	8390000	Can I please have that or is this...
8390000	8392000	Why 4K? Why not do 5K?
8393000	8395000	That'll be, and then they'll have the PlayStation 5K.
8395000	8398000	It'll only be on 27-inch max.
8398000	8399000	Alright, anyway.
8400000	8401000	Alright.
8401000	8402000	As Sharon under Matt says,
8402000	8405000	game retailers are pressuring them to make the game
8405000	8407000	because they're tired of fielding calls about
8407000	8409000	if they have Battletoads.
8409000	8413000	That the choice of retailers is funny there,
8413000	8416000	considering they kind of are the only retailer,
8416000	8418000	at least brick and mortar-wise, that exists anymore.
8418000	8421000	They started a whole online campaign for you.
8421000	8422000	Tell your, you know how they have like,
8422000	8425000	tell your cable provider that you want blah blah blah blah blah.
8425000	8428000	Tell your retailer that you want Battletoads.
8428000	8431000	It's not, it's not gonna do shit, but anyway.
8431000	8434000	Now we live in a Tweety Facebook-y era.
8434000	8436000	That's what we're talking about.
8436000	8439000	We live in a Tweety Facebook-y era.
8439000	8441000	That's the stuff that gets noticed, but anyway.
8441000	8444000	Alright, well there's some E3 predictions for you.
8444000	8446000	I mean, honestly, you know, I'm always,
8446000	8447000	it's one of those things where
8447000	8449000	I just don't realize it until you see it.
8449000	8451000	I was actually, I thought of it a little bit late,
8451000	8452000	but more proof that the only one
8452000	8454000	gets paid attention to are Twits.
8455000	8456000	Tweets, Twits.
8456000	8457000	Oh, Tweet, Twits.
8457000	8458000	Yeah, I get it.
8458000	8459000	Twitter.
8459000	8460000	Nice Twitties.
8461000	8462000	Alright, anyway.
8462000	8463000	That's it for email?
8463000	8466000	I thought I'd thought direct messages.
8466000	8467000	I got nothing.
8467000	8468000	You got nothing.
8468000	8470000	Actually, if you ever want a good laugh,
8470000	8474000	just Google image search like Tweety Bird graphics
8474000	8477000	because there are all these things that like
8477000	8480000	wine box drinking moms will leave like images
8480000	8482000	of Thug Tweety Bird on each other's pages.
8482000	8483000	Hold my mochi.
8483000	8484000	I'm going in.
8484000	8485000	Yep.
8485000	8486000	No, Google image search it.
8486000	8488000	Google image search like Thug Tweety Bird
8488000	8489000	or something like that and you get all these
8489000	8491000	like crazy results where you're like,
8491000	8494000	like the Tweety Bird on Blingy and all this other stuff.
8494000	8496000	It came up in one of our chats the other day,
8496000	8498000	which I thought was hilarious.
8498000	8501000	Anyway, going back to video gaming topic,
8501000	8502000	that's it for email.
8502000	8505000	So participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8505000	8507000	if you would like to send us an email in the future.
8507000	8509000	Maybe you'd like to send us your favorite Tweety Bird meme.
8509000	8511000	Let's get into some more news though
8511000	8513000	before we get to phone calls.
8513000	8514000	Loki.
8514000	8517000	Alright, so let's talk about the current
8517000	8519000	and brand new game consoles.
8519000	8521000	In this case, we're talking about the Atari.
8521000	8525000	So the Atari retro console has launched
8525000	8527000	their pre-order campaign and apparently
8527000	8531000	that's gone well for them because it crashed Indiegogo.
8531000	8533000	It looks neat.
8533000	8535000	I'm not exactly sure what this is,
8535000	8536000	but I like the interface.
8536000	8538000	It looks neat with all their Atari games.
8538000	8542000	But we got more details on what it is.
8542000	8545000	So it's basically, it runs Linux
8545000	8548000	and it's on a Radeon R7 processor,
8548000	8550000	a 32 gigabyte hard drive,
8550000	8553000	four gigs of DDR4 RAM and expandable storage.
8553000	8555000	Plus it connects to the internet,
8555000	8558000	supports streaming video and online multiplayer games.
8558000	8560000	And they even have voice control.
8560000	8563000	So that's pretty neat.
8563000	8566000	They haven't said too much about
8566000	8568000	what games are going to be on there,
8568000	8571000	but apparently the wood paneled model
8571000	8573000	is going to go for $339.
8574000	8579000	And they look like the controllers are similar
8582000	8584000	to like a PlayStation controller.
8584000	8587000	They said they have a cheaper option,
8587000	8590000	I guess, that's the Onyx model with no controllers.
8590000	8592000	That's $199.
8592000	8595000	I'm hoping that this supports some sort of Bluetooth controllers
8595000	8597000	because otherwise that's kind of lame.
8597000	8599000	How am I going to get some controllers for this thing?
8599000	8601000	Yeah, that's what it said
8601000	8603000	at the end of the previous section.
8603000	8605000	So, cool.
8605000	8607000	Are you surprised this is doing so well?
8607000	8609000	I am, especially after the whole
8609000	8611000	Coleco chameleon thing.
8611000	8613000	I thought people would be kind of hesitant,
8613000	8615000	especially with Atari.
8615000	8617000	How they were trying to kickstart was at
8617000	8619000	Theme Park,
8619000	8621000	Roller Coaster Tycoon or something like that,
8621000	8623000	but it's like the shitty one from mobile.
8623000	8625000	I do feel like the audience
8625000	8627000	that would be getting a retro Atari
8627000	8629000	is very different from those that were
8629000	8631000	keeping an eye on Coleco chameleon.
8631000	8633000	I just think it's very different types of audiences,
8633000	8635000	if you know what I mean.
8635000	8637000	By the way, before you finish,
8637000	8639000	I have a very important follow-up.
8639000	8641000	So I sent Shane that
8641000	8643000	blue PlayStation 4 thing,
8643000	8645000	and he said, I would own it
8645000	8647000	if it was a pro system.
8647000	8649000	I didn't realize it's not a pro,
8649000	8651000	and he said, it was announced earlier this week
8651000	8653000	and I'm mad it's not a pro system because
8653000	8655000	it's beautiful. So I was right that he would be
8655000	8657000	into that blue system, but it's not a pro.
8657000	8659000	By the way, tell Shane I have
8659000	8661000	coconut pocky for him.
8661000	8663000	What is it, like dbrand
8663000	8665000	or other skinning sites that
8665000	8667000	you can get a blue skin for your pro?
8667000	8669000	That's true. I'm sure he has
8669000	8671000	some type of blue PlayStation 4 already
8671000	8673000	anyway, but just not that.
8673000	8675000	I do need to get a pro. I've been thinking about getting a
8675000	8677000	pro and
8677000	8679000	a 4K TV at some point.
8679000	8681000	I just don't know how much better that's going to
8681000	8683000	really make VR games and stuff.
8683000	8685000	I don't think it's marginally better.
8685000	8687000	Marginally.
8687000	8689000	The whole thing that Bobby is saying about the 4K
8689000	8691000	now that he has this whole state of the art
8691000	8693000	theater thing he set up,
8693000	8695000	he notices very much that
8695000	8697000	Microsoft Xbox One X
8697000	8699000	does the 4K.
8699000	8701000	I don't have an Xbox One yet.
8701000	8703000	But we knew that.
8703000	8705000	We kind of knew that. Even though the
8705000	8707000	PlayStation has 4K support,
8707000	8709000	it still doesn't have the technology
8709000	8711000	and the chips in it to really
8711000	8713000	do beefy 4K games.
8713000	8715000	That would be why I'd want
8715000	8717000	Xbox One X.
8717000	8719000	However,
8719000	8721000	with that being said,
8721000	8723000	I don't really need
8723000	8725000	an Xbox One X because I have a PC
8725000	8727000	that can run Microsoft games.
8727000	8729000	That's the problem that they run into.
8729000	8731000	They make all their games on PC
8731000	8733000	and it's like, why the hell am I going to buy a system
8733000	8735000	for cross-platform games
8735000	8737000	that I have a system that can play them on already?
8737000	8739000	Because it's getting hard to get a graphics
8739000	8741000	card that does 4K because of
8741000	8743000	fucking Bitcoin.
8743000	8745000	Well, I don't have a 4K monitor so I don't give a shit
8745000	8747000	but I don't have a 4K TV either.
8747000	8749000	I have a 4K monitor and do you know how hard it is to get a
8749000	8751000	VO card right now because of fucking Bitcoin?
8753000	8755000	I feel like the only way I'm going to be able
8755000	8757000	to get a graphics card is to pay for it with Bitcoin.
8759000	8761000	Anyway.
8761000	8763000	Moving on.
8763000	8765000	One thing I could
8765000	8767000	play if I wanted to. Actually, I thought about picking
8767000	8769000	it up was the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary
8769000	8771000	collection because it does look like a pretty
8771000	8773000	sweet collection of games
8773000	8775000	and of course that's available on the Switch
8775000	8777000	and I think it's on other systems too.
8777000	8779000	I would obviously get something like that
8779000	8781000	on the Switch. Yes, it is on Playstation 4 and
8781000	8783000	Xbox One as well as PC.
8783000	8785000	So the collection
8785000	8787000	the collection
8787000	8789000	it came out here in the States
8789000	8791000	it's been delayed in Japan.
8791000	8793000	They have delayed it in Japan to fall of 2018
8793000	8795000	but this might actually
8795000	8797000	be a good thing because you may
8797000	8799000	or may not recall
8799000	8801000	the folks in Japan weren't super happy
8801000	8803000	about this collection because
8803000	8805000	it's all English titles
8805000	8807000	voicing and text. Meaning the Japanese
8807000	8809000	versions were just kind of
8809000	8811000	thrown away. Well in a message posted
8811000	8813000	on the official website the producer
8813000	8815000	of Street Fighter Tomoaki
8815000	8817000	Aino shared
8817000	8819000	that they are going to do a fall 2018 release
8819000	8821000	for the Street Fighter 30th
8821000	8823000	Anniversary collection international
8823000	8825000	and said we apologize for the trouble
8825000	8827000	this may have caused to those of you who were looking forward to it
8827000	8829000	but please wait a little longer
8829000	8831000	for additional new information
8831000	8833000	besides the release period.
8833000	8835000	So it sounds like they are going to be making
8835000	8837000	some changes
8837000	8839000	to potentially maybe let them at least
8839000	8841000	flip over to Japanese voice acting
8841000	8843000	and all that stuff and where
8843000	8845000	you know Vega will be
8845000	8847000	M. Bison
8847000	8849000	and Sagat will be
8849000	8851000	all those different changes that they made in the game.
8851000	8853000	Correcting that triangle
8853000	8855000	all that stuff
8855000	8857000	I mean that would be kind of messed up
8857000	8859000	There would be some people
8859000	8861000	I bet that would actually be really into
8861000	8863000	being able to get some of the Japanese
8863000	8865000	versions here in the states
8865000	8867000	you know so I kind of hope
8867000	8869000	that if they do fix it they still have some type
8869000	8871000	of DLC or patch or something
8871000	8873000	where our versions can get the Japanese
8873000	8875000	stuff. I think that would be cool but
8875000	8877000	I'm not going to hold my breath but
8877000	8879000	I just think it would be cool. Anyway
8879000	8881000	needlecrash in chat at live.vognetwork.com
8881000	8883000	says collection isn't bad
8883000	8885000	it's pretty good but the
8885000	8887000	online is iffy at times.
8887000	8889000	Japan needs to get their versions of
8889000	8891000	Street Fighter Zero.
8891000	8893000	Alright let's move on
8893000	8895000	DarkSakura what do you have for us coming up next?
8895000	8897000	Well
8897000	8899000	people have been
8899000	8901000	stupid about Battlefield 5
8901000	8903000	because it involves
8903000	8905000	women in a World War 2 setting
8905000	8907000	and basically
8907000	8909000	DICE basically said
8909000	8911000	and I'm going to quote here
8911000	8913000	first of all let me be clear about one thing
8913000	8915000	player choice in female playable characters
8915000	8917000	are here to stay.
8917000	8919000	And then he went on to
8919000	8921000	explain that it is important to be able to play as a character
8921000	8923000	you identify with for
8923000	8925000	immersion and to customize the way
8925000	8927000	that you want to and I like
8927000	8929000	this quote too. We want Battlefield 5 to represent
8929000	8931000	all of those who are part of the greatest drama in human
8931000	8933000	history and give players a choice to
8933000	8935000	choose and customize
8935000	8937000	the characters they play with.
8937000	8939000	And now here's a history lesson
8939000	8941000	little boys
8941000	8943000	who didn't pay attention in fucking school
8943000	8945000	did you know that there
8945000	8947000	was an entire battalion of female snipers
8947000	8949000	out of Russia?
8949000	8951000	Did you know
8951000	8953000	that one of the
8953000	8955000	highest kill counts for female
8955000	8957000	snipers was a Czech sniper?
8957000	8959000	Did you also know that there were a number
8959000	8961000	of women working for the resistance
8961000	8963000	in Germany and occupied areas
8963000	8965000	that were releasing propaganda
8965000	8967000	hiding children, helping to get
8967000	8969000	people out who were
8969000	8971000	non-combatant civilians
8971000	8973000	and there were plenty of fucking
8973000	8975000	people enlisted in
8975000	8977000	the armed services
8977000	8979000	who were women
8979000	8981000	who performed medic functions
8981000	8983000	who drove tanks, who drove
8983000	8985000	delivery and who
8985000	8987000	whether or not it was documented
8987000	8989000	did participate in combat.
8989000	8991000	So get off of your sexist little
8991000	8993000	I don't know shit about history
8993000	8995000	you know ass hattery fucking
8995000	8997000	read a book and shut up.
8997000	8999000	Also it's a fucking
8999000	9001000	video game and like a lot of the
9001000	9003000	stuff you're doing in the video game
9003000	9005000	didn't really fucking happen in history so you
9005000	9007000	know what if we want to you know
9007000	9009000	maybe bend some things a little bit to be more
9009000	9011000	inclusive so women can play women in the game
9011000	9013000	does it really like
9013000	9015000	change anything about
9015000	9017000	battlefield? But they all should know their fucking history.
9017000	9019000	And that is true too I'm not denying anything
9019000	9021000	that you're saying there. Well you're saying battlefield
9021000	9023000	is not realistic I mean I can't jump out of a
9023000	9025000	plane, snipe somebody with a rocket launcher
9025000	9027000	and then land back in that plane again
9027000	9029000	and take off. But women!
9029000	9031000	That's where I draw
9031000	9033000	the line. Goes to show
9033000	9035000	you're still
9035000	9037000	have a long way to go. Wow Raginator
9037000	9039000	is actually like making great points
9039000	9041000	tonight I don't know what the fuck they put in the water
9041000	9043000	over there but Raginator says
9043000	9045000	wah I want realism in
9045000	9047000	my games Gondi sets off
9047000	9049000	nukes which is a popular
9049000	9051000	civilization joke if you
9051000	9053000	play civilization it's like Gondi's the most
9053000	9055000	aggressive leader in the game because of a bug
9055000	9057000	in the original civilization. Dungeon buster
9057000	9059000	historically accurate fixes tank in seconds.
9059000	9061000	So
9061000	9063000	anyway
9063000	9065000	I just
9065000	9067000	I just think
9067000	9069000	that cause the big point that these assholes
9069000	9071000	are trying to make is
9071000	9073000	from a historical standpoint
9073000	9075000	when history disproves them
9075000	9077000	already. Sorry
9077000	9079000	I make it a point to study history
9079000	9081000	because you know they say those who
9081000	9083000	who don't know their history are
9083000	9085000	doomed to repeat it we're fucking reliving it
9085000	9087000	right now but
9087000	9089000	you pay attention
9089000	9091000	to it you learn from it
9091000	9093000	and if you knew anything about fucking
9093000	9095000	history first of all you probably wouldn't be playing
9095000	9097000	battlefield but
9097000	9099000	but second of all
9099000	9101000	you would you would know how fucking weak your
9101000	9103000	argument is I mean if
9103000	9105000	you're this poorly
9105000	9107000	prepared for a battle of wits
9107000	9109000	just don't participate
9109000	9111000	here's you know what
9111000	9113000	I Jamie I'm a big fan
9113000	9115000	of giving people a taste of their own medicine
9115000	9117000	so here's what I think you should do let's
9117000	9119000	say let's say I'm a dude and I'm gonna tell you
9119000	9121000	hey Jamie
9121000	9123000	women don't belong in battlefield
9123000	9125000	this is what I think your response should be you ready
9125000	9127000	shut up and go make me a
9127000	9129000	sandwich all right so Jamie
9129000	9131000	a women shouldn't be in battlefield
9131000	9133000	shut up and go get me a pizza
9133000	9135000	I have standards
9135000	9137000	I think
9137000	9139000	you know what
9139000	9141000	I think you just you just give it
9141000	9143000	right back to them the same way
9143000	9145000	it's been you know
9145000	9147000	no I would literally be shut
9147000	9149000	up and go back to fucking school
9149000	9151000	and while you're there get a pizza
9151000	9153000	and while you're there bring me a bread tangle
9153000	9155000	of pizza
9155000	9157000	okay do we remember our strong bad
9157000	9159000	email teen girl squad
9159000	9161000	all right speaking of teen
9161000	9163000	girl squad Loki what's next in
9163000	9165000	the news Loki
9165000	9167000	is so and so this isn't
9167000	9169000	team girl squad but it's
9169000	9171000	team Sonic racing
9171000	9173000	so this was yet another game that was leaked by
9173000	9175000	Walmart and now confirmed by
9175000	9177000	Sega and they had a
9177000	9179000	teaser trailer that showed nothing except for
9179000	9181000	Sonic and
9181000	9183000	his
9183000	9185000	friends racing
9185000	9187000	so I guess we'll
9187000	9189000	look forward to that coming out makes
9189000	9191000	sense that they have Sonic and all-stars racing
9191000	9193000	transformed as your Xbox game of the month
9193000	9195000	so it does make sense
9195000	9197000	and actually that was a good racing game remember
9197000	9199000	that was the one with Danica Patrick as
9199000	9201000	one of the characters yes Sonic
9201000	9203000	and all his shitty friends and Danica
9203000	9205000	Patrick it's like and
9205000	9207000	and they also had was at the Sega
9207000	9209000	Outrun cabinet they
9209000	9211000	had like ooh la la they had a bunch of like
9211000	9213000	Sega characters that were really you know
9213000	9215000	infamous in there this is only Sonic team racing
9215000	9217000	because Sonic he has enough
9217000	9219000	shitty friends to make a whole racing team
9219000	9221000	yeah I really hope that even if it's like
9221000	9223000	team Sonic racing sure maybe
9223000	9225000	it starts with Sonic and his you know Knuckles
9225000	9227000	and all his shitty buddies can we have
9227000	9229000	can we make cannon like
9229000	9231000	you know how they have Sonic and
9231000	9233000	you know all that stuff
9233000	9235000	you know they don't have the Wario version
9235000	9237000	of Sonic can we have Sanic as
9237000	9239000	the Wario version of Sonic
9239000	9241000	Sanic and Danky King yeah
9241000	9243000	Sanic no why not why not
9243000	9245000	when
9245000	9247000	Court
9247000	9249000	Ann takes over
9249000	9251000	I mean Sonic is it's pretty
9251000	9253000	you know they're pretty meme-y
9253000	9255000	on their
9255000	9257000	their Twitter so I forgot about that
9257000	9259000	Bobby Blackwell says I recently replayed Sonic
9259000	9261000	and All-Stars Racing Transformed Wreck-It Ralph
9261000	9263000	was in there too I totally forgot
9263000	9265000	about that that is totally
9265000	9267000	true was yeah Wreck-It Ralph was like
9267000	9269000	one of the things you unlocked huh yeah
9269000	9271000	I remember that now so anyway

9331000	9333000	it's next door to E3 it's next door
9333000	9335000	to the fucking convention center
9335000	9337000	so like I mean I realize
9337000	9339000	the press conference is in a different theater
9339000	9341000	in a different part of LA but it's not that far
9341000	9343000	away I'm sorry but your press conference is in a different
9343000	9345000	theater good lord
9345000	9347000	so they have one literally next door
9347000	9349000	to E3 but they don't have one up here
9349000	9351000	in Northern California
9351000	9353000	I don't understand why it's so
9353000	9355000	limited maybe they're paying for the space
9355000	9357000	I don't know what it is well they have to pay for
9357000	9359000	the theaters I guess they're
9359000	9361000	renting all these theaters I thought they just did it through
9361000	9363000	Fathom Events or one of those things that kind of already
9363000	9365000	I don't know I mean what do you
9365000	9367000	really get from this stuff like a free like
9367000	9369000	Avatar or some bullshit
9369000	9371000	what are we really getting I mean
9371000	9373000	I don't know just watch it on
9373000	9375000	TV there's several people in chat suggesting
9375000	9377000	that they put it in VR Kajuda
9377000	9379000	saying they need to put the Sony press conference in
9379000	9381000	VR cheap asses and as
9381000	9383000	Matt says they should actually do it in VR
9383000	9385000	Bobby Blackwolf talking about his
9385000	9387000	new basement home theater says
9387000	9389000	curiously there's no listing for my home theater
9389000	9391000	for this experience well Bobby do you really
9391000	9393000	want to have like 30 strangers showing
9393000	9395000	up at your house so maybe it's best that
9395000	9397000	you have a private viewing for
9397000	9399000	you and the misses and maybe any buddies
9399000	9401000	that you invite over to watch it
9401000	9403000	in your 4K of vision
9403000	9405000	which can you watch the press conference I know you
9405000	9407000	can watch Microsoft's thing in 4K because
9407000	9409000	Mixer does 4K but does
9409000	9411000	Twitch I
9411000	9413000	think actually there's a Sony event
9413000	9415000	viewer they have that I would
9415000	9417000	assume that works and I don't know if that does
9417000	9419000	4K well I don't
9419000	9421000	know yeah
9421000	9423000	they're losers oh Bobby says I only have
9423000	9425000	six seats in the theater well you
9425000	9427000	could that's you the misses and
9427000	9429000	and two other couples grab some floor
9429000	9431000	yeah yeah get some some
9431000	9433000	pillows or something like that lawn chairs
9433000	9435000	anyway
9435000	9437000	I'll be watching it on
9437000	9439000	my couch that's how I'll be watching
9439000	9441000	actually I like to do ironic things
9441000	9443000	and what I mean by that is that I will watch
9443000	9445000	the Sony press conference on my
9445000	9447000	Xbox and then I'll watch
9447000	9449000	the Microsoft press conference on my PlayStation
9449000	9451000	4 and there's usually ways to do this
9451000	9453000	so actually
9453000	9455000	no I kind of lied because the Microsoft one I'll
9455000	9457000	probably watch on my computer
9457000	9459000	because on my 4K monitor I could actually
9459000	9461000	watch it in 4K so that with
9461000	9463000	Mixer so that would be kind of nice so
9463000	9465000	we'll see Bobby Blackwell
9465000	9467000	says Twitch can do 4K most
9467000	9469000	just don't which makes sense because like
9469000	9471000	I don't have the bandwidth to stream
9471000	9473000	4K but Sony probably has
9473000	9475000	the bandwidth to stream 4K so they
9475000	9477000	might do it we'll see you may have the bandwidth
9477000	9479000	but you don't have the bandwidth cap for that
9479000	9481000	uh the Skype line is open if you'd like
9481000	9483000	to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight
9483000	9485000	or maybe something else you can give us a call at
9485000	9487000	Orange Lounge Radio all one word on
9487000	9489000	Skype while we uh continue to
9489000	9491000	debate uh Twitch and 4K and all that stuff
9491000	9493000	I was gonna say you know that Twitch app
9493000	9495000	that's on the PlayStation 4 it would be really nice
9495000	9497000	if that would fucking come out for Xbox One already
9497000	9499000	cause that Twitch app is so
9499000	9501000	dated on Xbox One now
9501000	9503000	like and also like
9503000	9505000	when did they stop doing communities
9505000	9507000	highlights on Twitch
9507000	9509000	that's my favorite part of
9509000	9511000	using Twitch on my desktop
9511000	9513000	is that you can actually look at communities
9513000	9515000	so I can look at say the small
9515000	9517000	streamer community or the LGBT community
9517000	9519000	or Twitch unity which is a big thing
9519000	9521000	they were pushing why can't I get that
9521000	9523000	on the phone app or the
9523000	9525000	Xbox One app and I forgot to look and see if it's in
9525000	9527000	the PlayStation 4 app cause the PlayStation 4
9527000	9529000	is currently in my studio
9529000	9531000	so I can hopefully uh do um
9531000	9533000	more streaming from it at some point
9533000	9535000	yeah SJ100Matt says
9535000	9537000	oh god that Twitch app on Xbox One sucks
9537000	9539000	it used to be the best one
9539000	9541000	like when it was first out because it was the only
9541000	9543000	one that would let you force the
9543000	9545000	source formatting and
9545000	9547000	it's how you would ensure that you get a high definition
9547000	9549000	feed coming to your TV
9549000	9551000	so anyway Orange Lounge Radio all
9551000	9553000	one word on Skype yeah
9553000	9555000	Hulk I think you're onto something
9555000	9557000	Xbox only likes Mixer now they hate Twitch
9557000	9559000	no updates for Twitch on Xbox One
9559000	9561000	I think that might be partially true
9561000	9563000	I mean obviously Microsoft is going to prefer Mixer
9563000	9565000	but I think they would be dumb
9565000	9567000	to just ignore that
9567000	9569000	Twitch is a thing
9569000	9571000	it's not Microsoft that's doing those updates
9571000	9573000	so it's Twitch that's making the updates
9573000	9575000	alright well we're gonna take a call
9575000	9577000	hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
9577000	9579000	hey uh it's Ragingator
9579000	9581000	hey Ragingator what's on your mind tonight
9581000	9583000	um
9583000	9585000	actually
9585000	9587000	when Dark Soccer did
9587000	9589000	the Classic Game of the Week
9589000	9591000	that gave me an idea
9591000	9593000	for my
9593000	9595000	call tonight
9595000	9597000	well as she's saying
9597000	9599000	indirectly she
9599000	9601000	mentioned college and all that
9601000	9603000	and that got me thinking back
9603000	9605000	to my college
9605000	9607000	days
9607000	9609000	not to get into too much detail
9609000	9611000	cause you wouldn't make a whole lot of sense
9611000	9613000	unless you're local but
9613000	9615000	I went to Erie Community College
9615000	9617000	North Campus
9617000	9619000	and
9619000	9621000	it's one of those multi-building
9621000	9623000	campuses and in the
9623000	9625000	student center they had
9625000	9627000	what they called the Coffee House
9627000	9629000	I think
9629000	9631000	to give you a little bit of an
9631000	9633000	analogy think
9633000	9635000	if you ever saw 90210 back in the day
9635000	9637000	think the Peach Pit
9637000	9639000	yeah
9639000	9641000	it's kind of like that stuff
9641000	9643000	or the Max
9643000	9645000	from Saved by the Bell
9645000	9647000	yeah that too
9647000	9649000	but
9649000	9651000	they served food there
9651000	9653000	and they also
9653000	9655000	had like
9655000	9657000	one of those
9657000	9659000	low
9659000	9661000	I forget what it's called
9661000	9663000	the hockey games with the handles on it
9663000	9665000	you slide the players around
9665000	9667000	hockey
9667000	9669000	yeah so a lot of us had these types of things in our town
9669000	9671000	so what do you want to know about it
9671000	9673000	yeah well I was going to say
9673000	9675000	those of you
9675000	9677000	in the
9677000	9679000	studio
9679000	9681000	and anyone in chat
9681000	9683000	those of you that went to
9683000	9685000	college did your
9685000	9687000	campuses have arcade machines
9687000	9689000	on
9689000	9691000	campus and did you play
9691000	9693000	them and which games
9693000	9695000	did you play in particular
9695000	9697000	and enjoy there did you call us
9697000	9699000	campus have arcades
9699000	9701000	of some sort and what did you play there
9701000	9703000	Dar Sacra well I talked about the
9703000	9705000	one at Solomon's that was right across from the campus
9705000	9707000	so University of South Alabama
9707000	9709000	at the time didn't have it but
9709000	9711000	across I mean they had
9711000	9713000	Mortal Kombat 2 they had
9713000	9715000	another Mortal Kombat 2 that was one of the early betas
9715000	9717000	they had NBA Jam
9717000	9719000	they had a couple of pins like
9719000	9721000	some of those mid 90's ones
9721000	9723000	not Adams Family
9723000	9725000	they had
9725000	9727000	Beta Theater of Magic they had a few
9727000	9729000	of the other ones
9729000	9731000	they had
9731000	9733000	just a bunch of fighting games really
9735000	9737000	and then of course I worked at an arcade
9737000	9739000	but yeah my college campus didn't really
9739000	9741000	have anything like that and then out here
9741000	9743000	when I was going to school
9743000	9745000	there was a DDR machine at Sac State
9745000	9747000	not at Sac State but at
9747000	9749000	American
9749000	9751000	American River College oh right
9751000	9753000	yeah and that
9753000	9755000	got gotten rid of really quick
9755000	9757000	I've been to other colleges
9757000	9759000	oh no South Alabama the other
9759000	9761000	thing we had we had the little arcade in my game room
9761000	9763000	where I worked so we had the World Cup
9763000	9765000	Soccer Pinball we had
9765000	9767000	Killer Instinct I don't know
9767000	9769000	why I didn't think about it because I fucking worked there
9769000	9771000	maybe I was trying to put it out of my head we had a
9771000	9773000	Cyber Slide we had
9773000	9775000	Dark Salkers
9775000	9777000	we had King of Fighters 94
9777000	9779000	they switched out for 95 we
9779000	9781000	had
9781000	9783000	Street Fighter Alpha
9783000	9785000	we had
9785000	9787000	Fatal Fury Special
9787000	9789000	all kinds of stuff
9789000	9791000	you know sadly I went to school
9791000	9793000	a couple hours north of here in a town called
9793000	9795000	Chico which is a little bit north of the Sacramento
9795000	9797000	area and I went to college there
9797000	9799000	and I don't really remember
9799000	9801000	there being I don't there wasn't an arcade on
9801000	9803000	campus I would have known about that there was a student union
9803000	9805000	but I don't remember there being any like video games
9805000	9807000	there like that and to be
9807000	9809000	honest I don't even remember like maybe
9809000	9811000	some of the bars would have an incidental pinball
9811000	9813000	machine here and there but not a lot of arcade games
9813000	9815000	so I was kind of robbed of all that I
9815000	9817000	remember there was a place called
9817000	9819000	Ray's that was a video
9819000	9821000	store so to kind of date it a little
9821000	9823000	bit and they had an arcade that was the place
9823000	9825000	you would go to like play arcade games
9825000	9827000	and pinball stuff but it was on like the other side of town
9827000	9829000	so we rarely got to go over
9829000	9831000	there and there was also Chuck E. Cheese which we
9831000	9833000	would you know that was before the kids really
9833000	9835000	took it over and you could still find
9835000	9837000	like regular arcade games there
9837000	9839000	so we would go there sometimes
9839000	9841000	but that was really you know I wasn't as big
9841000	9843000	of a gamer in my college years
9843000	9845000	because there was a lot of other stuff I was going through
9845000	9847000	but I also remember that
9847000	9849000	like in the dorms
9849000	9851000	the fact that I had a Super Nintendo
9851000	9853000	and Mario Kart was a huge deal
9853000	9855000	like the dudes were coming over to play Mario Kart
9855000	9857000	like all the time and so that was like
9857000	9859000	a big deal and then the guys upstairs
9859000	9861000	got a Nintendo 64
9861000	9863000	and you can imagine how that went then they got
9863000	9865000	Mario Kart and it was just like non-stop
9865000	9867000	you know and then myself
9867000	9869000	and my best friend in the dorms who lived
9869000	9871000	next door to me he was in the room next door
9871000	9873000	we would do dial-up
9873000	9875000	Duke and Nukem 3D matches
9875000	9877000	and the other guys would get into it like they would
9877000	9879000	they would walk over and see where I'm at
9879000	9881000	and then they'd go run over to his room and say okay
9881000	9883000	Rob's over in this part waiting for you or whatever
9883000	9885000	and they would do the same thing like they would like try to
9885000	9887000	try to ruin it all the time but we had a good time
9887000	9889000	doing that so that was that was fun
9889000	9891000	so that was what I remember with gaming in college
9891000	9893000	but I do remember also
9893000	9895000	before I went off to Chico
9895000	9897000	I did a few things at the community college
9897000	9899000	like one summer I think I did like a summer program
9899000	9901000	during my junior year or something like that
9901000	9903000	and I do remember that the
9903000	9905000	cafeteria there had a very small arcade
9905000	9907000	and the one that I would always play
9907000	9909000	Altered Beast
9909000	9911000	was the game that I loved to play
9911000	9913000	Rise from the Oak Wave
9913000	9915000	it totally looked like garbage
9915000	9917000	on the Genesis compared to the arcade version
9917000	9919000	but luckily you can play that arcade version now
9919000	9921000	on that Playstation 3 collection they did
9921000	9923000	yeah anyway
9923000	9925000	Loki I don't know
9925000	9927000	did you do any like
9927000	9929000	arcade gaming in college around your community
9929000	9931000	no
9931000	9933000	no not really I mean
9933000	9935000	no
9935000	9937000	I did a lot of arcade gaming when I was younger
9937000	9939000	yeah
9939000	9941000	we'd go to different arcades to play different games
9941000	9943000	cause we'd get to have like the
9943000	9945000	7-11 would have the Street Fighter
9945000	9947000	Street Fighter 2
9947000	9949000	and then there was a diner that had
9949000	9951000	Captain Commando and then there was a
9951000	9953000	Rico's Pizza that had a bunch of other games
9953000	9955000	oh yeah Rico's had
9955000	9957000	and there was a local movie theater that had
9957000	9959000	some more games so we just like kind of
9959000	9961000	ride between those and stuff and play different games
9961000	9963000	we spent a lot of money playing Captain Commando
9963000	9965000	a lot
9965000	9967000	but not so much when I was in college
9967000	9969000	cause college is, that was like
9969000	9971000	Golf Land
9971000	9973000	time oh that was right when we
9973000	9975000	we all kind of first met
9975000	9977000	that's true
9977000	9979000	there was many arcades
9979000	9981000	I just
9981000	9983000	got a quick question
9983000	9985000	now since I'm not
9985000	9987000	from California
9987000	9989000	is it safe to say that Golf Land is
9989000	9991000	basically your areas equivalent
9991000	9993000	to like Putt Putt Golf
9993000	9995000	or am I way off
9995000	9997000	I don't know Putt Putt Golf but I assume
9997000	9999000	you do yeah it's the same thing
9999000	10001000	I grew up in Alabama
10001000	10003000	so we had Putt Putt
10003000	10005000	with the big arcade in there you know we also had
10005000	10007000	a place called Mount Asia
10007000	10009000	that was actually like a multi level
10009000	10011000	Putt Putt
10011000	10013000	plus arcade
10013000	10015000	I mean that was where I played, what was that?
10015000	10017000	Trog
10017000	10019000	oh fuck yeah I do remember Trog
10019000	10021000	and then of course
10021000	10023000	here Dan would tell me about
10023000	10025000	the mine shaft all the time
10025000	10027000	I fucking love the mine shaft that place is the bomb
10027000	10029000	we drove by there on the way out today
10029000	10031000	it's like an abandoned RV place
10031000	10033000	but all the little buildings
10033000	10035000	and stuff and the underground is still there
10035000	10037000	all the structure is still there if somebody wanted to
10037000	10039000	buy it and turn it into a mini golf place again
10039000	10041000	I always refer to the movie
10041000	10043000	The Karate Kid I don't know if you've seen it
10043000	10045000	but there's a scene in the movie when they go on a date
10045000	10047000	and they go to like this big mini
10047000	10049000	golf place and there's arcade machines and stuff
10049000	10051000	and like I remember they're playing the
10051000	10053000	skeet shooting game and he jumps out like don't shoot
10053000	10055000	and she shoots him you know and all that stuff
10055000	10057000	so I figure like every
10057000	10059000	big city has a place like that
10059000	10061000	and so that's golf land for us
10061000	10063000	and what I'm assuming is putt putt golf for you guys
10063000	10065000	and all that stuff so
10065000	10067000	alright
10067000	10069000	well Rachael I'm gonna let you go see if we get any more calls
10069000	10071000	but thanks for the call buddy
10071000	10073000	bye bye you too
10073000	10075000	Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype
10075000	10077000	I'll keep it open just a couple more minutes but not too much
10077000	10079000	longer since we are past nine o'clock
10079000	10081000	and I do want to get to a live
10081000	10083000	stream here in a little bit without keeping
10083000	10085000	Bobby up too late he's a night owl
10085000	10087000	anyway but still do you have any
10087000	10089000	last minute stories you want to get to yes I do have
10089000	10091000	one well we see if any calls come in yeah so
10091000	10093000	guitar hero live the GHT
10093000	10095000	service is closing down in
10095000	10097000	December wow
10097000	10099000	okay that is December 1st
10099000	10101000	it'll be shutting down did this just come in
10101000	10103000	well uh yeah it was pretty
10103000	10105000	pretty decent so yeah
10105000	10107000	so the ability to purchase more hero coins
10107000	10109000	um ended a few days
10109000	10111000	I guess on June 1st
10111000	10113000	and it says the
10113000	10115000	iOS version of live
10115000	10117000	uh which is gone from the app store now
10117000	10119000	and they you know players will no
10119000	10121000	longer be able to use their banked hero cash
10121000	10123000	and extra items until or they'll be able to use
10123000	10125000	those until the service shuts down
10125000	10127000	so that's one thing you have to remember with all these
10127000	10129000	games that pushed them you know as being
10129000	10131000	live services like Call of Duty
10131000	10133000	Black Ops 3 or
10133000	10135000	4 you know
10135000	10137000	they eventually shut these live services
10137000	10139000	down when they become not popular anymore
10139000	10141000	that's true I kind of forgot
10141000	10143000	that that was a thing to be honest until you
10143000	10145000	said it shutting down I was like I've seen these
10145000	10147000	like they have guitar hero live
10147000	10149000	like you can get them for like 10
10149000	10151000	15 dollars now like the
10151000	10153000	stores but the ones I've seen have been like for
10153000	10155000	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and I'm like
10155000	10157000	I don't really want to buy and that's the version
10157000	10159000	with the guitar too by the way
10159000	10161000	yeah all right
10161000	10163000	well I don't see any other calls
10163000	10165000	coming in so I think we are going to go ahead and
10165000	10167000	wrap up for the night so I
10167000	10169000	am going to start to go around and get everybody's
10169000	10171000	final thoughts and
10171000	10173000	thank everybody for being here tonight
10173000	10175000	as I always say at the end of every show
10175000	10177000	if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio
10177000	10179000	be sure to tell a friend or two about
10179000	10181000	the show help us spread the word because
10181000	10183000	we are the show where every gamer has a voice
10183000	10185000	but if the voices aren't here
10185000	10187000	to air then we can't
10187000	10189000	air them so again
10189000	10191000	a nice 5 star review on a site like iTunes
10191000	10193000	also goes an awful long way so if you just let us know
10193000	10195000	like where you heard this podcast from or whatever
10195000	10197000	then you know
10197000	10199000	help us out
10199000	10201000	leave a nice review
10201000	10203000	so I would thank Jason
10203000	10205000	for being here tonight but
10205000	10207000	he fell asleep and I tried
10207000	10209000	to tap him to wake him up he's not responding
10209000	10211000	so he's breathing so don't worry he's fine
10211000	10213000	I hear tiny little snoring
10213000	10215000	so I know he's okay but
10215000	10217000	got a feather? well keep in mind here's
10217000	10219000	the thing he was on the road
10219000	10221000	and he told me he's like I think
10221000	10223000	in the past 48 hours I've slept for like 5
10223000	10225000	so I'm not going to give him too
10225000	10227000	hard of a time or make fun of
10227000	10229000	the fact that our show is that boring
10229000	10231000	yeah I think he's just
10231000	10233000	I don't want his computer to fall either so if he stays
10233000	10235000	asleep I'll close that for him
10235000	10237000	but I will go ahead and thank
10237000	10239000	him for being here anyway even though he
10239000	10241000	fell asleep I tried to
10241000	10243000	wake him up
10243000	10245000	so I'll go around and give everybody else a final thought
10245000	10247000	DarkSocras do you have the mic? do you have a final thought tonight?
10249000	10251000	people need to not voice
10251000	10253000	their opinions when no one has
10253000	10255000	asked them for it like the guy
10255000	10257000	who looked completely homeless
10257000	10259000	living in his truck who said
10259000	10261000	that he thought that my fiat was garbage
10261000	10263000	I told him
10263000	10265000	well at least it serves a purpose unlike you
10267000	10269000	alright ouch
10269000	10271000	my final thought is
10271000	10273000	I
10273000	10275000	I'm going to miss my short
10275000	10277000	work week this week
10277000	10279000	with my 4 day work week was awesome
10279000	10281000	but it's back to 5 days I have a very busy work week
10281000	10283000	next week but
10283000	10285000	Pride will be next weekend it looks like I'll probably
10285000	10287000	end up going to that and then Chicago is just 3 weeks away
10287000	10289000	I'm excited for June
10289000	10291000	it'll be fun last but not least Loki your
10291000	10293000	final thought tonight my final
10293000	10295000	thought is I would like to work
10295000	10297000	on games some more
10297000	10299000	like actually working against
10299000	10301000	I'm trying to get an office
10301000	10303000	like a desk because it's hard to
10303000	10305000	work on a laptop just one screen
10305000	10307000	I need like 3 screens or 4 screens
10307000	10309000	probably 3 screens
10309000	10311000	trying to get a desk set up with 2 24 inch monitors
10311000	10313000	on there as well so
10313000	10315000	it'll help with coding and everything
10315000	10317000	alright well that's going to do it
