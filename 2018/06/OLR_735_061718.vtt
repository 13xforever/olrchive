00:00.000 --> 00:16.960
This week, spice your morning bread up with the Sonic the Hedgehog imprint for the low

00:16.960 --> 00:21.800
cost of 35 rings, and yes dear listeners, that is an accurate statement, $35 coin rings.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.520
This is just one consumerism-tastic story, happy 16th anniversary to the show where every

00:25.520 --> 00:32.520
gamer has a voice.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.160
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:36.160 --> 00:38.220
where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.220 --> 00:44.800
It's Orange Lounge Radio with this, episode number 735 for this June the 17th of 2018.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.960
I'm laughing because I usually listen to Jason's intro, but I didn't listen to the whole thing,

00:48.960 --> 00:51.760
so I didn't catch that Gotta Toast Fast till just now.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.720
Anyway, we're full of surprises tonight, on our 16th anniversary show, my name Rob Roberts

00:56.720 --> 01:01.120
here in studio with you, based out of lovely Sacramento, California, and by my side, as

01:01.120 --> 01:07.680
she has been for the last 16 years, we kind of made a child together in a non-awkward

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
way.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
It's DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.120
I feel very awkward actually.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.120
How are you?

01:13.120 --> 01:15.600
A little tired because of the food-stravaganza today.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.560
Well, I was going to say, something that's less awkward than having a baby together is

01:20.560 --> 01:25.480
the fact that we had brunch together, and the fact that I literally had cake for breakfast

01:25.480 --> 01:26.480
at this place.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.480
You did.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.480
It was pretty amazing.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.960
We went to this trendy place downtown, this new place called Punch Bowl Social, which

01:32.960 --> 01:34.400
I have no idea where that name comes from.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.120
Well, I keep wanting to say Punch Drunk Social because of that movie, but it's Punch Bowl

01:38.120 --> 01:41.280
Social, and I guess they have these in other towns, but Sacramento has one now, and it's

01:41.280 --> 01:43.200
kind of like Dave & Buster's.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.200
But not as cool.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
But not yet.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
Well, because the arcade isn't nearly as big.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.920
The bowling alley in the middle of the thing is way too loud.

01:47.920 --> 01:48.920
Yeah.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.000
The bowling alley, they have all these other weird shuffleboard, like, ew, come on down

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
to play shuffleboard.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Like, who plays shuffleboard?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Who knows?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
But anyway, so we went there.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
It's from another time, Rob.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.120
But I had this, it was called Monkey Bread French Toast.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.560
It looked like a big slice of cake.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.760
It was a big slice of cake, and I was like, it was amazing, though.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
Don't get me wrong.

02:04.760 --> 02:05.760
It was pretty good.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.520
On the outside, it was kind of crunchy-ish, and then the inside was bread pudding, really

02:09.520 --> 02:15.800
nice soft bread pudding, which Rob was kind enough to let me sample both parts, the outside

02:15.800 --> 02:21.080
and a little bite on the end, but I just had an impossible burger that I ate a third

02:21.080 --> 02:22.080
of.

02:22.080 --> 02:25.120
It wouldn't be an episode of OLR if we didn't deviate to talk about food, right?

02:25.120 --> 02:26.120
Because food is amazing.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.960
And then we went to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Company, but we were like, oh, oh, oh, chocolate.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.760
That's the best time to go shopping for candy, is when you're already full.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.720
Although I did buy candy somewhere else.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.360
I know, I know.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.360
Candy is irresistible.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.360
What can we do?

02:40.360 --> 02:44.920
Anyway, let's move on and talk over to Techmaster Loki.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.040
Hi, Loki.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
How are you?

02:47.040 --> 02:48.040
Doing good.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.040
Good.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.040
What's on your mind?

02:50.040 --> 02:51.040
Not much.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
My mouth's on fire.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
Yeah, because you're also eating all this food talk.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.040
Salsa.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
Yes.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.040
Yes.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.040
Happy 16th.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.040
You also, I mean, I don't know how you parent with three parents.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.720
Well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't say that.

02:59.720 --> 03:04.000
That's totally, in 2018, you have all sorts of different households, and some households

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
have three parents, but this is a three-parent household with OLR.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.260
So I mean, this show existed long before your kids were born, your actual kids.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.260
So kind of crazy.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.260
It's true.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.260
Yeah.

03:16.260 --> 03:17.260
But OLR is your favorite child, right?

03:17.260 --> 03:18.260
Yes.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.260
Yes.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.260
Okay.

03:20.260 --> 03:21.260
Just getting that clear.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.260
Just getting that clear.

03:22.260 --> 03:23.980
And of course, we wouldn't be able to do it without you guys in our chat room over at

03:23.980 --> 03:30.220
live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network, as seen on Variety

03:30.220 --> 03:31.220
this week.

03:31.220 --> 03:34.260
I don't know if y'all heard about the Bobby Black Wolf doing the Billy Mitchell panel

03:34.260 --> 03:36.980
thing, but that was covered by Variety this week.

03:36.980 --> 03:37.980
So check that out.

03:37.980 --> 03:41.700
So hello to anybody who may have heard of VOG thanks to Variety and the involvement

03:41.700 --> 03:42.700
with that.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.700
All zero of you.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.180
You never know.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.180
You never know.

03:46.180 --> 03:49.340
Anyway, we do tape live, of course, at the Voice of Geeks Network every Sunday night

03:49.340 --> 03:53.820
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after world famous moderator, Bobby

03:53.820 --> 03:56.500
Black Wolf and his show, The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

03:56.500 --> 04:02.160
As we, I mean, God, we, Bobby and our show have gone together, not all 16 years, but

04:02.160 --> 04:04.940
at least, at least 10.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.200
Probably I don't remember the actual date.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.100
Bobby probably remembers it better than I do, but let's see.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.340
Live 365 as a network was about three years.

04:12.380 --> 04:17.500
And then I think maybe four years we were on all games, but we were syndicated on all

04:17.500 --> 04:19.140
games before our show moved there.

04:19.140 --> 04:20.140
He said 2006.

04:20.140 --> 04:21.140
It was 2006.

04:21.140 --> 04:22.140
So it was 12 years.

04:22.140 --> 04:23.140
All right.

04:23.140 --> 04:24.140
It was when we joined.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.140
So it was 12 years.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.140
I knew he'd know.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.380
For me, you get to a certain point where everything just kind of blends together.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.380
That's for sure.

04:29.380 --> 04:33.440
Well, also joining us in studio tonight, we have a special guest and somebody who's been

04:33.440 --> 04:38.980
here since really the very beginning and was with us those nights at Roseville Golf Land

04:38.980 --> 04:39.980
playing DDR.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.020
And here he is 16 years later.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.740
Say hello, everybody, to Bradley or Arcadian42.

04:44.740 --> 04:45.740
Hello.

04:45.740 --> 04:46.740
Happy anniversary.

04:46.740 --> 04:47.740
Thank you.

04:47.740 --> 04:52.120
I know I broke tradition a little bit by not playing that Para Para song at the beginning,

04:52.120 --> 04:54.700
but I couldn't because, you know, anniversary from Para Para.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.280
Usually we have to open up the show with that.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.700
There's only so many years you can do that.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.700
There's only so many years I can tolerate that song.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.380
No, maybe I'll do it on break, but I wanted to mix it up a little bit for those that are

05:03.380 --> 05:05.380
on the podcast feed.

05:05.380 --> 05:11.020
I did Shut Up and Drive by Rihanna, which we usually don't play like, you know, major

05:11.020 --> 05:12.740
label music before the show.

05:12.740 --> 05:13.740
But it's our birthday.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.380
We're gonna do something different.

05:15.380 --> 05:19.100
And as Jamie pointed out, that song was the big Wreck-It Ralph song.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.980
Remember, they had the was it Wreck-It Ralph 2?

05:20.980 --> 05:21.980
No, it was the first one.

05:21.980 --> 05:22.980
Yeah.

05:22.980 --> 05:23.980
We're going on the track.

05:23.980 --> 05:26.060
I was throwing up the peace sign.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.260
Oh, I thought you were saying Wreck-It Ralph 2.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.380
When you said my name, I was like, yo, V.

05:31.380 --> 05:34.500
I thought you were saying Wreck-It Ralph 2.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.100
And I was like, no, it was the first one, silly.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.600
Anyway, it's not about you.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.600
It's about Arcadian42.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.920
But he's used to these tangents by now.

05:42.920 --> 05:43.920
How have you been, my friend?

05:43.920 --> 05:44.920
I've been OK.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.920
Yeah?

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
Do you still play music games anymore?

05:46.920 --> 05:47.920
Sometimes.

05:47.920 --> 05:48.920
Yeah?

05:48.920 --> 05:50.920
What kind of music games do you still kind of get?

05:50.920 --> 05:51.920
I rez sometimes.

05:51.920 --> 05:52.920
It's been a while.

05:52.920 --> 05:53.920
I rez like that.

05:53.920 --> 05:54.920
Yeah.

05:54.920 --> 05:55.920
Last one.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.960
And it's been a while, like four years since I played like any rock band.

05:59.960 --> 06:05.880
Like probably the last thing, the actual music game would have been like retrograde, which

06:05.880 --> 06:07.360
you can use a guitar with.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.080
Oh, right, right.

06:10.080 --> 06:17.280
And I was going to say, with the whole rock band, I feel like with four, you know, they

06:17.280 --> 06:21.200
kind of recovered when they did the behind the music parody thing a year later.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.440
But it feels like a lot less people were really into that.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.600
And sadly, I really think those plastic guitar games are kind of dead now.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.040
I feel like music games now are showing up in VR.

06:31.040 --> 06:37.360
You know, when we were at this restaurant, I was mentioning earlier, they do VR, too.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.260
You can like rent a VR station for 30 minutes or an hour.

06:40.260 --> 06:44.920
So we were walking by and somebody was playing Audio Shield, which I was like, oh, I've played

06:44.920 --> 06:45.920
that.

06:45.920 --> 06:46.920
Bobby Block will show me that.

06:46.920 --> 06:47.920
I know that game.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.600
Like, I don't remember a lot, but I remember that game.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.880
And then so that game is really popular on VR, I think.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.880
And then Beat Saber.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.880
I don't know if you've seen that one.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.160
That one's incredible.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.320
And that's all today.

06:57.320 --> 07:01.320
But yeah, I haven't done it in the last actually the last game I played that was a music game

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
was Dumper.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.320
Oh, yeah.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
Like six months ago, though.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.880
That's a really good time.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.880
It's really hard, though.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.880
It is.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.520
I have a hard time getting past like the second world.

07:10.520 --> 07:14.920
It's really the turns, because those timing on the turns are really hard.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.240
And some of the other stuff is kind of weird, too.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.200
You don't have a lot of reaction time in those games.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.480
That's for sure.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.780
And another newer music game that we've been talking about here on the show, you might

07:24.780 --> 07:26.280
be into this, the Just Shapes and Beats.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.280
I don't know if you've seen that.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.580
It's kind of like Bullet Hell meets music game.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.580
It's pretty cool.

07:31.580 --> 07:34.360
Check that out if you get a chance at some point.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.540
I don't know if you've been watching the E3 stuff, but since you liked Rez, did you

07:37.540 --> 07:39.360
see the Tetris Effect?

07:39.360 --> 07:43.080
I saw the trailer.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.000
I have not watched zero E3 stuff.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.080
I watched the Game Boy for it.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.080
They said that's the first song in the game in the trailer.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.080
Oh, the one that's in the trailer?

07:50.080 --> 07:51.080
Yeah.

07:51.080 --> 07:55.000
Well, it's probably the big signature song, just like, you know, the original Luminous

07:55.000 --> 07:58.780
game, which that is another music game that's coming back because the remaster comes out

07:58.780 --> 08:00.920
like in two weeks comes out on my birthday.

08:00.920 --> 08:05.440
So but like, you know, Shinin was the big song from Luminous.

08:05.440 --> 08:12.720
I think everybody knows that first stage in Rez, you know, what's the name of the Mexican

08:12.720 --> 08:13.720
Flyer?

08:13.720 --> 08:14.720
Is that the name of it?

08:14.720 --> 08:15.720
From Space Channel 5?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.760
Yeah, but it was older than Space Channel 5, of course.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.760
I know, but that...

08:18.760 --> 08:19.760
Mexican Flyer, yeah.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.760
Right.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.500
But that's, you can't think of Space Channel 5 and not think of that song.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.720
So I think this is like, I think this is kind of like a trade of Mizuguchi's.

08:26.720 --> 08:31.120
He tends to kind of put these big songs as the first stage in a lot of his stuff.

08:31.120 --> 08:35.160
And so we're going to have that song that was in the trailer, the little trance vocal

08:35.160 --> 08:37.860
thing, will be the first song in Tetris Effect.

08:37.860 --> 08:39.960
So yeah, but the trailer was really cool.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
Yeah.

08:40.960 --> 08:45.320
I remember like one person I saw on the forums saying it was like the most pretentious trailer

08:45.320 --> 08:46.320
that they've ever seen.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.320
Really?

08:47.320 --> 08:48.320
I don't know about that.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.480
It was just, when I watched it, I made it maybe laugh a bunch.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.560
Then I must be pretentious because I ate that trailer up.

08:55.560 --> 08:56.920
That's just a matter of fact, for sure.

08:56.920 --> 08:57.920
It's pretty cool though.

08:57.920 --> 08:58.920
All right.

08:58.920 --> 08:59.920
Anyway, let's see.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.420
Rama's pointing out that more music games are coming to mobile phones.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.420
That's true.

09:03.420 --> 09:04.420
You had a decent selection of mobile phones.

09:04.420 --> 09:07.860
I like Neon FM and the whole like the synergy between the arcade and the mobile version

09:07.860 --> 09:08.860
of that.

09:08.860 --> 09:09.860
It's pretty fun.

09:09.860 --> 09:11.360
What was I going to ask?

09:11.360 --> 09:15.260
Oh, you said, Bradley, you're not really watching a whole lot of the E3 stuff.

09:15.260 --> 09:18.920
I assume that's because you tend to play more like classic games, pinball.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.880
Do you get excited about any of the new stuff anymore?

09:20.880 --> 09:23.000
It's just, I don't have any of the new consoles.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.520
Last console was Xbox 360.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.680
I haven't gotten the PS4 or the Switch or the X-Tone.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.120
Have you thought about investing in one of them?

09:31.120 --> 09:32.120
I might get a Switch.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.600
It's just, I might want to play the Zelda, but there's like a bunch of Zeldas I haven't

09:37.600 --> 09:38.600
played.

09:38.600 --> 09:39.600
Gotcha.

09:39.600 --> 09:43.280
I haven't played like a, whatever, I can't remember the name.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.920
Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess and the Wii ones.

09:45.920 --> 09:46.920
I haven't played those.

09:46.920 --> 09:52.240
I haven't even played the Moon one, whatever that one is, the 3A one.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.280
Oh God, Majora's Mask?

09:53.280 --> 09:54.280
Going that far back?

09:54.280 --> 09:55.280
Yeah.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.280
That's okay.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.280
You know what?

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
I barely touched Majora's Mask either.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.000
You don't need to know the old Zelda games because they're all in different timelines

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
anyway.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Pretty much.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Just jump into the new one.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.760
The new one's kind of, the new one doesn't really play like the old ones either.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.280
That's another important thing about it.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.720
The new one was very much influenced by open world things like Skyrim.

10:11.720 --> 10:17.560
No, it doesn't play like Skyrim, but I think they kind of took that like hint of just instead

10:17.560 --> 10:21.240
of like in the old school Zeldas, it was like, you have to go to level one and level two

10:21.240 --> 10:22.240
and level three.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.680
But then they kind of saw that like in speed running and so forth, people really like to

10:25.680 --> 10:27.240
break that pattern.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.660
People like to run through the game without a sword.

10:29.660 --> 10:31.120
People like to do all these crazy things to it.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.520
So I think Nintendo sort of, and the developers of that game sort of thought, what if the

10:34.520 --> 10:36.840
game was just about do what you want?

10:36.840 --> 10:40.300
You know, like maybe you don't have to get handheld to all these different things.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.300
It's very open.

10:41.300 --> 10:44.400
And in a way it's kind of jarring at first because you're like, where's my hand holding?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.880
And the game kind of doesn't really give you much.

10:47.720 --> 10:51.680
And not to be too spoilery, but it's been out for a year now.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.260
The game starts you off in this little like area and I say little, but it feels really

10:56.260 --> 10:57.260
big.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.960
And so you go through like the tutorial in this area and you go to these different dungeons

10:59.960 --> 11:02.280
and you're like, wow, this is a really like big area and so forth.

11:02.280 --> 11:08.440
And then you find out you're on one tiny little like island in like this gigantic fucking

11:08.440 --> 11:09.440
world map.

11:09.440 --> 11:15.120
And it's like the world opens up and you're like, oh, this world is like really big.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.560
So it's kind of neat the way they do it.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.560
I really liked it.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.560
Yeah.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.560
Of course.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.560
The big thing is just backlog.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.560
I have so many games.

11:21.560 --> 11:22.560
I never played like everything.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.680
Everyone else, millions of steam games and yeah.

11:24.680 --> 11:29.920
And she said like half of the games that are on my 3ds I haven't played yet.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.380
So Bobby Blackwell is asking, what does he play today?

11:32.380 --> 11:35.120
But I think, I think there's a lot of gamers like you out there.

11:35.120 --> 11:39.440
Not everybody necessarily has that financial luxury or whatever the reason is to just jump

11:39.440 --> 11:43.520
into the new generation until you know, a long time after the consoles have been out

11:43.520 --> 11:44.800
and they come down to like $200.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.000
I think there's a lot of gamers in your position.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.040
So what, what do you play right now?

11:49.040 --> 11:50.040
Okay.

11:50.040 --> 11:55.360
Right now I play mostly stuff on steam and 3ds generally.

11:55.360 --> 11:59.920
The games I'm playing now are, so you're the reason they won't kill off the 3ds.

11:59.920 --> 12:05.120
Maybe when I'm playing 3ds is I play like the Pokemon shuffle.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.920
I play that game all the time for no good reason.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.720
It's a time killer.

12:09.720 --> 12:10.720
Yeah.

12:10.800 --> 12:14.600
The big one I've been playing the last two, by about two months is a game called Slay

12:14.600 --> 12:17.920
the Spire, which is on the, it's on steam.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.880
It's, it's still in early access, but it's pretty much complete.

12:20.880 --> 12:25.760
They're just kind of tweaking various aspects of the actual, like maybe the card cause it's

12:25.760 --> 12:34.040
a rogue-like deck builder game and you basically, you fight a group of enemies on each level

12:34.040 --> 12:38.080
and at the end of the level you get like an, you can get another card or you might get

12:38.080 --> 12:43.040
some, some other benefit and then you pick and choose kind of which way you go and you

12:43.040 --> 12:49.120
kind of try to build towards beating the bosses because there's like three sort of like statements,

12:49.120 --> 12:53.840
three, three areas and there's a boss at the end of it and you kind of, kind of got to

12:53.840 --> 12:58.560
build your deck so that you can actually win and not, and not, and not die of course.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.600
And there's, you have to kind of make different risks and rewards too.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.440
So it's like one of those like PvE, like, like I've played, I played a tabletop game

13:05.440 --> 13:06.800
like that was Sentinels of the Multiverse.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.800
Is that the name of it?

13:08.120 --> 13:11.720
But there's like, there's a, there's a card game where you actually like, you play with

13:11.720 --> 13:14.200
other people and you're actually, you're not fighting each other.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.440
You're fighting like a different card boss in the middle that you're all kind of ganging

13:18.440 --> 13:18.840
up on.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.440
And it's like a deck building type of game.

13:20.440 --> 13:20.600
Yeah.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.360
Well, this is just a single player, but okay.

13:23.000 --> 13:23.560
But I get it.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.280
I get it.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.160
All right, cool.

13:25.160 --> 13:25.480
Yeah.

13:25.480 --> 13:25.800
All right.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.440
It's pretty fun.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.480
As far as other stuff, we'll wait till our gaming weeks to get into other stuff, but

13:29.480 --> 13:34.360
I do want to talk about other E3 going on because, you know, not only is it our 16th birthday

13:34.360 --> 13:38.120
tonight, which by the way, I do need to, you know, even though we kind of stopped doing

13:38.120 --> 13:42.760
big things for anniversary shows a long time ago, I do just want to say, you know, a big

13:42.760 --> 13:45.400
thank you to everybody who's stuck with us.

13:45.400 --> 13:50.040
You know, whether it be for 16 years, Bradley, or whether it be for 16 minutes, you know,

13:50.040 --> 13:53.000
just a big thanks for the support that you guys give to OLR.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.080
I know we're not the biggest gaming podcast out there by far by a lot.

13:57.080 --> 13:57.960
We're not the biggest.

13:57.960 --> 13:58.760
We're the best.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.320
We're just the best.

13:59.320 --> 14:04.520
No, we're best in the way that we can be best.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.240
Just like other shows are the best in the way that they can be best.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.120
We're 16.

14:08.120 --> 14:12.200
We are teenagers with emotional issues and overconfidence.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.560
Nothing can defeat us.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.240
So you're being a stupid spoiled brat.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.440
We're Wolverine.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.720
We're the best we are at what we do.

14:21.400 --> 14:27.480
Well, I try to still be humble whether I'm in my crazy 16 teenage years or not.

14:28.280 --> 14:32.120
But, you know, we obviously wouldn't be here if you guys didn't give us the motivation

14:32.120 --> 14:35.480
to be here by showing up, you know, and the fact that we weren't bored.

14:35.480 --> 14:39.080
Whether you're not whether you're showing up in chat live on Sunday night or you're

14:39.080 --> 14:44.760
showing up on the podcast feed and tweeting at us or I actually made a Facebook post today.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.360
I'm trying because the last time I made a Facebook post, I did a Facebook post with

14:48.360 --> 14:52.680
a bonus episode and somebody was like, oh, you're back on Facebook.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.040
You remembered Facebook.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.880
And I like, all right, guilt me.

14:55.880 --> 14:56.760
Why don't you?

14:56.760 --> 14:59.160
So I was like, all right, I need to remember that Facebook is the thing.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.400
I think Google Plus, I can let that go.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.120
But Facebook, I got to I got to try and interact with that more.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.160
So I made a Facebook post today and you guys left some really sweet comments.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.360
And they were like names I don't see in the email bag or in chat and stuff.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.880
So I was like, oh, shit, there's more people out there than I realize sometimes.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.000
So thank you so much.

15:15.720 --> 15:20.520
I actually forgot to put the thing on my on my personal quote fan page.

15:21.240 --> 15:26.120
But I while I may make the joke, yeah, we do this because we're bored.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.520
But in a nutshell, I wouldn't know what to do with my Sunday.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.520
I rearrange my work schedule when I can for you guys.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.440
I miss out on sleep for you guys.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.640
I mean, not that it's a major thing.

15:39.640 --> 15:40.280
I would do it.

15:40.280 --> 15:46.600
But I was posting that there's two things, two activities that I do that give me life.

15:46.600 --> 15:51.400
And I'm meaning this in the not in the give me life kind of way, but in the squad,

15:51.400 --> 15:56.360
but in the way that makes me feel like parts of my life are great.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.200
And that's what I should be doing.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.880
And number one is the show.

15:59.880 --> 16:03.800
Number two is being a novice sister of perpetual indulgence.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.840
So those are two big things.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.960
One of them is the what we do for you guys on the show.

16:09.960 --> 16:14.920
And the other one is what I do for the LGBTQ, et cetera, community.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.520
So those are two big things to me.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.560
And if I wasn't doing this, I would feel like part of my heart was missing.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.040
So now you made me all sappy.

16:22.840 --> 16:23.960
I almost want to hug you.

16:23.960 --> 16:24.460
Almost.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.160
I will after the show.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.720
No, I when you say like, what else would I do with Sunday night?

16:31.720 --> 16:32.520
Like, that's totally how I feel.

16:32.520 --> 16:35.560
Like, we're not going to be here next week because I'm going to be on vacation.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.720
OK, that's the best present we can give ourselves for being on the air a year is to take a week off.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.960
That and I make Rob bring me stuff.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.160
But I'm going to Chicago to hang with some friends I have out there.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.840
And as you all I've said on the show before, I'm turning 40 this month.

16:48.840 --> 16:52.360
So it's kind of like and my husband is turning 40 like two weeks after I do.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.520
So this is kind of like our big birthday trip, too.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.240
So I'm heading Rob on the head from a distance.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.760
This is one of those things where it's like, well, I know I'm fine with turning 40.

17:00.760 --> 17:01.320
I really am.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.840
Like, I know there's so many people out there that like, wow, 40 is like old.

17:04.840 --> 17:07.640
But like, honestly, my 30s were better than my 20s.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.480
Why won't my 40s be even better than my 30s?

17:09.480 --> 17:10.040
That's my outlook.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.680
Well, this is the thing, too, is that people say, oh, you don't look 40.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.360
What is 40 fucking look like?

17:14.920 --> 17:17.640
Am I supposed to be like middle aged man from Saturday Night Live?

17:18.280 --> 17:22.280
No, you're not going to have a bad comb over and wear, you know,

17:22.840 --> 17:25.320
polo shirts with your pants pulled up to your boot.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.080
I might, though, you know.

17:28.360 --> 17:33.400
But I'm saying, you know, 40, especially since people are living longer and taking

17:33.400 --> 17:36.680
better care of themselves, 40 isn't middle age anymore.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.200
I know so many people that are like having kids at 40.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.560
You know, that ain't going to be me.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.560
If that's what they choose to do, everybody does.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.040
But, you know, like I remember when like people would have.

17:46.040 --> 17:50.520
Well, I would because the generation I was born out of, people were having kids at 21,

17:50.520 --> 17:52.280
22, and people still do that.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.240
People still do it.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.520
But I was there's a lot more that are like my mom was 17.

17:56.520 --> 17:57.320
It was the 70s.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.040
They had drugs.

17:58.040 --> 18:02.120
And it's it's and it's well documented on MTV shows that that still happens.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.120
But I'm just saying more and more people are like waiting.

18:04.120 --> 18:04.680
You know what I mean?

18:04.680 --> 18:09.080
Anyway, not to get Dungeon Buster says level 40 unlocks new perks and skill trees.

18:09.080 --> 18:09.800
That is true.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.680
It really is.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.760
So anyway, what was I going to say?

18:12.760 --> 18:14.120
I was saying something about going to Chicago.

18:15.080 --> 18:20.280
So no, but Sunday night I'm going to be sitting there and the clock's going to hit six o'clock

18:20.280 --> 18:23.160
and I'm going to be like, I should be doing well right now.

18:23.160 --> 18:28.120
And I do I do I do this when I'm at fucking Dragon Con where I'm like out there promoting

18:28.120 --> 18:31.480
Vogue and like kind of doing something very adjacent to this here.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.280
I'll sit there and go.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.800
And if Bobby happens to be in the same room, I'll be like, Bobby, I should be listening

18:35.800 --> 18:36.680
to your show right now.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.040
You should be calling me right now.

18:38.040 --> 18:38.680
We should be doing it.

18:38.680 --> 18:43.000
And, you know, I think one year we even did a pretend live call in the same room.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
But, you know, that's a podcast.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.200
I was sitting in a Jewish deli in West Hollywood looking at my kugel going, I'm supposed to

18:52.200 --> 18:53.240
be doing all right now.

18:53.240 --> 18:53.640
Oh, shit.

18:53.640 --> 18:54.280
My phone's dead.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.560
Looks like I'm going to the Apple store.

18:56.520 --> 18:56.840
All right.

18:56.840 --> 19:00.760
Anyway, Loki, I don't know if you have any any words you want to say about it before

19:00.760 --> 19:02.280
we get into E3.

19:02.280 --> 19:02.840
Nope.

19:02.840 --> 19:03.480
OK.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.760
He's a man of many words.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.000
Well, Loki, he's a man of a single taco.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.320
You know, you you know this.

19:09.320 --> 19:13.480
Originally, the plan was Jamie and I were going to start a show and you kind of showed

19:13.480 --> 19:15.400
up and you you stayed there.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.760
You showed up every single week for many, many, many weeks.

19:18.760 --> 19:22.280
And it really got to a point and it is at a point where it's like, I could never imagine

19:23.080 --> 19:25.720
not having this show without you on it.

19:25.720 --> 19:26.440
You know what I mean?

19:26.440 --> 19:30.600
And like your rants, which people don't always agree with.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.920
But I think people you know, it's it's you provide a different perspective here on the

19:34.920 --> 19:35.560
show.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.880
I think it's really brought something to the table.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.400
So, you know, I can't imagine or without you on it is basically what I'm saying.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.080
I can't imagine it without me either.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.800
I don't know if we would have made it this long without you.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.000
So who knows?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Just like we would have made it this long without her.

19:51.000 --> 19:57.320
So anyway, let's get into and if I may say so, you guys have been with me through some

19:57.320 --> 20:04.680
pretty big shit in my life through, you know, losing both of my grandmother's, my mom losing

20:04.680 --> 20:11.880
her husband, my my wedding, you know, lots of like really crazy life.

20:11.880 --> 20:18.840
It's kind of like how people use, you know, the Bible, I guess the B.C. or B.C.E. and

20:18.840 --> 20:20.520
then C.E. or whatever.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.240
Sure.

20:21.240 --> 20:26.920
And for me, I kind of think of things in terms of aspects of my life.

20:26.920 --> 20:31.560
Like I have my pre California, my post California, but I have my pre O.L.R., my post O.L.R.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.280
because O.L.R. has been the majority of my life here in California.

20:34.840 --> 20:39.080
And I think every major important thing that's happened to me in my life has been while doing

20:39.080 --> 20:44.840
this show, I'm not like on the show, of course, you know, but major important things.

20:44.840 --> 20:49.080
And even doing the show when I was probably at my lowest has always been a high point

20:49.080 --> 20:49.560
for me.

20:49.560 --> 20:54.360
So I hear that a thousand percent, because honestly, like last year and you guys know

20:54.360 --> 20:57.240
this, especially last year, like you guys have been through some shit like when I was

20:57.240 --> 20:59.800
really sick, when I was twenty nine, I was like really sick.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.360
You know, the show was there and you guys were sending your well wishes.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.120
But like honestly, and this is not a secret.

21:04.120 --> 21:07.240
You all know this last year was like the worst year for me.

21:07.240 --> 21:12.680
And I was not in a really good place with my mental health for several months.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.400
And I'm hoping that didn't really come through on the show.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.840
I mean, I'm sure you guys could probably figure it out with, you know, how many shows we were

21:18.840 --> 21:21.000
kind of missing just everything that was going on and stuff.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.160
But like, I have not had a worst year personally than last year.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.920
And this show kind of like gave me a reason to get out of bed.

21:29.560 --> 21:35.080
Like it's that big, you know, is just that whole like feeling of, but I got to do this

21:35.080 --> 21:39.080
thing because I always do this thing and I'm not going to end it over this.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.640
You know, it's why, like, even when I'm, you know, dirt sick and physically can't make

21:43.640 --> 21:48.600
it to the show, I get on that Skype call to do my classic game or do what I can, you know,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.440
unless I'm just completely out of town, you know.

21:50.440 --> 21:50.940
Right.

21:51.320 --> 21:55.880
But I mean, the show has seen both of us through health scares.

21:56.440 --> 21:56.920
Absolutely.

21:57.640 --> 22:01.640
And I know Loki had a lot of personal issues, too, with the show during the show.

22:01.640 --> 22:02.840
So it's not just us.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.080
Yeah, well, I meant all of us.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.760
We've all that's life.

22:06.760 --> 22:07.960
Let's throw shit at you.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.240
All you can do is throw shit back like you're a orangutan.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.520
And take it out on some video games.

22:12.520 --> 22:16.200
I do have to give a shout out because I just noticed in chat this doesn't happen very often.

22:16.200 --> 22:20.360
But the one and only DJ Morpheus joined chat, who you might know as Travis Donovan.

22:20.360 --> 22:24.920
And I'm hoping he's here because he bought us a car for our 16th.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.760
Did Pod Daddy get us a car?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.920
He got us a Hot Wheel.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.520
For the podcasters that don't know.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.040
No, not a Hot Wheel.

22:32.040 --> 22:36.440
For the podcast listeners that don't know, Travis Donovan did Understation Live,

22:36.440 --> 22:37.800
which Jamie and I were both.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.440
I was a host.

22:38.440 --> 22:42.040
You were like the most frequent guest before we had OLR.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.760
So, you know, I can say Travis-

22:44.760 --> 22:46.040
I've even been a temporary host.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.080
I've even said this on DragonCon panels, whether Travis-

22:49.080 --> 22:50.120
He just flipped you off, by the way.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.720
Whether Travis realizes it or not.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.560
Travis Donovan showed me that any idiot can do this.

22:57.640 --> 23:02.200
But he didn't get us a Hot Wheel.

23:02.200 --> 23:07.880
He got us one of those overstocked fake diecast knockoffs from 99 Cent Store.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.880
But it takes a special idiot to do it well.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.200
That comes off so shady.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.320
It's not supposed to be shady.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.120
Travis knows.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.040
Travis knows I love him and that's what-

23:16.040 --> 23:19.000
As God as my witness, I am that fool.

23:21.640 --> 23:22.520
All right.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.800
Anyway, let's get into-

23:23.800 --> 23:25.480
We got a lot of E3 news to get into.

23:26.120 --> 23:29.160
It feels like E3 was like six weeks ago at this point.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.000
Like a week moves fast.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.400
But so we did our show last week.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.680
We were talking about Microsoft.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.120
Bethesda happened during the show.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.320
We got to wrap that up.

23:37.320 --> 23:41.160
But then we got to Monday, which brought us Sony, Ubisoft.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.920
So, Loki, if you would kind of recap some of the highlights of these press conferences

23:44.920 --> 23:46.040
and we'll talk about each one.

23:47.080 --> 23:47.720
Okay.

23:47.720 --> 23:51.800
So honestly, in my opinion, there wasn't a whole lot that happened.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.960
I mean, it was kind of a disappointment a little bit,

23:53.960 --> 23:55.160
but we'll get into that a little bit.

23:56.120 --> 23:59.640
So let's talk about the first one that was of the day, Square Enix.

24:00.440 --> 24:07.640
Which, they basically showed the same shit that was in the other Xbox conference and whatnot.

24:07.640 --> 24:11.960
So they had trailers for Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy XIV.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.440
They talked about the new expansion.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.560
And there's going to be this Monster Hunter Worlds

24:17.560 --> 24:20.920
Final Fantasy XIV crossover thing happening this summer.

24:20.920 --> 24:25.480
They showed off the trailer again for Awesome Adventures of the Captain's Spirit.

24:27.160 --> 24:34.280
Dragon Quest XI, Babylon's Fall, Nier Automata, Become as Gods,

24:34.280 --> 24:37.000
which is the Xbox One definitive edition.

24:37.960 --> 24:42.040
Octopath Traveler, they showed off another trailer for Just Cause 4.

24:43.240 --> 24:46.520
A game called The Quiet Man, and of course, Kingdom Hearts III,

24:46.840 --> 24:52.600
which they also reiterated again that the release date is going to be January 29th, 2019.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.160
To bring back to your point, as you mentioned earlier before the show,

24:55.160 --> 24:57.320
that's probably not supposed to come out before the show.

24:58.440 --> 25:02.840
Yeah, I feel like Square Enix's show didn't really show us a whole lot.

25:02.840 --> 25:06.440
And maybe that Kingdom Hearts release date was supposed to be the big announcement.

25:06.440 --> 25:10.280
But then I think it was announced at a symphony in Japan or something, right?

25:10.280 --> 25:11.800
That's where they first announced it.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.640
And I think somebody didn't really figure out that once you say something

25:15.640 --> 25:18.760
at a show like that, it will be all over the internet instantly.

25:18.760 --> 25:22.280
So I'm not so sure that they were supposed to announce it a couple days early.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.880
I don't think it's a big deal at the end of the day,

25:23.880 --> 25:26.680
but I do feel like that was supposed to be the big thing.

25:27.560 --> 25:31.160
And yes, some of you are like, but wait, they showed that trailer at Microsoft saying

25:31.160 --> 25:32.360
they could have cut it short.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.800
You know, they could have just cut off the end.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.440
It would have been just as impactful.

25:36.440 --> 25:40.600
But anyway, like Square Enix really just kind of showed us like a lot of, yes, we know.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.160
I think it's more interesting with Square Enix didn't show.

25:43.240 --> 25:47.160
Fam has seven remake still, still not around, not there, but okay.

25:47.160 --> 25:52.200
They, you know, we probably kind of figured that we would get Kingdom Hearts three

25:52.200 --> 25:54.840
or the seven remake, but not both.

25:54.840 --> 25:58.520
So they're focusing on the Kingdom Hearts remake seven or Jesus Christ,

25:58.520 --> 26:02.120
the Kingdom Hearts three, the seven remake will be next year probably.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.600
And no Avengers, no Project Avengers.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.200
That was very surprising.

26:06.200 --> 26:12.360
No Final Fantasy anything except like a patch in 14, which, you know, I'm a 14 player.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.040
I'm all about patches, but let's be real.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.720
That's not really big Final Fantasy news.

26:16.680 --> 26:21.080
Nothing about continuing adventures in 15, which I'm actually more than okay with.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.200
Nothing on 16.

26:22.200 --> 26:26.360
I thought this would be the year to say, yes, we're going to make Final Fantasy 16 and leave

26:26.360 --> 26:26.600
it at that.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.480
I think it's too early for that.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.520
They're working on too much stuff.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.480
All right, maybe next year.

26:29.480 --> 26:29.880
I don't know.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.680
Bobby does say the Final Fantasy 14 cross monster hunter thing.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.880
Okay, cool.

26:35.880 --> 26:40.920
But it's like, it's an event and not really like a whole, it's not even really DLC.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.120
It's probably going to be in 14.

26:42.120 --> 26:45.240
If you remember 14, Bobby, it's probably just going to be a bunch of fates.

26:45.240 --> 26:45.800
And that's it.

26:46.840 --> 26:51.160
I'm going to skip the limited run games press conference because these are basically all

26:51.160 --> 26:53.720
games that have been out that are just getting physical releases.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.520
So there's not a whole lot of news there.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.920
I mean, unless you're a collector and that sort of thing.

26:59.960 --> 27:04.760
Ubisoft, they showed off, of course, predictably, Just Dance 2019.

27:05.640 --> 27:10.760
They showed off a new trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2, which looks interesting.

27:10.760 --> 27:11.800
They showed Jade.

27:13.800 --> 27:18.600
And then there's this new thing that this kind of pissed off a lot of people.

27:18.600 --> 27:24.760
This whole space monkey program, where basically they're teaming up with Hit Record,

27:26.120 --> 27:33.000
Joseph Gordon Levitch company to crowdsource assets for the game.

27:34.760 --> 27:38.360
So whether that be artwork modeling, you know, like 3D models,

27:39.240 --> 27:46.040
music, level design, whatever you're supposed to be contributing to or you can contribute to that,

27:46.040 --> 27:49.400
which is weird because that makes it seem like that game is really far off then.

27:49.400 --> 27:55.800
And the concern was, well, people are getting they they want free artists basically.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.920
They're paying them apparently, but I don't know how well they're paying them.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.640
They claim they're paying them.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.640
So that was kind of controversial.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.920
Rainbow Six Siege, they talked a little bit about that.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.280
They showed off a new trials game, Trials Rising,

28:12.280 --> 28:18.120
which is going to be coming out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC and Switch in February.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.960
The Division 2, they showed off a little bit of that.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.520
They talked about the Mario and Rabbids Kingdom Battle DLC,

28:26.520 --> 28:27.800
which is coming out later this month.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.680
Skull and Bones, they showed a new trailer for that.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.760
It's coming out sometime in 2019.

28:33.720 --> 28:38.760
A game called Transference, which is a game by Elijah Wood.

28:40.280 --> 28:43.240
I mean, it's nice to know what Elijah Wood's doing these days.

28:43.240 --> 28:43.800
Yeah, yeah.

28:45.400 --> 28:49.240
There's a game that they showed off called Starlink Battle for Atlas,

28:49.240 --> 28:51.400
which is kind of like a space shooter.

28:51.400 --> 28:56.440
Think of like a twice to life version of Star Fox, No Man's Sky.

28:56.440 --> 28:56.840
Yes.

28:56.840 --> 29:00.360
And they also are including Star Fox in the game as well.

29:00.360 --> 29:03.400
So you can like swap out parts of your ship in real time.

29:03.400 --> 29:09.880
And I don't know, I'm just, I'm a little done with the Toys of Life stuff, honestly.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.160
Yeah, I kind of thought we were past that too, but apparently, yeah.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.440
Ubisoft doesn't like to take really strange risks.

29:16.440 --> 29:23.000
I mean, remember they had that one year with laser tag vests and their, you know, health.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.120
Oh God, I remember that year.

29:24.120 --> 29:24.760
Yeah, yeah.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.880
Now I was like, whoa, laser tag, I'm all down with that.

29:28.440 --> 29:32.120
Uh, SGA 100 Matt in our chat at live.vognetware.com says,

29:32.120 --> 29:35.480
I think Starlink is the closest thing we'll get to a Star Fox game for a while.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.480
Um, possible.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.160
It definitely was not at Nintendo's.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.280
Well, Nintendo mentioned Starlink.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.360
We just got a Star Fox game, what, last year?

29:43.560 --> 29:45.720
I guess, but, or the Wii U one?

29:45.720 --> 29:45.880
Yeah.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.320
That was like two years ago, I think.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.600
Because Switch was last year.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.200
Well, they quit your whining.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.400
Where's our F-Zero game?

29:51.400 --> 29:55.800
Where's our racing game that, you know, is Toys Life stuff, you know?

29:55.800 --> 29:56.300
The fuck?

29:56.860 --> 29:57.820
You guys are complaining.

29:57.820 --> 29:59.180
Oh, where's my Star Fox game?

29:59.180 --> 29:59.580
I have it.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.500
It's been two whole years.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.620
Oh, wine.

30:03.260 --> 30:09.100
Um, anyways, so for Honor, um, they showed off some new stuff that they have for that.

30:09.100 --> 30:15.100
They have a new, um, I guess expansion for marching fires that has four new, new fighters.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.740
Um, they also have this new castle siege mode.

30:17.740 --> 30:21.500
Plus they gave out the game for free on Uplay.

30:21.500 --> 30:22.940
I think that offers over though.

30:23.500 --> 30:28.620
Um, the crew too, they showed that in the open betas starting this week.

30:29.260 --> 30:32.860
And then Assassin's Creed Odyssey is of course, they finished with that and that's coming

30:32.860 --> 30:34.220
out in October.

30:34.220 --> 30:37.740
Which looked really interesting for an Assassin's Creed game, which I don't usually get into

30:37.740 --> 30:38.140
those games.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.580
Like I'm not trying to shade Assassin's Creed.

30:39.580 --> 30:42.620
It's just, I don't have time to play everything, but I like the fact that they're giving all

30:42.620 --> 30:44.620
these like branching story choices and stuff.

30:44.620 --> 30:46.380
It looked like Mass Effect in a way.

30:46.380 --> 30:49.820
I was like, oh, there's my new Mass Effect game, sorta, sorta.

30:49.820 --> 30:55.100
And obviously, you know, the team took their lashes a few years ago with the whole, it's

30:55.100 --> 30:58.300
too hard to render a woman and the things that they paid for with that.

30:58.300 --> 31:01.500
Uh, so now right off the bat, they're like, you want to play as him or you want to play

31:01.500 --> 31:02.000
as her.

31:02.540 --> 31:06.460
And then as part of the story, it's like, you can just, it's, it's grease people.

31:06.460 --> 31:07.900
You can romance anyone.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.900
So kind of, kind of neat to see that direction that Ubisoft's going.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.140
I'm, I'm curious about some of the like narrative stuff.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.580
I'm not just fixated on the romance.

31:15.580 --> 31:19.500
I like the fact that the story is kind of taking on that branching stuff.

31:20.380 --> 31:24.460
I, I will be looking more into this and I don't usually get into Assassin's Creed games.

31:25.180 --> 31:28.300
Um, no, then we'll get to the Sony conference.

31:28.300 --> 31:31.660
So Sony didn't show off a whole lot of stuff.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.980
They showed off some extended looks at different games.

31:33.980 --> 31:37.820
So they started off with The Last of Us 2 after wasting a bunch of fucking time playing

31:37.820 --> 31:38.700
music.

31:38.700 --> 31:45.660
And then, um, you know, after that they talked about, they're supposed to be a new, um, like

31:45.660 --> 31:47.100
I got a word, new game plus.

31:47.740 --> 31:51.420
I just want to say real quick, that musician, as I understand it, is a really respected

31:51.420 --> 31:53.180
musician for that instrument that he plays.

31:53.180 --> 31:58.780
But that kind of, the unfortunate is that kind of stuff is I think really just lost

31:58.780 --> 32:00.220
on an E3 audience.

32:00.220 --> 32:05.660
It just is like, like I get what they're trying to do, but like you've got a finite amount

32:05.660 --> 32:10.700
of time here to show off stuff and you're wasting how much of it of not only that, like

32:10.700 --> 32:15.100
it's the exact same criticism we gave to Bethesda last week with their music.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.100
And don't get me wrong, that's fine.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.380
But then on top of it, they're like, oh, and we're moving venues.

32:20.380 --> 32:21.820
Let's take 10 minutes to do that.

32:21.820 --> 32:25.580
It's like, why, why were you doing that?

32:25.580 --> 32:29.100
Yeah, I heard at the show there, it was, it was pretty messy.

32:29.740 --> 32:33.740
Like people were like, why are we just standing in the back of this barn?

32:33.740 --> 32:35.820
Like, are we going to have to stand here for two hours?

32:35.820 --> 32:37.340
Like, heck no type of thing.

32:37.340 --> 32:40.460
And then like, it was just, it sounded like it was really weird, but anyway, I'll let

32:40.460 --> 32:41.100
you finish it.

32:41.100 --> 32:44.300
I've got, I got some opinions on what Sony did, but I'll let you finish.

32:44.540 --> 32:46.700
Then they show Call of Duty Black Ops 4.

32:47.420 --> 32:48.940
All they do is talk about map packs.

32:48.940 --> 32:50.060
So they've got this like thing.

32:50.060 --> 32:53.260
If you preorder, you get some older maps and stuff.

32:53.260 --> 32:57.580
Black Ops 3, though, is available for PlayStation Plus users.

32:57.580 --> 32:58.220
So that's cool.

32:58.220 --> 33:01.260
So I got in on that because I didn't have it yet.

33:03.020 --> 33:08.460
And then they showed off or they talked while they were transitioning stages or whatever.

33:08.460 --> 33:10.700
They are showing off some of the announcements that they did.

33:10.700 --> 33:16.380
So they showed off the Tetris Effect, Days Gone, Twin Mirror, Ghost Giant and Beat Saber.

33:17.660 --> 33:22.140
They should not have announced them on Twitter earlier in the week if they were going to

33:22.140 --> 33:23.820
announce them during the show.

33:23.820 --> 33:26.460
All they were doing is like, yeah, they took the wind out of their own sails.

33:26.460 --> 33:27.180
So that move.

33:27.180 --> 33:27.500
Yeah.

33:27.500 --> 33:32.300
In my opinion, they showed off Destiny 2 Forsaken.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.060
That's coming out September 4th.

33:34.060 --> 33:38.140
The next big thing that they showed was Ghosts of Shusima.

33:38.140 --> 33:41.500
And of course, with that, they also had a musical intro with that.

33:42.460 --> 33:44.700
Gameplay looks fucking gorgeous, though.

33:44.700 --> 33:45.740
So that's pretty awesome.

33:46.780 --> 33:48.460
A game called Control.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.780
That's going to be like it looks like Quantum Break.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.460
That's coming out in 2019.

33:52.460 --> 33:56.780
Resident Evil 2 is getting a full remake and that's coming out January 25th.

33:57.900 --> 34:03.180
Trover saves the universe, which is the new Justin Roland game.

34:03.900 --> 34:05.580
The greatest of Rick and Morty.

34:06.540 --> 34:09.580
So that's going to be coming out soon, hopefully.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.300
They showed off more Kingdom Hearts 3.

34:14.300 --> 34:17.020
They talked about like the Pirates of the Caribbean thing.

34:17.020 --> 34:19.020
And plus, there's a limited edition PS4 Pro

34:19.020 --> 34:21.420
that's coming out with all of the Kingdom Hearts games.

34:22.780 --> 34:25.020
Then they showed gameplay of Death Stranding.

34:25.020 --> 34:28.220
And I still have no fucking clue what that game is about yet.

34:29.660 --> 34:32.700
I mean, but it's neat, I guess.

34:33.260 --> 34:34.460
No Man Stranding.

34:34.460 --> 34:38.220
I have no idea what it's about, but it's a game.

34:39.260 --> 34:43.420
Neo 2, they showed off more Spider-Man.

34:43.420 --> 34:48.060
And then a game called The Scene, which is from From Software.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.780
And it's a PlayStation VR game.

34:50.780 --> 34:51.980
I don't even remember that.

34:53.740 --> 34:55.740
But I think they showed that at the end.

34:55.740 --> 35:01.020
That was like after that, because it was really ambiguous when their thing ended.

35:01.020 --> 35:03.100
Because it was very clear they were trying to get people to stay

35:03.100 --> 35:08.620
to watch more of their little like blended kind of like pre-show post-show thing

35:08.620 --> 35:12.620
that they also kind of had in the middle of that while they were changing venues and so forth.

35:12.620 --> 35:15.660
So it was really kind of weird when it ended.

35:15.660 --> 35:18.060
But OK, here's the thing with Sony.

35:18.060 --> 35:22.460
Like, I think Sony took a big risk with the way that they did their thing this year.

35:22.460 --> 35:25.100
They warned us it was going to be different.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.060
So I'm going to give them that.

35:26.060 --> 35:26.700
They warned us.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.100
They said, don't expect bombshell announcements this year.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.940
We're going to focus on these four games.

35:30.940 --> 35:32.300
They told us what games.

35:32.620 --> 35:37.100
They set us up and they took a risk with this whole venue thing and the moving and all that

35:37.100 --> 35:37.500
stuff.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.900
So I applaud Sony for taking the risk.

35:39.900 --> 35:42.300
That said, it was a miss for me.

35:42.300 --> 35:43.020
Totally.

35:43.020 --> 35:44.220
Like it didn't work.

35:44.220 --> 35:45.500
It was a risk that failed.

35:45.500 --> 35:51.500
I hope Sony learns that and kind of goes back to honestly, the type of press conference

35:51.500 --> 35:55.260
that Microsoft kind of excelled in this year.

35:55.260 --> 35:56.140
I don't like to grade.

35:56.140 --> 35:58.060
I don't like to say one E3.

35:58.060 --> 36:00.860
I like to look for positives and constructive criticism to everybody.

36:00.860 --> 36:06.140
But the reality is the criticism I have for Sony this year is that Microsoft kind of was

36:06.140 --> 36:07.420
more effective at your game.

36:07.420 --> 36:08.620
Here's my issue, though.

36:08.620 --> 36:11.100
Like, let's let's just talk about the games that they showed, though.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.460
The first party games.

36:12.460 --> 36:13.980
What's coming out this year?

36:13.980 --> 36:15.900
None of their games are coming out this year.

36:16.540 --> 36:17.260
The Spider-Man.

36:17.260 --> 36:18.140
Spider-Man was okay.

36:18.140 --> 36:18.460
Fine.

36:18.460 --> 36:19.820
Spider-Man is coming out this year.

36:19.820 --> 36:20.460
Yep.

36:20.460 --> 36:21.180
But that's it.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.140
I mean, that's September.

36:22.140 --> 36:23.980
I mean, like, I don't disagree with you.

36:23.980 --> 36:31.340
It's like Sony was kind of especially when we get into some of the things later in the

36:31.340 --> 36:31.580
show.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.820
And if you all been watching gaming news, you know what's coming.

36:34.540 --> 36:38.940
Sony is sitting up on this throne right now, and they kind of feel like being up on this

36:38.940 --> 36:39.740
throne.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.260
They can do some stuff.

36:41.260 --> 36:42.140
But you know what?

36:42.700 --> 36:45.580
Microsoft making a lot of improvements.

36:45.580 --> 36:48.940
I think things are going to really turn around for them when we get to at least to the next

36:48.940 --> 36:49.740
realm of consoles.

36:50.700 --> 36:56.460
The Switch, both Sony and Microsoft have kind of dismissed Nintendo as true competition

36:56.460 --> 36:59.980
for a long time because they are kind of everybody's second place console.

36:59.980 --> 37:06.780
But I think what Sony is allowing to happen by not really highlighting a lot of what's

37:06.780 --> 37:07.740
happening this year.

37:07.740 --> 37:11.420
And Microsoft gets some of this criticism, too, is that when it comes to the holiday

37:11.420 --> 37:14.620
and systems that people are going to buy, I think the Switch is going to start to look

37:14.620 --> 37:15.740
more and more attractive.

37:15.740 --> 37:20.620
You just heard our guest Bradley say that he was thinking about getting a Switch if

37:20.620 --> 37:22.780
he's going to jump into this new generation of consoles.

37:23.260 --> 37:27.100
And I think that might be where a lot of people's minds are at.

37:27.100 --> 37:30.700
So that was another reason I think Sony's conference was a miss for me.

37:30.700 --> 37:34.940
And honestly, I'm going to be very real, and this is not going to be a popular opinion.

37:34.940 --> 37:35.420
I'm sorry.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.860
You're just going to have to deal with this particular gamer's opinion because it's the

37:38.860 --> 37:40.300
show where every gamer has a voice.

37:40.300 --> 37:44.780
I understand a lot of you are very excited about Last of Us 2 and the Samurai game.

37:44.780 --> 37:49.500
And you'll notice I don't even remember the name of the Samurai game and these other games.

37:50.540 --> 37:52.860
I don't really like...

37:52.860 --> 37:55.180
I was like, that Samurai game is gorgeous.

37:55.180 --> 37:56.300
It's pretty.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.620
And then while I was watching, I was like, it's really not for me.

37:59.180 --> 38:04.940
The Last of Us 2, I give Sony huge props, huge praise.

38:04.940 --> 38:12.060
The fact that here we are in the year 2018 and a major game company, major game publisher

38:12.700 --> 38:19.420
opens their press conference, essentially, with a well-executed, not a stunt, but a well-executed

38:19.420 --> 38:20.860
same-sex kiss.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.180
Like, Sony gets massive props from me from that.

38:23.180 --> 38:24.060
I will give them that.

38:24.060 --> 38:28.140
Sony fucking rocked that with the representation and everything.

38:28.140 --> 38:32.300
But I have to say, honestly, as much as I really want to support that game, then it

38:32.300 --> 38:34.060
got into what the game actually is.

38:34.060 --> 38:36.380
And it was that whole scene with the disemboweling and all that stuff.

38:36.380 --> 38:37.340
I was like, this is nasty.

38:37.340 --> 38:40.140
I don't want to play an uber violent game like that.

38:40.140 --> 38:43.260
That's just not the type of stuff I'm into really so much.

38:43.260 --> 38:46.460
You know, when it's cartoony, it's fine.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.740
I don't like Mortal Kombat.

38:47.740 --> 38:50.060
The old Mortal Kombat games was cartoon shit like that.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.100
It's fine.

38:51.100 --> 38:55.340
But when it's like, when it's that, like, I was like, that's a little too real for me.

38:55.340 --> 38:57.180
And y'all know I hate those Saw movies and stuff.

38:57.180 --> 39:00.780
And so, like, I was watching all that going, this is like, am I turning into my mom?

39:00.780 --> 39:03.660
I'm saying this is, this is gross.

39:03.660 --> 39:08.780
I never played the first, I mean, I never played the first Last of Us.

39:08.780 --> 39:12.700
And I'm just, it doesn't look interesting to me.

39:12.700 --> 39:16.700
I'm not really into a huge amount of this, like, stealth action games.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.180
I mean, it looks like a gorgeous game.

39:19.180 --> 39:20.140
I'm sure it's great.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.740
Not a game I want to pick up, though.

39:21.740 --> 39:22.060
Yeah.

39:22.060 --> 39:26.540
And same with, like, Spider-Man looks all right, but I never really pick up Spider-Man

39:26.540 --> 39:26.780
games.

39:26.780 --> 39:27.660
Me neither.

39:27.660 --> 39:29.260
And so, like, I'm right there with you.

39:29.260 --> 39:31.900
I'm like, wow, if I played these games, I'd play that.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.020
But I just don't have enough time.

39:33.020 --> 39:33.660
Exactly.

39:33.660 --> 39:36.860
Or like, even like the Ghost of Shazima, I'm like, that looks fucking hard.

39:36.860 --> 39:39.900
Well, not a game I probably can pick up.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.900
Here's the, I think, you know what this is leading to?

39:41.900 --> 39:46.860
I think in some ways, Sony showed very strong diversity with what I just mentioned.

39:47.420 --> 39:52.220
But ironically, they didn't show good diversity with the games they were showing at the show.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.540
And I think that was their biggest weakness.

39:55.260 --> 39:58.700
That's the whole problem with most of the entertainment industry anyway, is tokenism.

39:59.500 --> 40:03.900
Well, I'm not even talking about the LGBT representation, all that stuff.

40:03.900 --> 40:07.660
I'm talking about just the games were all cut from a similar cloth to me.

40:07.660 --> 40:08.620
That's what I'm talking about.

40:08.620 --> 40:12.380
They throw in the things that they think everyone wants as a token.

40:12.380 --> 40:12.940
Right.

40:12.940 --> 40:18.780
You know, yeah, we want to see more, you know, quilt bag characters.

40:18.780 --> 40:21.180
Yeah, we want to see people of other ethnicities.

40:21.180 --> 40:27.900
Yeah, we want more strong female leads, but they do the same kind of game over and fucking over.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.180
Okay, I get what you're saying.

40:29.180 --> 40:35.820
I still think, though, I cannot, I don't want to criticize Sony's big move for making L.

40:36.380 --> 40:40.220
Ellie in a game of that caliber for spotlighting that.

40:40.220 --> 40:42.620
Like, I really don't want to criticize that because it did,

40:43.260 --> 40:46.700
you know, watching the intro, watching the scene was it really didn't feel token to me.

40:46.700 --> 40:53.420
Like, it wasn't like, God, what's like, sometimes you play those Japanese anime titty games,

40:53.420 --> 40:58.060
and there might be like, like, I don't even want to say Bayonetta because I think Bayonetta is

40:58.060 --> 41:01.100
parody, but, you know, some of those games are sexy lesbians.

41:01.100 --> 41:01.900
Yeah, like Galgun.

41:01.900 --> 41:02.940
That's tokenism.

41:02.940 --> 41:03.440
Okay.

41:04.060 --> 41:07.900
But I didn't I didn't I wasn't I was more thinking like it's the throw a bone.

41:08.460 --> 41:10.460
I just didn't really get that.

41:10.460 --> 41:15.500
I mean, I'm not a lesbian, so maybe I or bi because technically it just shouldn't matter.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.940
It should just be a natural part of the game.

41:16.940 --> 41:23.420
I want ace characters, but I haven't had one yet except for one ever in Borderlands.

41:23.980 --> 41:29.500
So but the diversity of the games themselves, I think, was was Sony's weakness.

41:29.500 --> 41:33.660
And the fact that these other games like the Tetris effect and the other stuff was kind of

41:33.660 --> 41:37.180
like, oh, and by the way, we announced this earlier this week, too, was kind of like,

41:37.180 --> 41:40.540
well, give you should probably show that a little bit, too.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.820
And then, OK, they gave a lot of time to Kingdom Hearts three, which is great.

41:43.820 --> 41:45.820
That is the kind of game I'm signed up for.

41:45.820 --> 41:49.180
Too bad I already saw it twice before Sony's thing.

41:49.180 --> 41:50.860
So it felt really redundant at that point.

41:50.860 --> 41:51.660
You know what I mean?

41:51.660 --> 41:52.160
Yeah.

41:52.160 --> 41:57.680
So and it was really weird to me how there was all this stuff missing from E3 completely.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.960
Where was Soul Calibur six at anybody's show?

42:00.960 --> 42:03.120
Where was Red Dead Redemption two?

42:03.120 --> 42:05.760
I would have thought for sure that would have been a Sony thing.

42:05.760 --> 42:11.120
Well, you have to also remember there's Gamescom in a few months, too.

42:11.120 --> 42:11.760
Yes.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.680
So it struck me as weird.

42:13.680 --> 42:14.320
It was weird.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.120
Where was dreams?

42:15.120 --> 42:16.720
They had the transitions with dreams.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.080
They didn't talk about that at all.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.720
No, it was just it was weird.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.560
Sony was just weird this year.

42:22.560 --> 42:23.520
They took a risk.

42:23.520 --> 42:24.400
I didn't like it.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.920
I hope they don't do it again.

42:25.920 --> 42:28.160
The only other thing I'm going to say Death Stranding.

42:28.800 --> 42:29.280
All right.

42:29.280 --> 42:34.000
It looks pretty, but I've officially had it with the teases for Death Stranding.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.720
We're getting into No Man's Sky territory here.

42:36.720 --> 42:41.680
Yes, I realize some of what they showed there was the gameplay, but I'm sorry.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.720
They didn't really explain, like, what is the game?

42:44.720 --> 42:47.440
And I know some of you might all be, but that's the art.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.480
That's the mystery.

42:48.480 --> 42:52.880
Look, I fucking stand David Lynch's Twin Peaks hard.

42:52.880 --> 42:56.160
And if you want to know about something that doesn't make any fucking sense, let's talk

42:56.160 --> 42:57.920
about David Lynch's Twin Peaks.

42:57.920 --> 43:02.560
But my point is with this Death Stranding thing, like, they've shown it over and over

43:02.560 --> 43:04.560
and over and over again.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.160
And it's just like, okay, you know what?

43:06.160 --> 43:07.040
Put up or shut up.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.640
Like, it just kind of, like, feels like the thing.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.960
It's just it's the new No Man's Sky.

43:12.960 --> 43:15.600
And I worry in some ways it might end up disappointing.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.320
Maybe it won't.

43:16.320 --> 43:16.880
And you know what?

43:16.880 --> 43:17.760
Maybe I'll decide.

43:17.760 --> 43:21.120
I play the game and I'll be like, oh my God, I was so fucking wrong.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.480
This game is incredible.

43:22.480 --> 43:28.560
But I just think if there is such a thing as too much promotion, too much teasing, we're

43:28.560 --> 43:30.560
getting to that line with Death Stranding.

43:30.560 --> 43:33.600
That was what they did with No Man's Sky.

43:33.600 --> 43:36.320
Yeah, it became good eventually.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.360
Anyway, go to our chat at live.vog.network.com.

43:40.320 --> 43:43.840
At Def does want to clarify the Last of Us girl is bi.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.920
It was explained in the DLC for the first game.

43:45.920 --> 43:49.040
Well, I'm glad I did say it could have been either or.

43:49.040 --> 43:49.840
I was not aware.

43:50.640 --> 43:53.600
Certainly would not want to erase any sexualities here on the show.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.200
Sia Tabiri in chat says Twin Peaks makes more sense.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.200
Inland Empire is the one that did make sense.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.680
I saw Lost Highway in the theater, okay?

44:01.680 --> 44:02.640
You want to talk about a movie?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.000
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.640
Go watch a movie called Lost Highway from the 90s.

44:07.680 --> 44:10.640
Tigerclaw in chat says you have to take into account that this is Kojima.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.800
His games tend to have really weird shit going on.

44:12.800 --> 44:13.920
It's Kojima's trait.

44:13.920 --> 44:15.760
Okay, Tigerclaw, I do get that.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.200
But it's been weird shit for four years now.

44:19.200 --> 44:22.160
Like, where's the fucking game?

44:22.160 --> 44:23.520
God, can you imagine?

44:23.520 --> 44:25.520
Is the game walking from place to place?

44:25.520 --> 44:28.800
If it's a walking sim or that whole thing, then okay, cool.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.240
I don't think that's what it is.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.680
Can you imagine if he actually did Silent Hills, man?

44:34.480 --> 44:36.880
I feel like a lot of probably what was going to be in that game

44:36.880 --> 44:38.800
is probably going to be in this, but we'll see.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.840
Anyway, SG-100 Matt does say I'm in the same boat,

44:41.840 --> 44:43.840
three years of this nonsense of Death Stranding.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.520
Dungeon Buster says I feel that Kojima's Metal Gear Solid teases

44:47.520 --> 44:50.560
had a lot more information going on with him than Death Stranding does right now.

44:50.560 --> 44:51.440
Yes, agree.

44:52.240 --> 44:54.320
Anyway, sorry, I will stop ranting on that

44:54.320 --> 44:55.920
because I don't want to be overly negative,

44:55.920 --> 44:59.520
but I'm just like, please stop showing that game

44:59.520 --> 45:02.160
until you're ready to show us the game and the release date.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.600
I do not want to see that game again.

45:05.600 --> 45:07.040
All right, is that it for Sony?

45:07.040 --> 45:08.000
That's it for Sony.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.360
Let's talk about the Nintendo Direct.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.080
So Nintendo Direct started off with a game called

45:12.080 --> 45:20.080
Daemon X Machine, and it's basically a spiritual successor to Armored Core,

45:20.080 --> 45:21.200
at least that's what it looks like.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.760
So awesome metal soundtrack coming in 2019.

45:23.760 --> 45:27.280
It's a pretty cool name, like a play on Deus Ex Machina.

45:27.840 --> 45:32.320
So then they showed off Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is getting,

45:32.320 --> 45:34.240
I guess, some DLC that's coming out in September.

45:35.200 --> 45:39.200
They showed off more Let's Go or Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee

45:39.840 --> 45:43.600
and talked about the transfer as well as the Pokeball Plus

45:43.600 --> 45:45.200
is going to come with Mew in every single one.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.840
And that's going to be coming out November 16th.

45:48.560 --> 45:52.480
Super Mario Party, and they even have a way

45:52.480 --> 45:54.480
that you're going to be able to use multiple switches

45:54.480 --> 45:58.400
to play across two screens, which is kind of interesting.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.960
They have Fire Emblem Three Houses,

46:02.960 --> 46:04.240
which is coming out in the spring.

46:04.880 --> 46:06.400
Fortnite was out that day.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.600
They talked about some of the indie games,

46:09.600 --> 46:15.440
so they highlighted Overcooked 2, Killer Queen Black, and Hollow Knight.

46:17.040 --> 46:20.080
And then they talked a little bit about Octopath Traveler,

46:20.080 --> 46:22.400
which had a demo that came out as well.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.320
I actually know a little bit, I haven't played it yet.

46:25.600 --> 46:30.000
Dragon Ball FighterZ coming out October 2018.

46:30.640 --> 46:34.000
And then they talked about, of course, the big announcement,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.160
Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

46:36.160 --> 46:39.920
And it's got every character in every Smash game so far,

46:40.880 --> 46:45.040
and even bringing back Snake, and yes.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.760
And of course, along with that, they announced new characters.

46:47.760 --> 46:52.960
Daisy, they added, she's now what's called an Echo Fighter,

46:52.960 --> 46:55.440
so basically like a clone of another character.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.760
Does she still have an eyeball in the back of her head?

46:58.720 --> 47:00.160
I don't believe so.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.600
It would be cool if she did, though.

47:01.600 --> 47:03.920
Maybe one of the reskins or something, who knows?

47:04.480 --> 47:08.640
And then Ridley is also playable, and they've got amiibos coming for them as well.

47:08.640 --> 47:12.160
And that's coming out this year, December 7th, so pretty awesome.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.560
I sensed that there was a lot of people that didn't really care for Nintendo's presentation,

47:16.560 --> 47:18.880
because they focused on Smash Brothers too much.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.120
Because yes, it was all Smash Brothers.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.480
It's 30 minutes of Smash Brothers.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.640
Don't get me wrong, I love Smash Brothers.

47:24.640 --> 47:27.840
I just wish, it's like, where's Metroid Prime 4?

47:28.720 --> 47:31.520
Where's the Yoshi game that you guys talked about?

47:31.520 --> 47:33.600
Where's Animal Crossing?

47:33.680 --> 47:35.760
Where's anything else?

47:35.760 --> 47:37.520
It's like, where is all this stuff?

47:37.520 --> 47:39.360
I agree and I disagree.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.760
Like, certainly, I would be lying.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.440
I would be straight up lying if I didn't say.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.720
There wasn't that part of me that was like,

47:44.720 --> 47:47.680
oh, I wish they teased us a little more on Metroid Prime 4.

47:47.680 --> 47:50.640
Or I wish we kind of got some other stuff as well.

47:50.640 --> 47:53.840
I mean, we did get some new announcements in there with the Super Mario Party

47:53.840 --> 47:56.960
and the mech game and, you know, some of those things they were showing.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.560
There were at least some new things in there.

47:58.560 --> 48:02.320
But I'd be lying if I wasn't saying I wouldn't have appreciated some of these other teases.

48:02.320 --> 48:04.880
However, what I will give Nintendo credit for,

48:04.880 --> 48:07.200
that I think a lot of people are overlooking,

48:07.200 --> 48:11.040
is that the things they showed are coming a lot sooner

48:11.600 --> 48:16.000
than collaboratively what Sony, especially Sony, or Microsoft showed.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.440
Is that most of what you saw, like 90% of what Nintendo showed, was this year.

48:21.440 --> 48:24.560
And they still do these directs every month or so.

48:24.560 --> 48:25.060
Right.

48:25.600 --> 48:26.100
Exactly.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.400
You could think that they'd have other things.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.600
I just wish they would say,

48:29.600 --> 48:32.080
tease some stuff and like, oh, we'll have directs to talk about.

48:32.080 --> 48:33.360
For like, I didn't need...

48:33.360 --> 48:34.480
Which they did last year.

48:34.480 --> 48:35.040
Yeah, exactly.

48:35.040 --> 48:39.840
I didn't need Super Smash Brothers Ultimate to tell me what the differences were in the characters.

48:40.480 --> 48:43.600
All of the characters, like, here's all of the differences.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.480
I didn't need that 30 minute long explanation.

48:46.480 --> 48:50.720
That was a bit deep dive that maybe wasn't needed for the whole audience.

48:50.720 --> 48:53.200
Like that could be in like your Smash Direct that you do.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.600
We did not need to waste 30 minutes doing this.

48:55.600 --> 48:59.360
How about give 10 of those minutes to talking about Nintendo Online?

49:00.160 --> 49:00.720
Exactly.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.640
What the fuck is Nintendo Online?

49:02.640 --> 49:04.320
Because we haven't talked about it.

49:04.320 --> 49:05.440
We have a web page.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.800
This was that opportunity.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.920
So I was very surprised that was not there at all.

49:09.920 --> 49:13.920
And y'all know, I've been wondering, like, what is Nintendo's fucking retro plan already?

49:13.920 --> 49:17.120
And I feel like we're going to hear about it the day before at this point.

49:17.120 --> 49:21.440
The day before it's live is when we'll finally find out what their fucking retro plan is.

49:21.440 --> 49:23.920
Because I guess they don't want people analyzing it to death or something.

49:23.920 --> 49:24.800
I don't know.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.240
But it's, uh, yeah.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.280
I mean, I didn't, I didn't hate what Nintendo did.

49:29.280 --> 49:32.640
No, but it was, you know, again, and I kind of looked through it at the lens of,

49:32.640 --> 49:34.240
okay, well, at least they're just showing, like,

49:34.240 --> 49:38.160
here's the stuff to hold you over till our next direct type of thing.

49:38.160 --> 49:39.760
And I was like, all right, I'm okay with it.

49:39.760 --> 49:42.960
And honestly, you know, again, I don't like to do grades.

49:42.960 --> 49:47.920
I don't like to do the whole who won E3, but I am going to say the press conference

49:47.920 --> 49:52.000
that kind of surprised me this year of like, wow, I kind of feel like they put on

49:52.000 --> 49:53.760
the strongest thing was Microsoft.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.120
Yeah.

49:55.120 --> 49:59.680
And I think it's because everybody let Microsoft do the third party unveils.

50:00.320 --> 50:04.640
And Microsoft really had a whopper of an announcement with the fact that

50:04.640 --> 50:09.040
we're positioning ourselves to really kick some butt with our next console

50:09.040 --> 50:12.160
by acquiring four studios and building a fifth.

50:12.160 --> 50:17.120
You know, that if I was a Microsoft Stan, which I'm a fan of everybody,

50:17.120 --> 50:19.200
but if I was like one of those Microsoft fan boys,

50:19.200 --> 50:22.240
like certain other podcasts I've heard before, I would have been really excited.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.320
Plus, they had a lot of announcements.

50:24.320 --> 50:28.240
Granted, a lot of them are like far out, but like they announced a new Halo game.

50:28.240 --> 50:29.920
They announced three new Gears of War games.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.360
They announced a new Forza game.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.560
I mean, they got a lot of stuff coming.

50:36.560 --> 50:39.120
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, stop showing me Death Stranding.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.800
I'm tired of seeing it three minutes later.

50:40.800 --> 50:43.360
Why didn't they show us more about Metroid Prime 4?

50:43.360 --> 50:45.440
Okay, I'm going to show you the difference here.

50:46.240 --> 50:51.040
One, Sony is not only showing Death Stranding shit at E3.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.960
They're showing it at PSX.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.720
I think they did one at Gamescom, didn't they?

50:54.720 --> 50:56.720
Didn't the Guillermo del Toro thing come out of Gamescom?

50:56.720 --> 50:58.320
Yeah, or Tokyo Game Show or something like that.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.240
They've also been joining the Game Awards.

51:00.240 --> 51:00.720
That's it.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.960
The Game Awards is the other thing that I'm not thinking of.

51:02.960 --> 51:05.600
So they're showing Death Stranding like multiple times a year,

51:05.600 --> 51:07.440
just like they were doing in No Man's Sky.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.920
Metroid Prime, we haven't seen in like a year.

51:09.920 --> 51:13.280
And I'm not saying, we don't need to have a 20-minute deep dive

51:13.280 --> 51:15.840
on Metroid Prime 4 if it's not coming out to 2019,

51:15.840 --> 51:18.320
but it just might be cool to see a screenshot,

51:18.960 --> 51:21.120
uh, something that kind of gives us, is it 2D?

51:21.120 --> 51:22.080
Is it through, oh, it's Prime.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.040
It's probably 3D.

51:23.040 --> 51:25.040
But just tease us a little bit with the HD graphics.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.160
Are they doing multiplayer?

51:26.160 --> 51:27.440
Just drop that little tidbit in there.

51:27.440 --> 51:28.560
That's all I need.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.800
Just a little tickle, okay?

51:30.800 --> 51:34.400
That's all I really need from Metroid Prime 4 or anything.

51:34.400 --> 51:35.760
I kind of feel like there's a difference.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.160
Or like what Retro Studios is working on, you know?

51:38.160 --> 51:39.520
Or just whatever.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.400
I don't know.

51:40.400 --> 51:40.900
Yeah.

51:41.680 --> 51:42.080
Anyway.

51:42.080 --> 51:45.760
Or DLC for fucking Mario Odyssey.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.280
I'm surprised that's not a thing.

51:47.360 --> 51:52.160
I feel like a lot of the comments in the chat room are a very

51:52.160 --> 51:55.680
agreeance that Microsoft was the one that people really walked away

51:55.680 --> 51:56.880
feeling the best from.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.520
SG100Matt says MS did what people wanted.

51:59.520 --> 52:00.240
Showed games.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.320
Whether those games are for you is a different story.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.520
Dungeon Buster says Microsoft and Phil Spencer put on a solid presser.

52:05.520 --> 52:09.280
I don't have an Xbox One, but for us it looks like a game I would at least like to try out.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.400
Well, you could on PC.

52:11.200 --> 52:13.760
And Bobby Black Wolf pointing out with Metroid Prime.

52:13.760 --> 52:14.480
Fun fact.

52:14.480 --> 52:17.920
Metroid Prime came out five months after OLR started.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.400
Thanks for that friendly reminder.

52:24.400 --> 52:25.120
I appreciate that.

52:25.120 --> 52:26.400
Sometimes sequels take time.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.400
Look at The Incredibles 2 14 years later.

52:28.400 --> 52:28.880
That's true.

52:28.880 --> 52:29.600
That's true.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.320
I yeah.

52:30.320 --> 52:36.240
I'm all for Metroid Prime 4 can take its time to be done when it's done.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.840
And here's the thing.

52:37.840 --> 52:40.640
It didn't specifically have to be Metroid Prime 4.

52:40.640 --> 52:43.120
But being at a 3 or like anything.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.160
Show us enough.

52:44.160 --> 52:46.000
Hey, here's an update on these games.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.120
They can even preface it.

52:47.120 --> 52:50.480
These games are coming out, you know, much a little bit later, like, you know.

52:50.480 --> 52:53.600
But we want to show you here where here's some of the progress that we've made.

52:54.480 --> 52:58.880
You know, kind of like how movies will say here's here's a still from the production set.

52:58.880 --> 53:02.640
Here's a new actor that we've got in the game, which to be fair, I guess Death Stranding did do.

53:02.640 --> 53:04.880
But, you know, here's a new character in these games.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.240
Nintendo loves to show new characters.

53:06.240 --> 53:10.640
I did want to back up, though, real quick to talk one more about Ubisoft.

53:11.200 --> 53:15.120
Um, I think it was Ubisoft or maybe I'm thinking Bethesda.

53:15.120 --> 53:15.600
One of them.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.640
I can't remember which one.

53:16.640 --> 53:20.800
The highlighted all the developers that were making their games.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.400
And maybe that was Bethesda I'm thinking of.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.480
Well, they do that big intro reel with Bethesda.

53:24.480 --> 53:26.880
But I think now Ubisoft are the annoying marching band.

53:26.880 --> 53:29.040
OK, now I'm getting it cleared now.

53:29.040 --> 53:29.520
Sorry.

53:29.520 --> 53:30.560
No, that's all right.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.760
It's nice.

53:31.760 --> 53:34.000
It's nice to see the faces behind this.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
And I think a lot of times, you know, when gamers on Twitter can be really fucking mean

53:38.000 --> 53:39.840
sometimes and social media in general, Facebook, too.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.680
I always make fun of Twitter.

53:41.680 --> 53:45.360
But the reality is Facebook comments are even worse.

53:45.360 --> 53:48.880
Like if you go read Facebook comments on a lot of like public posts the companies make,

53:48.880 --> 53:51.280
there's so much fucking garbage that people write on Facebook.

53:51.280 --> 53:55.280
It's a good thing that their algorithm is such shit that it's really hard to find anything.

53:55.280 --> 53:55.840
Lord.

53:55.840 --> 54:01.040
Anyway, but my point with all that is like people really will razz games and be you know,

54:01.040 --> 54:04.240
we forget that there are so many hard working people that make games.

54:04.240 --> 54:09.680
And like, you know, I anytime that I feel like I personally have taken issues with what

54:09.680 --> 54:13.920
game companies do or things, it's very high level executive decision type of things that

54:13.920 --> 54:15.520
really tend to piss me off.

54:15.520 --> 54:18.720
Like the whole EA thing like disclosure.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.640
I know people that work at EA, OK?

54:20.640 --> 54:23.840
Like, you know, you do a show for 16 years, you're going to meet some people, OK?

54:23.840 --> 54:28.640
So I know people that work with EA and and obviously the problems that I have with what

54:28.640 --> 54:33.200
has happened with Mass Effect, what is happening with loot boxes, what is happening with Anthem.

54:33.200 --> 54:36.240
I would place none of that blame on those hard working people that are just being told,

54:36.240 --> 54:39.520
you know, being doing what they are supposed to do and doing it well.

54:39.520 --> 54:43.600
These are obviously when it comes to the money, the loot boxes, the how Mass Effect

54:43.600 --> 54:44.640
was handled and all that stuff.

54:44.640 --> 54:46.400
That's boardroom fucking decisions.

54:46.400 --> 54:50.400
And that is where oftentimes, unfortunately, people are brought into those boardrooms that

54:50.400 --> 54:51.840
aren't gamers.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.440
And I will tie this together.

54:53.440 --> 54:59.360
I think part of why Microsoft is in a much better place now with the Xbox One than it

54:59.360 --> 55:02.000
was when it was unveiled is you had Don Mattrick.

55:03.040 --> 55:06.640
Who is a little more that thing I was talking about that isn't such a great thing to have

55:06.640 --> 55:11.440
in boardrooms versus Phil Spencer, who clearly is a gamer himself.

55:12.320 --> 55:15.840
You have a very different person at the front of the wheel.

55:15.840 --> 55:19.920
That's also, I think, why Nintendo is mostly successful with Iwata at the helm.

55:19.920 --> 55:20.880
Oh, for sure.

55:20.880 --> 55:23.760
And even Reggie, you know, Reggie came from fucking Panda Express.

55:23.760 --> 55:24.800
People forget that.

55:24.800 --> 55:29.600
But Reggie, you still feel whether whether it's genuine or not, honestly, you he still

55:29.600 --> 55:31.280
shows enthusiasm for games.

55:31.280 --> 55:34.880
He's willing to get in there, make fun of it all.

55:34.880 --> 55:36.320
Play the games.

55:36.320 --> 55:36.800
Take it on.

55:36.800 --> 55:41.120
So you get the sense that he loves video games, whether it's legit or not.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.960
That's what he's able to show off.

55:42.960 --> 55:43.460
You know what I mean?

55:44.080 --> 55:45.040
So anyway.

55:45.040 --> 55:48.880
And also, honestly, Panda Express, pretty good, fast, casual food.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.400
And I'm not being made to say that.

55:51.760 --> 55:53.840
So Reggie's had a pretty successful past.

55:53.840 --> 55:58.720
Anyway, Dartetsuya in chat says, I definitely admire Reggie's dedication.

55:58.720 --> 56:01.360
Dungeon Buster says, got tired of the toxicity.

56:02.080 --> 56:02.800
Yeah, for sure.

56:02.800 --> 56:03.440
For sure.

56:03.440 --> 56:06.320
Bobby Blackwell points out, Bethesda always starts with their people.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.360
Yes, it's very important.

56:08.080 --> 56:12.480
And Sia Tabiri says, npr.org completely disabled their comment section last year or two years

56:12.480 --> 56:13.120
ago.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.360
All comment sections get bad sometimes.

56:15.360 --> 56:17.600
The VoG network comments aren't too bad.

56:17.600 --> 56:18.880
Not that that's a challenge.

56:18.880 --> 56:20.720
Please do not come up to that challenge.

56:20.720 --> 56:22.720
But I think it's because no one's using them.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.080
Very few people are.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.760
Leave some comments on episodes.

56:25.760 --> 56:26.960
I see one once in a while.

56:26.960 --> 56:32.000
I see you guys, especially overseas people that are leaving the comments on the episodes.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.040
We could use a few more.

56:33.040 --> 56:36.000
Show the internet how to behave, VoG network folks.

56:36.000 --> 56:36.320
All right.

56:36.320 --> 56:42.080
Anyway, if that's it for Nintendo and the E3 conferences, let's move on to our gaming

56:42.080 --> 56:42.400
weeks.

56:42.400 --> 56:45.600
Let's quickly, because we are an hour in and I know we only have Jamie till nine o'clock

56:45.600 --> 56:46.080
tonight.

56:46.080 --> 56:47.360
Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.720
So Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.

56:48.720 --> 56:49.360
Some Kirby.

56:51.040 --> 56:55.680
Also, mostly a lot of pinball because we had pinball league at my house on Thursday.

56:56.800 --> 56:58.640
I'm still playing idle pouring.

56:58.640 --> 56:59.760
I'm still playing Pokemon Go.

56:59.760 --> 57:01.120
We played some Pokemon Go today.

57:03.440 --> 57:08.160
Mostly I've just been reading a lot because books have kind of been my refuge while last

57:08.160 --> 57:09.120
week was kind of crap.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.560
So yeah.

57:12.240 --> 57:12.880
All right.

57:12.880 --> 57:13.840
Lots of pinball though.

57:13.840 --> 57:17.600
I'm sorry to hear about the crap, but I'm glad video games were there to help you in

57:17.600 --> 57:18.240
my garage.

57:18.240 --> 57:21.920
We have a guardians of the galaxy and it's fucking fun.

57:21.920 --> 57:23.120
It's a very colorful table.

57:23.120 --> 57:23.680
Very loud.

57:24.320 --> 57:28.480
I told Dan I'd be willing to sell Star Trek to get a guardians of the galaxy.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.800
So there may be some changes in my house.

57:30.800 --> 57:32.000
Ooh, friendly reminder too.

57:32.880 --> 57:35.920
I know this isn't you, Dark Sakura, but for the pinball fans out there that don't mind

57:35.920 --> 57:41.120
playing on PC, don't forget those license tables are going away at the end of June.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.640
So this like last chance.

57:42.640 --> 57:47.520
So a reminder, if you didn't drop your 200 bucks on buying all those old tables yet or

57:47.520 --> 57:49.120
however much it was, I don't remember the cost.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.040
Loki, let's do your gaming week.

57:51.040 --> 57:52.080
We'll go to Bradley.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.760
I didn't play much this week.

57:53.760 --> 57:55.920
I did play a little bit of Super Mario Odyssey.

57:55.920 --> 57:59.520
Still trying to just get all the power moons.

57:59.520 --> 58:03.120
So I finished the Luncheon Kingdom.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.560
I think I've gotten all of them there.

58:04.560 --> 58:06.160
So I moved on to other things.

58:06.160 --> 58:11.280
And then so that's two out of however many kingdoms are that I've gotten everything in.

58:11.840 --> 58:16.960
And then I did download the Octopath Traveler demo, but I still haven't played it yet.

58:16.960 --> 58:23.760
A little bit more Pokemon conquest and or Pokemon quest conquest would be even better.

58:24.720 --> 58:27.680
But Pokemon quest, I played that and Pokemon go.

58:27.680 --> 58:33.600
And I keep forgetting to mention every week, but still playing dance dance revolution extreme.

58:33.600 --> 58:34.640
So doing that.

58:36.400 --> 58:37.360
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

58:38.800 --> 58:39.680
No, not a ton.

58:40.320 --> 58:41.440
OK, let's go over to Bradley.

58:41.440 --> 58:42.560
How was your gaming week?

58:42.560 --> 58:42.880
All right.

58:42.880 --> 58:48.400
So aside from the other the aforementioned Slay the Spire also been playing.

58:48.960 --> 58:53.440
I play pretty much play Fire Emblem Heroes every day.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.880
At least like a little bit of it just for whatever.

58:58.240 --> 59:01.680
Also playing SteamWorld Heist.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.240
Oh, yeah, I know those games.

59:04.240 --> 59:04.960
Yeah.

59:04.960 --> 59:05.200
Yeah.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.960
Basically, it's a sort of a strategy platform sort of thing.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.960
Try to get into position and shoot the enemies and all that.

59:12.960 --> 59:13.840
So that's pretty fun.

59:14.560 --> 59:17.840
And I also played the Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.

59:19.760 --> 59:21.200
Pretty much wrapping up that game.

59:22.160 --> 59:25.760
There was like two other achievements that I got to do it the correct way.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.560
What are you playing that on PC?

59:28.560 --> 59:28.800
Yeah.

59:28.800 --> 59:28.960
Yeah.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.360
So I figured because you mentioned you didn't have the newer consoles.

59:31.360 --> 59:34.560
The not Castlevania wink pretty much.

59:34.560 --> 59:37.360
Doesn't it feel like it's just it's just Castlevania pretty much pretty much.

59:38.320 --> 59:38.800
But it's great.

59:38.800 --> 59:39.120
It's great.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.320
It's nice to have a new game like that.

59:41.600 --> 59:41.840
Yeah.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.760
And I'm not too much else I've met.

59:45.040 --> 59:45.520
All right.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.240
My gaming week.

59:46.240 --> 59:48.080
So I'm pretty much old favorites for me.

59:48.080 --> 59:52.160
Diablo three season 14 start of season 14 of Diablo 14.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.760
That's really started this past week.

59:53.760 --> 59:54.800
So I was like, oh, what the hell?

59:54.800 --> 59:58.640
So how often do they do is like every quarter reset them about every three months.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.760
So they were playing with the time at some point.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.480
It was four months.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.440
Somebody was two months.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.520
I think they're settled on like a three month average.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.120
So I started a witch doctor for season 14 and I haven't been power leveled.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.880
So I've grind my own levels up to I think I'm about 48 right now.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.880
So I'll be by the time the next episode of our airs in two weeks,

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.640
I'll be like Paragon 500.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.080
It's just the way these things go.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.000
Although then again, I can't play when I'm in Chicago, so maybe not.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.040
But I've been playing that.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.520
I got sucked into heroes of the storm again.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.600
So it's like I'm back on my blizzard.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:30.800
Bullshit.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.360
Basically, I'm playing with the casual blizzard games and doing that.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.880
So I've been playing heroes of the storm.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.880
I've been watching heroes of the storm on Twitch because they do like some of the drops.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.200
I guess right now you can get loot boxes for like watching people play heroes of the storm on Twitch.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.720
It's actually a really cool little promotion.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.840
I don't think it made our show roll,

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.840
but I thought it was very clever that like the game makers are rewarding people

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.480
with items in that game for watching that game.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.080
And especially for something that's a free to play game like heroes of the storm.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.040
It's very, you know, it gives people more people an excuse to check it out.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.640
I'm only level 70, which I know people that are in hundreds of levels.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.800
But guys, I only ever play AI.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.600
I have done that completely like AI matches.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.400
So if I had more friends that I played with on a regular basis,

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400
I might do more like player versus player.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.680
But for right now, like AI allows me to get quest done every day,

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.360
get the gold to buy new characters.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.480
And that's just kind of what I do.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.040
So I was doing a little bit of the event.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.440
They did like a wrestling event.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.640
It was kind of interesting.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.360
They did an event a couple of weeks ago,

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.200
but now they're moving into an Alterac Valley event.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.960
So I think there's a new map coming out on Tuesday.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.080
So that'll be cool.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.440
Anyway, other than that, Pokemon Go community day was Saturday.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.120
So I played lots and lots of that.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.360
Walked around Capitol Park again for three hours catching shinies.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.920
I got two shinies pretty quick.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.920
And then like that third shiny,

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.200
because you know I want a shiny for every evolution of Larvitar, right?

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.320
That third shiny would not fucking drop.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.280
So like I had two shinies by 1130.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.560
And then like 130 showed up and I still didn't have a third shiny.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.840
And I was getting really pissed off.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.040
But then by some miracle, I caught two more shinies.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.760
Phew, so I had my four shinies by the time the event was done.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.640
And I Pinat buried almost every single...

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.840
I went into the event with 90 Pinat berries.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.520
I used them all.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:19.040
So I walked out of that event with over a thousand Larvitar candy.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.760
And now I have an army of Tyranitar's waiting to shred up raids and things that...

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.480
Obviously, Tyranitar's won't do everything, but they do a lot.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.640
Especially, you know, because some have fire blasts,

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.600
some have the, you know, Stone Edge and, you know, the different moves.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.840
Well, didn't you get all of them that you evolved during the event?

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.240
I evolved two to get Smackdown, yes.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.240
So I caught a couple high level wonders at the park and I evolved those

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.040
to just have a high level Tyranitar with those moves out the gate.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.600
It's a bummer because I had a level 100...

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:54.160
Or I'm sorry, a 100% IV Larvitar from back when scanners were available

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.760
and people would post to our raiding group.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.800
They'd say, there's a 100% Larvitar over at the, you know, the...

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.240
Where was this at?

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.920
It was at an apartment complex somewhere.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.680
So we drove over there because we happened to...

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.320
Me and one of my Ingress buddies were out playing Ingress

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.240
when that message came in and it was like, 100% Larvitar, turn Ingress off.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.520
We're gonna go get this.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.160
So we did.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.240
So we went and grabbed it.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.080
And so, but I had already evolved that to Tyranitar all the time.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.040
So are those the ones that like come up as a wonder or how the...

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:19.760
They're a wonder.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.760
It'll go, if you're on blue team, the language in red and yellow is different,

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.560
but for blue team, it says, this Pokemon is a wonder.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:31.280
Its best stat is attack, matched by its defense, matched by its HP.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.840
And then it goes, the stats are so impressive.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.400
It's amazing.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:38.560
I don't remember the exact verbiage, but basically it's a 15 basically in that stat.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.520
So yeah.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.760
So anyway, that was my gaming week.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.440
Mostly those games.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.000
So yeah.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.560
Let's move on and get into some gaming news.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.240
As a reminder, guys, for housekeeping, we will not be here next week.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.600
I'm gonna be out of town in Chicago.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.840
We're just gonna take a week off, but we'll be back in two weeks

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.960
for the next year of Orange Lounge Radio and what's to come in the next year.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.000
I will say this though.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.400
We are...

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.400
I don't want to be too much of a tease,

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.400
but there's going to be some big changes by the end of the year.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.640
Not with hosts or anything like that.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.720
Just there's going to be some big changes at the end of the year.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.720
And I think you guys will like them and that's all.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.760
I hope you guys like them.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.480
That's why we're doing them.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.040
So we'll, it's something you guys have been asking for for a long time.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.640
So we'll give you more on that at a later date.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.800
In the meantime, let's get into some gaming news for this week.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.680
Loki.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.760
So let's talk about, since we didn't talk about during the, you know, recap of E3,

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.760
the PC gaming show.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.720
So there's a few things.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.920
I personally hate watching the PC gaming show because it would be pretty dumb,

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.080
but there were a few things that get announced out there.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.800
So one of my favorite studios, Coffee Stain Studios,

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.360
has a new game coming out called Satisfactory,

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.560
which is like a survival game.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.760
You can build these different machines that do different automations and whatnot.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.440
So that's pretty cool.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.520
And they have a closed alpha coming pretty soon.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.640
There's a game called Neo Cab, which is about a futuristic

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.040
or glass cab, human cab driver in a futuristic city.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.840
And that's coming out in 2019, February 5th.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.720
A game called Mavericks Proving Grounds,

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.480
which looks like a battle royale game with a thousand concurrent players.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.040
So that sounds pretty neat.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.200
No word on one that's out.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.400
Game called The Forgotten City, which is like a...

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:22.960
I'm sorry.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.520
One versus a hundred wasn't enough.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.840
Wait until you try one versus a thousand

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.000
and realize you're going to place no higher than nine hundred and ninety eight.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.560
Yeah.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.160
After the two people that disconnected.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.320
Let's see, they have a game.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.520
They showed off Forgotten City, which is coming in 2019.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.120
A game that's kind of interesting for me

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.160
because I used to play the old Star Control games, the Star Control Origins,

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.440
which showed off like they have it's an open universe action RPG.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.160
They guess they're launching that on September 20th.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.080
A game called The Hunt or Hunt Showdown,

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.280
which I think is a survival FPS game by Crytek.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.240
A game called Archangel Hellfire.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.080
It's a 2v2 PvP multiplayer mech shooter.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.720
Let's see what else.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.120
They showed off some stuff for Warframe.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.440
Now it's more Sega PC titles coming.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.800
So Shenmue 1 and 2, Yakuza Kiwami,

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.440
Valkria Chronicles 4 and Yakuza 0.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.920
So and Shining Resonance are all going to be making their way to the PC now.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.080
Killing Floor 2.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:32.880
What else?

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.120
We had another.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.840
They showed off some gameplay for Jurassic World Evolution,

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.320
a game called Stormland, which is an open world VR game.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.960
That Jurassic World Evolution,

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.880
a lot of people have been playing that on Twitch lately.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.320
People are I guess those people that are playing the the SimCity and the city.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.360
Oh my God.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.120
Why can't I remember that again?

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.440
Cities Evolved or Cities Skylines.

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:57.840
That's it.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.280
Skylines seem to be into Jurassic World right now.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:01.520
Yeah.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.520
It's like a little memory like of a theme park game.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:03.760
It is.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.640
But it's where the obviously the dinosaurs can kill everyone.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.440
So that's kind of fun.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.000
That's always fun.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:08.500
Yeah.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.420
What else?

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.080
Stormland.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:13.920
I think I talked about that.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.040
Night Call, which is you play as a Paris taxi driver.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.440
Tiger Claw says it's from the developers of Planet Coaster.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.360
So there's a reason why it feels adjacent.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:21.920
That's pretty awesome.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.480
That is awesome.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:31.200
They showed off some Star Citizen stuff and then they kind of got into a monitor.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.280
Of course, this is a PC gaming show, a game called Genesis Alpha 1.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.000
I think this show was like three hours long, so there's a ton of shit.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.120
Don't Starve Hamlet.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.800
I'm not really sure what that is.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.880
More DLC for Don't Starve, I guess.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.280
I guess.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:43.780
Yeah.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.200
They showed off Just Cause 4 on PC and talked about the, you know,

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.440
upgrades that PC version is going to get.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:55.840
They had the Walking Dead FPS game from Overkill that's coming out on November 4th.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.560
They also talked a little bit about the Walking Dead, the Telltale series.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.600
They have the final season coming out August 14th.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.680
And what's kind of unique about this season, though, is it's going to have unscripted combat

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.320
and some more free camera scenes.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:17.280
A game called Noita, which is a pixelated side scroller cave adventure game.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:17.520
All right.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.120
Anything we're dying for over here, Loki?

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.560
There's a game called Realm Royale, Hitman 2.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.720
Oh, I think that Realm Royale is showing up on Twitch too.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.720
I think it's a real game.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.880
And then a game that looked kind of neat.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.600
Ooblets.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.160
I've been seeing a lot of that on my Twitter feed.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.720
It's kind of like a Pokemon Animal Crossing game.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.080
Bobby points out that Realm Royale is the same studio high res that does Smite and Paladins.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.280
I thought so by the logo.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.920
The logo is like the same font as Paladins.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:48.960
Yeah.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.760
All right.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.320
And yeah, they have like another battle royale, Rapture Rejects, which is another battle royale.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.400
So all the battle royale games are the PC gaming show.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.400
Like all the just about all of them are over there.

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.680
The Rapture Rejects one.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.320
I like to mention this one is kind of cool because I did see this

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.880
on YouTube because it's Cyanide and Happiness co-created it.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.400
So it's their art style.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.160
And I fucking love Cyanide and Happiness.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.480
So that looks awesome.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.560
Well, something else that could have been a Nintendo's little event that was missing was

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.000
non-games.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.800
I mean, yeah, I know we don't want to fixate too much on that.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.720
Like, look at what happened at the Xbox One reveal.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.760
But it might have been nice to hear, oh, hey, Netflix, YouTube going to come to Switch.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.960
And apparently it looked like that was going to happen because Best Buy

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960
had leaked something on their website.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.320
I say leaked, but obviously it didn't happen.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.920
But they said that it listed features on the Nintendo Switch as Netflix and YouTube right

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.480
alongside Hulu, which we know is already there.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.800
Unfortunately, the direct happened and it wasn't there.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.360
And Best Buy did say that, oh, it was an error.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.720
You know, of course, they kind of cover their tracks a little bit there and say that was

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.920
an error because, of course, that picture with Netflix and YouTube made its way all

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.960
around the Internet.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.920
So, of course, Reggie Fils-Aime kind of got asked about it in one of the many E3 interviews.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.160
And he said in a quote in one of the interviews, when we launched the Switch, we were very

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.720
clear we wanted to position the device as a game playing device.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.360
We've done that.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.320
And so you've seen Hulu, for example, come onto the platform.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.520
In terms of other services, the conversations are ongoing.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.120
We've got nothing to announce right now, but certainly those opportunities will come

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.240
in due time.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.320
So in many ways, it's the same line we've been getting ever since the launch of the

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:26.800
system.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.800
Like, sure, we'll do it at some point, but we're just trying to focus on the games because

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.080
that's what you all want us to do anyway, which is kind of the underlying overtone.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.960
But he didn't say never.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.640
He said in due time.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:44.560
So it certainly seems like we'll have Netflix and YouTube when they talk about the networks.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.280
Yeah, maybe.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:45.840
You know what?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.760
It would be a good coupling with online stuff.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.920
So maybe that'll be when they unveil it.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.600
But at the same time, when it comes to setting expectations in Nintendo, I think it would

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.280
just be a bad idea to do that ever.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:03.280
So we'll just we'll just sit here and be surprised by whatever it ends up being.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.880
So all right.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.360
Anyway, let's move on.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.720
Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.520
Something that people don't always expect to hear on the show, stocks.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.480
Although I have said that the way to have some say in a company is to own some stock

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:18.960
in it.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.460
Hello.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:26.180
But anyway, there were some pretty big stock changes that came out of news from E3.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:35.140
In fact, three of the biggest stock increases went for Take-Two, for EA and for Blizzard.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:40.740
So those three had the biggest stock increase, which keep in mind, you know, again, the stocks

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:47.620
are an indicator of how not just how the company is performing, but also, you know, where their

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.340
strength is.

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.420
You know, a company that's making more money is going to be in a stronger position to do

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:52.980
more.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:57.060
And of course, you know, again, money into the local economy.

01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:57.560
Hello.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:04.420
But companies that took a hit was Nintendo dropped ten point four percent.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.860
Who knew that all those investors were also eagerly awaiting Animal Crossing on the switch?

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:16.180
No, it's because all those investors, they're like, wait, where's Waluigi?

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.180
Sell.

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.260
You know who's not investing is Tom Nook.

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.020
But they're investing in turnips.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:26.980
Sony dropped one point seven percent.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:29.460
Microsoft just barely dipped like point two percent.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.980
Other ones that did get a hit were Logitech.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:40.900
AMD took an increase and so did Nvidia, I guess, with, you know, seeing how.

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.340
So this this E3 kind of I don't want to say it was a flop,

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:50.580
but this E3 from a financial stock perspective, like nobody was excited out of E3.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:55.460
And honestly, in talking to a lot of like fans and things and I feel like a lot of people

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.700
are walking out of this E3 going, it's OK.

01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.220
It wasn't the best.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:06.100
The thing is, is that the largest players, you know, in I would say generally at E3 were

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:07.380
the ones to take a hit.

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.420
Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:18.580
But all the smaller ones and maybe the medium developers seem to be doing pretty well coming

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.060
out of this.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:25.700
So, you know, this I think it's really showing that people are more looking toward not toward

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:29.620
the very biggest of the names, but looking toward the software publishers as opposed

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.740
to the hardware providers.

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:35.700
And this is this is good information to look at, because ultimately, like your letter grade

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.540
on Twitter doesn't mean shit.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:40.500
This is what this is where the money is.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:40.900
Yeah.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.900
Well, some of that could have come out of copy text as well, because their show was the

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:47.380
week before and they were showing off all the PC hardware stuff.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:53.220
Maybe some maybe some of the AMD and things, but not not the big three.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:53.380
Yeah.

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:58.980
The ones that are like and I mean like hardware, not like console hardware is the one that

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.100
are the ones taking the hit.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.900
But I think the component providers are the ones that really.

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:10.260
Because, I mean, basically a lot more home gaming is being done, I think, on higher end

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:10.820
PCs.

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.580
It's really gotten an increase, I think.

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:17.620
Even I was reading another article that Turtle Beach has actually had an increase in revenue

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.500
thanks to Fortnite directly because of Fortnite.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.060
Oh, sure.

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:21.620
Yeah, sure.

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:22.760
Good call.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:27.380
Rama in chat says, fuck Waluigi, to which I respond.

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:34.260
When and Dungeon Buster in chat says investors were hoping for a stronger holiday showing

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.420
from Nintendo, from what I read.

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:42.260
But are we I mean, are we even if you have a pretty strong holiday, they've got a Mario

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:48.660
Party game, a Pokemon spin off, but like one of the more logical spin offs.

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.140
If you're going to spin anything off, spin off the mobile.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.180
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.460
It's still like Pokemon.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:58.180
And they got obviously Smash Brothers, which, you know, is a top 20 of all time.

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:03.620
And I watch and I didn't watch you casually some of the Nintendo Treehouse stuff.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:08.260
And I got to say, as a person who doesn't play Pokemon, I want that Pokemon game.

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:14.100
I mean, my kids want that game like Loki is talking positive about Nintendo like a lot.

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.100
And it's because of that Pokemon game.

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:20.820
So like y'all, I'll be picking up all three of their games this new holiday.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:25.540
Nintendo fans that always send the angry emails about Loki and his fits like like y'all

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.180
hearing this.

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.060
Y'all hearing it.

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.980
I only I I criticize because I love.

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:31.300
I know.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:31.700
I know.

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:32.980
We've said that over and over again.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.860
Bobby says two Pokemon games, not three.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.380
It's still the same thing.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.260
It is the same thing.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.540
Oh, he could be talking about the mainline game.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.820
They did kind of right.

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.660
They did a tickle to say mainline Pokemon isn't dead.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.100
It's coming in 2019.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.220
Then that's fine.

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:55.620
I'm talking about like, you know, and then your your dumb little Pokemon quest thing,

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.700
I guess, could be counted as a game in some ways.

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.580
That'll be on mobile.

01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:59.140
It's still a game.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.100
I mean, I still play it.

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.740
That's that's the one I don't get.

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:05.140
Even I look at that going, Loki, why do you like that?

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.020
Holy shit, by the way.

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.540
Well, all right.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.380
Don't mean to derail, but there was actually a big earthquake in Osaka.

01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:13.860
Oh, no.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:14.900
Yeah.

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.260
What what what did Richter scale?

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.100
Uh, lower sixes.

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:26.100
OK, I mean, but at least it's not an eight, you know, derailed some trains and killed

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:26.580
two people.

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.860
So just saying, I didn't mean to interrupt for anything like that, but I mean, no, that's

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:30.100
OK.

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.300
I thought we have listeners in Japan and friends in the area.

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:38.740
So just stopping to acknowledge and give you all tsunamis are going to be the big concern

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.460
center center central of the country.

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.460
So I don't think oh, so then the water would go.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:43.700
Yeah.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:44.500
So it's not going to do that.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.140
OK, that's great.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:45.940
That's good.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:46.580
Anyway.

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:47.060
OK.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.900
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOG Network

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.380
dot com, use the passphrase window.

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:57.780
Let's move on, though, with some other news.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:58.820
So, Loki.

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:00.100
All right.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:04.980
So Valve is, I guess, doing something.

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.500
I mean, they decided now they're going to put some limitations.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.860
They're trying to stop a lot of these like sketchy games are coming to steam.

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:18.740
One type of game that comes out there is these achievement games that basically spam, you

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.580
know, achievements.

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.380
You play the games like, oh, hey, you get 100 trophies all of a sudden.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.220
So what they're doing is they're putting in some sort of limitations for that.

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:34.580
So with with this, they're basically going to limit games to having 100 achievements

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.020
and there's supposed to be some sort of like confidence metric.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:41.220
They'll prevent features.

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.500
OK, I can't hold it in.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:47.060
Why all of a sudden to steam feel like, oh, but we need to regulate this.

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.820
Oh, steam.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:53.860
Oh, I thought there was supposed to be things in games that purposefully make you mad.

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:58.580
This has been like this has been an issue for like a long time.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.180
Why now are they fixing this?

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:04.420
You know, and yeah, and to your point, you know, oh, offensive content.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.260
Well, the whole platform is fucking broken.

01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:07.540
I mean, it's what it is.

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.940
And steam fix your life.

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:15.220
If it wasn't so convenient to get stuff, you know, on that platform, then, yeah.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:21.140
But here's the other problem, too, with steam, though, like, I don't know, like, I just feel

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:25.300
they like even their sales and stuff, it's just hard to get excited about anymore.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:29.860
When I see people with garbage achievements, I go, oh, look, they got a garbage achievement

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.940
like it does.

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.620
I just feel like, OK, fine.

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.300
Is is this need fixing?

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:36.900
I guess if it's ton and ton and spam.

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.540
What is exactly the trophies do?

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.620
Is that like raise your level or something?

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:44.180
I don't I don't fucking know anymore, Loki.

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.380
I don't fucking know anymore.

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:47.780
And who gives a shit about what level you are on steam?

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:50.500
Does anybody go like I'm a level 20 on steam?

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:55.780
If if it still works the same way when it first came out, it affects the drop rate of

01:18:55.780 --> 01:19:02.580
the cards every time I see now every 10 levels you go up on steam, you get a higher chance.

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:09.380
So what happens is they're power leveling the box, they're farming the cards so they

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:13.220
get more drops so they can make more money off the broken ass platform that steam has

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:15.540
let them get away with for such a long time.

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:20.740
I see it's all about the steam, steam, steam, steam.

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:21.380
Have a seat.

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:21.860
Steam.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.620
We need to talk at your life.

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.660
Look at your choices.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.020
Look at your life, look at your choices.

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.500
The call is coming from inside the house.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.100
That's all I have to say.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.860
Steam, the call is coming from inside the house.

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.220
Why don't you fix that?

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:39.620
Yeah, moving on.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:45.860
Hey, let's talk about the switch and some big arcade announcements that were not a part

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:50.180
of the big press thing that they did.

01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:57.380
But they came out later because they like to drop little things during the tree house

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.260
thing, right?

01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:58.580
Right.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:19:59.700
That was the one thing.

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:05.300
It's like, I can't watch all three days of this, but yeah, so I have to wait for people

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.740
to report on it for me.

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:12.420
But anyway, it did come out that Donkey Kong, the arcade Donkey Kong has come out to the

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.700
Nintendo switch.

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:17.860
Now this is kind of a big deal because Nintendo has released Donkey Kong time and time and

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:18.500
time again.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:23.060
But what they tend to release is that original NES cartridge of Donkey Kong, which was not

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.660
an arcade perfect port.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.980
It's missing the pie factory.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.860
So which was, did y'all know there's a board in Donkey Kong?

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.460
It's actually a cement factory, but I call it the pie factory.

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.260
They look like pies, even though it's supposed to be the whole thing that was supposed to

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.100
be like a construction scene.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:40.500
Yeah.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:45.780
So cement mixer in pie, whatever, which goes with the other boards.

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.140
You know, I'll have a construction theme.

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:47.540
Absolutely.

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:50.180
It looks like a pie factory, but it's cement factory.

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.180
But regardless, that board is in this.

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:56.580
So that's a pretty big deal because it's a more authentic, if you will, port of Donkey

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:56.820
Kong.

01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:02.980
So that is available and it's going to be on the switch for $7.99 through the arcade

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:03.780
archives.

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:08.740
This actually has the Japanese version to the Japanese original, the updated Japanese

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.220
original with bug fixes and the international version.

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:15.380
You can play a vertical layout by rotating 90 degrees.

01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:16.100
That's rad.

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:16.820
That's awesome.

01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:20.660
Is it going to be so convincing that certain professional Donkey Kong players aren't going

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.980
to be able to tell the difference between this and an arcade version?

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.940
I'm going to defer all those questions to Bobby Black.

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:27.220
All right.

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:29.380
Just confirming, you know, it can be confusing.

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:31.380
He's the variety spokesperson now.

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:35.380
Dartage Studio says, to be fair, they did have an edited NES version that re-added the

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:38.660
cement factory level, but this is the first time the honest to goodness arcade version

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:39.220
has been released.

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:39.700
Yes.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.060
And for the record, I still believe that the ColecoVision version was superior to the

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:44.420
Nintendo version, but.

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:49.220
And I prefer the Commodore 64 version, but that's also my fandom from when I was a kid.

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:51.780
Now, something else to keep in mind.

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:54.340
This was not the only arcade game that they released.

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.180
This is kind of a big deal.

01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.460
Sky Skipper also is getting a release.

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:02.500
Sky Skipper never got formally released in arcades.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.060
They did some location testing in 1981.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:06.020
That was it.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.020
Also, I think, didn't this cabinet show up at like Southern Fried Game Room Expo or something

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:10.340
like that?

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:14.660
Like, I feel like this cabinet is like one of those things that shows up rarely, but

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.260
anyway, or maybe they rebuilt it or something.

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:16.740
I don't know.

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:22.020
But apparently Nintendo had to extract the ROM from the only arcade cabinet still in

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.860
existence to make this happen.

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:25.620
So this is like a rare Nintendo.

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.500
You are sitting on a joke.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.300
What do you want to say?

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:31.620
I'm just saying, just based off their previous experience with Virtual Console, they extracted

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.100
off of the arcade board that they downloaded off the Internet.

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:36.660
You know, how did that come about?

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:38.820
All right.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:44.020
Anyway, Darticcia does confirm it was a Sky Skipper cabinet that was restored at last

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.380
year's Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.420
So, yeah, very cool.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.180
So anyway, that is also available now.

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:53.380
So if you want to take something from the archives of Nintendo that was never released,

01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:57.220
well, it wasn't Mother 3, but you got this.

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:57.940
It's something.

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.940
Anyway, at least Mother 3 was released somewhere.

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.620
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you got?

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:10.820
Well, how about one of our favorite things that has taken over Netflix?

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:11.700
Stranger Things.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:12.740
Queer Eye.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:14.660
Season 2.

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:15.380
Stranger Things.

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:21.860
Anyway, it looks like Telltale has got the rights to do a Stranger Things game.

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.140
So and, of course, we know what Telltale is best at.

01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:28.820
It's interactive adventures and point and click goodies.

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:36.260
So they are actually doing a Stranger Things game.

01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:38.180
It's actually still in the project state.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:45.060
It hasn't been determined on, you know, what exactly the story is going to be or when it's

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:45.700
going to be out.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:50.580
But they say that it's not going to be on Netflix at all, so there won't be any kind

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:51.300
of story to it.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.300
They're just it's all going to be pure game.

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.660
So there you go.

01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:00.340
This is one of the things that when I heard the news, I was like, oh, yeah, I guess I

01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:04.340
guess it would make sense for Stranger Things to have a game like this.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.500
I mean, I know there's that crappy little cell phone.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:10.500
I shouldn't call it crappy, but it was a cell phone game and very much just a cell phone

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.940
game of Stranger Things that came out.

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:15.300
So it makes sense that, you know, they're getting something a little more substantial.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.420
Yeah, substantial.

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:17.220
That's a good word for it.

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.380
Substantial and not upside down.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.340
Yes, correct.

01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:20.740
All right.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.620
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.180
Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:29.460
And you've got another big story from this week, Loki.

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.660
Yes, I do.

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:37.700
So right after, you know, they announced during the Nintendo Direct that, hey, Fortnite is

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.540
on the Switch and you can play it now.

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:46.740
Well, unfortunately, some people couldn't just play it right now because they found

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:54.020
out when they tried to log in that they couldn't if they happen to have played on a PlayStation

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:55.460
4, because that's right.

01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:03.380
While the system or the game is cross platform or cross play, it can only cross play with

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:06.580
Fortnite on PC, mobile and Xbox One.

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:09.860
You can't play it if you've accessed it on the PlayStation 4.

01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:15.380
The only way you can get to play that is if you create a new account.

01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:20.180
In fact, you can even unlink it from the PlayStation 4 and it'll still say, nope, sorry,

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:20.740
can't do it.

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.740
That is such bullshit.

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.260
But that's even unlink it.

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:25.300
That's OK, though.

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:31.860
So Sony did make a response regarding this, and their response was very, very to the point.

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:36.260
We're always open to hearing what the PlayStation community is interested in to enhance their

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:37.140
gaming experience.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:38.100
Done.

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.340
And the lie detector test is determined.

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:47.140
That was a lie because people have been harping on Sony about this cross play thing for a

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:47.380
while.

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:48.740
It happened with Rocket League.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.980
It's happening with Minecraft, although that one with Microsoft owning Minecraft is a little

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:53.780
more dicey there.

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:56.100
But we've had these cross play discussions before.

01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:00.180
Shit, we've had these discussions before when it was Microsoft that was sitting at the top

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:03.780
of the heap with the Xbox 360 when the PlayStation 3 was floundering.

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:11.620
And this whole thing about cross play and Microsoft not allowing it fucking gave a Sony

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.100
Street Fighter 5 essentially at the end of the day.

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:18.980
And Final Fantasy 14 is not on a Microsoft platform because they made those mistakes when

01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:20.260
Don Mattrick was in charge.

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:21.940
And now the tables are turned.

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.500
So no, you're not listening to what the gamers want.

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:30.900
Like, look, I think most people generally accept because there is competition that there

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.820
are things you're going to be able to play on PlayStation.

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:37.220
You can't play with your friends on Microsoft and vice versa and the whole thing.

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.380
It would be nice to see those walls come down.

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.460
And as we've illustrated many times on this show, it has come down in the past when the

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.740
companies really want it.

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:51.940
IE Final Fantasy 11 is like the only thing I can think of that was like PC, Sony, Microsoft,

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:52.420
all of that.

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:55.460
Like back in the day, Final Fantasy 11 worked on all those things.

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.820
Cross play is not hard.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:00.500
Okay, but now we've got this whole other complication as well.

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.660
It's not just the cross play thing that's annoying.

01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.700
I mean, it's a little bit annoying.

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:09.540
It's definitely not hard because I think at one point it was accidentally turned on on

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.620
the PlayStation for you to play with.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:17.700
Yeah, but what's really annoying last month, Twitch for Twitch Prime people gave away Fortnite

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:21.220
stuff and you had to basically, you know, give it get it on your account.

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.900
And it's like if you have all that on your account and you've ever played it on PlayStation

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:29.060
for even if it was just like once out of curiosity and you'd had to be too bad, you're fucked

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.580
because you can't unlink.

01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:32.420
That's the worst part of all of this.

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:37.140
In my opinion, like if Sony wants to be dicks and if they want to be like, oh, but the 80

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.340
million gamers are over here.

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.340
Bitch, you should know this by now.

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:45.860
You can have those gamers and you can lose them just as easily.

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:48.420
I got three words for you.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:50.420
Giant enemy crab.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:56.980
So y'all better watch yourselves on that throne because you had those 80 million gamers.

01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:00.580
You should learn by now the gamers can fucking turn on you like that, bitch.

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:06.900
So my suggestion is you stop this business speak and you listen to what people are telling

01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:12.900
you, and that is that, you know what, when I buy shit, I want to be able to use it when

01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:17.380
that precedent is there that it's on, you know, it carries over my PC account to PlayStation.

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:22.340
If I want to move it over to the switch because I want to play, you know, on the go at friends

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:25.780
houses and stuff with Wi-Fi and I want to play on my portable console stuff and I don't

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:29.540
want to be fucking locked in because I checked it out for five minutes on your console.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.700
Like a long time ago, then you need to like, let those people go.

01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:37.620
And there's a part of me as well that kind of wonders like,

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:43.140
is Epic necessarily blame free in this scenario?

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:46.340
I have this weird feeling. Call me crazy.

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:47.220
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:52.420
Epic may have set it up this way to push this issue with Sony.

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:58.020
This whole thing might've been done to get gamers to needle Sony on this issue.

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:00.500
And boy, are they needling Sony on this issue.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.940
Go look at any reply to a PlayStation tweet right now.

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.540
They're getting needled on this issue.

01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:12.100
And I have to wonder, is some of that maybe Epic's doing?

01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:15.380
I'm sure a little bit of it is because I'm sure that they could work it in a way that,

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:19.860
you know, Oh, any PlayStation exclusive items that you get on your play or whatever,

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.820
are just only on that platform and not necessarily,

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:26.580
you know, something you would see on another platform.

01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:27.080
Yeah.

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:32.020
S2100 Matt in chat says their response was such a slap in the face to their consumers

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:34.980
to have an address that seems like it was written by our president.

01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:36.020
Made no sense.

01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:39.780
Sure. Microsoft has messed up in the past, but had no problems making things right

01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:41.940
and communicating with their base very quickly.

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.860
Sony could use a major Nelson.

01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:46.740
I'm telling you right now, like even with like this stuff,

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:51.060
this is just between this, the way they had an old model mod support.

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:55.860
And just how even like how 4k is seems to be even better on Xbox one.

01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:00.180
Like I'm telling you that when the next round of consoles comes out, I'm going Microsoft.

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:00.680
Yeah.

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:03.940
Sony, you better watch yourself.

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.180
Like seriously, this is my, this is my loving advice.

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.260
Again, you know, I know people I'm very close with that are at Sony and I'm sure

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.300
this is not their problems.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.300
This is the problems of executive decisions.

01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:16.500
So Sony executives, listen the fuck up.

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:21.700
Microsoft just let you know this week, they are bringing in the troops.

01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:26.340
They want to snatch the crown in this next generation of gaming.

01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:33.140
Sony, if you keep doing dumb shit decisions like this and not, and compounding those dumb

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:37.940
shit statements or dumb shit decisions with really dumb shit statements, like your response

01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:41.940
to this whole thing, gamers will turn on you like that.

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.460
Listen to what Loki just said.

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.580
So Sony, you still got a window here.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:48.120
Fix it.

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.380
And yes, I am being extra sassy.

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:53.140
It's the sweet 16.

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:57.940
I wish that they, they would like support like the backwards compatibility and all that

01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:01.860
stuff because it would be nice to be able to play all these PlayStation three games

01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:04.100
that I have in my library that I can't play.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.620
But you know, Microsoft is doing that.

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:08.580
They're supporting that.

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:13.380
So, and their mod supports way better, even though both are pretty limited.

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:15.700
I guess PC would be the winner there.

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:21.540
And I mean, technically I don't need to get an Xbox one because I have a PC and I can

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.060
play all her games through that.

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:27.460
But I just like a lot of the games I play are multi-platform and it just seems like,

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:30.500
you know, like when it comes to like Skyrim and stuff like that, like the mod supports

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:31.000
is better.

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.700
Bob coffee and chat will end on this and we'll move on.

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.300
Cause our show's running very long.

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:40.100
Bob coffee and chat says it's pretty ironic when Nintendo is more open to cross play than

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.060
Sony LOL.

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.420
Isn't it though?

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:44.580
Isn't it though?

01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:49.300
Dude, do you know the other thing we haven't even brought up Loki with Nintendo and Fortnite

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.780
did do we all just like there's voice chat in Fortnite on the switch.

01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:55.380
Yeah.

01:31:55.380 --> 01:32:01.540
You just plug in any old headset and you got voice chat enabled in Fortnite on the switch.

01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:01.780
Yeah.

01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:05.380
It's like, it's so weird that the console can handle that.

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:07.460
Why the fuck do I have to have a phone app?

01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:08.260
Hold up.

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:10.340
Because that brings up a whole other thing.

01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:11.700
So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:17.780
So all this bullshit fuckery with the Nintendo app, this, this was all a ploy to get us to

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:18.900
download your shitty app.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:22.660
Nintendo that only works with one game right now.

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:25.380
And it's the most convoluted, stupid thing ever.

01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:31.300
Like that was, that was, that was the gag I was not prepared for with Fortnite on the

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:34.340
switch was this secret unlocking of, Oh yeah.

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:35.700
Voice chat's been there the whole time.

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:36.580
Works just fine.

01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:38.740
What?

01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:41.620
Yeah.

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:43.220
That I don't get like, seriously.

01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.500
No wonder more.

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:48.500
Is there a network that fucking borked that they can't fucking, Oh, I'm sorry.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:50.980
This, we just can't do voice chat.

01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:53.140
Like, do they not know how?

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:57.060
I mean, no, I think the reality is the answer you don't want to hear.

01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:03.460
Loki Nintendo is afraid of, um, pedophiles getting tied to the switch on how they met

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.500
their victims.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:08.340
That in a nutshell, that is what Nintendo remember.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:13.380
Remember when, um, I don't even remember the name of that fucking app, the drawing application

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:14.100
on 3DS.

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:17.860
Remember when not picture chat picked out, whatever that thing was, the other one that

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.820
you sent the little thing.

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.820
Remember when that got on the chat?

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:24.980
Remember when that got on the news in a negative light and it was pulled from all the 3DS is

01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:25.860
everywhere.

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:27.460
That is the root problem.

01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:28.820
Loki, whether you want to hear it or not.

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.740
I know, I know you don't want to hear it.

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:33.940
Loki, I know you don't want to hear it, but that, I'm just keeping it real.

01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:36.340
That is why voice chat is a fucking problem.

01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:39.460
And that's such a backwards way to think nowadays.

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:39.940
Swap note.

01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:40.180
Thank you.

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:40.660
Swap note.

01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:44.900
That's such a backwards way to think chat from like to chat with the DS thing.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:46.820
What year do they think they're in?

01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:51.300
I mean, seriously, how many kids nowadays have access to the internet?

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.100
Which is tablets and mobile devices.

01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:56.980
You're asking someone to have a fucking mobile device to chat.

01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.780
So they fucking have a access to the internet.

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:05.700
Why is it that you just make it so stupidly hard to just function?

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.380
Just go for the children.

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.900
It's fucking dumb.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:09.400
I don't.

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:13.300
It would be so easy to chat with friends only.

01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:15.480
Done.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.300
Exactly.

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.900
And not fucking hard.

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:21.620
The parental controls would allow your parents to see who's your friend.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.340
You have parental controls built into the fucking system.

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:26.180
I don't understand what the problem is.

01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:28.740
D'Artezio says, I should have known that would set Loki up.

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:31.860
I had to offset that positivity on Pokemon with something y'all.

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:33.220
It's an anniversary show.

01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:33.780
Stupid.

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.380
It's fucking dumb.

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:35.620
Right.

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:35.940
Shut up.

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:38.020
Cause like they're like, though, I understand it.

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:43.620
The argument was, well, the system is powerful to run these games, but it just can't do both

01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:45.460
this and voice chat at the same time.

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:50.580
Even the Nintendo fans, even the most hardcore Nintendo fans on this issue, even they're

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.060
going to be like, I really can't be mad at Loki.

01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:56.260
Like this is an issue Nintendo needs to evolve on.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.700
So anyway, let's move on.

01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:58.660
I got one more switch thing.

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:02.180
And then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week, which of course, for an anniversary

01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:06.660
show, you know, dark soccer, dark soccer has picked a fun one, but, uh, the switch porting

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:10.420
studio that did doom rocket league Wolfenstein.

01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:13.700
This studio is called panic button and they're doing a pretty good job.

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.020
All these ports were really well done.

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:18.580
Uh, they are working on something else.

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:22.180
They won't say what it is, but it's another AAA switch port.

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:25.940
Uh, and it's another major port that they will announce in July.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:33.140
So I wonder if there's going to be another Nintendo direct in July to possibly fill in

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.380
some of these gaps we're feeling after E3.

01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:38.980
I don't know, but anyway, there's something else that's going to get ported to the switch.

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.620
Lots of people thinking grand theft auto five.

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.620
They could do the three 60 version of the game.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:50.180
Yeah.

01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:52.180
Um, cause that's how Skyrim is there.

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:56.260
And that's why we don't have fallout four because follow four was the next gen game.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:59.060
So I could see grand theft auto five.

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:02.500
That's again, that is just, I would have to pick up.

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:05.060
I would have to pick up grand theft auto five again.

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:09.620
And that would be, you know, I'd be curious to see how the online mode works in grand

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.100
theft auto.

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:11.220
Well, that's the problem though.

01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:15.780
See, it wouldn't because the grand theft auto online, they've stopped supporting the Xbox

01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:20.260
three 16 PlayStation three because it just, they're not supporting any more updates for

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:20.340
it.

01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.180
So it'd be weird to see how that would work.

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.700
You know what I want to see?

01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:29.060
And I would, it would go a long way in making a lot of hurt feelings, feel a lot better

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.740
when Nintendo have boobies on their plan.

01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:35.940
They might, uh, mass effect trilogy on the Nintendo switch.

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:40.180
That would, that would go a long way in healing some hurt that I feel in my heart.

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.900
Or how about the mass effect quad trilogy?

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:44.660
Why not destroy Andromeda in it?

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:44.980
All right.

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:48.100
Anyway, I know I'm reaching, I'm reaching.

01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:49.540
All right.

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:51.700
Let's, let's take a trip back to a simpler time.

01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:56.900
A time when, uh, you didn't have remasters and all this stuff.

01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:00.500
You know, you know what you got if, if, if it was on the Nintendo and then it came out

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:03.620
on the super Nintendo, it was pretty much the same damn thing.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:05.300
That's what happened in the Ninja game trilogy.

01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:09.860
Anyway, uh, it's the classic game of the week, dark Sakura, seven, the vault find a game

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:12.180
that you think, Hey, we should be playing this week.

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:13.780
I wish I had one of these in the vault.

01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:14.180
Right.

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:16.420
And it's a very special 16th anniversary selection.

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:19.540
It is, but it only lived for two years as a series.

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:20.180
Did you know that?

01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:23.860
Uh, I knew it was, it kind of came and went.

01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.820
Yes, I knew that.

01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:26.740
It was beat mania three.

01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:32.740
Cause I've done beat mania and I've done excuse me.

01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:35.060
I ate something funny and now I have the burps.

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:43.300
Um, beat mania three is, um, the followup to the beat mania series, um, by Konami.

01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:50.660
Um, it came out in two, actually, um, the first one came out in March of 2000.

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:57.060
Um, the last one, which was beat mania three, the final came out in 2002 and had five releases

01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:58.500
though in that two year period.

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:05.540
So, um, the awesome thing about beat mania three, it actually, and I really liked this.

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:08.340
It had like 10 speakers in the cabinet.

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:12.020
You had four mid range that were stacked vertically on either side of the screen, two

01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:16.660
subwoofers and every time, and no matter where you went to play it, it was always turned

01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:17.700
to the fuck down.

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.340
This is a game that needs volume.

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:20.740
Hello.

01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:23.780
Um, although you could also play with headphone jacks.

01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:27.940
Um, and it actually, two players could bring their own headphones to use their own jacks.

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.700
Um, however it doesn't, uh, disable the external speakers.

01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:40.580
Um, it had, um, something, and this is actually something that made it into 2DX later on,

01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:45.140
was the, um, uh, major effector panel.

01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:48.420
Instead of just having the one effector button like the first beat mania did.

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:55.300
So you had, um, echo, low pass, high pass, uh, phaser, volume based.

01:38:55.300 --> 01:39:01.380
I've always mispronounced this, flanger, flanger, lo-fi, a few others like that.

01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:09.300
Um, and it could be, uh, applied to the background or just the sounds or both.

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.260
Um, and of course you could increase the intensity of it.

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:15.620
So, um, and sometimes it's the only thing that made some of these things audible.

01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:19.220
It also introduced the foot pedal.

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.780
So each player got a foot pedal.

01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:27.860
Um, you can, um, use it to turn on or off of the, um, effectors in normal play.

01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:34.660
Some songs do have a, uh, a foot version that adds another column with a green note

01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.180
that you play with the foot pedal.

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:41.620
Um, you can also set the foot pedal so that it can function as any one of the five keys.

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:47.700
I would be really happy if it would have functioned as the spin for really crazy spins

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:49.620
because it's kind of hard sometimes.

01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:51.540
It also had a floppy drive in it.

01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.140
It had a three and a half inch floppy drive.

01:39:53.860 --> 01:40:00.820
And now it does have to be formatted for NTFS, um, but it would record your scores on it

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:02.420
and save your status.

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:07.860
Um, and then you could use it in the game again, you know, if you wanted to keep track

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.900
of the scores or you could look at your scores on your own computer.

01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:15.620
Um, the disc is also required to unlock secret songs or game modes on some of the versions

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:16.180
of the games.

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:24.020
So the various versions that came out is we had Beatmania 3, Beatmania 3 append core remix,

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:30.500
Beatmania 3 append 6 mix, Beatmania 3 append 7th mix and Beatmania the final.

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:35.860
Which to be perfectly honest, I'd say Beatmania the final is probably the best of them.

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:38.420
It's the one I've certainly seen the most of and played the most of.

01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:46.980
So, um, of course we've never had, uh, I mean some of the songs have been in home releases,

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:51.220
but we've never actually had a Beatmania 3 dedicated home release.

01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:54.980
So if you want to get your Beatmania 3 on, good luck.

01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:59.700
Find an arcade or go to California Extreme like they have every July.

01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:01.220
Or domain like everyone else is doing.

01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:06.340
Not that we endorse that, but the reality is if Konami is going to make it hard to find,

01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:10.580
then I'd like to find a way to, cause you know, I still have two, five key controllers.

01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:15.380
So if I could find like a little converter deal, so I can use my five key controllers.

01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:19.940
Then again, I'd probably just go back to playing BM 98, like back in the day.

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:22.820
I have a few of those PlayStation controllers.

01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:24.340
Nice.

01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:25.540
It'll be worth a try with it.

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:26.660
All right.

01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:29.300
My five key controllers are all old PlayStation.

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:30.580
There it is.

01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.380
Your classic gift of the week, Beatmania 3.

01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:37.780
Not to be confused with third mix, just Beatmania 3 that came and then went.

01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.180
But 2DX still around.

01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:44.020
Beatmania 2 deluxe is still around all these years later on there.

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:44.660
What, what are they on?

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.180
Like their 26th?

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:48.260
I don't even, I lost fucking count at some point anyway.

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:49.460
Cause they started naming them all.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:53.700
Uh, I only remember Linkle cause it's also the name of a character in Hyrule Warriors.

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:54.980
It's pretty bad ass.

01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:55.460
All right.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.340
We're going to take a break, but when we come back, we got plenty more orange later.

01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:04.500
Orange lounge radio to come, including, uh, your calls at orange lounge radio on Skype.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:08.820
Uh, we're going to do a release dates, uh, the mailbag, and we'll talk about nudity.

01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:13.140
I promise when we come back with more of orange launch radio, right after this.

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:25.700
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number 735 of our

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:31.860
show for this June 17th of 2018, celebrating 16 years of orange lounge radio.

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:37.220
Also taking a look back at E3, but also, you know, we, we have rudely been almost two hours

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:42.020
into the show and have yet to say a happy father's day to all the fathers out there,

01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:43.380
especially our own Loki.

01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:43.940
Thank you.

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.260
And of course all the father figures, et cetera, et cetera.

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.700
You know, we don't want to leave anybody out.

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:51.780
Uh, cause I can, I consider myself a daddy, uh, to Mr.

01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:52.580
Smush.

01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:53.700
Get your mind out of the gutter.

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:58.260
I know a few daddies, but a happy father's day to all the daddies out there as well.

01:42:58.260 --> 01:42:58.900
Wink.

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:03.220
So, you know, anyway, but no, in all seriousness, I hope everybody's having a good day.

01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.980
Uh, that was the joke.

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:11.620
Uh, my, uh, my own dad, uh, he went to universal studios for the first time today.

01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:16.740
I took him to the airport to go to long beach, uh, which he, he never really would fly a

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:20.580
lot before, but he went, he flew to long beach to visit my sister, which is where she lives.

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:26.340
And she took them and like long beach to, to north of LA where universal is, is not

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.220
exactly close.

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:27.700
So Mr.

01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.820
Driven an hour up there, but they went to universal studios and I'm kind of impressed.

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:36.900
Now, my dad, my dad is, you know, he's, he was, when I was born, he was pushing 40.

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:40.100
So he's, he's like 78, 79 at this point.

01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:43.140
So, um, he wasn't exactly going to ride all this right.

01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.620
So he didn't ride the Harry Potter ride, but he did do the studio tour.

01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:49.220
I was pretty, I was pretty happy to hear that they did all that kind of cheesy stuff.

01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.060
So, uh, really cool.

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:55.860
So anyway, uh, looking at our chat room, uh, Rama says, since today is father's day and

01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:59.860
OLR and OLR 16th birthday, who is OLR's dad?

01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.300
Uh, it was established, uh, you might've missed it, but during the, uh, Bobby call and then

01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:06.820
thereafter, uh, Travis Donovan would be our, our daddy.

01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:09.860
And when you say it, you can't say he's the dad.

01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:15.220
If I, you have to say daddy, Loki shaking his head over there.

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:16.260
All right.

01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:23.540
Anyway, moving on, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and, uh, some other video

01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:26.740
games that you and your daddy can look forward to soon.

01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:28.820
Loki, start us off, please.

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:34.980
It's disturbing, but, or as Dungeon Buster says, big daddy Donovan.

01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:37.780
All right.

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:43.380
So apparently some modders of the game Bloodborne have discovered that there is a cut boss rush

01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:44.660
mode in the game.

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:49.380
And these actually appeared in some test, uh, arena maps that were actually labeled

01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:52.740
as boss rusher in Japanese.

01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:58.580
Um, they were apparently some holy, uh, optional dungeons.

01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:04.100
And they talked about like some of the different things that were in there that showed that

01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:06.500
it was kind of before the game's release.

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:09.460
And actually some of this stuff actually had come out in one of the, I don't know if it

01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:14.980
was an update or DLC that they had found, but they got it working a little bit to where

01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:18.180
some of the actual bosses spawn, but it's just not finished.

01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:21.940
Kind of neat to see, you know, that was something that was in development, but too bad it never

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:22.740
made the final game.

01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:28.100
And then, um, call of duty black house four.

01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:28.660
Oh yeah.

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:34.420
You may remember call of duty black house four decided that, you know, it was not going

01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:38.420
to have a single player campaign and said, they're going the route of it's going to have

01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:42.900
multiplayer, it's going to have a battle royale and that's that.

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:47.060
Well, it's also going to have a season pass because they want all of the money.

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:51.380
And, uh, what's going to be kind of different about this season pass, which they're calling

01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:58.340
the black ops pass, um, is that the maps, instead of being released, it's 12 multiplayer

01:45:58.340 --> 01:45:58.660
maps.

01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:04.420
So in four zombie maps, instead of releasing them in map packs, like they have in previous,

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:09.860
you know, releases so that, because basically in order to be able to play one of these,

01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:13.780
you have to be able to have the same maps as the person you're playing it.

01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:18.340
So say, you know, I bought the season pass and my friend did not buy the season pass.

01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:22.020
He would not be able to play with me unless he bought the same maps that we were going

01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:22.660
to be playing on.

01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:27.540
So instead of releasing these maps in map packs, which would be like four maps each

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:32.980
and charging a flat fee for that, they are releasing them individually.

01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:41.700
So you have to buy, um, these individual map packs, I guess for 14 99 each, which I'm wondering,

01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:47.860
you know, how many is going to come in these map packs in, uh, the season pass itself is

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.780
49 99 and it's apparently not going to be available.

01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:54.100
Okay, now I'm getting confused here.

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:57.860
So, oh, they're talking about in the past.

01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:05.060
Okay. So, um, the season pass or black ops pass right now, how much is that?

01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:10.020
I'm not sure, but it's additional money on top of the game itself, but they're selling

01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.220
the maps individually.

01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:15.940
So if you want to play, instead of buying the map pass for like 14 99 for four maps,

01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:19.460
you're going to have to buy each one individually, which is going to split the player base that

01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:25.220
much more because, you know, I may have maps one, two, and three, and, you know, the other

01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:30.020
person has two, three, and four, and now I can't play, you know, half of the maps with

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:30.980
the other person.

01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.420
So that kind of sucks.

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:39.140
Um, and apparently the issue also is this black ops pass.

01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:40.740
It's not going to be available after launch.

01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:44.500
It's only a pre-order thing, apparently.

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.220
So that's a dungeon.

01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:48.580
Buster's kind of saying in chat is that the black ops pass is literally all or nothing

01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:50.900
and it isn't initially available at launch.

01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:54.020
You need to spring for one of the more expensive versions to get in on it for now.

01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:55.160
Yeah.

01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:56.820
So that's lame.

01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:00.180
And it, they're coming out, you know, slowly as it progresses.

01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:01.700
I don't know.

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:07.220
I am really not interested in black ops four just because of this and the lack of a single

01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:07.940
player campaign.

01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:13.380
So I'll just wait for the best of, you know, they I'll wait for the gone sale.

01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:15.860
The, the, the year of definitive edition.

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:17.300
I don't even do that anymore.

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:21.060
Like the, the definitive editions that they released or the previously released, it's

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:24.820
like, Oh, we have the first map pack in there for you.

01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:27.620
Oh, but you got to buy the rest if you want to play all the maps.

01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:31.460
Fuck Activision is what the moral of the story is here.

01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:36.340
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I actually played some of black ops three single player

01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:39.780
campaign when it was on PlayStation plus I didn't realize it was 70 gigs.

01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:43.540
I spent almost one 10th of my bandwidth cap on fucking call of duty.

01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:44.260
Oh shit.

01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:44.660
Yeah.

01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:46.180
Good thing I haven't downloaded that yet.

01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:46.900
All right.

01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:48.820
Anyway, let's talk a little bit about kingdom hearts.

01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:51.780
We already mentioned, I was going to mention here the official release date in January

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.620
2019, but we kind of covered that earlier, but maybe some of you were wondering why did

01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:56.820
they bump it to 2019?

01:48:57.460 --> 01:49:01.940
Well, in an interview with Tetsuya Nomura, uh, he was talking about with IGN, uh, why

01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:03.060
this delay happened.

01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:06.900
The timing of the release that we actually are looking at, we were told by many people,

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:11.780
including hardware manufacturers, marketing teams, sales teams, that it just wasn't good

01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:12.660
timing in the year.

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:17.220
He also mentioned that there are differences in holiday links and store behavior in different

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:17.780
regions.

01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:21.300
And I suppose that's something to consider, uh, for kingdom hearts three, the square enix

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:26.100
Western offices had requested to release the game as simultaneously as much as possible

01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:27.860
between Japan and America.

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:32.980
So we were no longer able to just think about Japanese issues and retail situations.

01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:34.820
Kind of an interesting point.

01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:37.220
Kingdom hearts three is also a big deal in Japan.

01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:41.220
Christmas is not the same thing in Japan as it is here.

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:46.260
I mean, you might have a lovely cake, but it's not quite that same holiday season like

01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:46.980
we have here.

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:50.980
So a January, 2019 release in Japan, not as big of a deal.

01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:51.700
You know what I mean?

01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:52.020
Yeah.

01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:55.780
So that from that element, I'm like, okay, that actually makes a lot of sense.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:50:00.660
Even though I was already in the camp of just get it right, bitches, just, you know, just

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:03.620
don't have to do all these patches post release.

01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:08.020
Um, there were other considerations that went into January, 2019 as well.

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:12.020
We of course considered maybe speeding up development to release earlier than that would

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:15.780
when we were told that wasn't good, but the development team said, nope, we just couldn't

01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:16.100
do that.

01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:18.500
We could delay it, but we couldn't make it any sooner.

01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.020
So they're not going to delay it obviously.

01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:21.140
So there it is.

01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:24.500
Uh, and they've also said on big hero six, a little tidbit.

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:27.220
We pretty much have finished creating all the gameplay within that world.

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.380
We're just not finished with the cut scenes yet.

01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:33.140
They're not finished with the cut scenes and it's fucking like July or getting to get to

01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:33.780
almost July.

01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:38.260
By the time we have another episode, like, wow, I guess so.

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:38.980
I guess so.

01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:43.380
I guess if they have the engine six, seven months, I mean, I guess that's true.

01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:43.780
It's true.

01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:47.940
I'm just a little surprised to hear we're not really in like, kind of like fix it all

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:48.260
up mode.

01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:49.700
What are they supposed to do in seven months?

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:50.340
Yeah.

01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:50.660
All right.

01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:54.660
Anyway, uh, also one thing to keep in mind if you are looking forward to blood stained

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:58.420
ritual of the night, which, uh, Bradley brought up the eight spit eight bit spinoff earlier,

01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:02.820
but obviously this is all kind of a prelude to the more symphony of the night type of

01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:03.940
a blood stain game.

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:09.860
Uh, it will be releasing on Vita, but it's only going to be digital only, uh, is what

01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:10.580
it sounds like.

01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:14.820
And by the way, this is a little bit of a muddy issue right now because the original

01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:19.780
report on this was actually updated after it came out saying it said on a slide that

01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.180
it was Vita is digital only.

01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:27.860
Uh, but apparently, uh, and a PR representative, uh, confirmed it, but then representatives

01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:33.140
from bloodstain to said they're trying to make Vita copies for backers working, uh,

01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:36.900
even though Sony is apparently ending physical media production for the platform in the West.

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:40.660
So it sounds like the issue is a little bit more complicated, but it sounds like it's

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:44.420
going to be a lot easier to get digitally than it will anywhere else.

01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:45.460
Um, so there you go.

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.300
But blood stain, I'm looking forward to it.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:50.340
I don't know if the Vita would have been my platform of choice, but I know a lot of

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:54.820
people, uh, really love the Vita, but, uh, I think a lot of people have moved on to Vita's

01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:56.740
successor, uh, the Nintendo switch.

01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:59.460
Anyway, dark Sakura.

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:02.020
Uh, what do you have for us in a rapid fire toast?

01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:03.460
Yay.

01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:04.740
And not avocado.

01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:09.380
Even though it was on the menu at that place, I almost ordered avocado toast because even

01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:11.540
though I'm turning 40, some days I want to be a millennial.

01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:13.160
Xenial.

01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:16.580
I'm never going to use that term, but you just did.

01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:16.820
All right.

01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:18.820
Anyway, I was using it ironically.

01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:20.100
That was so hipster of me.

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:20.660
I know.

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:21.140
Fine.

01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:29.300
Um, anyway, um, there is a Sonic the Hedgehog toaster that is on the, um, Sega store, Sega

01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.340
shop, sorry.

01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:31.780
Um, it's $35.

01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:34.340
And if a thousand people don't order one, no one's getting one.

01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:40.740
So if you want your toaster to burn Sonic's face onto your Wonder bread, then.

01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:42.820
I kind of do.

01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:44.420
Got a toast fast.

01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:49.220
Although I do have a Hello Kitty toaster that I've used maybe twice in my life.

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:51.300
I have a nice toaster.

01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:56.820
It's by like a normal company and it's red and matches my fucking kitchen.

01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:00.100
We have a toaster oven that we use for pretty much everything.

01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:01.300
As I'm sure a lot of people do.

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:05.860
I linked the link to the toaster in the chat room.

01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:07.220
It's okay.

01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:13.220
So according to this, that if everyone does that, they've sold 561 out of a thousand.

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:17.620
And if they sell them, they're going to ship by October 1st.

01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:24.100
But only if they make the a thousand, if they don't do a thousand, nobody gets any good.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:24.740
No Sonic.

01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:25.380
Wow.

01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:28.500
Talk about a book or a page out of Konami's book.

01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:29.700
Wheel of bullshit.

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:34.500
You'll just have to wait for somebody to come out with the unofficial Sanic toaster.

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:35.540
You know what I'll do?

01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:41.700
I will slice up some avocado and put it into a pastry bag and draw a fucking Sonic myself.

01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:43.940
And it will look a bajillion.

01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:47.460
It'll look like Sonic adventure, Sonic, and not just like the Sonic team logo.

01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:49.380
Then my toast will have avocado on it.

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:49.940
I'm not sure.

01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.380
Who said that's your fucking toast?

01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:52.580
That's my toast, bitch.

01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:59.780
My toast is going to have delicious avocado with Sonic's face.

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:01.380
You make your own goddamn sandwich.

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:01.940
That's right.

01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:05.220
You can make yours out of mustard.

01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:09.940
That's I feel like it will make you some whipped butter and you can have a yellow Sonic.

01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:11.860
Not that I ever want to have Biggs the cat.

01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:14.820
Not that I ever want to talk about Jamie's obituary, but you know,

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:19.300
like years and years and years from now, I feel like the obituary should say, you know,

01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:22.980
Jamie, last name, such and such day, such and such date, and then put,

01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:24.580
you can make your own goddamn sandwich.

01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:27.160
That's it.

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:37.300
I want that to be if, if I don't do my, my tree pod burial in a protected land.

01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:41.620
Cause you know that if you, if your body is buried on a reserve,

01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:45.380
then that becomes a federally protected land that cannot be overridden.

01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:45.880
True story.

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.900
So that's, what's going to happen to me, but you can make like

01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:52.660
my temporary grave marker say, fuck your toast.

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:53.940
Your Memorial.

01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:58.100
Or as Act Deft and Jack says, uh, Oh, bitch you airy.

01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.060
Obituary.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.820
That just reminds me of a really bad joke I learned in the eighties.

01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:04.900
Now, you know, I'm going to ask.

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:05.940
Okay.

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:10.500
So the bear walks into a bar and he's like, I want some vodka.

01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:15.460
And the, uh, bartender, the bartender says, we don't serve bears.

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.220
And the bear's like, well, if you don't give me some vodka,

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:18.820
I'm going to eat this woman over here.

01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:21.860
Bartender's like, we still don't serve bears.

01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:27.140
So the bear ate the lady and the bartender's like, and so the bear's like,

01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:29.700
okay, give me some fucking vodka now.

01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:32.820
And he's like, I can't, we don't serve, uh, drug users.

01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:35.780
What the bear says that was a bar bitch.

01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:46.980
You ate, I hate it.

01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:50.340
I heard that in elementary school.

01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:51.300
Oh God.

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:54.660
Oh, Hey, sorry.

01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:55.060
Everybody.

01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.660
Oh, LR is canceled.

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.420
I hope we had a great run.

01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:01.860
Really great with that is where I draw as father as his father's day.

01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:04.260
That was the ultimate of dirty dad jokes.

01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:04.740
There you go.

01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:06.100
All right.

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:07.220
Oh, LR is canceled.

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:08.100
Good night.

01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:10.900
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:11.700
Bite my butt.

01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:15.140
I can tell you the one about the foo poo bird.

01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:16.660
No, no more jokes.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.060
Don't you have a story on soul caliber?

01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:26.180
Well, you know why the clock is considered a bad person to have at a buffet?

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:27.940
He goes back four seconds.

01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:32.100
What do you do with a chemist when he dies?

01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:32.600
Stop it.

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:33.980
Bury him.

01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:36.120
Okay.

01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:40.200
So the other piece of news I'll just do it quick is so caliber six has a release date.

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.600
It's what happens when you started working with drew.

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:43.160
I know it.

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:43.720
I know it.

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.640
No, no, he did this to you.

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:46.840
He did this to you.

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.240
That joke predates his birth.

01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:52.120
Oh my God.

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.320
He's learned how to time travel.

01:56:55.480 --> 01:57:00.120
Some of the jokes I learned from my uncle and my uncle for not having any kids is definitely

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:01.240
the master of dad jokes.

01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:03.720
Soul caliber six.

01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:05.800
You need to look at chat at some point.

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.000
I am sad to announce the cancellation of orange lounge radio.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.840
16 years was a great run.

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:13.400
After 16 years, we've reached peak status.

01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.920
Oh, Bobby did one of my favorites.

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:17.800
Bobby black will show will be four hours every Sunday night.

01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:20.120
Bobby said, do you want to hear a joke about sodium?

01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:22.680
Nah, please.

01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:23.880
For the love of God.

01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:27.880
Do I was trying to, and then you were harassing me.

01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.240
Mr. Smoosh, come tell you.

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:30.760
I was harassing you.

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:36.840
Come tell your daddy to STF years have been physically assaulted with a deadly pepper.

01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:44.600
Anyway, so caliber six has a release date of October 19th, 2018.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:47.960
They put out a story mode trailer, which I haven't watched because I've been interested

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.080
in soul caliber since two.

01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:52.760
Um, and, uh, yeah.

01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.720
Soul caliber on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC.

01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:00.360
So caliber four was pretty good and I can't wait for six.

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.760
I feel like the even numbered ones are good.

01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:07.720
Soul caliber, by the way, introduced a very crazy in joke in my house.

01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:08.360
Not a pun.

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:13.160
We just used to give everyone weird names, but the only one of them that is stuck is

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.040
Bob Astor off.

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:16.200
I'm Bob.

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:17.320
Bob Astor off.

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.560
You may know me from such games as soul Cal.

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:24.840
We would do like these whole intros as Bob Astor off in my house.

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.200
It was just me and Dan.

01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:28.120
So Bob Astor off.

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:28.440
All right.

01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.080
I'll remember that.

01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:30.120
It's better than the other jokes.

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:31.160
Nightmare.

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:31.660
All right.

01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:37.640
I, we would do like, like Julia Sofia would just come up with like crazy names.

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:38.440
So anyway, that's all.

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:42.200
But then I think a Tekken when you bring up Julia, Julia Chang was great.

01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:43.000
Anyway.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:43.240
All right.

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:45.720
And then she decided to be a wrestler.

01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.280
She'd had her costume.

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:49.960
Let's travel around the world and check out some games.

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.040
We'll be playing a little sooner than soul caliber six.

01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:53.480
All right.

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:56.200
And we should go to the end of the month for this since we're not going to be here.

01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:59.240
Uh, yeah, we can do that if you want to go over a couple of weeks.

01:58:59.240 --> 01:58:59.560
All right.

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:01.880
It's not gonna be much more, but let's do it.

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:07.080
Uh, the lost child is coming out in the switch PlayStation four in the Vita.

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.560
A game called Musenix.

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:11.160
Musenix.

01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:13.800
I thought that's what I take when I have a cold.

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:15.960
It's like Muse musics.

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:18.440
They spelled it really wrong.

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:19.640
It's a rhythm game.

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:20.840
It's coming out on the switch.

01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:25.640
Mustnix Vegas party on the switch.

01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:26.440
It's a card game.

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:35.880
And then we've got Mario tennis aces on the switch and new Gundam breaker on PlayStation four.

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:44.600
And then we've got, um, the following week, the blob remastered on the switch hunting

01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:47.560
simulator on the switch.

01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:49.880
Do we really have to label everything as a simulator?

01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:54.120
Because obviously if you're playing a hunting game on a console, it's probably not hunting

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:54.760
real animals.

01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:02.520
Um, and then of course, luminous remastered that's coming out on PC, Xbox one, the only

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:06.200
thing I need near automata on Xbox one.

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:10.920
The other thing I need, which is an Android simulator, uh, the awesome adventures of captain

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:13.800
spirit on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:18.680
That's free and ease eight, uh, like Ramosa Donna on the switch.

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:23.960
And then if we're going to finish up the month, then let's just go ahead and do MotoGP 18.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:32.280
Crash bandicoot insane trilogy on PC switch and Xbox one, the crew two on PC, PlayStation

02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:39.240
four and Xbox one, the Vita, which is going to be getting, um, psychedelic, uh, of the

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.040
ashen Hawk.

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.640
And that's a visual novel surprise.

02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:47.000
And then finally on the switch Wolfenstein two, the new Colossus.

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:48.440
Okay.

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:51.880
And if they can do Wolfenstein two, the new Colossus, which is an excellent game that

02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.160
maybe they can do fallout for.

02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:55.240
Did you mention on tempest?

02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:58.680
4,000 is coming out on PlayStation four on June 26.

02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:02.520
I didn't realize that it was also coming out on my birthday on the list.

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:06.440
It's on my other list is my Japanese list has some other stuff from other countries.

02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:08.760
Did you know they're making a tempest 4,000 Jamie?

02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:11.960
I remember it's one of those things like now that I see it, I'm like, Oh yeah, that was

02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.000
the thing that's happening.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.520
So I want to check that out.

02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:15.720
I love me some tempest.

02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:16.200
Yeah.

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:16.520
All right.

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:19.480
Anyway, uh, let's look at Japan and some of the releases for this month.

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.800
So in Japan, we have new Gundam breaker, uh, in a regular and several different types of

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:26.200
limited editions because they love their limited editions over there.

02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:27.960
That is out on June the 21st.

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:34.920
And then closing out the month on the 28th, we have Tonari ni Kanoujo no Uru Shiwaze

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:38.120
Winter Guest in a regular and limited edition out in Japan.

02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:41.400
Tonari means like neighbor something.

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:41.900
Yeah.

02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.640
And then Island, a game called Island is also out in Japan and that is also on the 28th.

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:52.200
Although oddly, um, I guess it's a worldwide release because, uh, the crew too gets a Japanese

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.360
release on June the 29th.

02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.680
So that is all on the PlayStation 4.

02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.600
Um, taking a look quickly at the Nintendo switch and seeing what's out there.

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:05.000
Uh, we have, um, uh, a mahjong game that's coming out.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.480
I'm sure you're all excited for that on the 21st, but also a Minecraft switch release,

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:11.560
uh, in Japan on June the 21st.

02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:14.920
And then we have Mario Tennis Ace on June the 22nd.

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:18.520
So you Waluigi fans can at least, uh, have something, uh, to hold you over.

02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:23.400
So that is out on, uh, the same day that it comes out in the rest of the world, the 22nd of June.

02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:29.160
And then also in Japan, a game called Sheen, uh, on June 28th, as well as Ys VIII,

02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:33.400
Lacrimosa of Dana on, uh, the 28th as well.

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:34.520
How about Europe, Dark Sakura?

02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:39.320
Mario Tennis Aces coming out on June 22nd.

02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:44.440
Also on the 22nd is Harvest Moon, Light of Hope for Switch and PlayStation.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.960
Um, on the 29th, moving forward, we have The Crew 2 for PlayStation and Xbox.

02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:56.360
We have Wolfenstein 2, The New Colossus for Switch on the 29th.

02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.720
Actually, the rest of these are on the 29th.

02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:00.440
We have Song of Memories for Switch and PlayStation,

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:04.520
Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy for Xbox, Switch, and PC.

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.880
Um, then that's it.

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.560
I almost went a little bit further, so that's all.

02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:12.760
All right.

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.280
Let's, uh, let's go to the mailbag.

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:17.400
Every week you guys email us and, uh, sometimes we read them.

02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:22.760
No, we always read them, uh, most of the time, as long as it isn't spam or something that

02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:24.360
you say, don't read this on air.

02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:25.240
We'll read it on air.

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:29.560
So, um, or like we have had some weeks where we get like eight emails all at once and sometimes

02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:32.360
we have to edit a little bit, but this week I think we just have one or two.

02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:34.600
So Dark Sakura is going to dive into the mailbag right now.

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:38.760
And if you want to send us an email, participate at orange.trader.com, especially since you

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:42.760
have two weeks, I would love to hear your stories about how long you've been listening

02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:48.200
to OLR and like, if you have a favorite moment, um, from the past 16 years, or is the tweet

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:50.920
that we just got said, uh, what was this?

02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:55.800
Uh, dark Tetsuya is saying, just have to say the whole joke tangent from earlier is why

02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.800
I still do the show this many years later.

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:00.600
I got a joke for you.

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:01.000
There you go.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.440
Moving on, uh, emails.

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.080
All right.

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:07.480
This comes from, um, Ron Chan.

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:11.240
Um, good afternoon, Rob, Jamie and Matt.

02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:13.240
How are you all also happy pride.

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:13.960
Thank you.

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:14.360
Super.

02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:15.160
Thanks for asking.

02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:18.360
The last three or so weeks, my life has been hectic.

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.200
So I'm very thankful for podcasts.

02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:25.800
Instead of calling in and discussing topics, we best to send an email one valve and visual

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:26.360
novels.

02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.760
A part of me feels like valve shouldn't carry these titles.

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:32.440
Visual novels are more like an interactive book, like a choose your own adventure style

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:32.920
book.

02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:34.680
The visual novels are akin to dating.

02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:39.800
So I can see why they're on steam, but a lot do contain content in there.

02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:44.360
Maybe this would just be a perfect time for, for valve to spin off a site just for that.

02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:48.600
But valve, just like Twitch, they have a neutral slash gray area side.

02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:53.080
When it comes to adult content, one voice actress said, censorship of sex and lobbying

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:56.920
against sexual material is a big reason people struggle with sex positivity.

02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:58.760
You can find more in detail on this link.

02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.040
I will put it in the chat.

02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:02.120
Unless Ron Sean already does.

02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:07.000
On the plus side, we do have Faku's gaming site that will handle these mature titles

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:07.480
as well.

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.080
Two, retro gaming.

02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:15.720
I always said that I wanted to see Sega come back with a Linux-powered Dreamcast 2 system

02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:20.440
with USB ports for controllers and a DVD drive that plays DVDs and GD disks.

02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:21.820
Excuse me.

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:27.800
The closest that we have is the Atari VCS and the new Intellivision retro consoles.

02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:30.280
Truth be told, I like the Atari VCS.

02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.520
It's the first gaming system I ever played on.

02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:33.560
I do kind of want one.

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:37.960
With the rise of retro games, I feel there's plenty of room in the ecosystem for more consoles.

02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:39.880
They aren't competing with the big three.

02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:42.760
I'm very skeptical of the price, but it's a wait and see for me.

02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:47.080
It does sound like the Atari VCS will achieve what Gabe Newell tried with steam machines.

02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:51.160
Three, PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5.

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:55.480
Given that the PS4 is only five years old, I really don't believe Sony's saying that

02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:57.960
the console is winding down to the end of reproduction cycle.

02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:00.920
Sorry, production cycle, not reproduction.

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:04.840
As for the rumors of the next system going rise in, I'm not really believing that.

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:07.800
When the PS4 came out, it was $399.

02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:11.480
If they go rise in, expect the price to jump to $599.

02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:12.520
Four, JD Roth.

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:16.280
I remember that y'all talked about him and some of his endeavors in reality shows,

02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:18.680
but here's a couple of things you might not have known.

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.680
He was a host of the game show fun.

02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:21.640
We knew that.

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:24.600
He was a host of the game show fun house, which was similar to Double Dare.

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:26.920
Here's a couple of clips below.

02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:30.440
The show spun off another series called Fox's Fun House.

02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:32.120
I didn't grow up in the 90s.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:34.920
My friend wanted me to go on that show with him and I said no.

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:38.280
College Madhouse and Fun House UK, which ran for 10 years.

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:41.400
I'll copy and paste stuff in a bit.

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:42.840
Nothing to confuse with TV Fun House.

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:46.280
Unless Rob, you would care to go into the mailbag and copy and paste all those links for me.

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:47.720
Uh, I can try.

02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:53.960
I just, for the live folks, Winamp straight up crashed at the end of that song and killed the

02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:54.520
stream.

02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:55.240
So weird.

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:55.640
Great.

02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:58.760
So we've, we've been down while you were reading most of that email, but sorry.

02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:00.120
Well, the podcast folks hear it.

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:00.620
Okay.

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:02.840
Um, five, Microsoft.

02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.680
I admit they dropped the ball on exclusive titles.

02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:07.400
Um, they really need to play catch up on that.

02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:12.280
As for reducing the cost of Xbox live, I doubt that since Microsoft builds and maintains the

02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:17.000
servers for all online games on their consoles, except for MMOs, a price reduction maybe,

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.040
but nothing more than that.

02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:19.800
Six, Battlefield.

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:21.160
Jamie, you nailed that.

02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:22.520
Yeah, of course I did.

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:23.960
Even I learned a few new things.

02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:27.480
The problem is that history is so selective on what's taught in public schools that some

02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:31.720
people refuse to learn on what actually, what really happened.

02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:33.080
No shocker there.

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:38.200
And by the way, I'd like to just take this moment for people to go up and just research

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:39.000
the night witches.

02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:44.040
I might've brought it up on the show the other week I was here, but these were women who

02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:48.760
would cut the power to their planes, coast in on idle and bomb the fuck out of Germany.

02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:54.200
The official Reddit for the battlefield thing foot, put their foot down this week and said,

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.600
no more posts about historical inaccuracy.

02:07:56.600 --> 02:07:57.320
Shut up.

02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:58.680
Basic in a nutshell.

02:07:58.680 --> 02:07:59.560
This is battlefield.

02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:03.560
We're talking about a game where it's very known that people eject out of their plane,

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:07.080
shoot someone with a rocket launcher and land back in their plane and fly away.

02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:07.720
Come on.

02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:08.600
I did that yesterday.

02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:11.160
I think that's it.

02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:11.560
Oh yeah.

02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:12.200
One more thing.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.400
Rob Loki was right.

02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:14.440
I'm disappointed in you.

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:20.520
I think you should look up gravitation, uh, Yurikama Arashi and Dramatical Murder.

02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:25.240
Oh, if you want to know more about some grade A yaoi titles, just ask Mako-chan.

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:27.800
Uh, I'll just stick to like X-tube.

02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:35.960
For the record, for the record, I do have like episodes of like D gray man and, you

02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:38.520
know, uh, sensitive pornography.

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:41.000
I just didn't know there were video games out.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.360
I didn't know it went all the way to clearly I'm aware there's a whole convention.

02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:46.200
I'm aware there's manga.

02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:49.560
I'm aware that if you think of it, it exists.

02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.640
However, I was not aware there was a video game.

02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:51.880
That's all.

02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:52.280
That's all.

02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:53.640
That was the, that was the news to me.

02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:55.320
I'm glad it's there.

02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.920
Do you want to watch little boys touching each other?

02:08:58.920 --> 02:08:59.160
No.

02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:00.920
Good.

02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:01.720
That's the right answer.

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:03.240
Yeah, that's it.

02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:08.200
I do not like the was, they call it shota creepy.

02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:09.640
Um, yeah, that's it.

02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.840
My apologies on bad spelling punctuations and grammar.

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.440
Actually, dude, your article, your email is pretty nice.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.800
I knew that there was more I wanted to talk about, but it's been,

02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:25.000
but it's been three weeks and I have spent three or days.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.080
I guess that should be three or more flops.

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:29.800
The grammar right at the end, working on this email at work.

02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:31.400
Cause y'all are worth it.

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:33.480
See you all on the flip side.

02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:34.120
Rama.

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:35.800
He has an exclamation point.

02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:36.200
Run.

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:39.480
I don't know what else.

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.280
There was a lot to cover in this email here.

02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:48.120
Um, I, I still think there's going to be changes with Xbox live, but I don't know.

02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.640
Maybe, maybe Microsoft's going to try to position this a different way,

02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:53.960
especially the studio acquisitions really change a lot.

02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:54.760
So we'll see.

02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:59.240
I still think if they really want to have an impact, they would merge that.

02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:03.000
And their past that Xbox game pass, I think would really say a lot.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.600
Uh, that's, that's all.

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:07.240
Um, but then, uh, what else?

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:10.760
The, uh, PlayStation four to PlayStation five and that whole thing.

02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:13.160
I think it's all 2020 at this point.

02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:16.520
I don't think next year, next year you might get some teases,

02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:19.000
but I think 2020 is going to be the year it all goes down.

02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:23.640
But not Nintendo, although Nintendo, I would anticipate is going to do a switch

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:28.520
deluxe or like some type of, you know, how they do the new 3DS.

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.120
There'll be something with the switch in a couple of years.

02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.120
But anyway, last email.

02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:37.720
Cause we got one in the interim.

02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:37.960
Okay.

02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:40.120
Uh, good evening you guys.

02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:41.960
Well, E3 is done for another year.

02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:43.400
Some surprises, some shockers.

02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:45.400
I know quite a few games have gotten my interest.

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:47.480
Excuse me.

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:53.320
Nioh 2, Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Control, Resident Evil 2 remake.

02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:54.840
I'm actually kind of looking forward to that.

02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:59.080
Rage 2, Forza Horizon 4, Cuphead, The Last Course DLC,

02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:05.080
Ghost of Tsushima, Metal Wolf Chaos, and Battlefield 5 for starters.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:07.880
I thought the press conferences weren't as good in previous years.

02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:10.280
Maybe it's because the overall delivery wasn't great.

02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:14.280
Change of venue that set the tone or something, who knows.

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:18.520
The Sony presentation of The Last of Us 2 got people mad quiet when it ended.

02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:22.760
I was surprised that, I was surprised that barely applauded.

02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:26.360
Xbox is still hurting for exclusives and Nintendo did a great job.

02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:28.440
Anyways, that's just my thoughts on it.

02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:30.040
Take care of yourselves, needle crash.

02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.920
There was a lot for the press conferences that were missing.

02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:35.240
I think, I think is maybe where some of your thoughts are.

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:38.760
That's where I'm kind of at is I'm like, no Soul Calibur, no Red Dead.

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:39.960
You know, I said this earlier in the show.

02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:43.720
It seems like there was a lot that weren't at the press conferences.

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:44.920
So that was kind of surprising.

02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:48.040
But otherwise, I think we kind of, we kind of well went over our thoughts earlier,

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:49.320
but I appreciate you sharing yours.

02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:53.960
And to clarify with The Last of Us, everything outside of the game looked great.

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:58.040
Like those scenes in the barn were really well done.

02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.160
Like I'm almost, I wish it just weren't so gory and realistic.

02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:04.680
Like I'm just not here for that.

02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:05.080
Sorry.

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:06.040
Am I, am I old?

02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:06.540
Maybe.

02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:09.320
All right.

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:09.800
Rob.

02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:10.300
What?

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:12.760
You have a week before you're old.

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:13.320
A couple weeks.

02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:15.160
No, you're not.

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:15.800
No, I'm not.

02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:16.120
I'm not.

02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:16.840
I know I'm not.

02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:20.040
It's just one of those, you know, it's just not for me.

02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:21.080
Age is a number.

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:21.880
Yeah.

02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:23.320
Experience is the real teacher.

02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.040
I'm okay with like a little bit of violence in games.

02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:30.040
Like I'm looking, I'm looking right at my copy of Rise of the Tomb Raider on Xbox One,

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:30.760
sitting right here.

02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.840
Tomb Raider games can sometimes be a little intense.

02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:34.680
They can get a little, you know, a little bloody and stuff.

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:37.160
Lara Croft and the terrible, no good, very bad day.

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:39.400
There's no fucking disembowelment in those games.

02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:39.880
You know what I mean?

02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:41.000
That's like in your face like that.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.760
It's just that there's always the sequel.

02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:43.320
I know.

02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:44.440
Well, there is a sequel coming.

02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:45.000
Who knows?

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:45.800
Well, they'll do in that.

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:47.320
So anyway.

02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:47.560
All right.

02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:48.600
Thank you for the emails.

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:49.320
Send us more.

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:55.400
Until then, we have more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line at orange

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.120
lounge radio.

02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:56.920
Loki.

02:12:56.920 --> 02:12:58.840
Let's talk about nudity.

02:12:58.840 --> 02:12:59.960
Let's all right.

02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:04.360
So Cyberpunk 2077 is going to have the nudity.

02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:04.860
Woohoo!

02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:09.240
And because CD Projekt Red said,

02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:12.280
Nudity is important for us because of one reason.

02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:13.160
It's important for me too.

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:15.000
This is Cyberpunk.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.680
So people augment their body.

02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:19.960
So the body is no longer sacred.

02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:20.920
It's profane.

02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:27.160
And because people modify everything, they're losing their connection to their body to the

02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:27.960
meat.

02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:30.760
And that's why we need to use nudity in many situations.

02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:34.120
Whatever you have to do to justify it.

02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:34.840
Sure.

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:35.480
Sure, guys.

02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:39.880
So yes, there'll be nudity in the game and looks interesting.

02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:43.160
And we're talking, we're talking lady nudity and boy nudity.

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:43.400
Yeah.

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.440
All nudity.

02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:45.800
Equal opportunity nudity.

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.520
When the kind of augments are we talking about?

02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:52.440
That's buy the game and find out.

02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:53.880
No, it looks really good.

02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:56.840
Is there going to be a booby slider and a dick slider?

02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:58.440
I don't think it works that way.

02:13:58.440 --> 02:13:59.640
I don't think it does either.

02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:03.480
No, it's very much like the Cyberpunk tabletop game or like the RPG.

02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:06.200
So you have different stats and stuff.

02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:06.600
Sure.

02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:09.400
But I really am looking forward to this game.

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:10.440
It looks really good.

02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:11.160
Yeah.

02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:13.960
Apparently a lot of people that went and saw the presentation because they did like a theater

02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:16.040
presentation, apparently a lot of people were really impressed.

02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:20.200
And I remember going to see the Witcher 3 presentation at one of the last E3s I went to.

02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:21.880
And I was impressed then.

02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:24.600
I remember walking out of that going, that was like a goddamn movie.

02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:25.800
And we just saw the Witcher.

02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:28.680
And that was like, like that was a game that was not on my radar at that point.

02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:34.920
And then after that, I was like that I remember that I don't usually go the art direction

02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:36.920
and that was really fucking good.

02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:39.800
But I walked out of the Witcher 3 going the art direction.

02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:41.560
And that was really fucking good.

02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:41.800
Yeah.

02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:44.360
I haven't played the Witcher 3 or any of the other Witcher games.

02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:45.080
I may have to try that.

02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:46.040
You should try Witcher 3.

02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:46.680
It's pretty.

02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:47.880
And I say that to myself too.

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:49.480
I played a little bit, but not nearly enough.

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:54.680
I really need to like, instead of going back and playing more Diablo or playing Final Fantasy

02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:57.720
12 again or so, I need to go back and fucking force myself to play the Witcher 3.

02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.640
Cause it is, it is very, um, or Fallout store and Grand Theft Auto.

02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:02.760
Yes, or Fallout 4.

02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:04.440
All right.

02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:11.480
Anyhow, um, or maybe I could play this game cause this might be something that's coming.

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:17.800
Now take this with a big grain of salt because it's coming from user forums.

02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:21.160
Oh no, not user forums.

02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:22.040
I know, I know.

02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:27.800
But there's a lot of buzz around the fact that Konami was showing something at E3 behind

02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:29.960
closed doors that was under an NDA.

02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:36.680
There's a lot of, there's a lot of buzz and it's going to be revealed soon.

02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:37.320
A lot of buzz.

02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:42.680
It's another Castlevania game, um, that it is something that actually Konami could be

02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:47.800
doing to counteract bloodstain, which seems like a real Dick move in many ways.

02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:48.360
You know what I mean?

02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:50.680
Cause like they're pretty Dick company nowadays.

02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:53.800
I guess so, but, um, which I don't know how you counter it.

02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:56.120
The only way you counter it is to get the jump on it.

02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:59.240
So if they're about to announce a Castlevania game, then they're going to say like, this

02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:01.480
thing is almost done and coming out like now.

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:05.640
But the other thing that they say goes with this, and I guess this comes from the same

02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:10.440
leaker that had said Ridley and Ice Climbers are back in Super Smash Brothers.

02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:15.960
Um, this same leaker is saying Simon Belmont is an unannounced character in Super Smash

02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:20.760
Brothers Ultimate, which I, I I'd fucking love that honestly.

02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:25.800
And you know, even though you probably go, well Castlevania, Nintendo, go way back to

02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:33.160
the NES days and Castlevania three was on the classic NES class, uh, super, super Castlevania

02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:34.600
four on the super NES.

02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:39.080
So it's not like Nintendo Konami's like Castlevania's relationship, like went anywhere.

02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:40.520
So yes, I'm in Belmont.

02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:40.680
Fuck.

02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:40.920
Yeah.

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:42.360
That's something I associate with.

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:43.320
It's back.

02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:43.880
So why not?

02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:44.360
Why not?

02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:45.240
Exactly.

02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:47.800
So from that standpoint, it makes a lot of sense.

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.520
I, it does feel a little bit fanfic to me.

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:52.680
Um, but I'm saying I'm not going to expect it.

02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:54.520
I'm going to take it with a huge grain of salt.

02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:58.120
I would love to see Konami bring back Castlevania, I guess.

02:16:58.120 --> 02:16:59.400
I mean, they got to do it right.

02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:03.800
And it's going to be weird with Igarashi not there, but I'll give them the benefit of the

02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:04.300
doubt.

02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.240
Apparently also the Castlevania thing could be being held back a little bit because of

02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:09.960
the anime.

02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:12.040
That also makes a lot of sense.

02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:14.840
Netflix's Castlevania anime is doing pretty well.

02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:15.640
Why not revisit?

02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:17.480
I just was browsing Netflix the other day.

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:19.160
I'm like, Oh yeah, that's on there.

02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:19.320
Yeah.

02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:20.520
Totally forgot about that.

02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:25.640
So well, and Bob, Bob coffee and chat says, Konami making a new game lulz.

02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:31.000
You forget though, that bomber man game that they did for the switch release did pretty

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:31.320
well.

02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:32.680
It exceeded expectations.

02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:37.000
Now, I think the reason for that is there wasn't a lot of games that released besides

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.480
Zelda, the PlayStation four and Xbox one versions.

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:40.920
Do you know that it's on those systems?

02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:41.560
Yes.

02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:45.720
But I mean, that game did very well, I think because it came out at a really good time,

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:49.160
but whatever the reason, bomber man kind of exceeded expectations.

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.920
So I think this is making Konami kind of take a second look at the retro library, which

02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:55.080
we've been fucking saying for 10 years, but whatever.

02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:57.560
Finally, what is it with game companies getting the memo?

02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:01.000
Like three years to one game in the retro library that could use another release.

02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:03.080
Does it start with dance?

02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:04.280
It does start with dance.

02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:05.160
Does it start with beat?

02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:07.420
All right.

02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:09.560
Both at the same time.

02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:12.840
You better not say it starts with beat because then they might confuse that as, Oh, new beat

02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:13.340
and groovy.

02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:14.920
Yeah.

02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:15.320
Good point.

02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:15.820
Good point.

02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:16.840
All right.

02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:22.120
Oh, as Joe and her Matt two points out, uh, bomber man is an assist trophy and smell that

02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:24.120
what they did go out of their way to show that.

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:29.240
So, you know, Konami and, and, uh, Nintendo are still friends.

02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:31.000
So we'll see.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:35.800
Uh, Bob coffee says the next season of Castlevania anime is supposed to drop in July.

02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:40.760
Maybe news will drop at anime expo or later in July at San Diego comic con.

02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:44.520
I think games come, they're announcing, Oh, and by the way, the new, the new playable

02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:51.640
character master chief in his fucking cross play with the X bar and the ceiling opens

02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:53.080
up and Mike's fall from the ceiling.

02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:54.280
No, I don't think that will happen.

02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:58.440
And then all of a sudden Gabe tumbles from the ceiling goes, sorry about steam, but half

02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:04.440
life three, that won't happen because that will involve apologizing for steam.

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:05.720
All right.

02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:08.200
A few more stories for you guys before the Skypline dark soccer.

02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:09.000
What do you have for us?

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.280
Speaking of animes, right?

02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:15.320
Yeah, well, um, trigger in Arc system and we know Arc system works has done, um, guilty

02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:20.520
year blaze blue and recently dragon ball fighter Z they're doing a kill a kill game.

02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:23.160
I am down for this because I fucking love kill a kill.

02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:27.400
Remember fashion, fashion kills fashion is murder.

02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:31.720
Um, so yeah, I don't know if it's going to be a fighting game.

02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:34.360
It just says that it's kill a kill the game.

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:40.680
Um, they say that it should be published in 2019, so we'll see what happens when it happens,

02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:42.200
but I'm still happy.

02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:47.960
As long as we have like little Omake scenes with Mako in it, I'd be, be pretty, pretty

02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:48.460
entertained.

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:53.240
Um, but it's, it's described as kill a kill battle action.

02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:58.040
This doesn't say if it's going to be a fighting game or what type of, you know, I would assume

02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:03.560
it's a fighting game since it's Arc system, but still whatever it is.

02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:07.000
I guess Arc system works are saying in chat is publishing it, but the people behind little

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.360
witch academia are making it.

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:09.320
Okay.

02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:09.820
Yeah.

02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:11.160
Well, we'll see.

02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:14.840
I'm looking at their English website right now and huh, this is awesome.

02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:17.080
I fucking love kill a kill.

02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:20.040
I freaking cried at the end of kill a kill.

02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:20.920
So it was great.

02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:22.840
All right.

02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:27.800
Uh, Loki, I know you, I know you didn't put this on your show row request thread, but

02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:29.640
I was like, I know he's going to want to talk about it.

02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:31.400
Of course I want to talk about it.

02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:36.760
So you may remember we talked about the Bethesda conference and one of the jokes that was in

02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:42.440
there was the Skyrim, very special edition, which was, you know, playing Skyrim on Alexa.

02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:42.920
Right.

02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:43.800
And that's hilarious.

02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:45.240
Yeah.

02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:48.360
It's hilarious because you know, it was a funny video and stuff.

02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:54.120
But we just couldn't leave it at that, but you were disappointed.

02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:55.720
You were like, I want this to be real.

02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:59.480
But at that point it was not just leave the joke at that.

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:01.960
They had to go 100% with the joke.

02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:04.920
And yes, it is a real thing.

02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:06.280
I appreciate that commitment.

02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:09.960
You can download it to run on Alexa.

02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:13.240
That is, that is now my favorite announcement out of Bethesda's conference.

02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:18.840
Or if you don't happen to own an Alexa device, you can also get it through, you know, if

02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:24.360
you get, um, through the Amazon store app on iOS or Amazon Alexa app through Android,

02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:28.120
you can also click on Alexa and have her get that as well.

02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:28.760
So nice.

02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:30.360
Yes.

02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:31.000
That's awesome.

02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:33.960
Hooray for silly jokes.

02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:34.760
It is free.

02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:35.320
Yay.

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:36.120
Free 99.

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:36.920
My favorite price.

02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:39.000
So go check it out.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:39.560
All right.

02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:42.520
Just try not to knock all your furniture over like that dude did in the trailer.

02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:47.560
And then the wife or whoever that was supposed to be comes in and goes, will that thing clean

02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:48.120
that shit up?

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
That was my favorite.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:51.320
All right.

02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:54.520
Anyway, um, one more news story for you guys.

02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:58.200
And, uh, you know, we aren't going to be here next week, so I don't want you guys to forget.

02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:00.520
But games done quick is going to get started.

02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:01.480
So you know what?

02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:04.840
I am totally fine with the fact that we're going to take a week off.

02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:06.840
So the games done quick can do their thing.

02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:09.720
We're going to step aside, um, summer games done quick.

02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:11.800
It gets underway on June 24th.

02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:13.480
It's happening in Minnesota.

02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:15.320
It's running through July 1st.

02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:19.640
If you want to attend in person, uh, you can go to the double tree Hilton in Bloomington,

02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:21.560
Minnesota, and that's where it's going to be.

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:25.800
And it's cost $65 if you registered early, but they do have an attendance cap.

02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:29.800
Uh, but I'm sure most of you are going to be watching on Twitch.

02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:34.360
So check that out, uh, next week, although Bobby would like to, uh, you all to remember

02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:35.560
he still will be live.

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:37.720
So you should still listen to him.

02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:38.360
Yes, you should.

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:42.600
But you could, I think Bobby, it would be permissible if at least they listen to the

02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:45.960
podcast at some point in the week, Bobby's been really good about getting his podcast

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:47.080
up within a couple of days.

02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:49.960
So at least listen to Bobby at some point during the week, if you're not going to be

02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:55.720
here live on Sunday night, just like we would hope you would listen to a OLR on the podcast.

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:58.120
If you could not be here live.

02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:01.160
Uh, and I'm sure Bobby will tell you about what's going on in Summer Games Done Quick.

02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:04.280
And hopefully whatever game they're doing, maybe he'll luck out.

02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.360
They'll be doing a transition during that time or something.

02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:07.400
Setting up for something big.

02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:07.880
I don't know.

02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:09.400
Anyway, but there you go.

02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:13.400
Summer Games Done Quick is coming up and, uh, I didn't, oh, I didn't catch the charity.

02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:15.720
Uh, what charity are they raising money for this time?

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:16.520
You guys know, where is it?

02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:17.560
Doctors Without Borders.

02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:18.920
It's always Doctors Without Borders.

02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:23.320
Uh, it is, well, they say that in their history, but I want to know, oh yeah, no, it is.

02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:27.160
Charity is Doctor Without Borders, but they have done Prevent Cancer Foundation.

02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:28.280
I think that's their winner one.

02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:29.640
I know they do one in the summer, one in the winter.

02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:32.040
So Doctors Without Borders is the charity.

02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:35.800
That's important to get out there too, because technically you could donate to that charity

02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:38.920
without this event, but I'm pretty sure it will be a big incentive.

02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:41.240
All right, let's open up the Skype line.

02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:43.560
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:47.160
If you want to get in and call, um, I may be limiting the length of some of the calls

02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:49.080
tonight just so we can get through.

02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:53.960
So please don't take it as a personal offense if I limit your call a little bit, just to

02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:57.320
make sure we get through everybody that wants to call, assuming people do want to call.

02:23:57.320 --> 02:24:01.480
It is the 16th anniversary, not to guilt you, but, um, we're not going to be here next week.

02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:05.160
Anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:07.400
Do we have any last minute stories we want to squeeze in while we wait?

02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:14.200
Um, yeah, I was going to talk about Netflix is going to be getting, um, more gaming on

02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:14.840
the platform.

02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:16.280
Not really Netflix.

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:20.440
Yeah, not really necessarily gaming per se, but you remember that they've done some of

02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.920
these like interactive storybook type things.

02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:28.680
So they have a Minecraft story mode, um, is licensed to do five interactive narrative

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:30.600
series that are going to be coming out this fall.

02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:33.400
So they have that.

02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:33.960
I like that.

02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:35.480
Let's get to the calls.

02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:36.520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:36.920
Who's this?

02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:39.320
Hey, this is Reginator.

02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:40.840
Hey buddy, what's your question for us tonight?

02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:47.160
Uh, well, no, before I get to my camera, I just want to call tonight.

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:50.680
So I do want to encourage you to, to try to get to it as fast as you can.

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:56.680
Uh, well, I was just going to say, you know, congratulations on 16 years of, uh, you know,

02:24:56.680 --> 02:24:57.720
of doing the show.

02:24:57.720 --> 02:24:58.040
Thank you.

02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:06.120
Uh, it now for my question now is, you know, uh, considering the main focus of tonight's

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:15.800
show has been, uh, E3, um, was there anything, uh, that you were kind of sort of hoping

02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:23.000
that would be, uh, talked about in any, any of the press conferences that wasn't, uh,

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:29.560
or maybe something that you were, you know, kind of sort of knew something about, but

02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:33.720
they make appearance or maybe some kind of surprise that, um,

02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:36.840
for me, it would be final fantasy 16.

02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:41.080
I was really convinced this was going to be the year they would give us a peek at it.

02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:45.960
Um, I thought maybe we'd get a more traditional final fantasy, uh, like, like final fantasy

02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:50.120
nine style or, or, you know, four style maybe in the engine of 15, but I guess that's kind

02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:51.560
of what the remake is supposed to be.

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:57.160
So, and maybe I think in many ways, final fantasy seven remake is final fantasy 16.

02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:59.640
Not that I think they're going to rebrand it as that, but I feel like we're not going

02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:04.280
to progress in the final fantasy series until this seven remake happens, which is starting

02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.280
to make me resent this remake a little bit.

02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:09.240
So I really hope they figure it out and get this out.

02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:14.280
I mean, obviously I want it to be good, but I want them to also move on with the main

02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:15.000
games.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.920
So, um, there is that.

02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:23.240
Um, but, uh, let's see, otherwise I guess I would join the echoes of people on the switch

02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:25.320
and I'm sure Jamie's in this camp too.

02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:28.600
I was really hoping to hear about animal crossings future and thought that this might be the

02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:29.480
year for that.

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:33.560
And, uh, to come up short on that and maybe, maybe that that peak at Metroid prime four

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:34.440
would have been nice.

02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:36.040
Uh, Jamie, Loki, anything you want to add?

02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:39.080
Think thing you, you wish you would have heard of at E3 that you didn't.

02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:40.360
Borderlands three.

02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:40.920
Yeah.

02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:41.800
That's a good call.

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:42.760
Where the hell was that?

02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:44.760
Very good call animal crossing.

02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:45.320
That's it.

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:45.800
Yeah.

02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:46.840
That's all I care about.

02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:47.400
Uh, quickly.

02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:50.120
Reginator anything in your camp that you, you were hoping for?

02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:54.040
Um, two answers, a serious answer.

02:26:54.600 --> 02:27:00.520
Maybe, you know, some of the third party companies would resurrect some of their somewhat forgotten

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:06.600
a series like Namco Bandai bringing back, uh, no, uh, what's my call it?

02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:14.920
Uh, they're, uh, they're one racing series, uh, Ridge racer and not, not like, uh, the

02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:20.760
Ridge racer and bothered crap, you know, style game, but more true to form PlayStation one

02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:27.720
games, games like, uh, our four or, uh, or, you know, the earlier titles check out horizon

02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:28.200
four though.

02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:32.280
I'm I'm gonna, they don't pay me to push that series, but I love me some fours of horizon.

02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:35.960
So if you like your arcade racers, uh, put your eyes over there.

02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:37.320
Yeah.

02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:37.640
Yeah.

02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:44.920
In fact, I got that recently on the original 360, um, and the game was pretty good.

02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:47.800
Um, no, it was for a joke cancer.

02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:49.320
I would have loved to have seen a game.

02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:56.040
You'll come out on stage, drop pants with, uh, you know, a half-life tattooed on his

02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:02.120
nether regions and him giving everyone the fingers and sucking, you know, motherfuckers

02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:02.680
or whatever.

02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:04.440
I know.

02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:07.000
I'd rather not see that either, but yeah, I understand.

02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:10.600
If something like that is going to happen, it has to be extra.

02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:13.400
So, uh, I appreciate the calls, uh, rage Nader.

02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:14.440
Thank you so much and take care.

02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:14.680
Okay.

02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:15.560
Yep.

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:16.200
Have a good one.

02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:17.000
You too.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.120
Uh, orange launch radio.

02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:18.920
All one word on Skype.

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:22.440
If you want to get through, uh, act F says no Kirby game.

02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:23.080
E3 ruined.

02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:24.680
Did you just get a fucking Kirby game?

02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:26.280
Yeah, there was a Kirby game.

02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:29.400
They just, will you let us F zero fans have a moment?

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:33.080
Just like the people complaining about wasn't fucking had a Kirby game.

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.520
I'm getting a star Fox game.

02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:36.520
Oh my God.

02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:37.240
What do you think this is?

02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:39.160
Call of duty where you get a new game every year.

02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:41.320
Act F put a frown face.

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:41.560
Fine.

02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:42.200
I'll get, you know what?

02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:44.280
Act F I'll meet you halfway.

02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:47.000
I would have enjoyed a new Kirby golf game.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:47.640
How about that?

02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:48.120
All right.

02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:49.240
We got another call coming in.

02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:50.280
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:50.680
Who's this?

02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:52.600
Hey, what's going on?

02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:53.320
It's Ranya.

02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:54.120
Hey Rama.

02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:56.920
You're now I can see that you're not calling from a Dixie cup.

02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:00.040
I think that microphone, your gain is like really high up on that.

02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:00.840
It's really busted.

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:01.480
I think that's what's up.

02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:08.760
Well, I've had trouble with it lately, so I think it's with my setup, but my systems

02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:10.200
is low over here for an update.

02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:15.960
So that's not here nor there, but I only turn on the webcam for two reasons.

02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:18.200
I already saw what you got in your hand.

02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:18.920
I know it's coming.

02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:19.560
I can't wait.

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.840
My favorite, my favorite.

02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:23.160
This is a bottle of, is that vodka?

02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:26.120
No, this is Puerto Rican rum, my friend.

02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.200
Oh, even guys, Puerto Rican rum.

02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:31.880
So as you can see, he's opening it up.

02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:36.360
This is the type I don't need to do heroes of the storm commentating.

02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:38.360
I want to do people drinking, commentating.

02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:43.080
So, uh, this lovely man on our cam right now is pouring a shot of that rum into a little

02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:43.800
shot glass.

02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:45.080
It's a, it's a plain shot glass.

02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:46.840
I don't see a logo or anything on it.

02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:49.800
Oh, there's a real flavor similar to Final Fantasy on there.

02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:52.040
So I don't know if you see it that well.

02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:52.520
I see it.

02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:54.200
It's one of those frosted glass things.

02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:54.680
Okay.

02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:58.280
It's a, it's a plain shot glass, you know, to remind you that we don't have anything

02:29:58.280 --> 02:29:59.320
branded that we sell.

02:29:59.320 --> 02:29:59.560
All right.

02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:00.520
Let the man make a toast.

02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:04.680
Well, I will say that I have no problem doing shots while doing a live stream.

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:12.120
You know, I got nothing else better to do, but to have a great 16th from the younger

02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:14.040
brother at anime jam session.

02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:16.760
So thank you so much.

02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:22.680
Which means that since Travis is getting all the car, you have to drive us around.

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:24.760
Uh, Rama, I'm going to need you to do another shot.

02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:32.920
I already gave you shit over, over your alley.

02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:34.600
Don't, don't get me started tonight.

02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:35.720
Rama, it's my birthday.

02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:37.320
It's my 16th birthday.

02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:38.680
It's my party.

02:30:38.680 --> 02:30:43.880
So I'm going to need him to do another shot because I was waiting for the here's to you

02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:45.240
and here's to me.

02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:46.440
That's all right.

02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:47.320
He knows where I'm going.

02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:48.920
All right, here we go.

02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:51.400
I got the man to take another shot.

02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:52.200
I love it.

02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:53.640
He's pouring himself a second shot.

02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:59.160
And I, all I see is his lips going motherfucker.

02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:02.440
This is why I love you.

02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:05.160
Here's to you.

02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:06.040
Here's to me.

02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:07.800
The best of friends we'll ever be.

02:31:07.800 --> 02:31:10.920
If we should ever happen to disagree, well, then thank you.

02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:11.800
And here's to me.

02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:13.000
Thank you, sir.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.320
That was, that was the toast I was waiting for my friend.

02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:19.960
I held up on the toast cause you were cutting it for time.

02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:23.640
I didn't want to take up any more time, but I guess this is an exception to the rule.

02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:25.880
Actually, Rob, I'm going to need you to do one more shot.

02:31:25.880 --> 02:31:30.280
No, I'm kidding.

02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:35.000
We would do at the end of D and D that actually was in mass effect.

02:31:36.200 --> 02:31:37.800
Um, here's to us.

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:39.160
Who's like us.

02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:40.840
Damn few.

02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:41.560
And they're all dead.

02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:44.120
All right.

02:31:44.120 --> 02:31:46.360
Rama drink responsibly.

02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:47.000
I know you do.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:47.640
Thank you so much.

02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:48.280
You know what?

02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:52.600
I, you have been listening to this show for a very, very, very long time and I appreciate

02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:53.320
you so much.

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:57.640
And, uh, I, the show that you guys do makes me proud y'all.

02:31:58.280 --> 02:31:59.480
And we appreciate it.

02:31:59.480 --> 02:32:03.160
And like you said at the top of the show, we're all like family.

02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:04.680
We've been here for each other.

02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:06.040
Y'all have been there for the past year.

02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:09.960
My mother, you have been there when my ex dumped me and other cool things.

02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:12.760
So I, you know how much I really appreciate having this show.

02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:16.120
So, Hey, why we appreciate having you as part of the fam.

02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:16.920
All right.

02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:18.520
Hey, that's all that matters.

02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:20.440
So I'm going to be on my nose a little way now.

02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:20.680
All right.

02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:21.320
One more shot.

02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:21.960
It'll help you sleep.

02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:22.600
Take care, buddy.

02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:25.320
Bye my friend.

02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:28.760
All right.

02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:30.040
We'll try to squeeze in one more call.

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:33.320
If you can get in here, orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:34.440
If you want to give us a call.

02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:38.920
By the way, I just got a text message from our buddy, uh, Brad at pod culture who said

02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:40.120
no fireball in the house.

02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:43.480
Cause that's his go-to drink, but cracking a cold one for OLR.

02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:44.360
And this sounds good.

02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:45.240
Uh, dark soccer.

02:32:45.240 --> 02:32:46.200
I think you'd be into this too.

02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:47.480
It's like a pineapple.

02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:49.640
It's an apple pineapple, hard cider.

02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:52.120
That's very similar to the mimosa you had earlier.

02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.320
You know what I'm making though right now?

02:32:53.320 --> 02:32:57.000
I'm infusing vodka with, um, fresh plums and cherries.

02:32:57.960 --> 02:32:58.600
A little bit of it.

02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:02.200
Cause I can't have much, but I, of course I also have grapefruit soju at home.

02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:02.760
Right.

02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:06.200
Well, you could always invite me over to drink and Guinness and then sleep on the couch and

02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:08.440
some belching beaver peanut butter milk stout.

02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:09.000
All right.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.120
Last call for calls.

02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:12.360
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:12.840
Let me check in.

02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:14.840
If there's any other last minute stories we want to get to.

02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:15.160
Nope.

02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:15.880
Don't have anything.

02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:16.760
No, nothing.

02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:17.720
All right.

02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:22.520
Uh, looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:25.080
Um, let's see.

02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:28.360
Um, dark to see you saying Rob over here trying to get Rama drunk.

02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:29.400
That's what I do.

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:33.080
Uh, Brad from pod culture also in chat says, uh, it's fucking tasty.

02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:36.600
Sia Tabiri says apple pen, pineapple pen cider.

02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:40.200
Way to go meme from a year ago.

02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:43.640
Rob, I'm gonna have to take you to up cider in San Francisco.

02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:44.760
It's nothing but cider.

02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:47.320
Nothing but yummy from all over the world.

02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:51.080
Many of them on tap, but they had a black bear, uh, a blackberry cider

02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:53.880
from Spain that was to die for.

02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:54.200
Nice.

02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:55.400
I will have to take you there.

02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:58.200
Um, unfortunately, you know, my July is booked solid.

02:33:58.200 --> 02:33:59.640
Who says I have to take you there now?

02:33:59.640 --> 02:33:59.960
I know.

02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:04.040
I know me, but, uh, my July is booked pretty solid at least Saturdays.

02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:05.480
Cause there's rehearsals coming up.

02:34:05.480 --> 02:34:08.760
I should plug this for anybody who is local in Northern California.

02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:10.840
We are going to be doing clue the movie.

02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:11.240
That's right.

02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:14.440
The old school movie from 1985 with Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn,

02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:17.880
clue the movie live on stage and on screen.

02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:20.600
So it's like a Rocky horse style shadow cast.

02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:21.720
And you ready for this?

02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:23.400
I don't even know if I should be saying this on the show.

02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:23.900
You ready?

02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:27.880
I am unretired because I stopped performing in these shows a few years ago.

02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:28.600
I still host them.

02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:30.840
I host them all the time, but I stopped performing in them.

02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:32.840
I unretired to do this role.

02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:34.520
I'm going to be playing.

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:37.560
Mrs. Peacock in clue.

02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:41.480
So if you're local, I really, we bought makeup today.

02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:41.880
Yes, we did.

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:42.920
We went out and bought makeup.

02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:46.520
I bought, I brought one of my best gal pals out to go make up shopping with me.

02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:47.960
So check that out.

02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:48.600
All right.

02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:51.240
Anyway, uh, the Skype line is not lighting up anymore.

02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:55.400
So I hope you guys will at least tweet us at OLR or maybe, uh, leave us, uh, an email

02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:58.120
participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:01.160
But again, you know, we've already gotten a little heavy tonight, but I really want

02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:03.960
to thank all you guys for your support over the past 16 years.

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:07.240
Thank you so much for helping orange launch radio be the show that it is today.

02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:10.520
If you liked what you heard here at OLR, give us all your money.

02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:11.640
No, I'm, I'm, I'm kidding.

02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:15.960
We don't usually end the show with that, but, uh, I will say in, in lieu of, uh, you

02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:20.120
know, uh, whatever money giving source I would give you here, I would say, help us

02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:20.760
spread the word.

02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:22.680
Um, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:25.480
Help us spread the word because orange launch radio is just show where every gamer

02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:26.040
has a voice.

02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:28.440
But if the voices aren't here, we can't hear them.

02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:32.600
Uh, a nice five star, we're just hearing voices, a nice five star review on a place

02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:36.680
like iTunes or Google play podcasts or wherever it is you heard this show.

02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:38.120
Those go an awful long way.

02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:41.160
You guys, you really can't underestimate the power of those good reviews.

02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:44.680
So please, please take a moment to leave us those reviews would really appreciate it.

02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:46.440
Um, let's go around and wrap it up.

02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:46.840
Bradley.

02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:49.720
I know I didn't get to talk to you a lot past the introduction, but I saw you, I saw

02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:51.640
you playing on your 3DS over there.

02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.800
I hope, uh, I hope you had a good time.

02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:54.360
How was it?

02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:55.000
It was good.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.360
It's good to have you here just for support, especially since I know you were one of the

02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:01.960
faces that was here early on in OLR history.

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:02.440
What do you think?

02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:03.080
Let me ask you this.

02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:03.720
We'll leave on this.

02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:08.200
What, what, what do you think's changed the most in 16 years here on this show from

02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:09.800
what you've observed in the past to now?

02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:15.240
It's hard thing to think about, uh, the format of course.

02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:21.000
And, and of course the game industry and how, how much indies have grown up and all

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:21.960
that kind of stuff.

02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:22.520
That's true.

02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:27.240
Indies self publishing has, was not a thing that was around when this show started.

02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:30.680
Well, PC was one thing, but you didn't even have as critical as I've been esteem.

02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:33.400
That wasn't even around, you know, all those years ago.

02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:33.880
You know what I mean?

02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:34.440
So yeah.

02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:35.160
Yeah, it's true.

02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:36.760
Indies have come a long, long way.

02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:38.440
It's a good, uh, good, good headline.

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:41.160
Anyway, any final thoughts or any final things you want to get out here, Bradley?

02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:42.520
Not really.

02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:42.840
All right.

02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:43.400
Fair enough.

02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:46.040
I would, I would, thank you.

02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:46.760
Thank you for being here.

02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:48.120
Thank you for sharing in the fun.

02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:50.120
Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:51.560
Um, Loki, I'll start with you.

02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.920
Um, my final thought is that, I don't know.

02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:00.280
I wish I have energy to work on my game this week.

02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:05.000
Cause I sure as hell haven't had time or energy to do it cause I'm working out.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.080
Well, I have incorporated weight training now.

02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:11.240
So now my workouts go from 30 minutes of just, Oh, you lift weights, bro.

02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:12.920
So now I have to do that.

02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:13.800
Yeah.

02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:17.640
I lift weights, weights that are very light.

02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:18.680
Bro, you even lift.

02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:22.200
Apparently my ass is weaker than I thought.

02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:27.720
Like I'm like, I used to live more weight in high school and that was like nothing.

02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:27.880
Wait.

02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:29.240
So you start deadlifting.

02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:32.440
You should see one of the challenges I had to do for that survivor game.

02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:34.840
I was playing on Facebook that I didn't get very far in.

02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:36.360
I talked about this on a previous episode.

02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:40.120
But I had to do a thing with five pound weights where like, for like 20 minutes,

02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:43.880
I had to have like one hand on the ground and the five pound weight up in the air.

02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:44.440
Oh my God.

02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:46.120
I don't know how my old ass did it.

02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:46.520
Huh?

02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:47.160
Five pounds?

02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:47.720
Yeah.

02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:49.400
It's harder than you think.

02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:49.560
Yeah.

02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:52.520
I used to do that with, um, kettlebells for 20 minutes.

02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:57.640
Well, not with, with for 20 minutes, but we'd have to do, um, a 15 kilogram kettlebell.

02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:01.000
Um, a series of them for a Turkish get up.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:05.000
I had to do it while this guy in Massachusetts,

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.680
who ended up being the first one to be voted out.

02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:09.880
He, he was doing this whole thing where he had to like

02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:13.240
move plastic cups and stack them with nothing but his mouth.

02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:19.800
And if I dropped, if I dropped the weight at any point, he had to start over.

02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.440
Oh, so it was one of those like, you have to rely on other people not to fuck up.

02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:25.480
It was interesting.

02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:27.960
But anyway, well, look, you were saying.

02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:31.640
Oh, I was just saying it takes a long time to do all that crap.

02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:32.920
Yes, it does.

02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:35.320
Especially if you're watching your form, which you should always be watching your form.

02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:36.520
I'm trying to watch my form.

02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:39.640
I need to watch my, like, I was even doing like, I started like,

02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:40.440
I even mixed it up.

02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:43.080
I was going to do a different type of like ab workout and thing.

02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:44.840
And they have me do like, it's like a rush.

02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:48.200
I think they call them like Russian turns or Russian curls or something like that.

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:49.720
And like, and I tried doing it.

02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:53.800
You're supposed to like sit on your ass, like sitting down, feet are up in the air a little

02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:56.520
bit, and then you have to turn your torso left and right.

02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:57.640
Holding your hands together.

02:38:57.640 --> 02:38:57.800
Yeah.

02:38:57.800 --> 02:38:59.400
My body doesn't want to fucking do that.

02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:01.960
It's just like, it's like, no, you can't turn.

02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:03.640
Stretch a lot and just ease into it.

02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:07.480
But you should always warm up before you stretch.

02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:10.040
Just saying, because then you will, you will pull something.

02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:11.800
All right.

02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:15.560
Uh, my final thought is this is the last OLR of my thirties.

02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:17.800
By the next time you hear me, I'm going to be in my forties.

02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:21.320
And, um, you know what I look for, I, I, I really can't believe.

02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:26.040
I'm going to be 40 years old and still doing this show, but I don't mean that in a negative

02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:26.360
way.

02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:29.880
Like it's, it's one of those, like, no, I know, I know I'm talking to me personally.

02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:34.440
But I'm like, you've already lived it.

02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:37.880
Well then maybe, maybe did you have this thought that like, I'm 40 years old and I'm still

02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:38.760
doing all our no.

02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:40.840
Oh, well then I guess it's just me.

02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:43.480
So it's, you're not going to be a year older.

02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:45.080
You're going to be a week and a half older.

02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:45.640
I know.

02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:45.960
I know.

02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:46.840
It's not a big deal.

02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:48.440
It's just a, it's just a fucking number.

02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:50.120
I'm still the same Rob Roberts.

02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:53.800
I'm still the gore hating Rob Roberts that I would not Chris Gore though.

02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:58.440
Cause he's cool, but I'm not the blood and gore hating Rob Roberts.

02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:00.600
Uh, this has nothing to do with my age.

02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:01.080
All right.

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:02.440
Anyway, that's it for my final thought.

02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:04.440
I just want to thank everybody again for the love.

02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:07.720
Uh, last but not least ladies last dark soccer, your final thought.

02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:13.640
Um, I am six pounds away away from having lost a hundred pounds since last October.

02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:14.280
Congratulations.

02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:14.920
Congratulations.

02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:15.160
Yeah.

02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:20.840
And since I haven't told anybody publicly what I did and people have asked and I'm just

02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:22.280
going to go ahead and be upfront with it.

02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:25.960
You had, I'm sure I had gastric bypass in December.

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:32.040
And I've had some, uh, highs and lows, but before my decision to have, it was the fact

02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:37.560
that I could not walk due to pain in my feet and I had to stop, um, going to the gym, lifting

02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:42.840
weights like I was in the past because of, um, a very debilitating problem with my spine.

02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:45.240
I had no other way to do this.

02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:48.840
And so I just want to tell everybody out there, don't think it's a cop out.

02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:52.920
Don't think that it's a easy fix because it fucking is not.

02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:55.000
I still suffer.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:59.160
Like I had to go, you know, I was sick during the break.

02:40:59.160 --> 02:40:59.880
I'll leave it that way.

02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:04.280
But for any, your body's still learning what my body's doing.

02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:04.760
Yeah.

02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:08.920
But if you know anyone who has ever been through it, do not give them shit for it.

02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:11.000
Be proud of them for taking that step.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.160
It is not an easy fix at all.

02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:15.000
It doesn't work for everybody.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:20.280
It's killed some people before I was to be, you know, I've, because I've said this to

02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:23.160
you before, I was honestly surprised when you told me you were getting it.

02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.280
Cause obviously I knew I was surprised when you told me you were getting it because I

02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:28.040
was like Jamie.

02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:31.640
I mean, I know people that have gas that are large individuals.

02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:37.400
And I wasn't, you know, but you weren't, I never kind of put you in that large lady

02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:37.880
bucket.

02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:38.440
You know what I mean?

02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:39.640
So I was really surprised.

02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:40.120
Thank you.

02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:43.000
But I was never, I was kind of surprised when you told me, but then when you told me all

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:48.280
this other stuff that was happening, it was like, Oh, because I had, cause I'm so I'm

02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:49.240
only five three.

02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:51.400
And by the way, I love large ladies too.

02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:53.960
There is nothing wrong with big butts and you cannot lie.

02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:54.520
That's right.

02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:56.200
Cause round bottom girls move the world.

02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:02.200
Love yourself large, small, because sometimes our society makes people that are too small

02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:03.640
feel like crappy too.

02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:04.520
And that's shitty too.

02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:08.040
So you love yourself no matter what body you got.

02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:11.480
I had no problem with myself visually.

02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:16.360
You know, I, I believe in body positivity, but I do believe that there comes a point

02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:18.520
where if you are in so much pain,

02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:19.800
but if your feet and your back are,

02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:23.800
well, I was in that cast for a month and you remember when we would go walking before I'd

02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:24.760
lag way behind.

02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:25.400
Yeah.

02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:27.480
I was a few steps ahead of you today.

02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:28.040
I walked around.

02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:29.080
Okay, well let's not get carried away.

02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:29.720
You know what I mean?

02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:33.800
But I was, I was at drag con for three days on my feet and then to Disneyland the next

02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:35.640
day and then went to see where it all the day after that.

02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:40.840
And I'm just saying, I believe in positivity and health at any size, at any shape.

02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:47.400
But when you come to the point where the size is becoming a medical factor, where it affects

02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:50.040
your quality of life, you have to make a brave decision.

02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:52.200
I'm not saying that I'm the bravest person in the world because I'm certainly not the

02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:53.480
only person that's done it.

02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:57.320
Sometimes you have to take a decision for the sake of your health because I don't think

02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:01.400
I would have been able to do OLR in another two years.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.600
And so I was thinking about it today.

02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:05.960
I hurt to drive.

02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:07.560
I hurt to do anything.

02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:09.000
I hurt to sit at my desk too long.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:14.200
My, my lungs hurt and now I am healthier than I've ever been.

02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:16.120
I can get around and do things.

02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:22.200
I have a lot more energy for stuff and I really had a lot of the listeners were really

02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:23.800
supportive of me, the people that I told.

02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:27.320
So I want to thank all of you for, you've given a lot of hints to that.

02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:29.080
I bet a lot of sleuths might have figured it out.

02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:33.240
I know I haven't like fully hidden it, but I'm not, I don't like to share everything

02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:34.040
that's gone on in my life.

02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:36.280
It's your fucking business, but it ain't video games.

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:40.280
Some people have asked, I will be upfront and also I've been able to play DDR again.

02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:44.120
And that's what it's really all about here on the 16 years of OLR.

02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:44.440
Yeah.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:46.760
Lots of love in chat room, by the way.

02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:48.040
So happy for dark soccer.

02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:49.880
Really happy for you, Jamie, less than three.

02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:51.640
So there you go.

02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:56.120
I went from, now I only buy old Navy jeans, not to give them that, but they're comfy.

02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:57.640
I went from a size 18 to a 10.

02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:01.000
So if that gives anyone any indication I've lost.

02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:05.080
I don't ever notice when people lose weight and that type of thing.

02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:05.800
Like I just don't.

02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:09.960
But like I do notice a different Jamie than I used to see.

02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:10.520
Yeah.

02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:13.480
The first place to be fair, you put it on your own Instagram.

02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:14.600
Like here's me before.

02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:15.160
Here's me now.

02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:15.400
Yeah.

02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:19.640
I was, I was being, you know, but it's people, I guess some people hadn't put it together.

02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:23.400
And I've told, you know, a few people I'm closest to, but I just want to say for anyone

02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:27.960
out there who is suffering with anything and they think that, and I'm not saying gastric bypass.

02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:32.600
I'm saying that if you talk to your doctor, talk to your doctor, what's right for you.

02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:33.080
Cause you know what?

02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:36.760
I know people that are large and in charge and they go to the doctor and it's like,

02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:38.360
the doctor's like, you're fine.

02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:39.080
But it's fine.

02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:39.640
Everything's fine.

02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:41.960
You're just, you, you were just born large.

02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:43.480
Your genes, that's what your genes do.

02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:44.520
That's what my genes did.

02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:45.320
Rock it.

02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:49.960
But I'm saying, you know, if you feel that you're, you're having pressure in your lungs,

02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:55.000
go to a pulmonary doctor.

02:44:55.880 --> 02:45:01.160
Get, if you are afraid, if you have a pain that you don't recognize, fucking get it seen.

02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:07.160
Cause I, I would have been looking at being unable to walk without a cane in two years.

02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:10.920
And not to completely derail, but I think you would support this too.

02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:14.840
Sometimes that pain, if it's not a visible pain and I'm talking about mental health,

02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:15.400
see a doctor.

02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:15.960
Get it seen.

02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:16.920
Yeah, absolutely.

02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:22.760
You know, if it's something that does not feel like it did, you know, even if it's just

02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:27.240
getting older, you should still go get yourself seen if you have insurance for it.

02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:29.640
If not, there are some free services out there that can help you.

02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:32.840
Medicaid in your state, maybe something you can look into.

02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:33.240
Yeah.

02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:35.320
Or if you're in Canada, then bless you.

02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:39.640
But, um, but I'm saying don't ignore any of the signs.

02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:42.440
And if you have a chance to do something about it, fucking do it.

02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:47.320
Don't wait, don't wait, you know, too much longer because you never know

02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:48.760
how much worse it's going to get.

02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:51.400
So well, a heavy but good note to end on.

02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:53.160
And I wanted just to make sure to leave that with people.

02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:57.880
Cause I love all of our listeners, even the assholes, cause I'm a bit of an asshole,

02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:01.240
but you guys mean a lot to me.

02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:06.200
And I just wanted to share that with you that if you, if it's a pain in your heart,

02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:08.600
physically or otherwise, if it's a pain in your back,

02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:12.200
if it's something that twinge is funny, don't hesitate.

02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:14.440
And if they tell you, no, you're okay.

02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:15.960
And it's still fucking hurting.

02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:20.120
Get a second opinion, make them give you a referral.

02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:23.320
Or at least like I have this, I'm not to, I, we really need to wrap up,

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:25.960
but like I have this bump thing on the back of my neck and I was like,

02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:27.320
Oh my God, is this like a tumor?

02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:28.120
What is this?

02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:30.520
So I went to the doctor cause I was like, it doesn't hurt.

02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:31.400
It was like a cyst.

02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:32.040
What is it?

02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:35.880
No, she, she did the whole thing and she's like, I think it's just a fat pocket.

02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:37.000
And I was like, Oh,

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.760
well, no, this formed a lipoma.

02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:39.080
Yeah.

02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:39.240
Yeah.

02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:41.720
I got a fat neck.

02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:42.520
That's what it is.

02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:43.480
All good.

02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:45.240
But at least I know, at least I know.

02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:48.120
In a nutshell, I want all of you to take good care of yourselves and each other.

02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:50.280
And that's really the most important thing to me.

02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:52.760
You know, sometimes it's scary.

02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:54.840
Sometimes it requires a major lifestyle change,

02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:57.160
but be willing to do what's best for yourself.

02:46:57.160 --> 02:46:57.640
I love that.

02:46:57.640 --> 02:46:59.320
We'll, we'll end it on a Jerry Springer note.

02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:02.520
Since I hear his show is ending, take care of yourselves and each other.

02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:05.240
And don't go punching people unless they're Nazis.

02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:05.960
Punch Nazis.

02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:08.600
Have a great two weeks, everybody.

02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:12.520
