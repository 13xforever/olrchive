WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
It's the most wonderful time of the year

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
When we learn of the games in the near future

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll discuss mentor hope and so on this show

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Thanks for that, Jason. Hi, welcome back everybody to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 734 of our show for this June 10th, 2018

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
And yes, it is that time of the year, the most wonderful time of the year to be a gamer

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Because we get to find out all the games that we'll be playing about a year and a half from now

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
It used to be the games that we would play this holiday, but now it's eh, the games we'll play about a year and a half from now

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Just kidding, we're not that cynical about it, but it is kind of funny

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
It's E3 week everybody, and we're here in studio to talk about all the latest and greatest that is unfolding literally before our eyes tonight

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
My name, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Her name, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, hi

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
How are you, Ms. Summers?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Tired

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I know, you had a prideful day, right?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I did

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Today was Sacramento Pride

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
I worked a booth at Pride and wandered around all over the place

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
But I was there with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
And some of the San Francisco Sisters came out and it was great to see them again

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
And I just had a really good time, but by the time I was ready to go, I was fucking ready

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
And I went home and cleaned off all the makeup and exfoliated and sheet masked

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
And nearly fell asleep with the sheet mask on my face

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
It's like the equivalent of a waffle iron she puts on her face to remove all the...

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
No

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Well, the makeup may be as thick as a waffle iron

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
You were all nervous about coming here with no makeup on tonight

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Lights, camera, and me without a stitch of makeup on

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
That's a very obscure movie reference if you get it

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
I came with the pink powder zit spot stuff on my face

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I was gonna say you look marvelous, darling

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Thank you

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
You don't need makeup, but I understand it is part of the sister ritual

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Well, yeah, but the thing is that I like, you know, going out with a little bit on

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Just because it's artistry for me

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
And today I was just like...

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Lazy Sunday

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I do appreciate your rainbow watch, though

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
You've got a very prideful watch

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh, yeah, I switched to my pride band

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Your LGBTQIA+, et cetera, et cetera

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
No, I ordered the new pride band

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
And it didn't arrive yet because I have the new face on my watch, too

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, that has little dancy lines

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
It is really cool, but I actually like the older pride band better

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
The new one I wish was on, like, a black background

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
With the stripes, it would have been better to me

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I do want to also introduce the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
vognetwork.com

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
And tonight, obviously, our show is being interrupted by one of the E3 press conferences

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
But I'll get to that in a minute

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
But if you are listening live, you can go to live.vognetwork.com

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Where JD is saying you don't need makeup, especially for radio

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
That's true, you know, I've been told plenty of times that I have a face that's perfect for radio

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Anyway, also a man fit for radio

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't know how to take that, but sure

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
It's a compliment, question mark, no I'm just kidding

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
How are you doing, Loki?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm fine

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Good, good

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Enjoying all these announcements so far?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Most of them, yeah

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Not so much EAA, but you know

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Alright, well, let's jump right in

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
We only have about 20 minutes before we get to Bethesda's press conference

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
So here's how it's going to work

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
So tonight, it's about 6.07 Pacific time

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
As we're broadcasting live here at the Voice Geeks Network

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
We are going to kind of pause our show at 6.30

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
So that we can all watch Bethesda's E3 press conference together

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Because there will likely be some big news that comes out of that

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
We know we're going to get a better look at Fallout 76

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Even more so than we saw at Microsoft's event today

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
So we're going to watch that together

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
For those of you that are listening live

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
We have decided this year to do it a little differently than we have in the years past

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
And as long as the bandwidth cooperates

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
That's a big footnote because here in the studio the bandwidth is sometimes crappy

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
We will provide you live commentary tonight

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
So if you want to keep OLR on while Bethesda's thing is going

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
We will do live commentary as Bethesda's event is going

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Because you guys have asked for it, the live folks in previous years

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
And if you don't want to listen to that, that's fine

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I will not be offended if you turn it off

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
And come back to us when it's all over

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
And we'll continue on with news and our regular segments

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
As we come back into the show

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I don't know how long Bethesda is tonight

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I don't know if they're 60 minutes or 90 minutes

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So I would think they're only 60

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Because I wouldn't think they have 90 minutes worth of stuff to announce

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
But if they were to surprise the hell out of us with Elder Scrolls 6

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Which I don't think they will at this point

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
What continents do they have left?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
The undiscovered one that we never knew about until now

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
That's the clever video game trope

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
But anyway, I'm not expecting that though

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I assume that Fallout 76 is their big title

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Maybe they would tease a little bit Elder Scrolls for next year

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
But I just don't see that happening

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
But anyway, let's talk about until then

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Let's talk about what we've seen so far

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
So yesterday EA did their bit

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And Loki, you watched the whole thing, right?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, I watched everything

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
What were your thoughts on EA?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I think it was kind of let down

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
But I mean, it's typical EA

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
They didn't really announce too much

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Even with Battlefield 5, they did this whole preview thing like a week before

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
But they didn't really show too much

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
They kind of talked a little bit about multiplayer

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
There's going to be, of course, some changes

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
They reiterated that there's no loot boxes or season passes

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
However, I overheard someone talking about

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
The pre-order stuff that they had for Battlefield 5

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And then it mentioned airdrops

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Which were possibly something alluding to

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
They're going to have a couple of Macs hooked up to airdrop

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, so a couple

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Basically alluding to that there might be some sort of content or something that comes in

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
But I don't know

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
So we'll see when it comes out if they actually stick to the no loot box thing

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
But that's what they said

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
They announced that they're going to be doing Battle Royale as well for it

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Because everybody's got to jump on that bandwagon

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
And then talking about customization

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Their destruction systems getting even better

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
And they had some other stuff like Grand Operations and whatnot

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Then along with that

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Of course, they talked about FIFA 19

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
So they have this new

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
They have a trial for 18 available now

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And then some new Champions League mode

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
They talked about their EA Cloud streaming service

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Which they didn't really say what that was yet

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
But something that's going to be coming

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
And that includes this Origin Access Premier

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Where you'll be able to access games as they come out

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Through Origin

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It's $15 a month or $100 a year

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
How's this different from the EA thing they already have on Xbox?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Or is it kind of like the same thing?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
No, EA is

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
The EA Pass

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
EA Play

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I don't even know what the fuck they call it

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I think this is on PC

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
So there's like a new one for PC

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
And the one on PC will be new stuff

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Whereas the EA catalog on Xbox One

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I think it's both new

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
New and old stuff

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Okay

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I'm confused

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
There's a lot of stuff they're trying to sell me

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Of course, it's EA

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Well that's business, whatever

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And then Respawn has a new game coming out

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
A new Star Wars game

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
That's going to take place between episodes 3 and 4

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
This was a holiday 2019

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Called Jedi Fallen Order

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
And then of course they showed off

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Some more updates for Battlefield 2

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
It's going to have a new season

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Which is going to be

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
So that took place in the prequel stuff

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So they have new heroes and villains

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
So General Grievous, Obi-Wan

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And a new Starfighter mode

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
There's also going to be stuff coming out for the solo movie

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
So content from that

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
They announced Unravel 2 which is out today

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
And so a sequel to their other indie game Unravel

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
That was kind of part of that EA original thing

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Yeah, that was a pleasant little surprise

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Especially the fact that it's out today

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
NBA Live 19 and Madden 19

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
They showed some trailers for that

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Then they had this thing for Command & Conquer Rivals

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Which is a new mobile strategy game

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Which looked terrible and they spent way too much time on it

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
You were a big Command & Conquer fan though

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I was

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
This looks like Clash of Clans or something

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
So no thanks

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Ouch, okay

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
So then they got to Anthem

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So Anthem, they had a new trailer

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
They talked about it once again

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
No loot boxes or anything like that

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
They will have cosmetic items but it'll be like

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You know what you're getting when you're purchasing them

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You can play the game solo

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
They're going to have a demo for it

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Also different clips

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
They are showing some of the gameplay and stuff

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
There's four different classes you can play as

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Different, what they call

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I don't remember what they're calling their

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Javelins, their suits, yeah

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I still am an extremely bitter Betty

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And probably unrationally so, I will own that

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
When it comes to Anthem, due to

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
How much of a middle finger

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I feel like EA has been giving us

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
When it comes to Mass Effect

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
But there's two things

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
That gave me a little bit of positivity

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
One, Casey Hudson

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Went on record and said Mass Effect's

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Not done, I don't even know if you saw that

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But Casey Hudson did

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I did and then I rolled my eyes really hard

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
At least they're not done

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
They're not going to abandon Mass Effect

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We're going to have more books

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I got the sense they meant games

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
What I want is that Quarian DLC

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah, I don't blame you

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
But if they decide, you know what, we're going to go

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Somewhere completely different next

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Or we're going to do, I don't know what's left to do

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Maybe they would have to do a prequel to The Shepherd's

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Story or something, I don't know where they would go next

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
But maybe they'll

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Do a really fucking ballsy thing

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And do Mass Effect 4

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
They had N7 skins by the way

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
For the Javelins, I did notice that when they were doing

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Their little thing

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Keep it, but anyway

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I will say this though, at least with as much

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Very angry gamer face when it comes to

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Anthem right now, because of the hurt I feel

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
In my heart

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I was very encouraged by the fact

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
That they went out of their way to say

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
You can do this completely solo

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So that tells me there is something to Anthem

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Besides just wanting to copy

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Destiny completely

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
If you can play this completely solo

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm a little more like

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Alright

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
So show me some more video, let's see

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't know yet though

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I'll go back and watch that whole thing later

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
But just right now, right now I'm still

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Feeling hurt

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Some folks in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
SHJ100Matt says Anthem looks really neat

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Dungeon Buster says they're trying to

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
In quotes, figure out Mass Effect

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
You know, aren't we all

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And then there was also

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Another indie game that they were showing off

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Which I can't remember the name of it

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Right now, but it was basically this big

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Flooded world type thing

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
That looked kind of cool

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
So, that was

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
That, but yeah

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
With the Command and Conquer rivals though

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I can't trust them at all, because I mean look at Dungeon Keeper

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
That they released, it was just terrible

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
They like ruined that franchise

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
By just destroying it with all the crap that you would get

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
With

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Just, you know, your typical mobile game

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I don't know, not a fan

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Of that

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
So that was pretty much EA right there

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Alright, so let's talk about Microsoft

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Which I did watch, I did watch Microsoft

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Yeah, Microsoft, they had tons of games

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
To announce, so lots of stuff they showed off

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So a brief tease for a game called

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Halo Infinite, not sure what that's

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Gonna be, but it is in the Halo universe

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Looked like an MMO maybe

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
It looked really pretty, like when they were showing all the

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Really diverse landscapes and stuff

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Especially because I was doing the whole

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Watching on Mixer in 4K

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And I was really impressed with how

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Good it looked, so there is that

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
They had a new

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Sequel for Ori

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And the Will of the Wisps, that looked pretty nice

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
That was pretty gorgeous

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
A new game from software

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Or from

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
From software

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Sekiro Shadows Die Twice

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Which is almost like a samurai

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Ninja Dark Souls

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Which is what people are kind of assuming from what we saw

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
But that looked pretty sweet

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
But here's the thing, I just have to

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Get this out, like although Microsoft

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Showed a lot of great games

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Like how many of them are Microsoft

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Xbox exclusive

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Or even Microsoft Xbox

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Windows exclusive

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
A lot of the stuff they showed

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Is coming to multiple things

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
You know what I mean, and that's the one area

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Where I do think Microsoft

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Still, don't get me wrong

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm not trying to derail what was

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
A fun, especially

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
As the opening act, I think a

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Fun tone of games, games, games

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
To show us at E3

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Even if a lot of them were for 2019

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
We found out

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Last night I think the Kingdom Hearts

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Was going to get bumped a little bit

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
We just found out that Crackdown 3

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Now it's going to get bumped a little bit

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
So don't get me wrong, they had this great games, games, games tone

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
But how much of that was really like

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
But you need to go get an Xbox One today

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Because you are missing the fuck out

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
If you don't do it

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
That was the impression I was getting

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
But don't get me wrong

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I enjoyed it just as a

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Games keynote

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Sorry, I don't mean to jump ahead

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
But there were some things where I was like

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Okay, this is why I own an Xbox One

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Because I want to be able to play this

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
This is why I have a beefy PC

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
So I can play this

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I just had to get that off my chest

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
They showed off Fallout 76

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Which is kind of surprising

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Being that we are about to see Bethesda

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Which looked interesting

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
It is a typical Fallout game

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Four times the size of the map from Fallout 4

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And it looked pretty

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So there doesn't seem to be any

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Oh, it's an MMO

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Or all these things people were anticipating

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It could be co-op

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
They had a new game

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That's in

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
A new game called

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
The Awesome Adventures of Captain's Spirit

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Which is in, I forget, the universe of

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Life is Strange

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Square Enix's

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
That's coming out free on the 26th

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Well, I imagine it's like Life is Strange

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Where the first episode is free

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
That's cool

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
They showed Crackdown 3

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
February is when that's coming out

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
How did you like that though?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
It looks nice

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I'm excited for it

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I just wish it was coming out this year

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah, but they gotta take the time to get it right

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
How much time do they fucking need?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
It's been like four years now

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
4K is probably a bigger pain in the ass

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
than people think

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I love the Tron look of it

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
For the record

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
As God's Edition

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
February 26th

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It's kind of remastered and everything

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Metro Exodus

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Everybody in chat is trying to correct me

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
On the whole free thing where they say

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
100% free

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
But doesn't that still leave the door open?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Sure, the first episode that they just showed us

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
That is this

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Is 100% free

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
But then they're gonna sell more episodes

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Don't you make video games to make money?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
There's gotta be a catch here

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
If it is 100% free

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
If it's a one-off side story thing

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
That's maybe trying to push back copies of Life is Strange

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Then great

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I still took 100% free

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
To mean

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's like a little teaser for something else

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
JD says

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It's a promo for Life is Strange 2

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Okay

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Then fine

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
It's 100% free

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Sorry Loki

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I gotta pay attention to chat

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
They showed off a new trailer for Metro Exodus

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Which looked pretty cool

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Kingdom Hearts 3 had a new trailer

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Metro is coming out February 22

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Kingdom Hearts January 29th

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
They showed off

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I don't know if they mentioned it before

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
The Frozen world

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
They have Frozen and stuff

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
As much as I'm over Frozen

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Again

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Getting to watch that in 4K

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
You can just see how fucking good it looks

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
With all the particle effects

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And the additional neon

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
They throw in it

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
The summons and the way that Wreck-It Ralph

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Looks like a digitized arcade

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It looks

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Really good

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
The graphics have come so far

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
From Kingdom Hearts 2

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
They showed off

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
There's two expansions coming for Sea of Thieves

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Cursed

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Cursed Sails

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I don't remember the other one

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
They have those coming out

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
They showed off another trailer for Battlefield 5

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Which is the one that EA was telling you

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Tune in for this peek at the

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Blah blah blah

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It was so brief

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I thought they were going to do a deeper dive into it

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
But they didn't

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
What they did do a pretty deep dive into

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Was Forza Horizon 4

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Which is going to be coming out in October

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
What's awesome about that is

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
In Britain this time

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
They have the different seasons

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't know if that's going to sync with the actual seasons

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
What part of the world is it going to sync to

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I don't know but it looked cool

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I'm down for that

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
We Happy Few is going to be finished

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
August 10th

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
They of course announced that they had bought a bunch of companies

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
This was the biggest news

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
The whole night in my opinion

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
They acquired four and built one

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Right?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
That's huge

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
The fact that they have Ninja Theory

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I kind of think this is something they should have done

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Two or three years ago

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
They identified that their exclusives

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Were not really holding up

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Next to Sony's as well

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
But I guess better late than never

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
The problem is you're not really going to see the effects of this

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
For another couple years I don't think

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And these new games that these companies are making

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
But no disrespect

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I still think Xbox is in a much better place

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Under Phil Spencer than it was previously

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
So again, no hate

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It would have been really exciting

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
To see this a couple years ago

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
And then of course

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
We showed off another trailer for PUBG

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Then there was a bunch of different announcements

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Tales of Vesperia

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Definitive Edition coming out this winter

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Also on the Switch

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Tom Clancy's The Division 2

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Why Ubisoft?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Why did you have to do the fake

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Co-op chatter?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
That fake Co-op chatter is like

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
The one time a year

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Where I feel like I can actually hear

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
People playing a game together online

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
And treating each other with respect

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
It's like a nice change of pace

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Where I'm like, wait a minute

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Two women are playing this demo with two guys

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And they're not being asked about their boobs

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
They're being treated respectfully

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
The guys aren't calling each other

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Fancy ass guys

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
You know what I mean?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Everybody is being very respectful

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
And I'm like, I almost prefer

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Fake dialogue planet

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
How do I get an account on Xbox fake?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Alright, well whatever

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
They had a new trailer for Shadow of the Tomb Raider

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
They have a session

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Which is basically

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Standing in for Skate 4

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Because there is no Skate 4

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
And the new Tomb Raider

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Lara Croft's No Good

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Very Bad Day in Latin America

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
And then we have

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
A new MMORPG called

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Black Desert

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Which is supposed to be out this fall

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Black Desert Online is already on PC

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Is that not the same thing?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
And they showed it last year too by the way

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Don't be wrong

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
It looked really good

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I remember last year going, wow this game looks really good

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And somebody tweeted me

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Black Desert Online is already on PC and it's not good

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
And I was like, oh well alright

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Womp womp

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Then they had of course Devil May Cry 5

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Which they showed off

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Cuphead in the delicious last course

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Which is DLC for Cuphead

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
That sounds like fun

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And they have a new playable character

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
And crying

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Cuphead of course

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
But work Miss Chalice

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
There's a new character

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Miss Chalice

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
It's like Mugman with a bow in her hair

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
No I'm just kidding

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Totally fleshed out character

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
They had a game called Tunic

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Which looks like Zelda

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
That was my favorite thing

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Second favorite thing

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
The Legend of Little Cute Fox

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Jump Force

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Which is Shonen Jump

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
It looked like a fighting game

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Anime is real

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Dying Light 2

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Battletoads

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Actually new Battletoads

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
But they didn't show anything

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
They didn't show anything but say it's happening

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
And it had a sense of humor

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Don't get me wrong

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It's nice to have that confirmation of the thing we've been saying should be happening for years

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Just Cause 4

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Which is awesome

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
That's coming out this year as well

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And then this is where they started teasing all the Gears of War stuff

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
So they first said

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Oh yeah we got new Gears of War

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Gears of War Pop figure

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Mobile game

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
There was like awww

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
And they're like just kidding

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
We actually have a real Gears game coming out

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Gears Tactics

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
And then they're like oh just kidding

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Gears 5

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
So there's a new Gears game coming

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
The three of them

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And they're going in a completely different direction with Gears with this

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
They switch the protagonist to

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
My Gears characters as well

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
But the way it's set up you're not playing as Phoenix

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
You're playing as the female

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
In their group

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Who I don't know her name so I apologize

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
But then it looks like her and one of the other guys

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
That was kind of like the side character

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
In the earlier games

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
This is their game

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
So they go off together

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I'm all for strong female leads

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
So let's make those

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
People that don't get it cry

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And that was supposed to be

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
The end of the show and then the one more thing

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
They showed off a trailer for Cyberpunk

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
2077 it looked fucking awesome

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
That looked hot

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Yeah that looked really hot

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
If you don't know that's being done by CD Projekt Red

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Who did The Witcher 3

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And obviously The Witcher before that

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Witcher 3 is an extremely cinematic game

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
So now it's like okay instead of like the medieval

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Setting that The Witcher games were in

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Now it's going to be like a cyberpunk setting

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
It has a really great look to it

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And then of course they were talking about Games Pass as well

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
You still get all these

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
First party games out day in

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Date with Crackdown 3

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And Forza

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Horizon 4 are going to be coming out

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Their Netflix type of thing

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Which by the way since you went through it so fast

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I did not get a chance to fanboy about Forza Horizon 4

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
But it looks so good

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
It looks so good

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh my god it was like one of those things

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I had my tweet deck up on one screen

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
While I'm watching the press event

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
On the other screen and as I'm watching the tweet

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
That go by there's all these people that are like

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Yawn car game

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Yawn potty break I gotta go poop

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
It's a Forza game and I'm like

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
If I knew where you lived

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I would be banging pots and pans over your head

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
While you sleep until you play Forza

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Forza Horizon

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Specifically because look look I get it I get it

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I'm not super into the Gran Turismo games

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Or even the mainline Forza series

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
The car sim games don't do it for me

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
But Horizon is like

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Mario Kart

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Without the items

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And it's like in a real setting

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
With awesome like

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Euro rave

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Techno stuff

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
And it's fucking great

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
They have seasons now so like they're showing off this one lake

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
And they're all well in the winter it'll be frozen

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
You can drive over the lake and yes

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Yes so I'm down and down

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Locopogo says I don't even like Forza games

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Forza Horizons look great

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
That is the correct attitude to have on my Twitter

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Thank you very much

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Everybody's backing up a little bit there

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
And well we're almost at conference time

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
But I just want to mention one last thing

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Because they did talk about a bunch of games

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
PlayStation T is a bunch of stuff

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
But of course we have to talk about Tetris Effect

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Oh my god like

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
E3 is done

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Tetris Effect I am so here for it

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Yay

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
It's like Tetris getting the luminous effect

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Mizuguchi Tetris

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And again the people replying to that on Twitter

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
They're like it's just Tetris

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I'm like I will cyberbully you

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Like I am all for

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I am all for treating people with respect

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And dignity online

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
But if you come after Tetris Effect

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I will cyberbully you

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I will alright

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Alright let's do this

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Alright so we're gonna have to switch over to Bethesda

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
So for the podcast listeners we're gonna get a little break

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
For those of you that are listening live

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
We're gonna do a quick

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
The Bethesda press conference

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
So for the live folks

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
You guys

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Actually yeah sorry we have a

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
The joy of live radio is that we have our

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Live thing playing okay I just need to

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Like turn off the system over here

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
So we get no more input from

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
YouTube on auto forwarding us to other streams

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Anyway so

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Some of you were listening along some of you weren't

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I saw mostly encouraging words there in

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Chat on the commentary but not everybody

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Is in the commentary so some of you didn't listen

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
To it and that's fine so let's talk a little

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
About especially for the sake of the podcast folks

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
What we just saw although

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Before we get into that let me quickly

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
What you may not have heard if

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
You're listening on the podcast feed

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
During that time that Bethesda's thing was going on

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Jamie had to bow out

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So she is no longer here

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
In the studio but who is

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Joining us in the studio is an old friend

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Of the show an old friend

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Hey hi nice to have you here

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
I'm doing uh oh

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You didn't ask how I was doing

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
When Sky's on a show happening

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Oh

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
That little thing

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
How are you doing? I'm doing fine

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
How are you? Good good

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
So alright fun time of the year

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
It is it's like the gamers

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Gamers Christmas in some ways right

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
It's when we get to see what's coming out not for holiday

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Anymore but for next year

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I know yeah mostly next year

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Yeah alright

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Let's run down kind of some of the things we just saw

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
So overall what did you guys think of the Bethesda

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
It was really padded out

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Yeah I don't know

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
If it needed to be 90 minutes

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
But you know there was still some

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Good stuff it was interesting and this is

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
What I wanted to ask on the commentary feed

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
That I said I'll wait and ask this on the main show

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
So we were kind of talking at the end there

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
So obviously Fallout 76 was one of the last things

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
They showed and so we got the confirmation

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
That it's going to be like an online

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Type of game that's the direction it's going

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
So it's going to be a little more multiplayer

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Which looks really cool you know

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I never have gotten super into the Fallout games

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
But I imagine like if you are a fan of

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Fallout like this is probably like the type of thing you've been waiting

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
A very long time for so I know there's probably

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Going to be a lot of happy people about that

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And then I was kind of thinking okay well that's

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Where they're going to end it right

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Well they didn't end it with that they had this Elder Scrolls

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Blades that they showed off which you

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Were saying was originally a PSP thing

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I thought it was a PSP thing I remember they were doing

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
A PSP game or they were trying

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
To do a PSP game but you know

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
You just can't run the Elder Scrolls

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
On a PSP right so

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
It just didn't turn out

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
That it would be anything but so then

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
They kind of had that going and said okay this is going

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
To be on mobile

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
It's going to be on Switch

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Consoles it's going to be on virtual reality

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Like if it fucking has a screen

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
We're putting it on there almost

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
An illusion to that little funny bit they did

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Where they did Skyrim on the Alexa

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
That was hilarious yeah that was really funny

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Does it have a mode to clean that shit up?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
That was my favorite line of holding

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
So but then after that they said

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
You know we want to tease you

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
About stuff out in the future too

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Because I think they probably have a sense

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
That we're all sitting here going

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Elder Scrolls 6 Elder Scrolls 6

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Elder Scrolls 6 so sure enough

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
They give us first a game called

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Starfield which is

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
It was nothing except

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
It's a space game it's a new IP that's all we know

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And then there it was

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
The Elder Scrolls 6 but

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
All we really saw was like

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
A landscape

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Elder Scrolls 6 is coming after Starfield

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Some music

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Well not necessarily because Starfield

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Could be mid next year

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Maybe not you're right

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Or 2021

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
So anyway what did you guys think

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Of that concept of

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Leaving us at the very

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
End with a really big

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Tease and you know honestly

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Microsoft kind of did this too

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
When they said we're working on

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
The next Xbox I mean

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Xboxes

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Oh yeah okay they said they're working on the next

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Xboxes plural

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Little bit of a tease in itself too I mean

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
We all know these hardware

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Things are planned years out

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
So of course Sony is working on

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
PlayStation 5 I see where you're going with that

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
So what do you think though about these

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Extended teases

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I mean we're making all these jokes about how we're

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Seeing games in 2019 but now

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
These like final notes that we're getting left on

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
On these press conferences are

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Here's the long play

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Oh I think it's designed for people

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
For the consumers

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
To keep that in mind

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
It's like designed for us to be like

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Oh I have a lot more to look forward to

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
So I just I need to keep

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Subscribing to their newsletter

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Or just like hey you know we've heard you

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Working on it you know you can stop asking us

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Now it is in development it's just true

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
It's a long ways out you know type of thing

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
But I mean did they have

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
To confirm that they're working on an Elder Scrolls

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Game we all of course they're fucking doing

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Elder Scrolls 6 I think they did

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
No I think they still needed to

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
They needed to like try to meet expectations

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Okay for what it's worth

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I'll give them this It's just like Metroid Prime

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
4 last year all we saw was

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Like yeah we're working on it I'll give them this

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
At least it was like Elder Scrolls 6

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
And not Elder Scrolls

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Forever

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
You know or something

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
But I think it's different

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Than the Metroid Prime 4

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I feel like Metroid Prime 4

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Is happening this year I feel like it's not

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Quite the extended tease

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
But I think the way it's different

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Is that I mean I don't know I can't speak

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
For the Elder Scrolls fandom

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
But with the Metroid fandom

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
We were all like

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Anxious because we thought Nintendo

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Had given up on Metroid

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Honestly we didn't think we didn't

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Know for sure if it was in the cards right

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
So that was like a big surprise

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
But did you did the Elder Scrolls

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Community like did they ever

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Doubt that another Elder Scrolls

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Game was ever gonna come out I thought for sure

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
That they would do something like an

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Elder Scrolls 4 remastered

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Or something like that you know just like

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Yeah I thought there'd be like an Oblivion remaster

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Like a remaster just you know bring it into the new engine

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
There still could be

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
It's not something they need to announce months and months out

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
You know

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Anything else you guys want to highlight from that conference

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
That we saw for those of you listening on the podcast feed

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
We will offer that comment some people

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Cause we kind of got a little bit off topic

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
In some places so if you have an hour

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
There was much much

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Objectification of the developers

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
By the males

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Not including myself

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Why would you do that? Rob

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Anyway you robbed me

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
If you want to hear that

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
That will be posted on our social media channels

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
This is an exclusive over at Twitter

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
It'll also be on our Facebook

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Facebook.com slash orange launch radio

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And it'll be posted first

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
In our Discord over at vognetwork.com

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Slash Discord so check it out

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I think that the very first part

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Of the whole conference

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Should have just like they should have not

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Done it I mean I get it for entertainment

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Value yay we have a big rock band

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
But you know what nobody in the audience

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Was excited

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
They showed the audience and they're all like

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Really old white nerds

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I just realized you are way louder than

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Jamie is

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Sorry for the volume issues

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Old white nerds sitting in

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
There going like looking

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Like they don't belong

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Well no they're probably just like dude I came here to see video games

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Not watching Andrew WK not that

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
We hate Andrew WK but it's like dude

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Come on

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Let's get the show on the road here

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
To watch a concert or watch a

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
You know a band play

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I thought it wasn't like

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
I thought the Rage 2

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Thing went on a little long

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Yes

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
It looks okay

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
It's by Avalanche they did you know

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
They've done the Just Cause games

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Avalanche actually

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I'm sorry my studio is confused here

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
I think they did

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I think Avalanche was Just Cause

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
And Mad Max

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
That or it might have been

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
What was the other one that was EA

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
I don't remember no that was Pandemic

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Never mind

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
So yeah they did Mad Max and stuff

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
So it looks very much like Mad Max or like a

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Borderlands type game just you know not with the

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Stylized graphics

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Just a couple other quick things I want to hit and then I'll open it up

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
If you guys have anything you want to add but

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Doom Infinite so we have

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Eternal

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
It's a stupid name

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Insert forever

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Synonym here

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
It's the new Rage in gaming

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Doom Eternal

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
They said that's a thing

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
But they didn't really show us

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Stay tuned for QuakeCon for more

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Which was lame

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
A little bit of a disappointment

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I guess it wasn't much more than they showed at the end

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
They had to make room for

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Andrew WK

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
We knew that Doom would get a sequel

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
So that's not too surprising

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
And it's probably still a ways out

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah that's kind of like a little spin off

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And then that Elder Scrolls

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
card game is coming to Switch

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Except they didn't really say that

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
You just see it in the trailer

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
They were very clearly playing it on a Nintendo Switch

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
So it does seem like

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Bethesda is showing the Switch a lot of love

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
If you're a Nintendo fan you probably love them

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Bethesda right now because they also just put Fallout

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Shelter out right now on the

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Switch so I bet there's some people probably

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
downloading it

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Fallout Shelter they said was now right?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Am I crazy? Didn't they say they were putting that out right now?

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I don't remember. I'm glad they did

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
So anyway

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Alright

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And they're saying in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
S2100Matt says

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Apparently Andrew WK did another concert

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
after the show

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Kaijuto in chat says E3 should be fun

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Not just trailers and predictable crowd reactions

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I know but like with other like

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
They've done that before with I don't know if it was

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Microsoft or Sony they'll do like a musical number

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Like either at the end I think

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Do it for the crowd

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Warm them up and everything

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
But like you know if you tell me to tune in at 6.30

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
to see game trailers I want to see game trailers

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Or like if you're doing that concert

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
where he's playing live you know playing the song live

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Do it to like gameplay

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
video or something like that

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Mix it in

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Things like that assume

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
that all of us that like games

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
like Rage also like that kind of music

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And I don't like that kind of music

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
But yet I do like

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
games like Rage

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
So for me it's not entertaining

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I don't care what people say

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
That's not entertaining

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
That's just padding the show and saying

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Hey we got this famous person

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Love us because we're cool

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and hip but we got this stupid

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
heavy metal band

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Hey we got this famous person

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
It's fine whatever

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I would say overall though

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I do feel very positive on Bethesda

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I do like that they were

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
willing to tease past the next year

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
You know and I kinda

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
You know and I've talked about this on a previous

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
OLR like the movie industry

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Fuck we know Marvel's plan for like the next four

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
years right so why doesn't the

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
gaming industry like are they afraid

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
that somebody's gonna steal the idea or something like

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I don't know yes I would actually see yes

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
because look at like look at all these

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
battle royale games coming up I guess that's true

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
But okay for all we know Elder Scrolls 6

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
is battle royale

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
We don't need to necessarily know that tonight

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Elder Scrolls 6 should be multiplayer that'd be pretty awesome

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I don't wanna even tease

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
the potential but it could be

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
but it could be alright anyway

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Moving on

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
So anything else you guys wanna say on

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Bethesda?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
No I don't have anything

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
It was alright it just seemed like a bit slower paced this year

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and they really dragged it out I don't think it needed to be 90 minutes

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
long and I just felt last year

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
they announced it was like more kind of exciting announcements

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
They had some that were pretty cool

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
but most of it was just kinda like

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I'm bored

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Honestly last year because they did the whole

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Bethesda land thing and that was all

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
really it was you know

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I felt like it was more concise

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
you know what I mean it felt like everything was just like

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
in this neat little package

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
so we didn't have time

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
to like pan or have those awkward

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
moments cause it was all like you know pre-done

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Yeah

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Okay so I am gonna do our gaming weeks

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
real quick here I will ask Loki

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
can you be prepared to run through some headlines here in a moment

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
just as soon as we are done

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
so we can touch on some other things that have been happening

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
during E3 we'll talk about our gaming weeks

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
a quick housekeeping thing though since Jamie

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
did have to leave earlier than expected cause we

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
thought that thing would only be an hour

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
and it ended up being 90 minutes there's actually

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
not gonna be a classic game this week so it's

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
kind of a rarity in OLR history

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
so we're gonna roll she actually I guess

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I gotta say this she was going to do a peripheral

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
tonight so we will roll that over

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
till next week which is our big

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
and it's a good knowing

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
what it already is it is a good one

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
for the 16th anniversary of the show that's all

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I'll say it's a good choice for

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
our anniversary which is coming up next week

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
so we will

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
though talk about our gaming weeks so

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Exeter I'll actually start with you if you want to talk about any

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
video games you've been playing what are games

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
you're enjoying lately

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
like Greece I know you've been very busy

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
preparing for your move but surely you've snuck

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
a game in here and there

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
so you know I'm addicted

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
to Binding of Isaac so really that's my

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
that's my go to game to like

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
just pick up and play you know

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
and not worry about anything like

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
you know worrying about paying attention to

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
story or anything like that just to pick up

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
and play a game so I can spend

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
hours in it

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
and so that's that's

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
that's pretty much what I've been playing

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
oh

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I did play a little bit of

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Overwatch on my Xbox

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
you know I was

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I was actually testing

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I was doing it to test out the

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Wi-Fi on the Xbox because we were

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
we were putting as

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
everybody heard on the live

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
on the Bethesda stream or whatever

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I am moving to North Carolina

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
so we've had to unhook

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
everything and so because I unhooked

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
the ethernet cable I was like I wonder

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
what the Wi-Fi is like so I tested Overwatch

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
and I ended up playing like three hours

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
of Overwatch and I'm like oh my

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
god like you just can easily get sucked

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
back into that game right yeah

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
but but yeah

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I have a lot of games that

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm meaning to go back to

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
but I just

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
haven't for whatever reason

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
like I started a way out

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I've been playing it with Flaco Jones

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
and we

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
we had a really good time playing that so

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
but that's dependent on his schedule

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
you know being available right so

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
so we're not gonna play I'm not gonna

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
finish it until I know that he's

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
available to finish it so anyway

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
alright

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I'll talk about Mike

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
are we allowed to talk about where your man

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
works or do we want to keep that off here?

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
oh I think we've already said he works for Ubisoft

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
but he wouldn't

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
talk obviously

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I don't know

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
even you don't know what he's working on?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
well it was announced today

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Division 2

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
so you knew

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
so I know what he's going to be working on

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I don't know the details or anything

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
but yeah he got transferred

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
he was so

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
he

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
worked for San Francisco

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Studio, Ubisoft

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
you can see him in Rocksmith

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
promo videos if I remember right wasn't he

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
in the Rocksmith promo?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
he worked a lot

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
on Rocksmith and then he worked

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
very heavily on South Park

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
the Fractured But Whole

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and he I giggle every time

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I know I know I giggle

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and then he

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
decided that

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Bay Area expensive

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
hard to raise a family

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
we eventually want to have kids

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
so he thought

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
it might be a better idea to

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
just try and get a transfer to the

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Ubisoft studio in

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
North Carolina and

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
basically their name is Red Storm

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Entertainment and they work on a lot of the

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Tom Clancy

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
so Division is

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
the game that they work on

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
in tandem with

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Massive Entertainment

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Massive is the main studio

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
and they're the ones in Sweden

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Malmo, Sweden

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
alright awesome awesome

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
so cool

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
if he ever wants to come

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
via Skype and promote whenever the game's out

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
cool cool there's some fans of

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Division in chat so we'll see

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
alright anyway

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
so let's talk about other gaming weeks

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
yeah I didn't play a whole ton of stuff

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I played more Mario Odyssey

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
just still trying to get the rest of the Power Moons

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
so I've been going through all that stuff

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I played more Pokemon

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Quest

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I've evolved a few things on there now

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
you play that more than anyone I know

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
but it's such a grind though

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
it's alright

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
it's getting kind of boring so I'll play it while I'm doing

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
other things because

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
basically it's on autoplay so I just

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
set it up, hit a button

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
and come back in two minutes

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
and it's done

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
yeah you can autoplay it

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I don't know if you've played a game like

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Non-Stop Night or something like that

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
where basically the character auto

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
they autorun and you have the option

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
to where you can control their special moves

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
to when they do them or you can just say

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
just autoplay and I find

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
that when I do the autoplay stuff it ends up

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
passing more levels than I do if I'm trying to control it

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
so I'm like ah fuck it who cares

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
I just let it play itself

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
and then what else

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I downloaded a game called

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Totally Accurate Battlegrounds

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
it looks fucking hilarious

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
which by the same people

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
they did Totally Accurate

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Battle Simulator and also

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Cluster Trucks and some other stuff

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
definitely a game I want to check out

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
it was free for like 100 hours

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and now

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
you can get it for 5 bucks

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
but it's a battle royale game

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
much like PUBG or something like that

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
it's its own

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
unique spin on it

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
where it's just really bad

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
as far as the physics and everything are just shit

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
the characters look like shit

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
because they look like the

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Totally Accurate Battle Simulator

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
characters they have these big bug eyes

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
and everything is just really weird

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
you can do gangster style

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
where they'll beatbox and turn the guns sideways

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
they have guns that are

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
enormous that will launch you across the map

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
when you fire them

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
what's this game that's out right now

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
I'm wondering if it's the same game

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
where you turn into a chicken

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
when you get shot enough

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I saw it being streamed on Twitch

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
and they make this like

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
horrible

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
that could be the same game

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I don't know

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
that sounds like something they would do though

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
it was the number one game streaming on

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Twitch because that Ninja guy

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
was playing it

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
it could be that

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I don't know but

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
it's a silly game they've done

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
other stuff they did a game called Stick Fight

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
that's pretty awesome

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
they have some pretty fun games that have come out

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I think that

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
it sounds like it could be

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
I'm going to check real quick to see what was more popular

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
games no they don't even have it on there

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
but yeah it could be

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
something that he played

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I probably will check it out

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I watched some streamers play it

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
it looked hilarious

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
you know how in

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Fortnite if you drop out of this

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
flying bus thing

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
this one you're on the cluster trucks

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
and you get launched out

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
into whatever you aim at

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
it is a little creepy

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
because they've got these giant blocks

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
as the arena is closing in on you

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
they kind of ominously come down

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
and crash into the ground

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
so it's pretty cool

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
but it's really funny

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
and then Pokemon Go

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
because they started that whole water thing

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
so I've been getting my water Pokemon on

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
and yeah

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
it was a little bit angerous

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
that freaking water event is going on

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
and I still can't find more Lotads

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
that's like the one thing

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
that you can

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I don't want to say easily get but I feel like the one

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
non-regional, non-legendary

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
the one thing I have left

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
to get is

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
well wait I take that back because I still don't have Luna Stone

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I have Soul Rock but I don't have Luna Stone so I need one of those

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
and then I need that Lotad's final form

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I have the second form

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
but I don't have the final form

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Lone Bray is the second form I think

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I've been getting a lot of Mudkips

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
yeah no there's tons of that and then Sirskit was one of the other ones I needed

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
that I was missing but I got

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
that because there's Sirskits everywhere right now

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
so that was something I was able to do

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
okay

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
let's see talking about my gaming week

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
it's a bit simple I've also been playing Pokemon Go

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
obviously

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
got sucked back into Heroes of the Storm

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
that's one of those games that comes in waves

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
it's like my love of Blizzard stuff

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
it's like I play Overwatch for a couple weeks

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
and I play Diablo 3 for a couple weeks

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
now it's Heroes of the Storm I'm back on that bus

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
so I've been having fun with that

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
and yeah just checking out some of the character changes

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
and leveling up my own characters

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
there's an event going on right now that's kind of fun

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
it's like a luchador themed thing going on

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
so I was able to get the little pictures

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
like my new

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
little picture looks like a corgi in a luchador's

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
outfit it's amazing

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
so that was worth the event right there

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
otherwise

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
yes Bobby after last week's

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
show I played Just Shapes and Beats

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
with Bobby on stream and that game

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
was fun I had a good time playing

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Just Shapes and Beats great music

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
great soundtrack in that game

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
is the Mortal Kombat theme in there? not that we

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
found unless it's like an unlock later down

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
the line but I have a feeling that was

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
probably a license that cost him more money

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
so it's not in there now unless one of you

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
guys has unlocked it oh

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
apparently it is it is the last

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
unlock says the chat oh that's

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
awesome that they made it in there okay cool

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
so hopefully I'll

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
hopefully I'll get that far at some point

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
nice

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
so besides that

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I've been playing more Hyrule Warriors

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
on Switch cause I missed the

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
boat when it was on Wii U and 3DS so now I'm

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
finally playing it and that game is also a lot of fun

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
and then still some more Final Fantasy 14

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
finally I have not played

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
my buddy Shane online

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
in months and so we actually have been doing

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
for those of you that play Final Fantasy 14

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
we decided to do some of the Eureka

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
leveling which is like this separate

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
kind of zone that has like a separate leveling

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
for your character and there's a lot

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
of stuff in there that kind of reminds us of Final Fantasy

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
11 which if you know

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Shane and I's friendship we played Final Fantasy

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
11 online for

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
years Loki was a part of that too

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
so Eureka kind of has a lot of throwbacks to how

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
11 works so it's just like losing

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
XP when you die and all that stuff

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
so but it's

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
separate from the other like

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
that's the interesting thing that 14 does cause it did

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
this in Deep Dungeon too is that your XP

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
in there is separate from the regular game XP

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
so it's kind of neat that they have all these other side things

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
but that's all I'll say about my gaming

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
week so again follow us on

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
social media twitter.com slash OLR we're also

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
on Facebook facebook.com slash Orange Lounge

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Radio we will be here next

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
week for our 16th

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
anniversary show but we will not

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
be here in two weeks I will be off

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
that weekend I am going to be in Chicago

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
seeing some

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
of my friends out there celebrating

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
my 40th birthday if you can believe it

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
is at the end of the month so gonna be celebrating that

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
so anyhow let's get into some

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
headlines some of the other things we have yet to talk

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
about tonight so you're gonna

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
we don't have a show roll tonight we're

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
doing this a little more free form so Loki

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
do you have some stuff we can talk about some talking points?

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
we're talking about the big thing so

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
valve

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
here we go

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
so valve

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
you may remember

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
we talked a few weeks back how valve was

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
planning on banning

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
these visual novel games

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
because they were too risque for steam

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
so now basically

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
they've decided that they're

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
gonna take a hands off approach on it

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
saying that hey

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
we've decided the right approach is to

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
allow everything onto the steam store

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
except for things that we decide are illegal or

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
straight up trolling so

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
the pendulum swung the other direction

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
yes so swung the other direction

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
and so

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
what did we get from that? well we got

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
school shooter simulator

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
whatever that was active shooter simulator

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
which ended up getting pulled off

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
and then the newest game

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
of the week that people

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
you know want to talk about that was totally a trolling

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
game AIDS

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
simulator

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
and that also got taken off of steam

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
well I mean at least they took it off

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
eventually okay they took it off

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
but how many

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
how many sold

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
because some people will buy that shit

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
because they like to troll

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
and so they want to bump that shit up in the rankings

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
and like people I knew were seeing

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
that game as a recommended game

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
because you like this other stuff because other people were buying

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
it and steam was happy to take a

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
30% cut of that stuff like

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
they need to have less of a reactionary

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
thing and be proactive

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
steam valve should fucking

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
know better at this point seriously

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
what the fuck is happening at valve

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
it is 20 steam is

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
coming from your no 20

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
it no but here's my point yeah it is

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
2018 what the fuck is

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
valve doing right now yes I know the actual

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
answer is they're working on HTC Vive

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
and VR but like that

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
is kind of like in my opinion that's kind of like

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
its own little thing that's kind of like

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
separate from the company that bought us

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
portal 2 okay here's the thing

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
guys the valve that we all

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
know and love the cake is a lie

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
all that shit 2011

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
portal 2 came out in 2011

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
that was 7 fucking years ago

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
and look I get they're working

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
on this Vive stuff they're doing this other stuff or whatever

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
but like valve has been slipping

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
y'all valve has been slipping

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
hardcore and especially when it comes to steam

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
because you know what the last interesting

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
steam sale was probably also in

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
2011 so like

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
valve because they

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
have the strong dominant end of the market

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
right now feels like they can do

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
this shit and like look I get

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
that the bad games got pulled

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
that's fine my point is

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
this whole cockamamie attitude of

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
and it wasn't just the fact that they were like

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
oh we're gonna allow everything on steam it was the way

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
they delivered that message of well

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
there should be some offensive

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
things that should offend

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
you and if we're not if we don't have that

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
then we're not doing it right and I'm like

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
um

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I would not walk into a store

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
that sold that shit

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
so why am I gonna walk into yours

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
you cocky fuck

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
yeah they're trying to the thing is valve

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
needs an attitude adjustment right

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
the fuck now and it is up

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
to the people that sorry extra I'll

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
let you have a quick it is up to the people that have been

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
lifting them up for no

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
reason over the past

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
five years and I say no

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
reason because again okay sure maybe

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
you like dota 2 maybe you're into the

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
vibe stuff whatever you can lift them up on those

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
platforms as far as steam goes

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
steam has been fucking slipping

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
for several years now

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
the storefront is not as

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
good as it used to be the

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
sales are not like steam sales

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
are just kind of a meh now you know what I mean

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
like steve's been slipping over the few years

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
and after this fuckery

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I'm sorry but like gog

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
itch.io humble bundle

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
are all starting to look more attractive right now

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
so don't think you're fucking invincible

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
valve that's my

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
point sorry extra go ahead no I didn't mean

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
to talk over um I just wanted to say

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
that like when you when you

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
get as big as as

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
steam or you get as big

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
as valve

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
you can't just give up on responsibility

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I think that they're

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
they're trying to justify irresponsibility

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
that's all it is to me

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
you know and I don't see

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
people I saw

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
their announcement and I looked at the comments

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
and they were horrible they were like yay valve

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
free speech I you know

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
come on guys with the free speech stuff

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
this has nothing to do with free speech

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
it has everything to do with

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
being a good curator

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
of content for your customers

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
and this is not good curation

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
no one is preventing free speech by not putting

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
your game on the steam storefront it's the fucking

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
internet you can put it anywhere you want

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
thank you thank you thank you thank you

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
if you want to release aid simulator

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
in your stifling stinky little

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
black hole of the internet then that's

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
what the internet is for have

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
have fun actually I don't even want to tell you to have fun

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
just go fuck yourself honestly

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
but you have a little space to go do it in but like I don't understand

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
like the whole point like they made this big deal

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
like they're like okay we need to get rid of

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Greenlight cause it's not working

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
but I think it was doing more

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
like so this filter

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
that we had wasn't working let's just get

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
rid of the filter like how the fuck

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
is that any better like that doesn't make any

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
sense the filter is that oh

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
we're charging $100 to submit a game

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
but you get it back you know if it sells

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
they don't want to be responsible

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
they don't and they don't want to hire a bigger team

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
to be responsible either they're a small team

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
that is a big problem too

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
their customer service sucks

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
yeah stop letting so many games

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
on your platform then cause it's drowning

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
out all of us it is finally time for the

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
rest of us to hold them fucking accountable so that

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
is why I'm here on this show today to say

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
because I've been accused of this in the past

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
and it will no longer happen

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Valve does not get a free pass

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
anymore I don't fucking

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
care if they have these gigantic sales

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
or what have you you know what everybody's got a fucking

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
sale this is the internet GOGS has

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
sales Humble Bundle has sales

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Valve does not get a free pass

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
anymore because they are Valve

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
that is

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
that is why I'm setting forth today and that ties

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
to this comment in our chat over at

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
live.vognetwork.com

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
e3inator in chat says Rob Roberts really

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
if you get right down to it Valve doesn't

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
have to do jack shit why because

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
they're making money hand over fist and

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
laughing all the way to the bank they can wipe their

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
asses with one thousand dollar bills if they

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
so choose you know what

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
not on my watch Satan

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
we're done with that and you're right

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
it has to start with the rest of us saying

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
you know what there are

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
other places to buy some fucking games

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
nobody knows that better than you

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
raginator there are

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
other places to buy games and find deals

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
make Valve

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
fight for first place

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
the attitude that they could print money and

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
they don't have to care is

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
is pointless to me so

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
so that's the same thing as saying

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Martin Shkreli you know that guy

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
who raised the pharmacy

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
you know pharmaceutical drugs

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
is practically too rich to

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
care you know whatever but we all

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
like rose up and said no

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
you know what I mean and look where

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
he is now he's in prison

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I'm not saying

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Gabe should go to prison I'm just saying

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
no I am I'm saying they should go to prison

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
no I'm not I'm saying that

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
like somebody at his level

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
needs to come out and say

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
we fucked up exactly

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I need I need that to happen

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
they need to take

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
we fucked up PS

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
as an apology Half Life 3

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
3

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I'll take the first part at least

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
anyway

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Rama says in chat when Valve brings us

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Half Life 3 then I'll give a fuck

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Bob Coffee says it's time for GOG to shine

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Bobby Blackwolf wants to point

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
out he isn't in prison for the drug stuff he's in prison

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
for tax evasion yeah I know but you know

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
what Karma is a bitch

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
exactly yeah I don't care

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
what the actual circumstances

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
we got mad at him and he

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
got like in trouble and we're

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
all happy about it alright so anyway

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I guess I don't

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
need to keep going off but my point

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
is from now on

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Valve needs to earn that number one

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
spot as far as I'm concerned

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
because I will be looking for where the deals

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
on other games are I'm not gonna sit here and go

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
I'm gonna delete my fucking Steam account because you and I

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
both know that's not true I got too many games to do

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
exactly I got too many games locked in there

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
and like if I want to play Civ 6

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I'm going to have to do it on Steam but I

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
can sit here and go I'm gonna think

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
twice before I just drop money

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
on a PC game on Steam because it's

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
on Steam and because you know

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
of the fucking trading cards or whatever is keeping

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
me on Steam I'm gonna start saying

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
you know GOG

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
that's a thing Humble Bundle that's

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
a thing itch.io that's a pretty cool thing

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
and Battle.net

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
uh fuck it

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
do you know how serious

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
I am everybody I'm about to show you how

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
fucking serious I am

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I'll update my Origin account

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
oh yeah

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
oh no oh no bitch

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
nope I want

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
you all to pay fucking attention that's

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
how serious I am I'm gonna

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
update my Origin account

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
oh but you were gonna do that anyway when they brought

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
out their next Mass Effect

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
game right? in 2025

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I love thank you guys for

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
playing along and chat oh shit now let's

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
not go overboard no I'm fucking serious

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
next thing you'll be telling me that you want to reinstall Uplay

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
or something like that I forgot

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
about you know what and if Uplay

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
has got a deal I play

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I'm a proud member

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
of Uplay and I'm

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
biased you're biased alright

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
to be fair to give them props

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I do like the fact that you can earn like points

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
or achievement points or whatever to like

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
get free shit in other games

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
yeah I like that too I like that but that's the

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
only thing I like I fucking hate everything else about it

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I was about to be like oh I love that too

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
which ones do you play?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
my whole like thing

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
give us another headline cause I hate that I'm the angry

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
bitch tonight

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
this is your role Loki I'm sorry

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
he's hand picking the stories that'll piss me off

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
uh Pokemon Let's Go

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Pikachu and Eevee require an

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
online subscription of course

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
because it's Nintendo and they want to sell that subscription

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
oh it's Nintendo's new thing

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
that kind of actually does surprise me

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
isn't it like a single player game?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
yeah I was under the impression it was gonna be a single player thing

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
does it only require the online

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
thing for like trading

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
with maybe it needs it to access

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Pokemon Bank well wait a minute no it's not a mainline

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
game so you wouldn't it says it will have online

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
play functionality battling trading

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
with other players over the internet

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
but will the entire game require

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
is this gonna be another

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Nintendo thing?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
I think that's I think he just said it

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
like I think that's what you get there are

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
some things in Pokemon games you go online

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
for trading battling etc you want any

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
of that I'm thinking about I'm over

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
like paying for the subscription it's $20

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
a year I don't fucking care I spend

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I spend more than that show of hands is anyone

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
not buying the Nintendo thing I know

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
I'm totally buying the Nintendo thing

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Loki is buying the Nintendo

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
thing it's 20 fucking dollars

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I mean that's like a couple

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
of meals and we have

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
when Tuesday happens and they announce

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
everything that's coming with it I think we'll be all like

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
okay let me put it this way the only

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
reason why I'm still

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
um giving them shit about it is

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
because I don't wanna just like them go

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
oh well it's only $20 well

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
but that doesn't give me an excuse to not do anything

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
for that $20 other than

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
oh well now we're letting you play online

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
even though we just didn't let you to do that

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
earlier for free but

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I'm gonna give him a chance on this whole new

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
virtual console thing we'll see let's

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
let's I'm crossing my fingers it's

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
not gonna suck we'll see I have mod

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
chips if that's not the case

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
alright Tuesday's coming

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
there'll be a lot more coming on Tuesday

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Tyco Drum Master

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
sorry I'm just gonna say

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
the one thing I

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
hear consistently

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
from more casual

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
but I bet a lot of you fit in this category too

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
the one thing I hear consistently about Tuesday

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
is this

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I hope Nintendo announces a new

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
anyone wanna fill in the blank?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
the number one thing I hear from casuals

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
no from casuals

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
no

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Mario game?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I hope Nintendo announces a new

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
and it would be something that would completely

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
people would throw that $20 down

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
in a heartbeat

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Animal Crossing

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I want a new Animal Crossing

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
god dammit

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I hate Animal Crossing

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
do you or do you hate the love it?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I hate it

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I hate that every version of Animal Crossing that comes out

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
has less features than the one before it

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
and by less features I mean

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
none of them have virtual console games in them

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I do wanna give JD a cookie in our chat

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
room because he answered, I love that the chat

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
jumped in, JD said new

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
IP

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I will give you a cookie for that

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
the good news is I'm gonna give you a cookie

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
the bad news is it's oatmeal raisin

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I want excite bike to come back

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
that's what I would shell down money

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
excite truck

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
yes!

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
excite bots bullshit

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
no! you should never have to play mini

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
games in the middle of a fucking race

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
that is dumb, that is dumb shit

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
excite truck though

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
act deft is getting angry

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
over here because you started to say taiko drum master

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
and I cut you off, sorry, taiko drum master

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
the Nintendo switch version

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
is coming to Asia in English

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
on August 9th

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
so yes, you may not necessarily get it

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
in North America, although I thought they were gonna

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
release it over here as well

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
but they're gonna be doing an English patch for free

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
on August 9th

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
so remember, the switch is region free

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
so if you want it, you can import it

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
you know what games I like better

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
than taiko drum master?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
are the persona dancing games

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
there's a lot of those coming out

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
oh I know, well I mean persona dancing

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
all night, persona 4

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I platinumed that

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
why can't we have both extrovert?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
well I'm just saying I like it better

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I can have both

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
there's

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
a new unannounced Diablo game

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
coming thanks to a

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
development job listing

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
that's all we know

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
but there's hope

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
it's gonna be so erect at Blizzcon

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
if they announce Diablo 4

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
that's another one

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
where I assume that they have been

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
working on something

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
since the necromancer didn't

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
end up being an expansion

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
then I'm assuming Diablo 3 is done

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I mean, it could be

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
another Diablo expansion

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
it could be this switch thing

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
that maybe would be the

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
way to do this new Diablo 3

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
but there's a part of me that says

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
you know what, they're just gonna

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
whip out the number 4, why not?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Diablo 3 kinda had that cloud

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
over it ever since the beginning with the auction house

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and all that other stuff, even though it's a great

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
game now, like

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
because Diablo is a console and PC

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
thing for them, it doesn't

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
necessarily have that exact same sort of

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
foreverness that Overwatch does

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
although, I don't know, the rifts and stuff

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
are still interesting, I still play them

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
why not? Let's do Diablo 4

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
the only thing that's weird about Diablo 4

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
is that Blizzard

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
hasn't done a

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
sequel game in a very long time

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
like the last sequel game I can think of

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
when was Starcraft 2?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
because I think it was Diablo 3

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
so that's the only weird

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
thing about it, is that Blizzard

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
isn't exactly known for cranking out the sequels

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
and when they do announce it

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
it takes a very long time for them to get

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
that's true, they'll announce it now and then it's really

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
out in 3 years, so we'll see

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
oh shit, you know, I just realized

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
something, which makes

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
the Square Enix thing very exciting

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
tomorrow

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
they have that Marvel project, fuck yeah

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
fuck yeah

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
that's a good chance that we're gonna see that Marvel

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
project tomorrow, I can't wait

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
speaking of which, the rumor with that

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Marvel project is

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
a reboot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
which I am totally down for

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
oh, interesting

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Ultimate Alliance is fucking awesome

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
those games weren't like bad

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
or needing a reboot, but I guess then again

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
they do this all the time with games, they just kind of start over

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
maybe it could be just similar

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
like a similar type of gameplay or something

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I'm down, that's cool

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Hitman 2 is something that's

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
also gonna be probably shown off

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Sony confirmed that

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Sony confirmed Hitman 2 I think

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
yeah, so they've got that coming out and they've got

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
this collector's edition with a rubber duck

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
that's kinda cool

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
what else

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
we have the lineup for

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Sega and Atlas

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
so they're gonna be showing off

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Shining Resonance

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Refrain, that's coming out on

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Team Sonic Racing

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
which is also on PlayStation 4, Xbox One

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Switch and PC

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Valkyria Chronicles 4

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and the Switch

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
and Yakuza Kiwami

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
on PlayStation 4

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
and then one

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
thing that they'll be showing but that won't be playable there

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
is Total War Three Kingdoms on PC

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
and then

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I wanna say that there was another

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
like Catherine, Catherine Full

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Body was something else that was being announced

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
and then

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I feel like that Catherine thing they'd already announced though

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and then, and then

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
that was a PSX reveal or something wasn't it?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and then Atlas, they've got some more

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
stuff that they said they found including

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
you know there's, they found websites

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
for Persona 3 Dancing Moon Knight

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and Persona 5 Dancing Star Knight

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and of course those

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
have been confirmed

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and both

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
look amazing

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
so, neat

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
let's see what else we got

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
here, while you're looking I'm gonna go ahead and open

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
up the Skype line if anyone does wanna give us a call

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
if you wanna talk to us about an E3

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
that's already happened or that's

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
going to happen, maybe you

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
have some things you wanna talk about with

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Sony or Nintendo tomorrow, let me ask

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Xtifer, cause we don't get to hear from you

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
a lot here at OLR

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
but I know you're a big gamer, what

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
what do you hope for from Sony and

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Nintendo?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I'm looking forward most out of all

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
of E3

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
for the Death Stranding

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
stuff

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
gameplay finally?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I'd be satisfied with another

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
trailer, honestly

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I need to see the game

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I'd love to see the game

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
it'd be great, it'd be great

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
if there's another trailer that is also

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
very cryptic, I'll watch it for days

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
but be angry that we didn't get gameplay

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
at the same time

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
but when it comes to Nintendo

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
obviously I think it would be

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Metroid Prime 4

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
you're a big fan of Metroid Prime

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I love Metroid anything

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I'm hoping for Mario Maker

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I would like to see a Mario Maker port

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
too, I feel like I'm in the minority

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I just wonder how, I mean I

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
get how it would work

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
on the docked, but it'd be kinda more clunky

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
compared to

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
using it portable, right?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Yeah, but there's no reason you can't create portable

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
and then play docked

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
part of the fun of Mario Maker is playing

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
all the crazy fucking stages

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Mario Maker, like that, but here's the twist

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
it's two player because

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
the Switch has two

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
like maybe co-op or something

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
like that, what a twist

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
split screen, yeah because you know they're gonna

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
wanna use their two player gimmick

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
thing that they have going on, co-op

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I don't think there's

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
any, maybe

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I'm pretty sure they won't show anything else

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
with Bayonetta 3, but

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
maybe, maybe

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
a new trailer, maybe a little teaser

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
yeah, maybe another morsel or something

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Let's get to the phones, we got a call coming in, let's do it

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Hi, this is Ray G. Nader

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Hey Ray G. Nader, what's up buddy?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I know a whole lot, well

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
since the topic is pretty much

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
solely E3

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I'll chime in on that

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Go ahead

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Sorry if I'm a little measly looking there

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
sick as a dog, but

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
well

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
take what I'm about to see

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
with a little bit of

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
a grain of salt

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I always do, ba-da-bum

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I missed

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
some of

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
some portions

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
of the conferences because I was

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
supposed to be out and about

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
but based on what I did see

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
overall

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I was pleased with what

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I saw

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Now if I were to be

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
nitpicky about one

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
thing

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
is that

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
while I kind of saw this coming

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
in the back of my mind

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I was kind of sort of hoping

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
that

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I would hear about a new Magic

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Together game

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
that was in the works

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
That's something up your alley

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Oh yeah, well you know me, I talk about

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
those Magic Together games

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
all the time, in fact

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
the newest one

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Magic Duels came out

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I believe in

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
2014 or 2015

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
and that was like

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
three, four years ago

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
so I think we're kind of

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
overdue for a new one

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
and you know

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Grand is not as popular

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
as say Gears of War, Halo

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
or Mass Effect, but it does have

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
a pretty strong following

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Sure, of course

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
with the trading card game and everything, of course

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah, and plus

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
knowing that, but

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Grand is not as

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
extensive as actual

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
card game, but at the same time

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
it's a whole lot cheaper than

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
going out and getting the booster packs

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
and trying to find

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
the rare cards individually

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
you know, you'll save a lot of money

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
that way, so

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
that's why I love

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
the game myself, so

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
but

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
there was

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I loved everything else

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
you know, the

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
talk about Doom

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
the Fallout

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
talk, you know

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Let me ask you this question, RageNator

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
because there's a comment in our chat

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
where Kaijuto says, take it from a guy that plays a lot of

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
card games, there are so many better games than Magic

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
well, I mean, opinion

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
is a big thing, but I'm curious

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
RageNator, especially because

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
we're talking about Bethesda, Bethesda does have their

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Elder Scrolls based card game

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
do you ever try some of the others?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Uh, no

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
honestly, yeah

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
really, I mean, the main reason why

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I got into the

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Magic the Gathering

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
video games is because

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I've been involved with

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
the card game way back when

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I was in high school, back in the Stone Age

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
so, I'm already familiar

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
with concepts and

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
the mechanics and this and

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
other, and plus now there's the

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Paul and the Stabs thing for me

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
so, I'm not saying

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
that these other games are any

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
way, shape or form

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
bad games, I'm not saying that

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
if other people love these

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I totally get it, it's like me and

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Elder Scrolls Online when we were talking during the

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
thing, it's like, I just

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
tend to gravitate towards Final Fantasy 14

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It's your comfort zone

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Yeah, it's my comfort zone, it's not that Elder Scrolls Online

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
is bad, it's just, it's

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
the game that other people like, you know

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
some people like action movies, some people

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
like comedies, some people like

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
There's a lot of people that don't understand

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
my love for Binding of Isaac

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
but, it's my comfort zone, it's my game

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
with choice, you know

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Yeah, I kinda like what you like, it's cool

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I'm curious if you do the

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
experimenting with the other games, that's all

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Uh, no, I

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
well, I did manage to get

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
a free copy of GWENT

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
through DLG

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
but honestly, let's be

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
honest here, I haven't even

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
installed it yet, I haven't

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
fired it up yet

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
and honestly, I probably

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
never will

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I'm not saying that these other

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
games are anyway bad

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
other people love them

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
There's just only so much time in a day, I understand

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Yeah, well

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I'll probably get a free off the lines that way

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
if someone else wants a call

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
but have a nice night

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Thanks, thanks for the call, take care buddy, bye

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Such a nice guy, that regenator

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
if you wanna give us a call

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
For such a, for such a

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
testosterone-y filled name

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Like Rage?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Maybe it's just one of those ironic

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
It's one of those ironic names, maybe

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I don't know, I don't know, or maybe like

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
he's like Terminator, he terminates the Rage

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
The Rage stops here

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I think that's what he was going with

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Perhaps, perhaps

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Loki, any other headlines you wanna run down with us?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Uh, yeah, Final Fantasy XV is getting mod support on PC

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
or I should say it has mod support on PC now

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Oh, like official mod support

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
So like, now we can have

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Nudie mods officially

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
There's pictures of Keyblades

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
and Thomas the Tank Engine

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I feel like we knew this was coming because I remember this guy

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
the guy behind Final Fantasy XV

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Don't make nudie mods

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Please, we're just gonna ask the community

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
nicely to not make the nudie mods

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
and like, within

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
30 seconds the nudie mods were here

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
If not, look

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
If you're not into dudes

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I'm sure they've got a Sydney

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
like, and the

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Dragoon, Ariana, what was her name

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
the Dragoon lady, I'm sure they get naked too

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
so whatever you're into

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And Valve, Valve is just like

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
whatever the fuck you wanna do

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
you know, just don't troll people

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Okay

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Valve and I are fighting right now so

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I don't care what they're doing

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Valve can go do whatever they want

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
in their corner right now where I'm just side-eyeing them

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Speaking of mods

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
of course, you know, with the emulated version

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
of Breath of the Wild

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
people have modded Mario

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and Valve's are in there

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Because why not?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Because you can do all that kind of shit

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
You sure can

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I don't know

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
if we talked about this or not

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
but there's a new game streaming service

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I guess they're saying with Facebook

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
facebook.gg

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Oh yeah, this is like their answer to Twitch

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
and Mixer

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
and all that stuff

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
They're doing this facebook.gg

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Are we still mad at Facebook right now?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Are we on a cooling off period?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Facebook is like

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
that person you hang out with that you know

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
is nothing but drama and trouble

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
but like once in a while

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
like they're cool

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So it's like you're guarded

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
when you hang out with Facebook

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Facebook's kind of like the friend

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
that I

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
never really

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It's more of an acquaintance

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
not a friend

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I feel like Facebook doesn't need to be in this space

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
There's a lot of spaces Facebook is getting into

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
where I'm like Facebook, I think you should just stay out

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Exactly, it's trying to be a jack of all trades

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
but it's really horrible

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Game streaming is one of them

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
It's just like, it's not going to happen

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I don't know, I just read an article recently

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I say that, but I think actually

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
because so many people are glued to Facebook

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
it's going to pop up in people's

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
feeds so easily

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I read an article recently about how

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
they question Mark Zuckerberg

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
when he was

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
questioned by Congress

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
about the shadow

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
profiles, about how they make

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
profiles for people that don't even have

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Facebook accounts

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
and I was like, that really rubbed

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
me the wrong way

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
and his answers were not very

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
reassuring

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and so I'm like, wow

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So I don't feel like I can trust

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
them, you know what I mean? In fact

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I went into their privacy settings

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
just recently, which basically

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
their UI is so

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
convoluted, and we all know

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
this, right? But I was trying to go

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
into every single Facebook privacy

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
setting, which is like a headache in itself

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and turn everything off

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
because I don't want to allow anything

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
but even that, I don't trust

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
because they don't

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
have that there, so why would I trust

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
them with a streaming thing?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Honestly, my

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
biggest comment with this is

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
I will still be streaming on my Twitch

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
channel over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Go give me a follow, please

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
That's really all I have to say

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Not that Amazon is

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
really that much better, but

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
At least

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I feel like Twitch, for the most

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
part, when they have

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
issues, they're really good at resolving

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
them quickly and doing better, you

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
know, and maybe it wasn't always that

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
way, but like lately, you know

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
so I can't

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I enjoy being a Twitch streamer

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
you know, when I have the time for it

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
which isn't all the time, but when I have the time for it, I enjoy it

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
so, and honestly

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
if Twitch wasn't around, Mixer's not bad

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
there's a lot to like about Mixer

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I wish I had the time where I could

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
do a stream here and there, you know

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
but I just, I don't have that kind of time, sadly

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
but I watched the Xbox

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
thing on Mixer today and it looked great in 4K

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
so, because my monitor

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
on my computer is 4K

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
so it looked great. I watched it on YouTube because

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I was out and about

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
when it was going on. I forgot it was

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
early on. It was a weird hour

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
They always do their

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
concerts. I'm not talking about

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Bethesda. They always do their

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
conferences early

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
in the day, right? Well, it's early

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
for us, but

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
it was 4 o'clock on the East Coast

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
so a little more reasonable. So maybe they're just trying to be

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
friendly to the East Coast

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
but Sony always tells them like 6 o'clock

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
in the afternoon. Also

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
not just us, but Europe, that would've been

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
9 in the evening in Europe, so let's not

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
forget Microsoft's a global thing

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
so it makes a lot more sense

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
for them to go so early so that way it's

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
you know, because when Sony does

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
their thing, it's always later. That's gonna

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
be like 2 in the morning for Europe

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
so that's not as nice for them. So that's

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
part of the reason why, you know, there are

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
morning press conferences with ether. But I think that

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
maybe Sony has it in their mind, you know, well

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
this, you know, E3 is

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
primarily like North American

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
announcements, whereas Gamescom

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
is like more Europe, you know?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Yeah, at least Sony kind of

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
gives a little bit to Gamescom too, you know?

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Yeah, because they have those like

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
E3 style press conferences. Plus they have

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
PSX too. And you know what?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I think for Sony more, the thing

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
they have to consider is

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Japan. And so for Japan,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
it is the morning when

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Sony goes. So I think they all just kind of

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
have to consider like, you know, because you can't

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
do anything that's gonna be a

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
great time for Japan, the US, and

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Europe. So you just kind of have to pick two.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I just assume E3 has

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
already happened because Japan is in the

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
future. Yes.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Alright. Oh, back to Loki.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
See if there's any other stories you want to cover.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I was trying to find out what

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
happened with the Devolver Digital

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
thing. All I know is it

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
involved the physical loot coin that you

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
can buy for a very large amount of money

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
that keeps changing price.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I'm not really sure what else.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I am so

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
wanting to see this. Everybody in chat was

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
screaming about Metal Wolf Chaos, I guess was the

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
thing. Yeah, I thought that was rumored

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
to be something they were going to be bringing out.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Devolver Digital was my highlight

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
last year. They were like the best.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It made no sense.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Tim and Eric.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
They're kind of like the

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
frat kid game company in some

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
ways. You have to admit it was

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
funny last year. I didn't watch it. We were

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
doing this show. You didn't watch the

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
stream of it? No.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
There's a new

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
serious Sam game

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
coming out. I don't know.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But the actual

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
you have to watch that, Rob, if you've

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
never watched it. It's really funny.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Sorry, that was my

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Google chat that just went off. Again?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I know. It's like, God, I think it's safe

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
to keep it open so I can have a show roll up.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Well, to be fair, we didn't have a show roll tonight.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
We just had an email, so that's why I had it up.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
It was irony. Anyway.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
And you know what the funniest thing about it?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
There was a message from Alan going, what are you doing?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
What do you think I'm doing?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
He also knows that the show lately has been

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
wrapping around 8.30, so he's probably curious

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
if we're done yet or not. But I think we are

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
about winding up. Yeah, I think we've run out of

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
some stuff to talk about right now.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
We've run out of steam. Well, we haven't

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
run out of steam, but there's like a

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Dead or Alive 6 reveal trailer.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
There's a lot more we'll be talking about, I'm sure,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
after everything's done. Yeah, next week's gonna be crazy

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
because we're gonna have Sony and Nintendo to talk about.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Happy E3 week, everybody.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Try not to be too cynical.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Not everything sucks.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
There should be something you enjoy this week,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
so I hope, hey, I got Tetris

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Effect. If nothing else,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I have Tetris Effect. I'm telling you that

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
that is, and do you have,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
by the way, just for shits,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
do you have the Tetris Effect

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
when you play a prolonged

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
amount of time? Oh, do I suffer from it?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
It's not, you don't suffer from it,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
but it's something that a lot of people haven't. I do.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Um, I get it with other video

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
games. Really? Yeah. I'll dream

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
about other video games like that.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Well, no, no, I mean when,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
well, that's one thing. Isn't that

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
kind of the same thing?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I think it goes, it also goes

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
into the fact that when you play something like that

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
with like basic shapes for a long period of time,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
then you actually, when you close your eyes,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
you almost see it in your head.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And that's what happens to me.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
It's called the Tetris Effect. With all the music

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
games I've played over the years? Like, I've totally seen

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Falling Notes. Exactly. That's what it,

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
that's the Tetris Effect. Yeah. And that's the actual

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
official name of that

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
phenomenon. Yeah. So that

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
trailer was so cool the way they did that, yeah.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Like, it pisses, again,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
if you're one of those people out there on Twitter

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
that's like, a fucking Tetris

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
game, that should be, like, do not

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Oh, fuck you. Tetris is the best game in the world.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Seriously, I will cyber-bully you.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Like, you think Steam got

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
it bad tonight? Just wait until I find out where you are.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
There's a reason why they keep

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
re-releasing that game. It's because

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
it's a tried and true formula and it works.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Exactly. And, like,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
seriously, seriously, the first time

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I played Luminous, my reaction was,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
man, can you imagine if they made, like, a Tetris game like this?

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And, like, we're fucking getting it. So,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
sit down, shut up,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
and eat pie. And eat your rice.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I don't know.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
It's not coming to the Switch, though, which is unfortunate.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Well, no,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
yeah, it's exclusive. Not out the gate.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Right now, it's exclusive for Sony.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
That Luminous reboot, though, is out at the end of June.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
This is true.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And that is on the Switch.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I just like the soundtrack for Tetris Effect.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I just want everything to be on Switch, because

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I just, I wish it was more powerful

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
that they could put more of the other things.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Did you notice, though, that Microsoft kind of snuck that

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
in there, where they were like, you can play on your phone,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
and even though I know we're all laughing at that, like, ha ha,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I feel like that was kind of

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
like their way to say, like, well, you know,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
you can play anywhere on Microsoft, too.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
It's just a little different.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Yeah.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I get it. A little bit. Yeah, I get it.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
But I appreciated that Microsoft

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
is kind of trying to slyly go, you know.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Anyway,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
go ahead and chat.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
SG100Matt, I like this little piece of positivity here.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
We get tied up in

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
winners and losers of E3, when

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
in reality, the winners are all of us gamers,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
and the losers are the hate-filled

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
people who want to put down others

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
and make gaming an unhealthy place

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
for everyone. Be a winner, folks.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Aw, we could bake a cake.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Winners don't use cynicism.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
FBI warning.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
2018. Follow your dreams.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
NBC star.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Let's see. E3inator

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
in chat says, Tetris is overrated,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Rob Roberts.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Okay. You want to talk about reading?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Let's talk about reading.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Aren't you the guy that just

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
called into the show to talk about Magic

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
the Gathering? I can see

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
where he got his name.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
He's enraging us.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
That's all I'm gonna say.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
You're not the nice little guy that called in earlier.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I gave you all those compliments,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
and now I think you're shit.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
You're not shit.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
You just have an opinion.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Yeah, you just have some really bad opinions.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I mean,

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
we all sometimes have incorrect

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
opinions, and it's just about, you know.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And I kind of like Magic

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
the Gathering, but like the old school card game

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
the most. Nothing beats the card game.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You know, Matt, my boyfriend,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
he likes Magic the Gathering.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
He used to like it a lot. He doesn't play it now.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I used to play

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
the shit out of it. He has a ton of old cards

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
in his... I used to play

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
in high school, and then I found out one day we were

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
completely playing it wrong.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
The rules of that game are kind of complicated.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Now you've got YouTube's tutorials and shit

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and computer games to help you understand the rules

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
of Magic the Gathering, but trying to read it out of a book

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
we were playing it wrong.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
What I want to know is, where does the title

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
like, why is it called The Gathering?

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Like, what do you gather

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
in it? Do you gather magic?

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Yes, you tap your lands.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
You tap your lands!

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Tap the land, bitch!

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Is it Magic comma The Gathering?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
No.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Like, is Magic the title of The Gathering?

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Magic colon The Gathering.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Oh, Magic colon...

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I want to know

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
what caused the

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
original people to come up with this title.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Magic colon

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
The Gathering.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Wait, wait, is Magic the IP

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
and The Gathering is the name

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
of the game?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Listen, you gather the magic

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
to summon the monsters while you tap the lands.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Why is it so complicated?

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
That's the game's core mechanic.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Yeah, but when you think about it,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
though...

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I don't know.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I just wish...

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I agree with Dungeon Buster. Dungeon Buster says,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Magic colon The Gathering sounds dangerous.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
We're gonna leave it at that.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
That was a joke I knew Extro would like.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I like that joke.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Anything else to share with us, Lowkey, or are we shutting it down?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Ah, we can shut it down. I was just checking the Wikipedia page

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
for Magic the Gathering to see if they had an explanation.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Explain yourself!

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
You know, I'm glad I can

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
provoke these moments of

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
education. It's what I

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
live for.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
You're welcome.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Alright,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
so here we go.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Let's explain what it was.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
The game,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
while the game is simply called Magic

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
through most of playtesting,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
when the game had to be officially named,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
a lawyer informed them that the name Magic

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
was too generic to be named.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Mana Clash was instead

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
chosen to be the name used

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
in the first solicitation of the game.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
However, everybody involved in the game

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
continued to refer to it as Magic.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
After further consultation with

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
the lawyer, it was decided

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
to name the game Magic the Gathering,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
thus enabling the name to be

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
trademarked. So that's why they don't

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
just call it Magic. Interesting.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
But you know what? Mana Clash sounds...

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
You can't trademark Magic.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Mana Clash sounds

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
like an 80s synth-pop band.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
But it also, in the context of today's

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
media and everything,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
it sounds like a generic mobile game.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
It probably is a game

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
called Mana Clash on the store right now.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And it's probably a match three game.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Mana Clash!

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Alright, anyway.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
We're going to wrap things up. Extrovert, the chatters

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
are loving you tonight. S2100 Matt says

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
don't be a stranger. Call in when you get settled in.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
You're missed here. And Judge Boeser said thank you for

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
suggesting... S2100 Matt is suggesting

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
that you should have... Oh, I don't know about this.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I don't know about this. But he's suggesting

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
you should have a segment called

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Hot Game Developer of the Week.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
You know my

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
habits when it comes to podcasts.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I'll always miss that.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
He'll do it for 12

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
weeks.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
And they'll be like, oh, like

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
five weeks later. It's like, you're like,

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
do you want to do it again?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Guys, there's something about

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
the guys on the show, I think the revival went

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
for like 12 episodes, right?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Pokestop podcast went for 12 episodes.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Shaking and crying, we have 13

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
episodes and we've been off for five weeks.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Okay, so it's you. It's your fault.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I think it might be. You're the constant

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
in this. Alright, no.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
No, no. I'm going to own up to the guys on the show.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But, but, but

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
um, most... And I am

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
trying to get Victoria in gear for us to move again.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And it is partially my fault why we put it

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
on a stop for a while. Most revivals

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
only last 13 episodes.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Roseanne.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Yes, but that's

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
because the last time I checked

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I don't post stupid shit

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
on my Twitter.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I have to say, I have something

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
to say.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
No, shaking and crying is coming back.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
It's just, you notice, it's been a little

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
bit. So some of you might think it's been

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
ending, but as long

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
as Victoria isn't stopping, we

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
shouldn't be stopping. Anyway, sorry.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I was just going to say, you know, I, by the way

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I've, people that

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
have listened to the show know I take

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Ambien. I'm a friend to the

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Ambien. I speak Ambienese.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Right. And so I have

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
taken it for 13 years on and off.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Do you play with Amiibo on Ambien?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
No, I don't. I don't.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I play with my Amiibo on Ambien.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Right.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I'd like to play

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
with some of those guys on the show.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
On Bethesda.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Okay, so I'm going to

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
summarize beside the point,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
but what I want to say is

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
never have I

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
ever wanted to post

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
a racist tweet on Ambien.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Just going to go, just going to make

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
that clear, right?

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Okay, just so that's clear. You've never been

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
compelled to just get on there. No, no, because

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
the thing about Ambien is you still

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
know right from wrong when you're on

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
it, so you're not going to do things that

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
aren't you. It's like you're not allowed to murder

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
it. Like guns don't kill people.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Ambien kills people. Exactly.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
So let's say that I did

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
make a racist tweet on Ambien.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
That would mean I'm a racist.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Uh huh.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Connect the dots there, Rob.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I kind of already did.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Like Roseanne, she's

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
canceled. Like literally and

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
figuratively. I didn't like the show anyway.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
It came on as like, this is

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
just too much propaganda

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
bullshit nonsense.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
It got so bad. It got

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
so bad in my opinion. Like I'm like,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
this isn't funny anymore.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Anyway, wow. So this is

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
not the Roseanne podcast. No, it's

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
not. It's not. So I think, I think

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
we're ready to wrap up.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, you have

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
said stupid shit, Rob. Like Super Metroid

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
is better than Chrono Trigger on

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
your Twitter, so that's hate speech.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Well, I mean

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
when you're going to spell the truth. Facts are facts, America.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Honestly,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I can't judge Chrono Trigger. I

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
never played it. Here's the thing.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I always get shit

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
over that line, which I, I'm going to

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
stand by. I'm going to stand by. You can

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
put it on my fucking tombstone. Super Metroid

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
is the greatest video game ever made. Here's

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
the thing though. When have I ever said

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Chrono Trigger is a bad game?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Like, and that's the whole thing. This is like gaming

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
in a nutshell. Can't we

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
just enjoy both?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Can't we enjoy both?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Isn't there room

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
in your collection for

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
both? And also, if we're going to go further,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
what if you did think

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Chrono Trigger was a bad game?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
What does that matter? You're not actually

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
destroying world peace. That's just your opinion.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
It's true. Lavos

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
destroyed world peace. I didn't do shit.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I don't care if you don't like my favorite

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
things, but like, I mean

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I might get a little irked and be like,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
well, they're stupid.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
That's like when you talk shit about Forza Horizon

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
4. I'd be like, that's your wrong opinion.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
But go ahead.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Well, it's kind of a derivative game.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
You know, with those cars. I think you meant to say

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
a deriving game. It is a deriving

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
game. A deriving, yeah. And you drive

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
in the winter and the summer

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
and the autumn and we're gonna leave it at

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
that before I'm gonna put

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
you in Valve's corner.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Nobody belongs in that corner

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
except for Valve, Rob. Nobody puts

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Valve in a corner. Yeah.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Nobody wants to put Valve in a corner.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
This hurts me more than it hurts you, Valve.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Are we done?

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Can we sign off now? Alright. Yes.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
That's it. We're gonna be back in another

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
seven days to do this all again.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Without Extfer. No, but they can't.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Sorry, guys.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I appreciated you being here. You're a lot of fun as always.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Do you have anything you want to plug?

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Like, things that people should follow you on

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
if they miss you? You know, you can follow

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
me on Twitter. I'm

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
GamerExtfer. It's

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
G-A-Y... Why do I always have to

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
spell this stuff? Well, cause there's...

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Well, Extfer is E-X-T-O-F-E-R.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
It's not X-T-O-F-E-R.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
It's E-X-T-O-F-E-R.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
But Gamer is G-A-Y-M-E-R.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Like Gay,

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Gamer, GamerX. Right.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Happy Pride. Yes.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
You should spell that name. That is

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
what I would think. There you go.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Cool. I don't have

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
anything else, though. I don't have anything else I do

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
lately. I don't stream

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
anymore. Support Ubisoft cause

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
then... Yeah, yeah. Buy the

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Fractured But Whole.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Because, you know, it's nice to show

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
people support. A lot of hard

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
working people worked on that game.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
That's right.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Still haven't played through all the DLC.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I know. He keeps telling me to

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
play through the latest one.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
The second DLC. He says

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
it's really good. I bought the Season Pass

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
and I was like, that's what I typically do

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
with games. Like, I'm gonna buy the Season Pass.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And then I stopped playing the game. I did Fallout 4.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I did that with Call of Duty.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And I did it with that one.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I'm sure there's other games.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Skyrim. It happens.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
It happens. Alright.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So as I always say at the end of the show, thank you

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. If you enjoyed

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
what you heard here at the show, leave us

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
a nice five star review on iTunes or

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
tell a friend or wherever you hear the show.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
iTunes, Google Play, whatever. And tell a friend or

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
two about the show. Help us spread the word because

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
And we can't get the

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
voices out here to air unless

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
y'all know about the show. If you didn't

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
enjoy tonight's OLR, try

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
to download one of the other episodes

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
that didn't get interrupted with E3

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
and Extoverne.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
No, I consider that a compliment.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Anyway, if you didn't enjoy

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
tonight's episode, you're just wrong. Sorry.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Hate to say it. Anyway.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Dexter, do you have a final thought?

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I want to

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
sleep with that guy and his dad on

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
the Bethesda conference.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Maybe you should keep that thought

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
internal. I don't know if my boyfriend

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
would really appreciate

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
the final thought. Probably not.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Loki, can you give us a real final thought, please?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I'm looking forward to seeing all of the

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
game announcements this week.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Hopefully there's nothing

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
disappointing. Death Stranding.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
My final thought is I'm gonna hold out

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
hope for Super Metroid 2.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Have a good night, everybody.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
We'll see you in seven days. What about F-Zero? What are the odds

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
of F-Zero this year?

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I hope so. None to none. Can I play the credit

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
music now? We'll see you in seven days. Bye.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
The views and opinions

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
expressed in this program do not

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
necessarily reflect those of the staff

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
of Orange Lounge Radio or

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
VOG Network, but you know

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
they were all still true.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
See you next week.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Thanks for watching!
