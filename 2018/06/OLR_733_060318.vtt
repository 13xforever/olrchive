00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
After testing your mind all weekend at gaming cons for the last four years, Just Shapes and Beats finally releases for the Nintendo Switch and PC. The Mortal Kombat theme song is now playing in your head. If this is just one game in a full week of news, stay tuned for the rest, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on June the 3rd of 2018, episode number 733 of our show.

00:44.000 --> 00:58.000
That's right, June is underway, it's a big month. Happy Pride Month folks. Happy me turning 40 at the end of this month. Happy OLR's birthday month. June is a very busy month. Isn't it DarkSakura or Jamie Summers over there with a mic?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah it is.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
How are you?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm tired.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
You tired?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Well wake up girl, we got three hours to fill.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
I got woke up.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Somebody shook my ass out of bed and said, you gotta go to Placerville.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Ew, ew, why does anybody want to go to Placerville?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Placerville is pretty though.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
No, there's some cool things up there.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
That was like...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Wasn't that the one they used to call Hangtown?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I don't know, I'm not from your country.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
I think it was back in the day. Anyway, I hope you're doing well. Let's also check in with Techmaster Loki.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Also the VoG Network birthday.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
That's right. VoG Network was also born in June. Thank you for the reminder. We kind of passed it. It was June 1st.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
But yes, celebrating six years here at the Voice Geeks Network.

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
So a big toast to not only of course Bobby Black Wolf who's on before us every Sunday night because we do tape live at the Voice Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific at 9 o'clock Eastern right after said Bobby Black Wolf's show.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Not only just a big toast to him but all of the contributors to the different shows from our network.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
You know, all the way from the people that have been with us from the very, very beginning.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Shows like, you know, Critical Myth, Pod Culture, Electric Sisterhood.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
All the way up to shows like our newest addition to the network Faraway Nearby.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
So a toast to everybody who's been participating with the Voice Geeks Network and all our big shows.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
You can check out more information on all the shows here at vognetwork.com.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Great plug, Loki.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
No problem.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Speaking of plugs, I see you've plugged your switch into your computer to keep it running charged or whatever.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
Yes, because my kids were playing with it all day long and I haven't got a chance to really play around with it.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
I see. Does that work okay? Like charging it through your laptop and then your laptop is in the wall? Is that given enough of a charge to keep going?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
It's apparently working.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Alright, good to know.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
A couple percent higher than it was.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
But sadly, hooking that into your laptop will not allow you to suddenly get in there and grab all the files, right?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
No, I hope they have a mod chip that'll be coming in a couple weeks to do that.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Of course, of course. I knew there was something with that. Alright, fair enough.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Also, say hello. We have a guest in studio tonight and it's been a little while since we've had a fourth chair.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
But I think it's great that we're welcoming him back. You guys actually hear this guy every week on OLR.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
But you may not have heard him here in studio for, God, it's probably been a couple years.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Welcome back, Jason.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
You're gonna get to hear me for a lot more than 13 seconds tonight.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
That's right. And you have that down. You know exactly your window that you get.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
One of these days, though, we're gonna change the intro on you and I'm hoping to give you something.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Well, what I'm hoping is that in whatever future intro we use, it'll be a loop.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
So if you need more time, you can extend the loop. If there's less time, you can just delete the loop.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Which means that I get to actually do all of the audio editing in the process. But yes.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Doesn't that sound fun?

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
It's a great idea because sometimes, you know, I just want to sit back and say, on June 2nd of 2018,

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
when the Sacramento weather finally hit 100 degrees, the scorching sun above and the hot rods in the parking lot

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
led us to a discussion about the... Anyways.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
On the seventh day, Microsoft said, let there be GitHub.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Nice. Nice.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
All right. Anyway, that little current news going on there.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
So, oh, our chat room's lighting up over at live.vognetwork.com.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
SSJ saying welcome back to the studio and Eric RPG saying press X to Jason, which I'm sure you've never heard before.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
I... nobody... I have a shirt that says that.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Jason. Jason.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
And shockingly, nobody has actually used the reference against me.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Okay. Until now.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
So I haven't actually heard it plenty. So thank you.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
So, Jason, I know, obviously, you know, if I don't say this enough on the show,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
like this show wouldn't like fucking exist right now if it wasn't for you.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Like, I hope folks realize that.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah, I'm just, you know, I'm just kind of awesome.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
You do it. Yeah. Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
You'll go. Hold on, though.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
We'll keep that ego check.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
But you do a ton behind the scenes.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
You do like the orange laundry dot com website, even though, yes, it's old.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
And we've talked about that.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
The fact that, you know, we have a podcast generating custom thing, a place to host the shows and everything.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
That's all because of you as well as the audio intros and outros that you do every week.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So big, big thanks to that.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
What else are you doing in gaming these days in the past couple of years?

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
I know like you do a lot with at least like watching Twitch and supporting Twitch.

05:13.000 --> 05:22.000
Like you were the one that made me go to TwitchCon and finally kind of like sell me on this concept of broadcasting games for people to watch that now, like two years later, I'm actually like doing.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Yeah. Yeah.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
TwitchCon was only two hours away from me at the start.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
It's like it's practically your backyard, Rob.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I know. It's just Moscone. Exactly.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
It's not like traffic is God awful.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I have to get in the car. I have to pay a toll to get over the bridge.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Five bucks over the pretty water.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
I unfortunately like gaming.

05:44.000 --> 06:02.000
What is what is most relevant and most interesting is that the Colorado chapter of the IGDA when when the Twitch Colorado group formed the folks at Cigna, Colorado Independent Game Developer Association, attended the first meetup.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
And so there's been a strengthening of the gaming and geek tech nerd communities by nature of getting together.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
So I've actually been pained, returning the favor and kind and attending some of the Cigna hangouts.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
And I'm not a game developer myself.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
And everybody asks, everybody there asks, what are you working on?

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Well, I'm not I'm not a game developer myself.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
I consider myself more of a kind of an integrator, maybe, maybe web service at best kind of person.

06:31.000 --> 06:41.000
But I am gaming adjacent and I would love to be able to see the things the things that exist in my backyard back in Colorado that I didn't know about.

06:41.000 --> 06:50.000
And I think here locally with Sacramento, even though now we have the Sacramento Game Developers Collective, which is very similar in concept to IGDA and all that.

06:50.000 --> 07:00.000
What what they one thing I've kind of learned with working with them is that there is a lot more in-game development than just necessarily knowing how to program games.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Right. For example, I know like, you know, and I'll just I don't think I'm saying anything that's like a big secret.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
But like when Bree was here from from that group and they were talking about the SAC Indie Arcade, which sadly it didn't happen this year, you guys.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
We're really hoping it's going to be back next year. But Bree was on the show before and she kind of admitted she didn't really like super get into games.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
And so she started getting involved with this.

07:19.000 --> 07:29.000
But when it came to like promotion, when it came to like how to get in touch with the media and how to get your game like exposed and all that, like the business side of things that sometimes people doing the programming.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Don't always think about like she was like rock solid on that stuff.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
That was a huge strength for her because she had worked with the radio background, all that.

07:36.000 --> 07:47.000
So my point with that and bringing up, you know, former guests on the show is that it does remind us that like, oh, yeah, there is a lot more in the game industry besides just programmers getting in there, making the game.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Because then the question is, well, where's your music going to come from?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Where's your voiceovers going to come from, Jason?

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Where's your voice of voice of God going to come from the other vog?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Nobody's poached me yet, but nobody yet.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
Absolutely. Like it, like any like any production, like any art form, like any anything, it's not just the programmers.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
It is also the artists, both in the visual and the acoustic and any other sense.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
It actually it absolutely is promotion dissemination.

08:15.000 --> 08:24.000
There is a certain there is a certain distribution and marketing Web site of indie games that goes by the name Game Jolt.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
The owners are nomads, but they currently reside in Colorado.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
And so I back as a lot of nomads do only only for their 14 K and then they move on.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
They move on to the next mountain.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
I see. But why? I just thought it was the legalization of a certain substance that brought a lot of nomads there.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And then, oh, wait, wait, they got it in California now to the entire coast.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Just just start in SoCal, swim all the way up. And no matter where you land, it's green.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Or as Raginator in our chat room asks, Sega nomads.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
That won't even get you to the next city.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
That is like the second funny joke Raginator said in our chat room in like this year.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Congratulations, buddy.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Also, I tripped over ours literally.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
It is it is a brick.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
It hurts when it falls on your foot, just saying.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
All right. So anyway, where were we? Oh, yes.

09:16.000 --> 09:27.000
So the moral of the story is, I bet these companies like, you know, your companies, these organizations like Colorado, IGDA, you know, the sat and any game developer in your city where you live.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
You know, if you've been wanting to get involved with game development like they actually probably want more people.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
That aren't just programmers. I mean, if that's something you want to do, cool.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
But like, you know, if you are a music guy, if you're an art person, if you're a marketing person, if you're a Web site creator.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I mean, these all these things go into how to get a game out.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
And even even if it's even if there's no digital aspect to it.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
Cigna's holiday party at the end of last year had a had a tabletop.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm sorry, but every time you say that name, I think of health insurance.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
I can't like I'm like, wait, Cigna, what the fuck do they have to do with anything?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:05.000 --> 10:15.000
The holiday party had a tabletop board and card game creator and like logic, even even if you're not a programmer yourself.

10:15.000 --> 10:31.000
Your ability to create design rules is just as important for for balancing, for fairness or for even tipping the scales and making knowing how to make something demonstrably significantly hard.

10:31.000 --> 10:43.000
So it's it's it's a production like it's not it's not as literal as when I my my very first job was working for a newspaper whenever whenever I would tell someone that, oh, you're a writer.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
No. Oh, you edit. No, I fix the computers of the people that do.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, yeah, and it's important for sure. For sure.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.000
No, that's that's you know, it's you know, when you see these companies, like if you were to go to like Blizzard's website, they're always hiring for people.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Right. So you could see like what kind of roles is Blizzard trying to fill right now?

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
They're always going to have somebody that's like a project manager. And like, what does that person have to do?

11:07.000 --> 11:14.000
Basically, corral all the cats, you know, and make sure that the project manager will be responsible for making sure that the game actually comes out when they say it's going to come out.

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
Organization like proper organization of people and tasks is a huge is an incredible skill.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
For sure. Anyway, great chat.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
Well, welcome back to the show, Jason. And it's good to have you here. And please feel free to chime in as necessary on our stories tonight.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
I should ask you real quick, though, because we were talking about this a little bit at lunch TwitchCon this year. Is that something you're going to go?

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
I do already have well, I don't have my tickets yet. They haven't even frickin gone on sale. I have a hotel room, though.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
And yes, when to as soon as tickets go on sale, I absolutely will be. I will be once again in your backyard in San Jose.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
But I told you my problem with the weekend. Why are they doing Halloween weekend? Seriously?

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
Because they that's been their time slot. I know that are the weekend before.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
I know at least one couple that's getting married Halloween weekend and then there'll be a Rocky Horror thing for sure.

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
So I'm a little I want to go like really big because now that I actually do more streaming, I actually want to and like I know people that are going to be there.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
They're going is like, fuck, I really want to meet these people.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
So what you're saying is we need the hyperloop to be done in the next four months so you can just get down there in half an hour.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Can you can you give Elon Musk a call? I mean, I am one of those tunnels. I am one of his customers.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
I have some cloud, doesn't it? Perhaps. Perhaps.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Oh, well, I was going to ask you this real quick and then we'll get into news with the Twitch stuff.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
You don't really do a lot of broadcasting, right? So is this like a similar thing to the game development?

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
What what do you do? Because you you've always been like a big supporter of Twitch and streaming and all that.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
What what is your role in that? I am not a game developer. I'm developer adjacent.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
I am not a Twitch broadcaster. I am broadcasting adjacent. I am a Jason.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Jason, you're broadcasting adjacent. Jason, come on.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Come on. I was literally picking up the microphone to make that joke.

12:56.000 --> 13:05.000
That's pretty funny. OK. Anyway, I I have dabbled in streaming to kind of understand, especially like OBS has some really.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
It's a it's a it's it's a language that you need to learn. It's a it's a way of putting things together that you need to learn.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
And I I've been a tech support person my entire professional my entire life period.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
And so that's just kind of the role that I take on. I'm a community member for friends.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
I know I have a couple of IRL friends that stream a coworker.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
A former coworker was a gate was my gateway drug into Twitch. And by referral, friends of friends and all that kind of stuff.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
I go in and I help people out and I make friends by reference.

13:37.000 --> 13:44.000
And I, you know, I meet new people. TwitchCon especially has has exemplified that.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
So I'll take part and be a community member and provide knowledge and insight as possible as necessary.

13:50.000 --> 13:59.000
Really rad. And I think, you know, especially for the larger streamers, which is not something I've had to deal with personally, because I'm you know, I'm still kind of I'm a affiliate, but I'm I'm still kind of small fry.

13:59.000 --> 14:09.000
Right. You know, I'm a small French fry, not a jumbo size. But like those guys that are like partners and stuff like they need like teams to be able to just moderate their channels to like take the garbage out basically.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
And sometimes it's kind of a thankless job sort of thing, you know?

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
Yep. So, yeah, you're you're doing a very important role there with all that. So. All right. Awesome. Great.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
If you guys want to ask Jason any questions, you can over at live.vognetwork.com.

14:24.000 --> 14:32.000
In fact, actually, Bobby Black Wolf is speaking up going, maybe I need to talk to Jason because I'm fighting OBS for some stuff with plugins or browser source stuff.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
So I guess the consulting door is open. All right.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
I am reachable on the Internet. I go by VX JasonXV.

14:40.000 --> 14:48.000
That's right. And actually, funny enough, like OBS, you were kind of talking about like getting that software, you know, it's not just for streaming.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
You can make regular movies with that, like record things.

14:52.000 --> 15:02.000
And I've actually used like so for my dumb Facebook game that I got way too involved with earlier this month, you have to record these little like, you know, like like they would do on the TV show.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
It's just like them sitting there talking shit about everybody.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
So that's what you have to do is you have to record yourself talking shit about everybody for like five minutes every every game round, basically.

15:10.000 --> 15:19.000
So I used OBS to do it so I could use my green screen to like pretend that I was in the forest or like actually people started requesting like, could you do one in the Grand Canyon?

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
So I did it when it was in the Grand Canyon. And so like I would use my green screen. That was all through OBS.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
So I would record little things in OBS and I would use good old Windows Movie Maker to string it all together.

15:29.000 --> 15:36.000
But actually, well, but then I learned like, how do I step up my game? And there's some free video editing program that's like really big Redfish or something.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
I don't remember the name of it now. Red Lantern. I don't remember what it's called.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Red Lantern is a very angry.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I don't know. I don't I don't think that's really somebody in chat will yell it out.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
But it's a it was a movie editing thing that's free. And I actually started to learn like how to use it.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
And like it was like, God, this ridiculous fucking game is teaching me these like real life skills. What the fuck?

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
If you want as well, I would be more than happy to bring over my Mac and let you use iMovie.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Oh, yeah.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
iMovie will work on your iPhone.

16:04.000 --> 16:11.000
Now, if I shoot films on my phone, which I have done, I definitely use iMovie for that because it's super simple.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
And it will migrate over into the desktop version.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
Yeah, that's that's with all with the cloud and all that good stuff. Yes, of course, of course. Anyway.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
All right. Well, let's move on.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
We've got to get into gaming and we're going to get into, of course, our gaming weeks.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
But first, we actually have a kickoff topic. I know we were like 20 minutes in the show.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
We've got to get to our kickoff topic, which has to do with Pokemons.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
That's right. E3 is just around the corner next week.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Actually, we're going to have kind of a different a very different O.L.R. show.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
So we're still debating. And maybe you guys can have a say with this.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
We are considering one of two options.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
We're either going to cut our show short so that Bethesda's press conference, we can kind of go watch that.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Then come back and give our thoughts.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
But Loki is kind of suggesting that maybe we do something that I said we'd never do and actually do the live commentary this year.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Sure. Let's do it. All right.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
So that may be playing live. We complain complaining live or say that's really cool.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
No, I think I think less less cynicism, more optimism would be the optimistic.

17:11.000 --> 17:18.000
I'm still hoping for another Elder Scrolls game, even if it's like some stupid like, oh, hey, we're remastering Oblivion now.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
I'll take that. Yeah, we'll see that.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
Maybe what we'll do, maybe I am thinking, all right, some folks are saying live commentary worth a shot.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Screw Bethesda. They're going to be let down. What I might do.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
And so this would be important for the podcast folks.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
What I'll probably do is we'll still do it live for those that want to listen.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
They can and those that don't want to don't have to.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
And then what we'll do for the podcast is we'll make that section of the show like a special download on our social media.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
But we won't actually be part of the regular podcast. So that that's kind of where my head's at right now.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
We'll let you all know what to expect next week.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
But anyway, my point was with E3 literally around the corner is next week.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
E3 is next. Well, you know, a week from next next business.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
We next business. Well, no, you are right. It is next week because of all the keynote.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Yeah, yes, that's true. Oh, yeah, that's true. The keynotes are starting on Saturday.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
Is your whole lesson of discussion? Yes. Six days away when the first keynote is going to be first out the gate.

18:11.000 --> 18:18.000
So anyway, but we have leaks are starting to show up, which are getting confirmed by some of the publishers.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
We'll talk about that a little later in the show, but also some people wanting to get the jump on some of the announcements.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
And the Pokemon Company was one of those companies that wanted to get the jump on those announcements.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
They did a little thing in Japan during this week this week.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
So they talked about the latest of what's going on with Pokemon.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
So the first thing that they announced is that they have a little side game called Pokemon Quest.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
And Pokemon Quest came out for the Nintendo Switch for free this week.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
And it is slated for mobile in about a month. It'll be coming out on iOS and Android.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
You can download it on the switch right now. It's very obvious it's a mobile game.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
It's all touch screen. It is. It is all touch screen.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
I mean, you can't if you dock it or even if you are still in handout, you can use the little controllers to move around.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
I didn't even realize this until I was streaming it earlier this week, actually.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
And Bobby or somebody chimed in and said, did you know you can use L and R to change at the bottom?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I didn't even realize that.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
Or you could just do what I do and just let the game play itself because it ends up beating levels that I can't do on my own.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
So I'm like, eh, fine.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
That may not be a bad idea, actually.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
Anyhow, the little free to play thing came out and it's basically blockymon.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Like they look like very blockymon.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Cubivore Pokemon.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
It is cubivore Pokemon. Well, when I first saw it, I was like, oh shit, here's Pokemon's Minecraft.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
But it actually is nothing like that at all.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
It's more of Crossy Roads. I was just gonna say Crossymon.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Crossy Roads Pokemon.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
That's a good way of putting it.

19:47.000 --> 19:56.000
So anyway, the thing about it is that, you know, you can't really, like, you're playing a story mode-esque sort of thing by yourself.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
But you're not trading with friends. You're not interacting with friends.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
You can't see how friends are progressing.

20:01.000 --> 20:12.000
For a mobile game, well, what will be a mobile game, you know, for what's right now on the Switch, there's really no sense of competition with your friends whatsoever.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
It's a shockingly antisocial mobile game.

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
Yes, and so therefore, all the free to play elements are just like, you know, pay this money to get items or just sit there and wait.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
It's like that Harry Potter game.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Like you have energy.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah, it's that whole thing, which is a little bit eh, but it is free.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
So, you know, there is that.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
But for me, I think it's one of those things where it's like, I played it a few times this week, and I'm done.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
You know, that was cute.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Next.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
You know, meanwhile, these other games are coming out, and I don't have the time to check out my silly little Pokemon.

20:44.000 --> 20:55.000
Maybe when it's on mobile, so I can do it from places like, you know, a doctor's office or a waiting room or sitting at the airport or something, like, maybe it would make more sense in those places.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Which I guess technically you could use the Switch in those places too, but I just, I don't take my Switch with me everywhere.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I take my mobile phone with me everywhere.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
So it's going to make more sense there.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
But, Loki, I couldn't help but notice you have been playing it.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
I noticed that was the game that was on your Switch, so that kind of surprises me.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
You're into Pokemon Quest?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Yeah, it's fun. I've played it for a few hours already.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
How far are you right now?

21:17.000 --> 21:24.000
To like the, not the, like the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels, because they unlock three at a time.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
So I'm to there.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Wow, okay.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
I haven't got any evolutions or anything, but I have a shit ton of Pokemon though.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Okay, wow, okay. You just keep, you keep using the little cooking thing?

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Do you just let it cook whatever it wants, or do you actually...

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
No, I looked up online how to, like, do those.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Oh, okay. I was like, there's got to do it.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
But, I mean, it's easy to figure out too. It's just like, okay, all red, all blue, all, you know.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Oh, okay.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
It's not that hard.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Alright.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
That's really smart.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
And Bobby wants to know, have you hacked it yet, Loki?

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
Um, I paid money to unlock some stuff, because I thought it was worth...

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You gave those people money?

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
It's a game, yeah. I'm supporting the game, because I played it for like eight hours.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So I'm like, okay, well, I think it's...

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
No, I just...

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Throw them some money, so I did it.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
I would not have thought that Pokemon Quest on Switch, out of all of the things out there,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
would have been the thing to finally get you to open up, well, I mean, I know you've opened it up before,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
but would be something to get you to open up your wallet.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I'm just, I'm pleasantly surprised, that's all.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
I just figured I'd throw them some money.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Alright, fair enough.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
So there you go.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Headline of the week, y'all.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Loki spent money on Pokemon Quest.

22:23.000 --> 22:29.000
Alright, so Pokemon Quest is out, but that's not the thing people really wanted to know about.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
People wanted to know about, where's the real game coming out on Switch?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
And Nintendo had kind of two answers for that.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
In a sense, they had a literal two answer with, let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Which was a game, I think they leaked, these were leaked a while ago.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah, the leaks turned out to be pretty legit, because those were the leaked titles that came out.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
And so, yeah, I mean, that would not be a thing.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
I think most people would guess, is that Eevee was now a starter Pokemon of sorts.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
Which, I mean, that makes people very happy, I'm sure, because Eevee is, you know, people love Eevee and the Eeveelutions.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
So, that's really cool.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
And then Pikachu, of course, has always been a bit of the mascot of the Pokemon series,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
thanks in no small part to the cartoon.

23:11.000 --> 23:18.000
So anyway, these games were confirmed, they will be coming out for the Switch, but they're not your traditional Pokemon RPG.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
In fact, these games look like they are, I mean, I guess the easiest way to say it,

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
would be it's a bit of a hybrid of Pokemon Go and the more traditional Pokemon RPGs.

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
What I mean by that is that it looks like you will be catching Pokemon with a very similar ball throwing type of mechanic

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
that you use on the mobile phones when you play Pokemon Go.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
In fact, speaking of Pokemon Go, there does appear to be a way that you will be able to bring in monsters

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
that you've caught in Pokemon Go into your Let's Go game.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
No word yet if that's like an isolated area, because if you look really closely at the trailer,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
you see it mention something called Go Park or something like that.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
So it's unknown if it's like something you bring into the full game or just like this one mode that kind of works with it.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
And Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee is going to have their own little Bluetooth peripheral.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
It's a little Pokeball.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
And you can also bring them back into Pokemon Go too.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
Yes, yes, apparently. So yeah, that's got a lot of Pokemon Go players pretty excited.

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
So anyway, the accessory is a little Pokeball and then I guess it makes, I don't know, makes a little Pokemon noises as well.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
It's Pokeball Plus that they are saying will be available in November.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
For a day and then gone for three months.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
That's fucking generous. For five minutes and then it will be gone.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
That's a portion of the day.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
If you want one of these things, you better be ready to fight.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
Because we all know Nintendo cannot keep these types of things on the shelves for shit.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
We don't know how to supply our vendors.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
I'm just telling you all, so that when this happens, we can say, oh yes, we knew this was coming.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
This is going to be the thing that you're not going to be able to fucking find, but you're going to want it.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Oh no, customer fainted.

25:02.000 --> 25:11.000
Trainer used eBay. It's super effective, but you now have zero dollars.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
Breaks list, use scalper.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
So anyway, so Pikachu and Eevee.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
But I say it looks like it's kind of a hybrid because when you look at the battle, the battle doesn't look like Pokemon Go at all.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
Because the battle is just mash the screen as fast as you can type of thing.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
But in this one, you can clearly see that the Pokemon comes out and you can choose one of three moves.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
Like there's a little screenshot with Pikachu being able to use Thunder Shock or Quick Attack.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
And he's limited to how many times he can do it, just like in the games.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
So it does seem like there is a little bit of a hybrid there.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
So you might catch your Pokemon like Pokemon Go, even though you are on the Switch.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
It's a single player experience.

25:49.000 --> 26:00.000
But I got to admit, as somebody who loves Pokemon Go, who appreciates the single player games but never seems to have the attention to completely get through them,

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
I'm looking at this going, wow, this seems like a really kind of perfect blend of the things I'm into.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
And I understand there's people out there that just for whatever reason, they don't go outside as often.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
And so this is a chance to play a game like Pokemon Go, but from the comfort of their own home or what have you.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
So, I mean, that's really cool, too.

26:19.000 --> 26:26.000
But, I mean, just as, I guess, for no other better term, but a filthy fucking casual when it comes to Pokemon.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Like, I'm like super into this.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
So it's interesting to me to watch some of the, you know, reaction over on Twitter.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
You've got some people that are like into it, like I am.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Some people that think it's trash.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
You know, they're like, pass, you know, whatever this is.

26:40.000 --> 26:47.000
Now, if you're one of those people that's like, pass, well, the good news is for you, they confirmed this is not Gen 8.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
Pokemon Gen 8 is coming in 2019.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
But...

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
So the next Pokemon mainline game is a year away.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
It'll be what, like holiday 2019.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
But that is, again, and I talked about this on a previous episode.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
If you look at the number of years between mainline Pokemon gens, you should have expected 2019.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
But, this game is going to be the way to unlock one of the Gen 8 Pokemon before the game.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Ah, I see. Okay, I didn't realize.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
Now, I heard that there was going to be an extra Pokemon in this game.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
And it's going to be a brand new Pokemon.

27:21.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah, so the thing, and also if you didn't already pick this up, the thing about Let's Go Pikachu, Let's Go Eevee is that it is Gen 1.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
It's Kanto Pokemon only, basically.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And it's only using one Joy-Con.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
It's controlled completely with like the analog stick, basically.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
I'm also still kind of curious how that's going to work with Pokemon Go.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
If Go has three generations, and I would think by the holiday...

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Probably only port over certain Pokemon.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Yeah, maybe. Maybe only certain ones are going to be able to go back and forth.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
We'll have to really see how that all shakes out.

27:49.000 --> 27:57.000
Or maybe if these games, like Pokemon Go, are built to expand to Gen 2, Gen 3, Gen 4.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
I mean, it would probably make more sense to Nintendo to sell those things separately.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
But they could also be awesome DLC.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
I mean, would you guys pay for DLC that was Gen 2, Gen 3, and so forth?

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
If the game's good.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah, if the game's good.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
I think it looks cool. I'm excited to get it for my kids because, you know, my youngest son is really small.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
He plays Super Mario Odyssey.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
He doesn't really understand everything in it and gets stuck a lot.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
But my oldest son beat Super Mario Odyssey, so...

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Nice.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I was surprised having played through the whole...

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
You know, I'm just surprised he did that.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
But like, it would be nice to have a game that they could both play together that is pretty easy to control.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
So, I'm down with that.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
bonds006 in chat says,

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
This is how Ninty and Game Freak is gonna get me to buy a Switch. Damn you, gaming god.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
That's over at live.vognetwork.com.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
You know, I'm in a group of Pokemon Go raiders and you have all sorts of different levels of gamers in there.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
And there's some people that don't really play a lot of console games.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
But some of the folks in there are talking about,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
So, how much is it to get a Switch?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Like, what other games are on the Switch?

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
So, like, if I wanted to get it for this game, what else would I be able to play?

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
You know, like, they're asking those types of questions where some people are thinking about it.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Like, especially because it has the Go functionality.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
And, like, if you're not a Pokemon Go player, one thing you need to understand,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
there are still a lot of people playing Pokemon Go.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
And I don't... At least from my perspective, there's a lot of older folks that are playing.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
When I say older, I kind of have to loop myself into that crowd because I'm also in my 40s.

29:26.000 --> 29:34.000
But I notice, like, there's definitely a crowd of, like, late 30, 40, 50-year-olds that are, like, super into Pokemon Go.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Because that's why I keep running into it all these raids.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
It's a very interesting... Like, the core audience right now for Pokemon Go is very interesting to me.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Yes, there's kids that do it too, but I think there's also...

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Like, I see a lot of parents who bring their kids.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
And then I think a lot of kids are just kind of off doing their own thing.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
They're not necessarily trying to get shiny Ho-Os and things like this.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
But, like, when it comes to the raids and the hardcore stuff, like, I notice a lot of, like, older people.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
And I think folks that are just like,

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
So, okay, well, like, if I got a Nintendo Switch, it might help me in this game.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Like, I'll consider it.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Like, it's, like, super interesting to me.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
That's the most expensive DLC I've ever heard.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I know, right? But there's people that'll do it.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Like, people are just going, like...

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
And plus... Oh, man, the best part, I don't even think I should get into it here on OLR.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
But, like, some of the drama that comes up between, like, grown-ass men and women about, like...

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
And I told that motherfucker he needs to stay off my fucking gym until I get my coins.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
And if that motherfucker knocks me off that gym before I get my fucking 50 coins,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I'm gonna go to every gym in this goddamn neighborhood and look at that motherfucker and I'm gonna knock him off.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Like, that...

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
I wish I could say I'm exaggerating a conversation that I've overheard. I am not.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Like, Pokemon Go has its own set of drama.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
But I don't want to scare people off from Pokemon Go either.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
You can stay... It's very easy to stay away from that and turn that off.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
But I'm just saying, like...

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
It's, like, you know that's, like, the equivalent, like, a dollar worth of, like...

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah, these are grown-ass men and women who fucking fight about gym control.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Mommy fainted.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
And, okay, thank you. Thank you. Chatter's backing me up.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, I believe that conversation happened.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Bonds006 says, yes, the gym battle drama gets real.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
Actf says, I have friends that are getting back into Pokemon Go because of this new game.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Yeah, that's kind of the general vibe I've been getting on Twitter, too,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
is that I've seen a lot of people that are suddenly like,

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
I'm gonna reinstall Pokemon Go and see what I've missed because I need to be prepared for this Switch game.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
You've missed a lot.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
They've been... I gotta say, the quest is something that they've done in all these different events each week.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Really helping.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
So, I mean, love it or hate it,

31:40.000 --> 31:46.000
there's no denying that Pokemon Go is, like, transforming Pokemon and therefore Nintendo.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I mean, the fact that this game is happening.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
And I gotta say, I'm super fucking excited for it.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
And all those people that...

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
I'm here for it.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Yeah, no, seriously, like, for all the people that are just like,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
oh, I hate this and stuff, think about it this way.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
You're getting all these people that are gonna be more into Pokemon.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Now this is kind of the next step to a traditional Pokemon RPG.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
So when the new Pokemon RPG comes out, that's even more people that'll play it.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I don't see how there's a downside to this.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Yeah.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Jamie, you've been a little quiet.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
I know you're not as into Pokemon Go.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
Well, you play here and there, but what are your thoughts on this whole, like, direction for Let's Go?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I was actually kind of excited.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Yeah?

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah, I mean, it's the first new Pokemon game I've been super interested in, so...

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
And even Dan, who's like, eh, Pokemon, whatever,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
he's, like, really liking that controller.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
The Pokeball controller.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Yeah, it is pretty cool.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I like how it kind of glows.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Like, it reminds me, what was that old, like, 80's cartoon,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
where when the little robot talks, it would glow?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
It's what it looks like with the little Pokeballs doing.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Mmm.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
But, I mean, the whole concept is very interesting,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
and I was even super excited.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I was like, you know, I think I found a Pokemon game that I want.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Nice.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
But I would get the Eevee one.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Well, that's fine, because I've pre-ordered Pikachu.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
Because, I don't know what it is, but every gamer I know,

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
and I don't know what it is, has pre-ordered Eevee.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
I did not realize that Eevee was, like, the unofficial, like, LGBTQ plus mascot.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Um, but...

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I just think Eevee's cuter.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Eevee is cute, but I got Pikachu because, A, I'm old school and hipster,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
and Pikachu's what got me into, like, the anime and stuff.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
No, but for real, if all these people I know are getting Eevee,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
then I'm gonna get Pikachu, so I have people to trade with.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
Because Pikachu's got some weak-ass evolutions is why I would go with, you know...

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
You know what, but he's fucking cute, so shut up.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
The first thing I'm gonna do, though, with my Eevee is make it a Flareon.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
If you can, though.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Flareon was first gen.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Oh, yeah, sorry. Flareon was gen one. Yes, sorry, sorry.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
I don't know why my brain went to, when you said Flareon,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
my brain brought up a picture of an Umbreon.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Because it's gonna be my little flame name.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Yeah.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
There you go. See, Bobby Blackwolf in chat, that's the key to a happy marriage.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Bobby Blackwolf says,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
My wife has told me she's getting Eevee. I'm getting Pikachu.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Do you like, by the way, there was no discussion there.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
It was just, my wife told me she's doing this.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
As it normally goes.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Is that right, right, Jamie? All right.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Actually, even, you know, Alan is super into Pokemon Go,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
and I think he's kind of, like, looking at this going,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
huh, huh, so is this something that'll help me, too, if you get this?

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
Or, you know, are we gonna have to get him his own Nintendo Switch?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Help me, God. All right, anyway.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
So, yeah, I'm really excited about those games.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
And then, of course, gen eight, as we mentioned, at some point next year.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
So, for those that aren't feeling this Go thing, you know,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
you can wait till next year for the RPG.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
So, you got that.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
So, anyway.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Jason, what are your thoughts on the Pokemon Let's Go?

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
When I was younger, I told myself that I would get back into Pokemon

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
when the technological sophistication is...

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
...sufficiently upgrades.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
Somehow, I told myself that was Diamond. Pokemon Diamond.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
And, yeah, it had, like, system to system,

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
the cave mechanic that I barely even remember the details to.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
But I've touched, I played maybe an hour and a half of Diamond

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
and never again.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Well, to be fair, that's, like, gen four, right?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
That's, like, the worst gen.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
I couldn't say because I just didn't really make any progress on it.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
I know Bulbasaur, Twirtle, Charizard,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Charizard, Charmander weren't the starters.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Nope.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
But, yeah, like, for, I don't even remember the logic

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
that went into that decision.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
This is significant.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
This is new.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
This is interesting.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Yeah, I sank in, I don't know how many hours,

35:37.000 --> 35:42.000
twenty-something, probably mid-twenties level of Pokemon Go.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Unaligned, thank you very much.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
I never chose a team, which probably means, like,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
the game isn't going to be available to me.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Anyways, yeah, I enjoyed Pokemon Go.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
I'm keeping an eye on this kind of stuff because it is very interesting to me.

35:55.000 --> 36:01.000
It is a very significant part of my pre-teen and teenage years,

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
but certainly kind of the formative teenage years,

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
and with all of these new features and possibilities

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
and Pokemon Company and Game Freak and everybody

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
starting to be able to actually take advantage of them.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
It looks very interesting.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
Nothing like, I think buying it is inevitable.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I'm not over the hump quite yet,

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
but it's something that I am certainly keeping an active eye on.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Yeah, there's something to be said, too,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
because you mentioned that I just remember the starters weren't

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Bulbasaur, Charmander, that whole thing,

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
but yet this is going back to a Gen 1 kind of reboot,

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
and I think maybe part of the reason for that is to get those people.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
It's just like Pokemon Go did.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Hey, remember Pikachu and Bulbasaur and all this stuff

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
you remember from when you were a kid?

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
I think there's something about that particular first generation,

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
even though I know some people are burned the fuck out on reboots

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
and all that stuff.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Folks, there are like 800 Pokemon.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Can we stop with the first 150?

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
Not to mention only being limited to 150 and not,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
oh god, there's so damn many.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
Right. So anyway, alright.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
Well, there's some thoughts on Pokemon Let's Go.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Hopefully we'll get some of your thoughts later in the show,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
either in our mailbag or, of course, there's also our Skype line

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
at Orange Lounge Radio.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
But for now, before we get into the news of the week,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
we want to get to our gaming weeks.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I bought some games.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
I haven't started them yet because Steam had a couple of things on sale.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
One of them, well, great, now my Steam is trying to update

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
so I can't look at what they are.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
And I put my receipts away.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I'll get my receipts in a second.

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
I did play, I'm starting to try to actively level in Pokemon Go again.

37:52.000 --> 37:57.000
And, of course, you know I like my idle pouring.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Okay, so the game that I bought was,

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
I bought Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines for five bucks.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
And I bought the Dark Souls Remastered

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
because it's on sale for 20 bucks right now.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
And I know I bought something else, but, oh yeah,

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
I bought Shatter based on recommendation from a couple of the listeners.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
So, we'll see if I like it.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Actually, no, I had already bought it, but someone,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I think it was Rage Nator, told me that I'd like the soundtrack,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
but it wouldn't let me buy the soundtrack for myself.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
It was really weird.

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
The Steam's DLC, I mean, for every other kind of DLC,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
it makes sense that you would have to have the base game,

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
but just because of the way that you have to have the game

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
to download the soundtrack, yeah, it's a mess.

38:38.000 --> 38:45.000
Yeah, so with that then, I was, since I had to get a new phone,

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
I went back to go finish playing the new Puzzle Bobble game.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Yeah, I have to start completely over on Puzzle Bobble,

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
and I was like on stage 80 when I quit, when I had to replace my phone.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
So, a little bit aggravated by that.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
Apparently a set of Corsos on sale for 15% off, so that's cool.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
If you like your car games.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
And Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons is on sale for $2.99.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I'm buying it right now.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
So, anyway, it's really been kind of a busy week

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
because I did just come back from DragCon before that,

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
and then all of the Bay Area stuff I've been doing.

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
Probably this month is not going to be a very great gaming time for me

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
because I have two Pride events, sorry, three Pride events.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Are you doing Sacramento Pride this coming weekend?

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
I'm doing Sacramento Pride.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
I may actually go after all. I know I said I wasn't going to go,

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
but one of my friends was like, we should go, we should go.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
And I'm like, all right.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
If we have a booth, I'll let you know.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
But, yeah, I'm doing Sacramento Pride, Rainbow Festival, and San Francisco Pride.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
So, it may be just mostly Pokemon for this month.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
That's all right.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
That's still a game.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
That's going to be me next month

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
because next month I'm going to be in rehearsals for,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
I guess I can say this now,

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
I'm going to be in Clue the movie here locally on July 28th.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Kermit flail.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Kermit flail.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
At the Colonial.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
And I think the reason why people like Jamie are taking a particular interest

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
in what's happening here, I'm going to be playing Mrs. Peacock.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
So, if you've ever seen Clue the movie, you know that Mrs. Peacock,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
like she starts the movie like she's kind of normal

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
and then she kind of goes like completely neurotic.

40:29.000 --> 40:34.000
So, I remember about 10 years ago, I saw a stage adaptation of the movie Clue.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I think it was totally bootleg and probably would have got shut down

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
if Paramount found out about it.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
But that was the first idea where it planted in my head

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
where Mrs. Peacock is like 15 times funnier as a drag queen.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
And so, I was kind of like, all right, like acting goals.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
So, here we are, July 28th, acting goals.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
I'm going to play Mrs. Peacock.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
So, I'm like actually like super excited about it.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
But now I'm realizing like, oh God, I have to shave my beard.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
I'm going to miss my beard and I have to shave lots of other stuff too.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
But thankfully, Mrs. Peacock's dress is pretty big.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
So, I won't have to go too crazy. But yeah, I'm excited about it.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
This means no tucking.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
Yeah, that's one of the big reasons.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
And let me tell you, it's a big reason. No, I'm kidding.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
It's one of the big reasons why I was willing to play a part like that

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
is because the dress is pretty conservative.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
So, I didn't have to like go like all out, you know what I mean?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
So, but it'll be fun. It's going to be a good time.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
I'm pretty handy with hot glue so I can help make a fascinator.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Not when it comes to that.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
I meant the fascinator. Her weird hat thing that she's...

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
Is it just me or we went for the topic of tucking to where Jamie goes,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I have a hot glue gun. No!

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
No, everyone knows that you use boat tape to tuck, okay?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Yes, I'm aware, yes.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Or a friend of mine uses gaff tape.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Yes, anyway.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Not duct tape.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
Hey, for someone who don't have the junks, she knows a bit about tucking, okay?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
You can, you can, you know what?

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
And if you want to hear more, there's a YouTube for it.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
There's all sorts of YouTubes for everything.

42:05.000 --> 42:10.000
So, go enlighten yourself if you are curious how that part works.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
But meanwhile, we are a video gaming podcast.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
So, I'm going to take it over to Loki for how was your gaming week?

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
This week, I played a lot of stuff on the Switch.

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
So, I finished... I don't remember if I beat Mario Odyssey this week or last week,

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
but I finished Mario Odyssey, just the regular storyline.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
So, now it's, of course, getting all the Power Moons and everything.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
So, now I have all of the Power Moons in the Sand Kingdom.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Actually, all but one.

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
One which is following this taxi around, which that's pretty super easy to get.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
So, I'm not worried about that right now.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
And then, let's see what else.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
I picked up a few games on the Switch as well.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
So, they had some sale with some of their LEGO games.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
And so, I picked those up.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
So, I've got LEGO Worlds, which my kids have been playing a lot.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
And that's kind of... Yeah, it's been a while since I played LEGO Worlds,

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
because I was in when it was in early access, when I first got released.

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
And so, I played it back when it was just being made.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
And it was very early and rough around the edges.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
Now, it's completely different. So, I'm kind of interested in it.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
It's all right.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
And of course, the LEGO Ninjago game, because that was half off as well,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
because I like the movie.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
And what else?

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
The Pokémon Quest game, I've been playing quite a bit of that.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Pokémon GO, I've been playing more of that,

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
just because they've had a lot of their stone and earth types.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
And so, I've been trying to just level up some of the ones I don't have yet.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
Fucking lack of fucking shinies is driving me crazy.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
I have not gotten a shiny anything since...

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
What was the Dragon Water one?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Dratini?

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
Dratini, yeah, since Dratini. That's the last shiny that I got.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Wow.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
And I played quite a bit. I mean, I don't know.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
I know, me too. I run my gacha a lot, and I'm just not getting my needs met.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
Yeah, so to me, I don't even know that there's shinies, because I never get them.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
And then what else?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Yeah, I think that's about it.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
I picked some stuff up on Steam. I don't remember what it was, though.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
It was just a Humble Bundle.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
So whatever that last one was, I think it was the multiplayer one.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
I think I wanted it just for this stick fight game, because that game's awesome.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
Same guy as it did, you know, the Total Epic Battle Simulator,

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
and Cluster Trucks, and stuff like that.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So I wanted to support them, and the game looks awesome.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
I watched some people play that.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
Cluster Truck is fucking fantastic.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
It is a great game.

44:43.000 --> 44:51.000
I lament not playing it more, but the fact that I've played it since its official release...

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Oh god, what was that? End of 2016 or something like that?

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Yeah, it was more like that.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
All sorts of fun.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
But yeah, I mean, I had finished everything.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
The only thing I don't have on that is I haven't played the PC version enough to where I've gotten...

45:03.000 --> 45:10.000
They had Halloween special levels and stuff like that that I wanted to try out, and I don't have those yet.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
So I had to play through that.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
And then I did play a little bit more Bloodstained Curse of the Moon,

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
and I think that was it.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
It was mostly Switch stuff, just because it's very convenient to play that, especially after my kids go to bed,

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
because I just pop it off the dock and away I go.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
So that's been my week.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
Alright, Jason, you want to tell us about your gaming week?

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
I have been eyeballing the Switch for a while.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
I was in San Diego in, well, April now.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
It's June, so not last month.

45:44.000 --> 45:51.000
I was in San Diego in April, and on the way back, visited a friend of mine in Arizona that had one,

45:51.000 --> 46:04.000
and beat the entirety of Odyssey with a modicum of Power Moon chasing, finding, puzzling.

46:04.000 --> 46:10.000
I beat the entirety of the story, kind of rushed it towards the end, but I legitimately beat that game.

46:10.000 --> 46:16.000
And as I expected, everything about the Switch's design is phenomenal.

46:16.000 --> 46:22.000
You see the underpinnings of what the Wii and the Wii U brought,

46:22.000 --> 46:28.000
and they turned it into such a great presentation package.

46:28.000 --> 46:35.000
So many things that they're doing with Labo and other accessories,

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
and all of the wireless capability of the Switch is phenomenal.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
All of this I'm putting together to say, I own a Switch!

46:43.000 --> 46:49.000
So, my gaming week has been playing Odyssey on my own system,

46:49.000 --> 46:57.000
over again doing a lot more Power Moon hunting, and that's the only retail title I owned.

46:57.000 --> 47:05.000
I've been a fan of 2020 Super Baseball since it's existed, both in arcade and on the SNES,

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
and seeing that on the store, I picked that up immediately.

47:09.000 --> 47:15.000
I touched on Pokemon Quest just to see how it played, get a feel for those mechanics.

47:15.000 --> 47:22.000
It was kind of interesting, yeah, but getting most of the way through Odyssey again,

47:22.000 --> 47:33.000
a little bit of downtime, my brain is wiped from the 48 hours of driving that I've been doing.

47:33.000 --> 47:42.000
Working mostly in Odyssey and Downtime, I actually read Ready Player One.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
That's gaming related. I hadn't read that back in the day.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Did you see the movie already?

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Yes, I caught the movie.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It's completely separate.

47:51.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, it is, but I think thematically, with the intent of the base ideas that went into the book,

48:06.000 --> 48:14.000
they took the important bits and then made, not better references, certainly different references,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
more modern references than the movie.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
I enjoyed the movie and I read the entire book, and that was great.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
Gaming Week has been reading Ready Player One, catching up on Odyssey,

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
a little bit of dabbling of some other stuff, some other random stuff on the store,

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
and I think that's pretty much it.

48:37.000 --> 48:44.000
Because I'm not on a weekly basis, I have been playing Borderlands with two friends of mine

48:44.000 --> 48:51.000
for quite a few months now, once a week on Sundays every week when I'm not traveling,

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
and I have officially beaten Borderlands 2 for the first time all the way through, finally.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Nice.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
And so we started, we were kind of back and forth between the DLC and the pre-sequel and all that kind of stuff.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
We'll get to it eventually, but we're actually doing True Vault Hunter mode,

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
which, because I had never beaten, I never did that either,

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
so seeing mostly the name renames more than anything else,

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
but even some of the quirks of making armored racks and armored psychos

49:19.000 --> 49:26.000
and a lot of those things even worse and even harder and more frustrating to deal with has been really interesting.

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
So Borderlands 2 for the past couple weeks with some friends of mine,

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
and yeah, fill in time where possible and when not traveling.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
Alright, well that's fun. Borderlands Friends, that's a nice little weekly thing to do.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
I need to play through the pre-sequel still. I'm hoping for three this year.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Yup, yup. I'm hoping for three.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
I think that's a pretty safe bet that that'll happen, but we'll see.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
Anyway, my Game of the Week, I'll try to keep it fast since we've had a lot of Game of the Weeks,

49:52.000 --> 49:58.000
but I've been playing more Pokémon GO. I got my Latias so I can calm down about having my Pokédex very filled,

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
although one of my friends is visiting Texas right now, so he just sent me a picture.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
He just caught a Corrosola, so I'm a little jealous. These region locked stupid Pokémon,

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
but oh well, one of these days I'll catch some region locks of my own.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
Let's see, I've also been playing on the Switch. I also was playing Pokémon Quest a little bit.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
I've been continuing in Hyrule Warriors, which I think I was playing after the show last week,

50:20.000 --> 50:25.000
and still having a good time playing that, but all these other games that are coming out that are getting my attention,

50:25.000 --> 50:31.000
including, I finally got my code on the Switch so I could play Bloodstained Curse of the Moon on the Switch,

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
so I actually did a stream of that for probably a good hour, hour and a half earlier this week,

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
and I played through like, I don't know, six or seven levels.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
I got all the way to the boss with the, that's kind of like the succubus girl that has little umbrellas,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
like that was the last thing I beat.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Yeah, so I was trying to explain it to my kids.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Why is there bathtub red? I'm like, it's blood.

50:50.000 --> 50:56.000
Because it's full of heart candy, you know, I don't know, you just have to kind of, yeah.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
So anyway, I like, you know, especially, it's funny because as I was playing through the stream,

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
I was like, you know, oh my god, this is just like Castlevania, this is just like Castlevania,

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
like these monsters are just like Castlevania.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Exactly, yeah.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
I do like those like small little subtle things that they change, like the different candle colors,

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
so you know if it has a weapon in it type of thing.

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
I really like the character switching mechanic, like the old dude that's an alchemist,

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
like some of his attacks are badass, like that ice thing saved my ass, I don't know how many times.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
So, and I remember there's even one of these boss fights I was doing.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Oh yeah, it was the painting, the painting that fucking like ate one of my characters.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
I was like, what the fuck? The painting just like one shot at me.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
So I was like, fuck this, so I played the old guy and I just shot it with an ice beam,

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
and then just walked up to him and went, beep, with the little rod and the painting shattered.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
I was like, well that made it easy.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
So anyway, I like that variance between the different characters and thought that that was really cool.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
And I've been playing on the simple mode, I've been playing in casual mode,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
or sometimes as we call it here on the show, Bobby Black Wolf mode.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
It's not, there's nothing wrong with it, it's just you have infinite continuous, so what?

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Exactly, so what? It's still the same thing.

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
It's funny because I haven't played this game yet, I bought it and I'm going to play it after the show,

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
and it's called Just Shapes and Beats, which is a game that Jason referenced in the introduction there.

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
Just Shapes and Beats has been shown at conventions for like years and years now,

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
and I remember like the Mortal Kombat theme was always like a song.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
Did the Mortal Kombat theme even make the final game? I don't think it did.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
I don't think so.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I think it's just like, yeah, I think it's just like other bit tunes.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I guess Bobby would know because he's been playing.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
It sure was a highlight, yeah.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Well because everybody knows that song.

52:30.000 --> 52:37.000
If not all three PAX outs that I've been to 2016, 2017, 2018, it was absolutely 2017 and 18,

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
and when you get kind of towards the middle of the show floor, test your mind.

52:47.000 --> 52:54.000
And so I saw it at MAGFest, I think both times I was at MAGFest I saw it, so kind of a similar thing really.

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
I mean, I make fun of it, but you know, hats off to them for putting something, for being able to get it together,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
and consistently having a crowd and getting it out the door.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
Well anyway, the thing with that game, Just Shapes and Beats, I noticed because I haven't played it yet,

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
but I went through to configure the options just to make sure that when I broadcast it after the show tonight,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
because Bobby and I are going to do a co-stream after the show tonight,

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
I want to make sure that when I broadcast it, it's going to look fine.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
So I was going through different options, and I noticed one of them was about a casual mode,

53:20.000 --> 53:26.000
and it said something about, in this mode you have two times more health to help you basically get through the story mode and stuff,

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
and it said something like, there's no judgment in playing this mode, just have a good time with a little heart emoji,

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
and I thought that was really funny, so I like that they did that.

53:33.000 --> 53:40.000
Anything that talks about a casual mode will always remind me of my Devil May Cry 3,

53:40.000 --> 53:46.000
that I was just horrendously terrible at it, so much so that I unlocked easy mode,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
and I turned off the game and never played it again.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
You know what, there's so many people that will go to the park and play basketball on casual mode,

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
or play baseball on casual mode, so you know what, sometimes you're going to play a video game on casual mode.

53:57.000 --> 54:03.000
And that's also why basketball was created, because they could just land shots all day if they just didn't have to run around all the time.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Oh my god, alright.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
Is it the 90s yet? Have we traveled back yet?

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Dated reference.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
Bonds006 in chat says, I own the term filthy casual, I play all my games on casual.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Hey, no shame in that.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
Well, my thought with Bloodstained 2 is that knowing it's like an 8-bit version, I'm like, it's not going to be that long of a game,

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
so once I play through it on casual and I beat it on casual, if I like it enough, then I'll go through and play it on normal now.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
And it's like, okay, now I'll kind of know what to expect, and I think I'm actually kind of glad I did it that way,

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
because there are things like the branching paths and the upgrades,

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
and there are things where I'm like, okay, I'm glad I kind of know this in advance of playing it on normal mode.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
I think that will help.

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
So, anyway, that's enough for my gaming week and what I have been playing this week.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
By the way, though, it did come to my memory this week.

54:49.000 --> 54:54.000
I recalled that we had talked about a Minecraft Realms for VoG.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
We got distracted with all this other stuff.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Oh yes, I have not forgotten.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
So that is something that I want us to hopefully get underway this week,

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
so stay tuned to our Discord for all the details over at vognetwork.com slash Discord,

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
and once we have something up and running, I'll be sure to post more information there,

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
but that is something I'd like us to do this summer for all the Minecraft players.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Are we going to do survival or creative?

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
I think we're going to do survival so that there is actually a game.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I won't play then.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Oh, but it'll be easy survival.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
But I don't like survival mode at all.

55:24.000 --> 55:32.000
All right, well, creative is just, I mean, there's no reason we can't have two realms,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
but if I'm paying for it, I'm going to pay for the survival realm.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I'll just play by myself.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
All right.

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
Yeah, I think just with creative, it's cool because it's art on a canvas,

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
but I don't think there's as much.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
And I think when you did yours, yours was on creative, right?

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
It started off survival, and then we just went creative

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
because we were going to do a lot more stuff in there.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
Bobby Blacko says, is there a survival peaceful where there's survival mode,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
but there's no creepers?

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
We'll look into that.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Yes, you can do that.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah, because creepers are fucking annoying anyway.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Just no creepers specifically or is that PvP?

56:11.000 --> 56:17.000
I think you can turn PvP on and off, but I think there's a mode where it's still like,

56:17.000 --> 56:22.000
the thing is though, in crafting mode, you have access to anything when you want.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
Peaceful though, I don't remember if there's animals though with peaceful.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
I don't remember.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
We'll look into it. We'll figure it out.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
Creepers aren't that bad. You'll just get used to not having to deal with it.

56:33.000 --> 56:40.000
You can turn off creeper, I think where you can turn it off where the explosions don't break anything.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
They just hurt you.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Yeah, that's the annoying part.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
I think you can turn that off, I think.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
We'll look into it this week.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
Alright, anyhow, that is enough though for our gaming weeks.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
As far as announcements go, next week will be a little bit of a shorter slash different show

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
because E3 is going to start on Saturday and run through,

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
let's see, we have preferences on Sunday and then Monday,

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
and then the actual show starts Tuesday as well as the last press conference,

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
or in this case Nintendo Direct, is Tuesday morning.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
So there will be lots and lots coming through E3,

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
but we'll kind of be in the midst of that when we do our show next week.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
In two weeks, we will be celebrating 16 years of Orange Lawns Radio.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
This show is old enough to drive right off a cliff.

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
That is where we're at with 16 years of Orange Lawns Radio.

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
And then we will be off the week of the 24th.

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
It's a good thing that this show ends in the 9 o'clock hour Pacific

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
because when you're 16 on your provisional license, you can't drive after 10.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Oh, is that true?

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Depends on where you are.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Yeah, it depends on where you are.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Is that not US-wide by now?

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
That's not US-wide.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
Well, keep in mind, in Mississippi, permit age is 14.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
Yeah.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Oh, wow.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
You get your license when you're 15,

57:56.000 --> 58:01.000
but I don't think it's required yet to have driver's ed to get it at 15.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
They've changed a lot in California.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
I think even when you have your license, like 16, 17, 18,

58:07.000 --> 58:12.000
you can't have other kids in the car or something weird.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
They have some really weird lawyer.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Yeah, those are the same rules.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
At least for me, when I had my provisional license,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
because I'm the youngest one in the room,

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
for me, when I went through the driver's license process growing up in New Mexico,

58:25.000 --> 58:30.000
obviously, with your permit, you had to have an adult, a parent.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I think it was any adult, not just a parent.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
But with a provisional license, you could not drive after 10 before 6

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
with more than one other friend.

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
All of these can be overridden with a parent in the car.

58:43.000 --> 58:48.000
And I think the only other requirement is that you're supposed to have,

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
like, 50 hours of driving by the time you get your actual license.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
I remember getting pulled over at 2 in the morning once when I was 16,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
but I had legit, because my dad worked for the railroad,

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
so he was on call 24 hours a day.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
I had legit taken my dad to work at 1 in the morning

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
so I could use the car on the weekend for something else.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I got pulled over, and I was by myself,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
and I think the cop was more concerned with, like,

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
what the hell is he doing out at 2 in the morning by himself?

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Give me your fake ID.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah, right?

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Just take it with you.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Anyway, no, they didn't have quite those same rules when I was 16.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Anyway, all right.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, magazine.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Uh, let's move on.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Let's talk about news.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
We got gaming news to get to, starting with Loki.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Let's get into news.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Do we have news? Okay.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
A few things.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
I guess we'll get to that, finally.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
So, we talked about how PUBG was kind of a little upset

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
that there was this competitor, Fortnite,

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
that was, you know, coming out

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
and just kind of taking over the market

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
that they had kind of built up a little bit

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
with the whole battle royale genre.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And, you know, their complaints before were like,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
well, hey, they're ripping us off

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
because, you know, this uses a frying pan in this game,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
and actually, I think this lawsuit was similar.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
They were doing it against mobile games as well,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
like some mobile knockoffs saying that,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
oh, yeah, they use a frying pan.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
They use the phrase, you know, winner, winner, chicken dinner

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
or some other bullshit like that,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and basically the whole concept of the battle royale gameplay.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Well, now they have strangely enough decided

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
that they're going to sue Epic Games over Fortnite.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Just to put some things in perspective,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I'm looking at Twitch right now, the rankings live on Twitch.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
So, Fortnite is currently the number two ranked game on Twitch

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
with 224,149 viewers.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
IRL is number one right now.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I don't know what's going on IRL, but yeah.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Fortnite is number two, and then Player Unknown Battlegrounds,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
which used to be, like I would see it number one all the time, number 15.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
That is on my phone right now looking at the Twitch app.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So, I mean, their main complaint is that, you know, one,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
that it's unfair because they were licensing the, you know,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Epic's game engine to basically build their game,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
and because they were using the Unreal Engine,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
they felt that, oh, because they were familiar with our game,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
so they just straight up copied it,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
and now they're profiting off of this thing that we came up with.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I don't know. To me, it seems kind of ridiculous,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
but let them try, I guess.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
They are suing them, though, in Korea,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
which is kind of interesting that they're not doing that in the US.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I'm wondering maybe if their laws are a little bit different there,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
or what's going to count as, you know, copyright or whatever.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
But, yeah, so that's something that they're doing,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
and what's kind of weird, though, about that is, like, okay,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
you're suing the company that you're using their game engine.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I mean, you don't think that there's going to be any sort of negative consequence

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
to doing something like that.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I mean, that doesn't seem like a very smart thing to do,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
but they're going to try, and I think they're going to fail,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
but they're going to try, and we'll see what happens,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
but ultimately they're probably going to fail.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah, I don't really see it. Well, this lawsuit is not in America.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It's not. It's in Korea.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And it's just such a stretch. Like, I get it, the gameplay is similar,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
but then that's kind of going back way, way back, like,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Street Fighter clones, Doom clones.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
First off, you didn't invent the battle royale genre, one.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I mean, there were games that were out way before PUBG

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
that were basically the same type of game.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And the Romans existed.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Yes. Right.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
You know, like, H1Z1, King of the Kill, very similar gameplay.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And honestly, I think that would be the defense's angle right there,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
is that you didn't invent it either. Done.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Using a frying pan as a weapon in the game, not iconic to your game.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Yang did that in Final Fantasy IV, thank you, thanks to his wife.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Princess Peach did it in Super Mario RPG.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And it's been used in books.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
There you go.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I'm sorry, am I the only one that read Dragonlance?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And it's been used in the kitchen.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Exactly.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And on top of that, a lot of the assets that are used in PUBG

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
are straight out of the Unreal store.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Like, there's not really a cohesive style to the game,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
whereas Fortnite has this unique art style, unique gameplay,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
there's the whole building portion of that.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's very different.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It seems like such a stretch to try to...

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The goal of seeing that their game copied yours

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
just because their game is doing better than yours right now.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Thank you, Ninja.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
You know what? Karma's gonna come up.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It's gonna catch up to you.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And it's gonna bite you in the ass, especially when it's the company

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
that you're licensing their fucking game.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I know, I was gonna say, I am really surprised

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
that we have not seen Epic make a move where it's like,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
you know what, due to ongoing litigation,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
we have to suspend your license because of this litigation.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I'm really surprised Epic hasn't made a move like that yet.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Maybe it's coming.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Maybe that's something they could subtly do during E3

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
and it might get lost with all the other news going on,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
but we'll see.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But, I mean...

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I mean, the PUBG fans would certainly notice

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
and make a fuss about it.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
We'll see.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I'm just curious to see what will happen,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
but I just think that you gotta...

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
It's not a direct clone.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
It's not like we're seeing like,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
oh, look at this, this is a mobile game

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
that looks like it's PUBG.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It's just something different.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
They're calling it something different

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
and copying the unique style of the game,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
but this game is very general and kind of bland looking

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and that's to its detriment, unfortunately.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Yeah.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So, we'll see.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Speaking of Fortnite,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
there's rumors that it's coming to the Switch,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
and this is from a couple different sources,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
one being that there is this document posted on 4chan,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
so take that as you will,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
but allegedly it's like a leaked...

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I'm bringing in the truck full of salt.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
A leaked...

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:07.000
It's allegedly a leaked piece of material from E3

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
and advertising materials, something like that,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
talking about games coming out to the Switch.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
However, there is also a second source, though,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
which is the Korean ratings board

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
that mentions it on the Switch,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
so maybe that's a little bit more legit,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
but we'll see.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
It wouldn't be a big jump to say that it's coming to the Switch.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I would imagine that that would do well there.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
So, we'll have to wait and see what happens.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Only a couple weeks.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
All right.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Yeah, I'm pretty...

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Do you think it's...

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I think it's absolutely happening.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I think it's legit.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Yeah.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I don't see why not.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
All right.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Yeah, Dark Tetsuya says,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
normally I wouldn't put a lot of stock in that rumor,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
but the Korean rating board thing is interesting.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Well, also, if you think about Nintendo,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
it's a good way to sell that,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
hey, multiplayer pass.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Oh, good point.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Good point.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Nintendo is trying to load up

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
on all the stuff that's multiplayer online.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Although, games go on PC and play it for free,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
but, you know...

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And you can't stream Fortnite as easily from the Switch.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I mean, well, I mean, if you have a card like I do,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
it's super easy, but, you know,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
not as built in.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Anyway.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
All right, well, over on the Microsoft side of things,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Microsoft taking a little heat this week

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
because they have laid off Xbox support staff,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
and the new plan for folks that need Xbox support

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
used volunteers from the Xbox Ambassadors program.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Now, well, before you go too crazy with this,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
it's not like they closed their whole call center

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
or anything like this.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Here's what actually happened.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Microsoft let go of 12 people from the Xbox support teams.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It's not like the entire existence of their support staff.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
But, I mean, it's still worth noting,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
like, they let paid people go

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
to basically have volunteers do what they were doing.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It sounds like a lot of these folks

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
were inquiries that went to Twitter.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It's like, you know how Xbox has a pretty active Twitter account

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
that will help people that are complaining about different things?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It sounds like a lot of the staff came from this area.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So Xbox Ambassadors now will be the ones

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
that will be able to help.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
They will earn points and get entered into competitions

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
for a chance to win prizes.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So, apparently, too, just to put salt in the wound, I guess,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Microsoft asked the staff,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
the staff that they ended up letting go,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
to train Xbox Ambassadors and increase their input,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
which is always a little bit of a red flag.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I mean, sometimes, you know, cross training is inevitable

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
no matter what industry you do.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But sometimes if it's like, wow,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I'm showing every function of my job to somebody else,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
that may not always be the best sign.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Every case is different, I suppose,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
but certainly that was probably the first sign

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
that something's up there.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Anyway, Microsoft, of course, is not specifically responding

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
on anything about the layoffs specifically,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
but in an interview that they did with the big gaming website,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
they said that we continue to have a number

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
of highly trained customer support agents

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
plus community ambassadors available to help customers

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
with their needs.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
It's never good to skimp on your communication anywhere,

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
but I feel like Twitter, being such a first line,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
is an especially bad place to get rid of

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
full-time, compensated, you know, talented individuals

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and open it up to any aspect of community management.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Maybe. I don't know.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
That particular role strikes me as a little...

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
That particular medium for the role strikes me

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
as a little strange.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Bobby and Chad confirming they had an active Twitter account,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
they've stopped responding pretty much altogether,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
so it sounds like pretty much anybody who was using that Twitter

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
was probably part of this.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
So, you know, that's unfortunate for those guys.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
What? Who messes with tweets to one account doesn't scale?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm surprised.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
But...

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Well, I mean, I kind of thought Microsoft

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
would have learned this lesson before

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
about what happens when you dial back on community engagement.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You get something like the Xbox One unveiling.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Now, granted, I realize this is a different scenario

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
because we're talking a little more like support and help,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
but still, like, I'm a little surprised to hear

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
that Microsoft wants to cut corners

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
because I feel like that has not benefited them in the past.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
But no one plays games anymore.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Everyone's watching TV and sports and sports

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and TV and TV TV.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Well, I mean, but if they can't...

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Here's the thing, though.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
If people can't figure out how to fix their Xboxes

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
and they're complaining about it on Twitter

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and nobody is, like, actively helping them,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
then they're going to continue to complain to their friends

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
and the other people they follow on Twitter.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I mean, I just always felt like

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
when Microsoft is, like, actively seeking out

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
the people having problems with Xbox stuff

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
and they're replying to them,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
they're trying to cut these issues off

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
before they grow and they escalate

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
and they turn into,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
now I'm going to tell all my friends about

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
how shitty, you know, Microsoft is, you know?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I don't know.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
At the end of the day,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
will this have a gigantic impact on things?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I don't know, but, hmm.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So, anyhow, Bobby is also kind of saying, like,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
they had several Twitter accounts,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
like Xbox Support One and Two,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
but basically they replaced those accounts

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
with ambassadors' personal accounts

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
that use the hashtag, hashtag XboxAmbassadors.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Wow.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Rageinator says, I'll help you right now.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Did you try turning your system off

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and then not back on again?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Oh, that should just be,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
there should be a Twitter robot.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
How many flashing lights do you see?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Oh, my God, this would be a genius Twitter robot.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
You ready?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Whenever somebody writes a complaint to Xbox Support,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
it just automatically replies,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
have you tried turning it off and then on again?

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Hashtag XboxAmbassadors.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Hashtag XboxIp.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I think that's funny.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I think that's hilarious.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Hashtag the XboxCrowd, the XCrowd.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Let's see.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
SS2100Matt says, they were pretty hush-hush

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
about that hacking problem you had back in the day, Rob.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
That was before,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
the hacking problem was before their Twitter.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
The 990 gig thing that came up,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I think they did try to reach out to me on Twitter,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
but they, like, couldn't help me.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
They couldn't figure it out.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
They, like, couldn't help me.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
They couldn't figure out what the hell the problem was.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
So it was weird.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Yeah, they didn't really want to, like, admit anything.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
So it was kind of weird there.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Anyway.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So that's something that's happening.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
So, you know, if you have strong feelings about that,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I suppose you could tweet Microsoft,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
but I'm not sure it's going to change anything.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So just hopefully this doesn't lead to a series of more bad decisions.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
If you tweet at a support account and nobody's there to read it,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
did you really say anything at all?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Maybe I'll send that tweet right now to Xbox support.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I'm surprised that we're not having Cortana field these tech questions.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Make sure to hashtag your question.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
That could be the robot.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That could be the robot.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But instead of, like, Cortana, it's like,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
God, what is that web series with Donard Duck and,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
you know what I'm talking about, Darcy.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
The Rupaz drag rez.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Like, all the, like, gooby is based off, like, a Disney thing with gooby

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
and Donard Duck and stuff.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Oh, yeah.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Right, okay.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Somebody knows what I'm talking about.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Or Miss Effect.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Yeah, yes.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Like, that whole thing, yes.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
There should be, like, a core Cortana or something.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Core Ann.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Core Ann.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Perfect.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Core Ann is the boss.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Is the boss that just replies to everybody going,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
have you tried turning it off and then on again?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Yeah.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Core Ann.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And the Avatar is just a picture of Courtney Cox from Friends,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
but, like, dyed blue.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
We live in the modern age of the internet where that is something

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
that could be possible.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
That's it.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Gooby Dolan.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Dolan, Dolan, that was it.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Thank you, Act F.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You win.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
You know what I'm talking about.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
All right.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Sorry, I'm in love with this idea.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Like, does anyone know how to program a Twitter bot?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Like, Bobby, I know there's so much work to be done at Vodka Network,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
but do you know how to make a Twitter bot?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Jason, do you know how to make a Twitter bot?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I could look something up.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
This is Gaming Adjacent, so.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
We need Core Ann to happen.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Gaming Adjacent.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
All right.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Meanwhile, let's get into some other stories.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Dark Saga.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Oh, this one made me angry and then made my heart warm.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
So, there is a streamer who goes by Ann Munition.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:28.000
She plays some of the war games like, was it Rainbow Six

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
and a few of the other ones like that, PUBG, God of War, Overwatch.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
She was playing Rainbow Six offline with a bunch of guys,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
and then they didn't know who she was, and she was a pretty big streamer.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So, when they asked if she was a woman, she said yes.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And the moment she confirmed it,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
they laid into her with some really hateful shit,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
like calling her, you know, you try to use gamer girl like it's an insult,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
and then called her, and this is a quote

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
because I would never use this term, a tranny bitch.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And then said, we're not treating you like this,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
we're not being like this because we don't like women,

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
we're being like this because you're shit.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And the same person telling her, I hope you die.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And all she did the whole stream was just play the game,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
play square, called the shots when they need it,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
when she would do well, they said she was kill stealing,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
and then when she died, they would just fuss at her for it.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
So she saved the whole thing and uploaded it.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Uploaded, made it public, called them all the fuck out.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And one of the players went back and said,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I'm extremely sorry for the way you feel.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Which is number one, the bullshit, I'm sorry you feel that way.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
No, it should have been, I'm sorry for being human garbage.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And he said, you know the words I use,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
we're meaningless and have no substance.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
And her response was, I appreciate that you wanted to apologize,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
but man, you went hard just because you heard a woman's voice.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You called me a fucking tranny bitch and told me to kill myself over nothing.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
All I did was exist.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And she's like, and I'm going to read this quote here,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I don't necessarily want to crucify people.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
When I feel there's a potential for them to walk away from the subject thinking,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
wow, I messed up.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I did something really awful and it came back to bite me, I won't do it again.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000
But, and she's basically like, yeah, there's consequences for this.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Which actually, I am super inspired by this,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
to the point that I want to go out and play these games,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
and catch people in the act, and go public with their names.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I just, this kind of begs the question, like why, I don't know what platform she's,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I mean if she's playing these on PC, then unfortunately the downside of PC

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
is a little bit more of a no man's land.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
There's no moderation is my point.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I'm not saying it makes it right, I'm absolutely not saying that,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I'm just saying it's harder to moderate.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
But if she's playing these games on Xbox Live, or PlayStation Network,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
or Nintendo, you know, which these games aren't.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Rainbow Six on Nintendo, please.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
They can't do that.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
No, she's playing on PC it looks like.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
But my point is, Nintendo would have the same responsibility no matter what.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Okay, then sadly, you know, because my question...

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
But those games themselves, their rooms should be moderated.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
That's true, the game makers should be doing something,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
because somebody is kind of hosting those servers.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
My, I guess my question at the end of the day is like,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
why aren't these fuckers getting banned, or dealt with, you know,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
because like, look, I've had my share of completely unpleasant matches in Overwatch,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and I just play Quick Play for fuck's sake.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And I've seen people be really fucking mean in Overwatch.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And it's like, and it is PC, so Blizzard thankfully has, you know,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
they've committed to trying to do some better stuff.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
But they're saying it's taking away from the development of future stuff,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
like they're having to deviate, I know that's kind of where my head is at.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Hire more people.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Yeah, right.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Be less shitty.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Don't outsource to Xbox ambassadors.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Oh no, we'll get less, we'll get less, you know, Overwatch skins.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
The whole thing, to go back to the point, is,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and she also goes on record saying,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I'm sick of sweeping this behavior under the rug and pretending it's all fine and dandy.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
It's easy to sweep things under the rug, it's harder to ask people to be better.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Especially when so many people are just resigned to accept the fact that

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
online gaming and toxicity goes hand in hand.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
To go back to what you were saying about playing on PC.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It shouldn't go hand in hand.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And honestly enough, I want to hold these people accountable.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I want to fucking hold them responsible.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I want people to know that these people are garbage.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And if you see these tags, ostracize them.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Let me ask this tough question though,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:50.000
as much like I get that from an immediate, I feel like some justice has been done in this scenario,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
but at the end of the day, what does that really change for those people?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
These people need to lose their privilege of being able to play the game online.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And unfortunately, you can't do that.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
At the very least, just like we had that one person go back and say,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I'm sorry that I was that way.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Well, he clearly got some shit over it.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Or he probably wouldn't have apologized.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
People like that don't apologize until they're fucking caught.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And when they're caught, like all these, you know, asshole men who are being accused of harassment,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
and they're like, oh, I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yeah, you got caught, bitch.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
More of them need to get caught and made a public example of.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I just don't understand why, like I get it.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
You don't understand because it doesn't happen to you.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Okay, let's not do this.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Let's not.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
You didn't let him finish his thought, to be fair.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Yeah, well, I get interrupted all the time.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
All right, finish your thought, Logie.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
No, what I understand is like, I get it, there's dicks out there online.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I mean, but there's also functions to mute them as well.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And I get it, yeah, maybe one gender gets it more than the other,

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
but you can also just mute them and block them and then that's the end of that.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
You shouldn't have to, especially when you are playing a cooperative game

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
and you need to fucking hear what the other people are doing,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
or else it's not a very cooperative game.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Yeah, I got to agree with that.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
In a co-op sense, like when you're muting somebody, it's harming the game

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
because maybe the other team isn't having garbage.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Here's my thing.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Here's what I honestly think needs to happen is what the decent individuals,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and I think, you know, the men in this room would consider themselves decent individuals.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Yes, they're all decent.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I think many of the men listening are very decent individuals and so forth.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So here's my thing is that the other thing that kind of blows my mind in this scenario

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
that happened with this gal that was playing online is that when these comments were made,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
nobody said anything there and then.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And I'm not saying she has to always be the one to do it.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Why didn't any of the other bros say, dude, not cool, it's 2018, grow the fuck up.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Because they are equally garbage.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Or chicken shit, you know.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And that's my thing is that I think it's up to the other people.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
It's just like, you know, when we talk about some of these greater complications in society,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:05.000
you know, so forth, usually it takes that person in the position of privilege, so to speak, to call out.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Because the unfortunate thing is it doesn't always happen when the oppressed is calling out.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
It takes the person from the position of privilege to say, hey, wait a minute, this shit needs to stop.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000
In order for change to like for people to kind of, you know, the oppressor to stop and think about what they're doing.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Does that make sense?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:28.000
But anyone who is so weak willed as to go along with it is part of the problem.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:35.000
They are equally, they are complicit in this behavior, even if they sat there and quietly said nothing.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Now, she was taking the high road because she was the one being targeted.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000
She kept, and I think it was because, you know, she was recording this too publicly out them.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
She had to be the one to play it straight.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And kudos to her for calling it out, for making it public.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Because we need more people to stand up and make it public and hold these people accountable.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I have to admit, though, you know, I'm looking at Bobby in our chat room.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I'm quoting him a lot tonight, but he's saying some good stuff.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And honestly, I have to be honest, I'm in a similar place to where Bobby's at because something that Bobby says,

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
that's why I never play online.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I have better things to do in my time rather than be in a place with people being assholes.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
My time is more valuable than that.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I have to kind of agree.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
That's why I don't play a lot of these games online.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000
But also taking yourself out of that situation doesn't help alleviate it either.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
It contributes again to the problem because they're pushing out the people who are talking against them

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
who aren't willing to take a stand.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Yeah, but I sort of feel like I don't want to jump in this garbage pool in the first place.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
This is part of the reason why I don't like to go on Xbox Live with non-friends.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I kind of feel like, you know, Microsoft kind of needs to moderate this.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
The people that are interested, maybe if that gets better, maybe I'll consider going in in the future.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
But otherwise, it's a waste of my time.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Look at it in terms of history.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Let's say that it's in the 60s during the protests against Vietnam.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
A lot of people said, I don't want to be involved in this.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Okay, hold up though. Hold up though.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I know where you're going with this thought.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
So I'm just going to say, does this mean you're going to start playing Rainbow Six online?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I might.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I will be very interested to see if you stick with that.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I have to put my money where my mouth is.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I mean, I have to practice a little bit and actually be good enough to play online.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
But I mean, if that's what it comes to, I would do it.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You know, that's why I'm an activist and other things that are important to me.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
You can't just...

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It's...

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Real heart, what is it?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
The true evil is when good men do nothing.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
That's the quote.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
So if you do nothing, it's going to persist.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
If you want things to change, if you don't like how something is,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
you have to get in the middle of it and you have to fucking make it change.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Nothing changes until you make it change.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Even if you die without seeing the change,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
you got in there and made the fight, and that means that the next generation to pick it up

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
is going to take up where you left off.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's why, I mean, if we want to look...

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I know it's just a game, you know, playing games online,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
but look at it in the higher context.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
You know, if you're willing to take a step out for this,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
you know, an easy thing,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
what's to say that there won't be a bigger, you know,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
that when it comes time for a bigger stand,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
that the same behavior might not happen

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
because it's easier to just take yourself out of the equation.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
We have some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Shehulk says, I've met a lot of cool people online playing games,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
but every once in a while a person cheats or is a loser.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I block them forever.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
ActDeft in chat says, and people complain.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Splatoon 2 not having proper voice chat.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
To be fair, ActDeft, like, I think when that topic has come up,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I think there is certainly some complaining in that regard,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
but then there's also that whole, like,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
well, if it was there, would I use it anyway?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I don't know.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And then Bonds006 says, I want to play Dark Sakura.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Team OLR on RB6.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So, hey, you might have some good dudes.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
That means I have to actually buy the game.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Or it doesn't necessarily have to be that game.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Believe me, there's lots of toxic games out there.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
There's other games that I can play that I'd be good at.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Don't you already own Overwatch?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
It makes me motion sick.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Fortnite. It's third person.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I could do Fortnite.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
That might be a great place to start.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
But Fortnite's a good candidate too.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I'll do Fortnite. No problem.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I bet there's a lot of people that would love to play Fortnite with you.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I just, you know...

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
It's...

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Oh, God. I'm just...

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
It's something that's very... Activism itself...

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I get it, girl. Let it out.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
...is very near and dear to my heart. Sure.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And when I see people not willing to fix something,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
but they're willing to complain about it,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
you can't complain about shit

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
if you're not going to fucking do something about it.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
It's like voting.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
If you don't vote, you have no right to complain.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I just, I think in this particular case,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
it's more complicated than that, because from my perspective,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Jamie, you're saying you need to play this game

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
that you have no interest in playing.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
It's not the no interest in playing thing.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
It's people play the games,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
but they don't put themselves in that environment.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And I can understand keeping yourself out of something

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
if you just don't enjoy it.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But the fact of the matter is that

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
when you know that there's a group out there

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
who wants to enjoy the game online in that capacity,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
and you could be in a position to help them enjoy that game,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
why aren't you helping?

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I would say, though, in some cases,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
especially MMOs are the thing that's near and dear to me,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
and I have been the type to, you know,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I kind of give it back to them in MMOs,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
because my character's a sassy little lala

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
that when somebody mouths off, I mouth her off back to them.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I do it in WoW.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
When I'm playing WoW and I have a piece of shit

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
in one of my parties, I vote kick them.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
So there are places.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And I post screenshots.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
But I think just when it comes to stuff like this Rainbow Six

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
and all this stuff, it's like, that's just a pool

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I am not interested in jumping in.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
And I would just hope that maybe some of the dudes in there,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
because there probably are a lot of decent dudes

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
that are playing Rainbow Six,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
can kind of be the ones to start that change.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Because there are so many games out there,

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
and the industry is so huge,

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
that change is going to have to come from multiple angles anyway.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I totally am planning on going ahead

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
and hopping in on games that I like.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And I'm going to stream them,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and I'm not going to tell them I'm streaming them.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Because why do they have to know if I'm streaming it?

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I'll wait until the game's done, and they'll say,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
watch the stream of your behavior at this.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Because I'm ready to start calling these fuckers out.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Bonds006 says,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
we need to have an official OLR online game squad team group, etc.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Let's make it happen.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Or at least at the level of VOG, too.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
We've been talking about that for a while.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
We need the OLR me, or the VOG thing.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
But the other thing, too, is that

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
it's something I've already been doing on social media,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
like Facebook.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
If I've gotten a message from someone being scum,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
and thankfully I haven't gotten any yet,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
because some of these people have learned,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I've posted it, I've gone and found their parents

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
and sent them links to how their children are behaving,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I got apologies real quick.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Because I don't care if you're going to be shit.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I'm going to call you on being shit. Sorry.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I am not going to sit here quietly and let people...

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And some people on Facebook do need a spanking.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
But I'm not going to sit here quietly

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
and let myself be an oppressed party.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Fuck you. I'm going to stand up for myself.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Bonn 2006 in chat says we can each do our bit,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
as Jamie is saying.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Yes.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Alright. Anyway. Let's move on.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
We've got lots more gaming news.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
We're an hour and a half into part A.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Let's try to get the rest of this gaming news.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
But it's good stuff tonight. Loki, what do you have for us?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
So this is kind of cool. I watched this video,

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
and it's basically this guy who...

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
He actually hacked...

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Most people, when they emulate stuff,

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
you're thinking like you're emulating the hardware

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
and running the ROMs like NES emulator.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
We're taking emulating hardware,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
we dump the ROMs and we run it

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
so that it runs on fake hardware, basically.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Well, this guy, programmed by the name of Tom Murphy,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
otherwise he's known online as Tom7,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
he worked on a slightly different route.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Instead of emulating the NES, he emulated the cartridges.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
So basically what he did is he threw in a Raspberry Pi 3 Mini

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
inside of a cartridge,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and he got it to interact with the cartridge slot

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
in a way that he was able to output to the NES.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
And so he outputted this presentation that he made,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
and he even outputted Super Mario World

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
in an SNES emulator running on an NES.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Which is pretty awesome.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
So, really neat, but...

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I think he has the code online to actually try that as well.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
But, really cool.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Alright, so how can I do that at my house?

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I guess you have to have a Raspberry Pi 3 and be very smart.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Because you have to completely wire a cartridge or something like that, right?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Yeah, basically he wired the output from the Raspberry Pi 3

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
to the cartridge slots to work...

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
It went very in-depth in the video, so definitely check it out online.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
His YouTube account...

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Let's see here...

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Looks like it's like Ampersand or it's...

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Yeah, Tom7 is what he's...

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Oh, Suckerpinch is his name on YouTube.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
So he's looking for Suckerpinch.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I think it is kind of a neat concept, though.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
So, DarkTusuya says, I watched the whole video. It was amazing.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Yeah, so he has a making of the reverse NES emulation process.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
And it was interesting because he basically talked about how the cartridges worked and everything.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And how he had to make his own security chip and everything.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
It was just really interesting.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
And just being that you can use a Raspberry Pi to do that.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Pretty awesome.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Alright, well, let's get into talk about some E3 leaks

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
and some things that are getting announced a little bit in advance of E3.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
So, Assassin's Creed Odyssey has apparently been confirmed thanks to a keyring.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
That's right, there was a keyring that showed up.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I don't know if it was on a shelf or what the deal was.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
But apparently the merchandise was posted by a French site.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
A little collectible that showed Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
The little logo and a little Greek Spartan helmet on a keychain.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000
So, this led the official Assassin's Creed account to then tweet a couple days ago.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
See you at E3 with an official little quick teaser there.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000
So, certainly this was kind of a spoiled announcement, I think.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
But at the same time, is it a shock that there's a new Assassin's Creed game coming?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
No, they said that they were doing one this year, I think.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
So, that's not a shock.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Maybe the Greek thing is a little bit of a surprise.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.000
But, hey, since God of War went to the Nordic gods this time, if I'm not mistaken.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Well, they've been mixing it up.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I mean, they did the whole pirate thing for a while.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
They did Ancient Egypt last time, so now Greece.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Sure, they're just mixing it up.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I was still waiting for Feudal Japan.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I know they had the spin-off Assassin's Creed that was like that, but that was more of a 2D game.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I'd be more interested in the actual Feudal Japan one.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Having not played the Assassin's Creed series, it makes me feel very strange.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
The sheer number of Assassin's Creed games I have in my library on my Xbox One.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Because, what, three of them have been games with gold?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Yeah, I think one of them is right now.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yeah, it was. Second half of May.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
It was a game series I could just never get into.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Like, I purchased the first Assassin's Creed and I just like...

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I haven't never been into Assassin's Creed.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I played two hours of the first one and it just didn't grab me.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
And then two, three, four, Black Flag, China.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
But some people love them. It's just different.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
It might be just so many, so fast.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And it could be just that style of gameplay, because Dishonored is the same thing for me.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I can't get into Dishonored either, and I tried with that.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
It's a similar type of gameplay, that stealth action type stuff.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
That's me in Monster Hunter. I feel like Monster Hunter is a game I should really be into and love.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And I have so many friends that are super into it, but I've tried it and I'm not feeling this the same way.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I don't know what it is. I'm just not feeling it.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
But that's different.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Different games for different people.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Different jokes for different folks.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I suppose, if you want to put it that way.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Anyway, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in the news?

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Oh, I have some stuff.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000
You know, last week we talked about that game, Active Shooter,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000
where you play as either the police responding to an active shooter or the shooter itself, going into a school.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Well, the online petition has been successful.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And Valve has taken the game off of the Steam store.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Also because the developer has a history of bad behavior.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:18.000
But it also, of course, gained some pretty big attention after two of the families that had students killed in the February attack in Parkland

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.000
said it was despicable and horrific and really called them out for it.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Steam got some really bad PR over this by folks who had been involved in either school superintendents or people involved in the education system or local law enforcement.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Really started calling them out, so Steam jumped in and said, nope, it's gone.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:52.000
So they emailed the media and said that it was taken down ahead of the June 6th release.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And the developer, who is calling himself Ata Berdyev, has a history of being a troll, abusing customers and publishing copyrighted material and doing user review manipulation.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So they're not going to do business with people who act that way toward their customers.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:21.000
He's an asset flipper, so he's been known to do a lot of really shitty games that have been on Steam.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:30.000
The one that got him in trouble last time was he put up a Pickled Rick game, which of course rips off Rick and Morty.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.000
But he's done several other asset flip games on there and then basically manipulated systems to try to get him.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
He kept coming back on there.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
It wasn't him this time publishing it, but it was him and his friend, I guess, publishing it.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And they just found out because he used the same bank account as his other companies that he has the same dude.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Well, someone who said his name was Arthur Belkin says that Ata was his friend and that the games were his.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000
So he's waiting for Steam to reply, but basically it needs to be taken down anyway.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Nah, he's not coming back.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Well, never say never.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Next time he'll come back wearing glasses and a suit and he'll just look different.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
But also this guy said that everything was bad sarcasm.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Sorry, but English is my third language. No.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Yeah, that's not really an excuse for the game though.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
No, you're... bye bitch.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Yeah, some of those things say it all in every language.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Hold the garbage accountable.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Yes, so there was another announcement that was teased with a very long Twitch stream of a screen and a bobblehead.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
But finally Fallout 76 was announced.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And it's not clear exactly what the game's going to be about aside from Vault 76.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:57.000
But that there's been some artwork that they're painting down in LA.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Because traditionally when E3 rolls around they tend to paint artwork on that one...

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I don't know if it's like a hotel building or something like that that's right there.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Oh, it's everything in that area. Like, you know, the banners go up on the convention center itself.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
The nearby hotels, parking lots, all the buses.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
The picture that they have for it though has multiple Vault boys on there.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.000
So the thought is that it's a co-op or online type of game but they haven't really said what it was yet.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Doesn't mean that they're stopping from taking pre-orders of course.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Before we even know what the hell the game's about.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Yeah, it's coming.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
And then of course the game is under development by Bethesda Game Studios.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And then also a company, Battlecry Studios, is working on it as well.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.000
So it'll be interesting to see. And I guess we're going to find out about it in June 10th.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
For sure.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
We can hardly wait.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Yeah, I'm excited for E3 too.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Especially because it seems like there's all these big games.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And obviously Fallout is another one of those things.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I personally don't super get into Fallout because I own Fallout 3.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And I just never really like super...

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
You have Fallout 4.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Oh, no idea. I have Fallout 4. I get them all confused.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I have Fallout 3 and I have Fallout 4.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
And I think I have another Fallout 2.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000
But anyway, I can't get into them the same way I get into Elder Scrolls.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
You should. It's really good.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I know. I know. It's so weird.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Anyway, I'll be curious about this new one.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000
But I mean, just between this and Borderlands.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
I'm going to be more into Borderlands than Fallout.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
But it's been a long time.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I've been getting that itch to play Borderlands again.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Well, I think a lot of people are getting there too.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So, alright.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Well, maybe you've got the itch for a classic video game.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000
And get this, apparently Intellivision is going to be making a comeback.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Now, I know Intellivision...

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
They've done the Intellivision Lives and they have an Intellivision Flashback.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I actually own the Intellivision Flashback.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Like they have Atari Flashback and so forth.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
But Intellivision is kind of going through another sort of shift, if you will.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
And it's thanks to Tommy Tallarico.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Who we actually had on this show years ago in Video Games Live.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I'm Facebook buddies with him and he's been posting these cryptic hints.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
And then finally he's like, here's the news.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Really? He didn't accept my friend request and I tried to add him.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Or he had hit his limit.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I think it is the time my friend requested him.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
So, anyway. I'm not his friend. But you guys are. That's alright.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So, here's the deal.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Is that Tommy has apparently acquired the rights to Intellivision.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000
So, Intellivision Entertainment is going to be now the name of the company.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
And Tallarico did a little interview about this.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Of course, he's not just the musician who did Video Games Live.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
But he has done video game development as well before.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
And of course he's done, you know, TV and some commentary due to that.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Of course, Intellivision Productions came from Keith Robinson.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Who unfortunately passed away in 2017.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Which, you know, I remember meeting Keith Robinson years ago at an E3.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Around the time, I think, Intellivision Lives was coming out on like the Xbox or something.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Or the Xbox 360.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
The Xbox.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
It was like the original Xbox, yeah.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I think.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
So, yeah.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Well, no, no, no. That would have been like...

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
It may have been both.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Because the Xbox 360 was out because we were playing...

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Yeah, I feel like it came out on 360 and like PS3.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I feel like it came out on...

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
So like there was that whole little collection there.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I think I...

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Did they bring my 360?

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I know I was playing...

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Because that was the year that they did demos for like the E3 stuff.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So they had...

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Lost Planet, I think, was one of the demos that you could play.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Before, you know, it was the same one that was on the show floor.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
MXC says it was PS2 and Xbox that that came out on.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
So I guess it was kind of a little bit of an older game.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
But I feel like they were doing...

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
They were trying to do more stuff with later games.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
But anyway.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
So Intellivision Entertainment is out.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And so they are looking at doing a new Intellivision console.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
But Tommy Tallarico kind of wants to take a different approach.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Doesn't want to necessarily do the same thing that like the Atari relaunch is doing,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
which we'll talk about in the second half of the show tonight.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
But Tommy said in an interview,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I see a huge gaping hole in the market now with families in the home.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
We will be focused.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
We will not try to compete with Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
That would be insane.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
And we would need one billion.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So they're going to come out with more details on October 1st.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
There's also a new website you can get into as well.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
So it sounds like...

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
And he says we are in the middle.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
We won't run Netflix.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
We're not trying to do 3D.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I was going to say I hate to be the one to say the terrible O word,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
but it sounds a lot like the Ouya.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Well, you know what?

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I think there was a lot in concept that maybe could have been better about the Ouya.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000
And so maybe a second go at it is what this needs or what have you.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And it'll have the classic Intellivision library to back it up.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
But it sounds like from what Tommy is saying,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
maybe they're going to try to put out a console that's like 50 bucks,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
something that's a lot cheaper, maybe $99.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I don't know where they'll go with it.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
They'll try to put something out that's really cheap

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
that just plays simple kid-friendly type of games,

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
which maybe isn't for you and me, but that's okay.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Maybe the goal is the parents can play the games they remember from Intellivision.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Well, I mean, if you think about it, imagine a homebrew version of the SNES classic.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:15.000
You're running SNES type games on that type of hardware for that price point.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
That doesn't sound terrible.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I mean, think about if Nintendo had the forethought to put networking in their SNES classic

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
and have a storefront where you can purchase more games.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000
It would have been cool if they had called it Satellaview.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Or that, yeah.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
And harking back to that.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
So anyway, I'm very curious to see what Tommy comes up with with this.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
And hopefully we'll get...

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
It sounds like he's taking the right approach,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
where he's like, look, we're not trying to compete with Nintendo in this stuff.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
We're looking at a different market.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And so maybe this is a kid's bedroom console.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I don't know. We'll see.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
So good luck.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
SG100Matt in chat says, I think he'll do a good job with this console.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000
He's a smart businessman, and we'll get the right people to work on this.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Tigerclaw says, so expect those Intellivision consoles at your local dollar stores.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Well, I don't know.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I don't want to be that pessimistic about it,

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
but maybe some of the games will show up at dollar stores.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
But honestly, is that such a bad thing?

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
I mean, if there's a way to make some of these games for pennies on the dollar,

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.000
then maybe dollar store sales is not actually the end of the world.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
So anyway, we'll see.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
We'll see.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Dartatia also says, video games live wouldn't suffer because of this new system.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
He'll still be doing that, too, from the sound of it.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Well, you know, you can run multiple businesses.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Again, it's just like Gwyneth was pointed out in an earlier comment.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
If you have the right people that are doing it,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
you can still kind of do whatever you need to do.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane and take a look at a classic.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking this game out.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
And maybe it's not as old as the Intellivision this week,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
but it's still a classic.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I mean, when gaming's been around for years and years and years,

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
you've got a lot of shit to choose from.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
But the rule around here is generally ten years old.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
We blur the line a little bit, but ten years older or more.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
So Dark Soccer, I know this is probably more like 20 years old.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.000
What is the classic game of the week this week?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Marvel Super Heroes.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000
A fighting game developed by Capcom that was released in the arcade in 1995

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
and was a CPS2 arcade system game.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
It got ported to...

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Stupid ads.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I thought this thing had ad block.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
You need the ad block for YouTube specifically.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I guess so.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Okay, here's the actual music.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Plus I picked one of my favorite characters to play in this, Shuma Gorath.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Or as Dan and I just kept calling him Shumachan.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
But anyway, this is a cute little god of destruction and chaos.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Cute is an interesting word to describe it.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I love the poses though for Shuma Gorath in this game.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000
It also has one of my favorite ever attacks, chaos dimension.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
But I'll get to that anyway.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.000
So later on it was ported to the Sega Saturn and Playstation in 1997.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
The Saturn version being the good one.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.000
And then it also was included in the Marvel vs. Capcom Origins collection.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Where, of course, Marvel vs. Capcom was also released as well.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.000
It came out digitally for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
It is loosely based on the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And it is the second Capcom fighting game.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
The first one being X-Men Children of the Atom.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And then succeeded by the Marvel vs. Capcom series.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And one thing about this is that it was dedicated to Jack Kirby.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Because they based all the characters in the game off of Jack Kirby's original design.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
The ones that he had the hand in.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
I read his autobiography too.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And if you haven't read Jack Kirby's autobiography you really should.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
But going further.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
It is a fighting game.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Did I say fighting and lightning for some reason?

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It's a fighting game.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
It has superheroes and villains from the Marvel universe fighting against each other.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
But they use attacks to knock down the opponent.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
And of course possess more life than them at the end of it.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And they also have this different mechanic in it.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
They have the infinity gems.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
So the power, time, space, reality, soul and mind.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And you can knock them out of opponents during arcade mode.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Or fill certain criteria in versus mode.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Like just getting the first hit.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Or doing different things.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But when you use the gems in battle you get enhanced effects.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000
So for example if you use the time gem you get super speed.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Power of course.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Power.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Different ones can be life.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Things like that.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
And also certain fighters will get extra benefits from using certain gems.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Like Spiderman using the power gem will let him create a doppelganger to do extra damage during his attacks.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:09.000
And so basically the main antagonist of the game being an infinity gauntlet storyline would be Thanos.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000
And see I thought that with Infinity War having recently come out I thought that this game would be appropriate.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:26.000
So the characters in the game are, and by the way some of them are only available in the Japanese version.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000
They were hidden characters in the Japanese version and they were unlockable in Origins.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And then of course there is boss characters.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
So Thanos is the unlockable boss character.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
And for a hidden character you actually have Anita.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
As in Donovan's little wanderer.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
You know the little girl who hangs out with him from Darkstalkers.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And Doctor Doom was also an unlockable boss.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Other than that you had Blackheart.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000
I don't know I really wasn't too into some of those characters in the 90's.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:07.000
But I remember Blackheart was in, it was like Punisher, Wolverine, and somebody else doing a crossover for that.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:15.000
But also Captain America is in it, Hulk is in it, Iron Man, Juggernaut, Magneto, Psylocke, Shuma Garak, Spiderman, and Wolverine.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Which I don't understand that if all of these characters are in it why the fuck was Doctor Strange not in it.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
But go ahead and ask Marvel that.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So it did include four of the characters that were in X-Men Children of the Atom.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Who were considered to be the most popular so it was Wolverine, Juggernaut, Magneto, and Psylocke.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.000
So yay Psylocke was one of my regulars in this game.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:49.000
And then of course the home conversions were revealed at E3 1996 with Stan Lee there at the time.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:54.000
It is one of the best fighting games I think I have ever played.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Great graphics, wonderful music, and then of course the Saturn version is of course practical perfection.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Because it does use the 4 meg RAM cartridge so that you get near arcade quality performance from it.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:17.000
You're missing some frames of animation, but it really is about as great as the arcade version as you could get the day it came out.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Playstation 1 of course was lacking because it didn't have the memory to accommodate so many characters.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
And of course the Sega Saturn much better for anything 2D.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And of course Saturn Magazine gave it a 95% for being a wonderful conversion.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And it was considered the 16th best Marvel video game by Geek Magazine in 2013 for quote it's chaotic yet insanely fun gameplay.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.000
And it's considered one of the top 25 best 2D fighting games of all time.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Because the gem collecting mechanic still keeps the game fresh.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Now a little story about this game.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:10.000
When I was a student at the University of South Alabama we had at this little, I mean the place has long gone since then.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.000
But it was a deli that had been around since like the 70's called Solomon's.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
And now it's like some barbecue joint.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
But Solomon's had this bar but they also had an arcade next door to the bar.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:33.000
And to the side also of the deli that had import arcade cabinets as well as ROM hacks.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Just you know bootlegs and what have you.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
So I got to play this game pretty much the week after it came out.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.000
And I remember saying you know I only need 3 hours of sleep.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And going to Solomon's at 4 in the fucking morning to play this.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And one of the still beta editions of Mortal Kombat 2.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And that was like my jam. Lots of pinball too.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
But I have very fond memories of this game.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000
And of course my first character on this game was Psylocke.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
My second was Shumacrath.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.000
So memories. It's a great game. Did you guys play it too?

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.000
No I didn't really get into the Marvel side of the fighting games until Marvel vs Capcom.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
When Storm was in it and you know I would always play Storm or Chun-Li usually like that.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000
So I think I kind of missed this one. I don't remember this being in any arcades near me. That was the problem.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
And they had a missed opportunity with this game.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Because if they really wanted it to be more true to you know the Infinity Gauntlet stories.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.000
You should have had Gamora. You should have had Nebula. You should have had you know Doctor Strange involved in it.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000
You know Dormammu maybe. You know.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:49.000
We actually need a remake to this.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Well and I understand they tried to do that with the Marvel vs Capcom.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
But that's bullshit. It means it's just a flat Marvel game.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:03.000
The 2D fighting game that has the actual characters involved in the Infinity Gauntlet original storyline.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Because the Infinity Gauntlet storyline is fucked up because it had Nebula getting the gauntlet.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
And if they do that in the movies I'm just going to laugh.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Well.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
I haven't seen it yet.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I do the next movie.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Alright who knows. Anyway.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Yes Nebula had the gauntlet and made Thanos her bitch.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
But.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
She also had hair.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
But that you are simply talking about the comics.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
About the comics.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
We don't know what they'll do in the movies.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
About the comics.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I haven't even seen the movie because I'll be perfectly honest Infinity Gauntlet was really not one of my favorite storylines.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Uh huh.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
You know Secret War was another one I didn't like.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
It was from that same general era.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
The stuff that I liked was like Extinction Agenda and Inferno.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
All the X-Men separate storylines.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Alright.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Well there it is.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Classic game of the week.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Marvel Super Heroes.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000
The arcade game but also ported faithfully down to Sega Saturn.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And the Playstation.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
More people had a Playstation.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
It was where we just patted the Playstation people in the head and said oh you poor dear.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000
You get it too.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
But remember Saturn sold very well in Japan.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
That's true.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:13.000
And if we had gotten in the US if they had marketed as well as they did in Japan and got us those 4 meg RAM carts.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
They could have charged 100 bucks a game and people would have said here take all of my money.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Yeah well considering that Neo Geo was giving you arcade perfect stuff it was way more money.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Yeah you could have gotten close to perfection with the Saturn for a fraction of the cost.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Alright.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Well we're going to take a quick break but when we come back we have lots more news.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
We have your emails.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:39.000
We also have some stories on free games coming out if you are subscribers to Xbox Gold or Playstation Plus.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
We'll talk about some backwards compatibility.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
We'll talk about Atari's retro stuff and maybe some more Street Fighter stuff as well.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
So we're going to take a quick break.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Don't go anywhere.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000
We've got more of Orange Lounge ready to come right after this.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Episode number 733 of our show already in progress.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:10.000
For this June 3rd of 2018 kind of the eve of E3 and as we talked about in the first half of the show.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Quite a few things already kind of slipping through the cracks thanks to various leaks.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Be they intentional or not.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
We talked about Pokemon Let's Go.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
We talked about Fallout 76, Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.000
And we have more to talk about in this part of the show as well as your calls in a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
All one word on Skype.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
But before we get there we have some rapid fire news to get into.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Of course Jason also joining us in the studio.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I need to give him a shout out as well.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Hello. Hello.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Good to have you as always.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Hope you have a good time so far.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Alright.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Let's get into rapid fire news and we'll do Loki.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Yeah.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Let's talk a little bit about Mayman 11.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
The game that I forgot was coming out but it is and it looks awesome.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Oh yeah.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
I didn't forget it was coming.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
It's just one of those.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I'm going to believe it when I see it.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
And so this week they kind of showed it a little more.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Yeah.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
They showed it a bit more of the game.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000
It looks very similar as far as gameplay wise to the original Mega Man.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And of course much nicer looking.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:13.000
They showed off some of the new boss characters in there including Block Man and was it Fuse Man I think it was called?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Or Spark Man or something like that.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
That's right.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Fuse Man.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
It's Fuse Man.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Yeah.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.000
But it looked pretty cool and they have like a time slow ability that you have now too as well.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.000
But the game is going to be coming out October 2nd on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
So you can check it out then.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.000
If you're getting it on the Switch they even have a version that has an amiibo because everything has an amiibo.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Because of course it does.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
But it's not the existing Mega Man amiibo.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
It's a new amiibo.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
It's a new Mega Man amiibo.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
It's the amiibo edition.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:58.000
So it's got the game, the new amiibo, a Dr. Wily logo adhesive patch and a set of stickers and the stage select microfiber cloth.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
You can wipe your dirty Switch off.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Because your Switch has been very very dirty.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Very dirty.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
It needs to be rubbed down by Dr. Wily.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:15.000
And of course as everybody's favorite retailer it is a GameStop exclusive.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Because of course it is.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
That makes me so angry.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Whatever.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Yeah.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Alright.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
And then of course it's that time again.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
It's that time to see what new games are going to be coming out for the month of June.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:34.000
As part of the mandatory multiplayer passes that you have to pay for.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
But you can forget stuff.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:44.000
So for Xbox we've got starting June 1st, Assassin's Creed Chronicles Russia.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
And that's for the whole month of June.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.000
And then of course starting June 16th through July 15th you're going to have SMITE the gold bundle.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000
And then the Xbox 360 compatible games that are going to be released around that time.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for the 1st through the 15th and through the 16th and the 30th.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Lego Indiana Jones 2 the adventure continues.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Isn't SMITE free to play?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000
It might be like a gold pack that you're getting.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Yeah I figured they're probably like what?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Like XP boosters?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Some like that.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Characters.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:23.000
They've done this before because they gave away killer instinct in games with gold which is also free to play.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
But what the games with gold stuff was like you got all the season 1 characters.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I think at one point they even gave you all the season 2 characters.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
So you got some of the stuff that most people would pay money for.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I'm also fucking garbage at Xbox One Killer Instinct.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Yeah Xbox One Killer Instinct is like a totally different game.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I like it a lot but it's very different from the old school ones.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
And then on the Playstation side of things for Playstation Plus.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
On Playstation 4 we're getting XCOM 2 and Trials Fusion.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I do like me some Trials so that's worth it.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Except I already bought it.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Playstation 3 is getting Zombie Driver HD and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I thought they stopped doing Playstation 3 games.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Or maybe I'm thinking Playstation 3.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000
They will be stopping that I think but they gave like a year notice on that.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
So it's like stopping in April 2019.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000
It's a ways out.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Okay.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Don't quote me on that date but it's a ways out.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
And then on the Vita, Atomic Ninjas, and Squares.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I don't know if any of these are like multi-platform games because usually there's a few of those on Playstation 3 and stuff.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
That end up being like multi-platform.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Yeah.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
But check those out.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Kaishudo confirming the date is March 2019.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I was really close so April would be the first month without it.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Anyway.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Let's see.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Also Needlecrash is in chat talking about Mega Man 11 saying yay Mega Man 11.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:52.000
And mentioning that the Japan versions or the Japanese versions have better editions.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.000
So if you want the Amiibo you could import it if you don't want to do Gamestop.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Of course that's going to be way more money but you'd be getting a Japanese edition.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000
They're a little different in their configuration so maybe that's an alternative.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
So I like that.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Yeah.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Some outside the box thinking.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I like that.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Good deal.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Alright.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Kaishudo says I love the Gamestop.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
This makes me smile.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I'm glad someone's smiling.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Alright.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Moving on.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Also in Microsoft news, what about backwards compatibility?

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
That's still a thing that is growing and continuing.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
So this is pretty cool because it's a lot of Rockstar stuff so I think Loki you're going

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
to be really into this.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Because it's all the same engine.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Yeah.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Right.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.000
So apparently starting June 7th you will be able to play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Midnight Club LA, and ooh this is one that I bought because it was an early 360 release.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Rockstar Games Table Tennis.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
That's right.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000
All of them will be available to play now on the Xbox One thanks to backwards compatibility.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be the enhanced version released on Xbox 360 with the increased

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.000
resolution and draw distance even if you use the original Xbox disc.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.000
So that's pretty cool that the original disc will actually trigger the enhanced version.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
The original disc with the downloaded patch.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Well yeah because all the disc does is unlock the download.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Yep.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
That's all it's doing.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
And then the Midnight Club LA will be the complete edition.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Oh I'm sorry the initial release and the complete edition will be available.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
So neat.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.000
They say there was a native 4K update for Red Dead Redemption when they did that but

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
no similar improvements to these at least not yet.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Who can't wait for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie?

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Well it's happening.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I'll probably see it at some point.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Whether you like it or not Sonic the Hedgehog is becoming a movie and they were trying to

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:47.000
get Paul Rudd to be in it but it sounds like they have actually cast James Marsden from

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Westworld and I believe he was Cyclops in X-Men if I'm not mistaken or like the early

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
X-Men movies right?

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Yes.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.000
That was him.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
That was him.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.000
So he's a little older now.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Dick Cyclops.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
And his now his movie career consists of running around with blue hedgehogs.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:06.000
But is he going to be Sonic or is he just going to be like one of Sonic's wonderful

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.000
friends?

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
He is the star.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000
He is possibly a buddy cop type of role it sounds like.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Sonic's human friend.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Yes.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Sonic shitty human friends.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:22.000
This honestly it's sounding more and more like a cross between Detective Pikachu and

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000
what is that R rated movie about the puppets that's coming out?

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
No it's not like that.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000
No I would say if anything because it's blue it reminds me a lot of the Smurfs as in it

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000
would be shitty but I still kind of want to see it because Neil Patrick Harris is in it

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
but that's really the only reason I'd ever want to see that movie.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And since I do say Detective Pikachu it shouldn't be forgotten that that movie is still happening.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.000
There is a Detective Pikachu movie coming out too.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:54.000
So it's Ryan Reynolds though it's not it's not Danny DeVito but I hope that Ryan Reynolds

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000
will be as dirty as Danny DeVito and I believe that he could do that.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I'm sure I'm sure.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Good times.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I believe in Ryan Reynolds.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
He's my current lord and savior.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
I'm still a little apprehensive about the fact that they're doing a clue movie with

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Ryan Reynolds because you all know clue is near and dear to my heart but it's going to

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
be R rated.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Yeah.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.000
They could go places.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I need everybody to stop saying remake.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Literal flames.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Literal flames on the side of my face.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Every clue that comes out is a new clue because it's different every which way.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
It's true.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
This is a re-imaging.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Re-imagining of the board game in a movie form.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Right.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Yes.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Just like how there was the VCR game that was different.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
But if we have nods to Madeline Kahn.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
I would be fine if they do like a nod and have somebody in the movie doing the whole

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
flames on the side of my face.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Like I think they're almost required to do a nod.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Or if they do an opposite like I went cold.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Cold like the depths of hell.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
If you read Dante.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I'm just thinking.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Maybe.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I don't know.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Yeah.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Something a little more in your face.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Or like a character named Yvette or Wadsworth.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Like they can call the butler Wadsworth.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000
I don't care.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Anyway.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Let's move on.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Sorry.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Away from clue.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Yeah.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Well we did bring this up before.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000
But it's of course gotten larger attention so I did want to bring it up.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Ted Dabney who is one of the co-founders of Atari died at the age of 81.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Which is not a bad run.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Started the whole thing with you know wanting to do.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000
You know of course the Nolan Bushnell who created Pizza Time Theater.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Had the idea for the Pizza Time Theater way way back when.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
But it's one of those ideas that came about and led to.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
You know they couldn't start the pizza place.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
But they began the partnership that led to Atari.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Right.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
So.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
So even though we had addressed this last week.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000
It's worth noting that like you're seeing this now on places like the BBC.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
And like these very large websites.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I'm reading it off of NPR.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Yeah.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Or NPR.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Like these very big places are kind of picking this up.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Like I even noticed it on Twitter.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Like one of my friends that does a lot of like media stuff.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Posted a tweet about it like Tuesday or Wednesday.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
And I kind of wanted to reply and be like this.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
He actually passed away like a few days ago.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
But I didn't want to be that bitch.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
You know I was like OK if people are.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
It's taking its time for people to kind of recognize it's happening.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
And so.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000
And the thing that's kind of what you saw happen.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
About the NPR article is it does go a little bit into more of who he was as a person.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
It was cancer that got him.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:29.000
But what I didn't know about him is that I mean apart from just being an electrical engineer and co-founding Atari.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
He was a Marine.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:38.000
So I actually got call outs from a few buddies of mine who had been retired Marines.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000
So that was kind of actually how I found the NPR article.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
OK.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
So.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Interesting.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
But yeah.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I think it's you know.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000
He's he's one of our co-founders and actually this NPR article is totally worth reading.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I'm not going to go like super more in depth on it.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:02.000
But it's a reason why since you know they set up their first pong in the Andy Capps Tavern in Sunnyvale.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.000
We would do Atari party every so often in Sunnyvale instead of Davis.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000
So I'll link the article in the chat room.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000
It's totally worth reading.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
It's definitely going to be a lot more.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Actually I'll be linking this on my Jamie Summers Facebook.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000
So definitely worth reading the whole article.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
All right.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.000
And also one of my favorite characters who I keep going didn't he die in the first Soul Calibur.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Maxie is back.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I won't be happy though with Maxie is not voiced by Hayashi Nobutoshi who was his original voice actor who was also Knuckles in Sonic Adventure and Toski in Fushigi Yugi and Basara in Macross 7.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Just one of those voices you know really good voice really good singer.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
But yeah he's back in it and he better be voiced by the same guy or else I will be upset.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
That's it.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
All right.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:01.000
We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates some games you might be playing a little sooner than Soul Calibur 6 here on the Eve of E3 coming up.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Yeah there's actually some stuff coming out.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:09.000
So we've got Blaze Blue cross tag battle that's on PC the Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
A game called Happy Birthdays that's on the Switch.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Nobunaga's Ambition looks like Taishi and that's on PC and PlayStation 4.

Muv Luv on the Vita and Muv Luv Alternative on the Vita.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:13.000
And then finally and last but not least for this week Sushi Striker the weight of the Sushido on the Switch and 3DS.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
That's it.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I feel like Nintendo's trying to push that game way harder than it deserves.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
But I guess I can't hate till I try it so.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Hate which one?

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
The Sushido game.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Oh.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Yeah anyway.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Alright moving on to Japan and let's check out some of the releases there.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:33.000

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.000
As well as a game called Little Nightmares in a deluxe edition is also out this week.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
But that is about it at least for the PlayStation 4 releases in Japan.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I should point out though there is.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Excuse me.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
There is some sort of special PlayStation 4 like a new bundle that's coming out on the 8th.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
It is a new.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
It's a very pretty like blue.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
It's called the Days of Play edition.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I don't know if we're getting one like that here but it's a really pretty blue like.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000
If Shane saw this I think he would import it from Japan because you know he loves the color blue.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:17.000
And it's a really like pretty blue with the gold like PlayStation logo in it with all the little other X's nose.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
And the controllers are really pretty too.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000
I might have to like send him that link and see what he thinks about that.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Anyway.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Also on other systems I'm not sure if the Vita.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.000
The Vita also has that Fate Xtella Link and that's the only real release on the Vita this week in Japan.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
But hey they're still getting something in Japan.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.000
And then on the Nintendo Switch this week that Little Nightmares game is on the Switch.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Otherwise that is really it.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000
It's a little slower for releases than it is here.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Dark Sakura.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
What about Europe?

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.000
In Europe we have on the 5th Elder Scrolls Online Summer Set.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Actually a game exclusive.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
The retailer.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Onrush on the 5th.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Also Vampyr.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Vampire.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
It's the Y R spelling.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
For PlayStation and Xbox.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Warhammer 40K Inquisitor Martyr also for those same consoles on the 5th.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000
On the 7th we have MotoGP 18 for pretty much everything.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Flashback 25th Anniversary Edition for Switch on June 8th.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Also on June 8th is Sushi Striker The Way of Sushido.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
That name.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Okay first of all Sushido would mean the way of sushi.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Don't call it the way of the way of sushi.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Stupid.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
It's like saying chai tea.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
ATM machine.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
USB bus.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Chai tea.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Chai means tea.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000
But I love chai tea.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Bitch don't make me.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Hey next time I drink a cup of chai tea you should walk up to me and go hey nice tea tea.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Girl.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
I'm way too easily amused.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Alright.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Or like when I see yakitori chicken.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Uh huh.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Yakitori means chicken.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
On a skewer.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Specifically chicken on a skewer.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Alright.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Chicken on a skewer chicken.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.000
If that's it for the UK releases then I'm gonna direct Dark Soccer to the mail bag.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
The bag of mail.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Which I had to prune.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yes Dark Soccer went in there and uh.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
This is working.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Yes it actually I just a quick off the record since Jason was here I was like Jason.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Jason.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Jason.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Jason.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Jason.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.000
I was like Jason our website's been doing all this stuff and he went oh click click click click click.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Done.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Done.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
So hopefully that won't bother us again.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Okay so this one is actually a code for a game for someone who has Xbox Live.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I saw that.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
So I don't have it so.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Um.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Whichever one of you guys.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
It was Street Fighter something right?

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Street Fighter 4 arcade code.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
I don't think I have that on Xbox One if I don't have it I'll take it.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Then it's yours I'll leave it in the inbox.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Who sent that to us?

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Rababa.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Thank you Rababa.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Rababa.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Rababa.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Rababa.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I've been listening to Rababa since he came back from Japan and gave me my Anpanman plushie.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Rababa needs a theme song.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Okay.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Rababa.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Rababa.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Rababa.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Rababa.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Rababa.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Rababa.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Rababa.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Rababa.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Rababa.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Rababa.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Rababa.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Rababa.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Rababa.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Rababa.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Rababa.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Rababa.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Rababa.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Rababa.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Rababa would like to take back this email.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
That's right.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
That's the actual email that's content for us.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Hey, OLR.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
It's been a long time since I wrote you guys an email.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I just wanted to get your thoughts on Mega Man 11.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Two new bosses were officially revealed this week.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Block Man and Fuse Man.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
They look pretty innovative and I like their designs as well.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:42.000
I already have my premium edition on pre-order from Play Asia since Japan gets the good shit

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
and we don't.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I also noticed that you can't get the Mega Man amiibo on pre-order anymore from overseas

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
since it's sold out everywhere unless you buy the Switch bundle that comes with it.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Okay, I'll stop there.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
So what do we think about Mega Man 11?

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
I think, yay, it's a fun Mega Man game and I'll probably have it.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Same.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I appreciate that with Mega Man 9 and 10 they went back to that old school Mega Man look

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
and they really made it look like.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.000
But I think people have been waiting for a game like this where it's that old school

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000
2D but definitely with the tricks that you can do in a new school environment.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Who am I kidding?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
I'm gonna fucking buy it.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Even though I'm sure the game is gonna be fucking hard as a lot of Mega Man games are,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
I'll buy it.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
You know?

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Whatever.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000
9 and 10 wrecked me.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
9 and 10 were a disaster.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I'm not saying they were bad games, they were actually great games, but when I played them

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
it was sad.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Hey, remember how you couldn't dash or charge special weapons and all of these things from

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
the X series that you don't get anymore?

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Go back to the 90s.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
I want a new X.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
That's what all this makes me do.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
It makes me want a new Mega Man X.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
We'll get there eventually.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
What was the last X game?

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
X8?

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
X8?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Sounds right.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Yeah.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
But...

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
They just have to get through re-releasing everything.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.000
They have to get through extending the classic series and then they'll start extending the

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
X series.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
My eyes are gonna hurt from all the rolling that they're doing.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.000
And then the XE and the battle network and then they'll make another sequel to ZX.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Oh, DarkTight2U in chat points out over at live.vognetwork.com, I did hear Mega Man 11

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
will have a casual mode.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Yay for Bobby Black Wolf mode.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Yay.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Because I love those modes.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Although, with what I heard about Curse of the Moon, it might not mean a lot.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Look, the thing about Curse of the Moon, it gives you unlimited lives.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Yes, I wiped on that boss, but it let me start all over again on the screen before the boss.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
That's typical Castlevania, too.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
But I mean, I died.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I lost everybody and it still let me start there.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
So, yeah.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
I'm a big fan of casual mode.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
So, to continue this email.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
E3 starts in a few days and I'm wondering what your predictions are.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
For me, I'm hoping of the following.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Onimusha Collection is announced.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
PS4 to be backwards compatible.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Final Fantasy 7 remake footage.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Nintendo Switch online plans.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Bayonetta 3 info.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Mega Man X9.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
A man can only dream.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I truly hope you are all doing well.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I haven't had the time to hear you guys lately due to life.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
But that's how it goes.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Be well, keep up the good work, and happy Pride Week.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
And that comes from Needle Crash.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Well, welcome back. Happy Pride to you as well.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
And let's see, E3 predictions.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Week? We get a month.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I guess that would be the time.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I know, that's right.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
We do get a month.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Well, actually, here in SAC, it's this coming weekend.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
But then I'm going to Chicago Pride.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I'm such a selfish bitch, I'm doing it twice.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
I'm going to San Francisco Pride.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
When you're in Chicago for Pride.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
You're doing charitable work, though.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Well, but I would have been there anyway.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
So anyway, as far as the E3 predictions go,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.000
I think Bayonetta 3 info is a really good, safe bet.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.000
As well as some of those other things that were named.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
There's one other one that he named that I was like,

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
oh yeah, that's probably for sure going to happen.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.000
I thought that Tekken vs. Street Fighter was a very interesting prediction

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000
because that has seemed to kind of disappear altogether.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000
So I would like to see that make a resurgence as well.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Maybe they're hoping we'll forget about it before they re-announce it.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
And maybe now that Street Fighter V is a little bit like,

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000
and Tekken 7, both are kind of like, you know, doing their thing.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Maybe now's a good time for that to happen.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
So that's a really good call.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
As far as other stuff I'd like to see,

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
from the Nintendo camp, I mean, I would like to see

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
what great big holiday hit they have in store.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000
I think there's a lot of people really hoping for a new Animal Crossing.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
I would love for you guys to be pleased.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
But I really would put that expectation on the lowest possible setting.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I really want it though.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000
I know, but wanting it, like, I've wanted F-Zero for how many years?

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Or as my husband likes to say, how does it feel to wand?

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Yeah, here's the thing with Animal Crossing.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
That mobile game is still too fresh.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.000
So I would say, you know, keep bugging the shit out of Nintendo

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
and tweeting at them and stuff. Let them know the demand is there.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
But don't be surprised if that's a next year thing.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.000
But as far as Metroid Prime 4 goes,

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000
now that I would like to hear some more things about.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Otherwise with E3, gosh,

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I still am going to go by my old standby

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.000
that I think one of these years Microsoft is going to be the first one to say

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
you no longer have to pay to play online anymore.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000
That's my old standby prediction I'm convinced they're going to do.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Which seems weird, especially in the face of Nintendo

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
holding up that mantle now.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I know, but Microsoft has to make a big fucking move.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000
They have to be bold.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:34.000
They're going to have to make a big fucking move to get people to talk about them again.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
And I think that would be one of the things that would do it.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Another thing, though, about making a free-to-play model for online gaming

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
is the fact that there will be less...

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
If they have to shut down a server or something,

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
that will already lessen, I guess, some of the blow on that one

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
because no one's paying for it.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I was going to ask how...

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I know the Games for Windows program ended a long time ago,

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:09.000
but for games that exist both on PC and Xbox One,

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:13.000
gold isn't a thing in the PC universe.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Correct. And you see where my thought process is going with this.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Yeah, I was leading down the same path with the big unification,

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.000
the big one ecosystem for multiple systems thing.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I don't want to repeat myself too bad, but Microsoft has these other perks.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000
They could still have a gold program that gives you the free games.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Microsoft has that very rich Netflix-style thing that they're offering,

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
the game password, whatever it is, separately.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
They could start to move some of that into the gold and what have you.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I'm just saying, as far as paying to play online,

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Microsoft being a company to take that off the table would be a huge fucking move.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.000
And I don't want the Xbox and Microsoft fans to get mad at me

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
that I'm saying, oh, Microsoft's got to make a move.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000
But you guys know the reality is they are getting lost

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000
amongst competing with PlayStation 4,

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.000
competing against themselves on PC.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.000
And then obviously, Microsoft doesn't really compete with Nintendo,

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.000
but Nintendo's just got so much of that gaming buzz right now.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
And hey, the phrase goes, you snooze, you lose.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Yeah, but if Microsoft made a big fucking move.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
So I think that's another thing for E3.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:23.000
I think that Microsoft is going to do something to make our jaws drop.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.000
And even if it's not necessarily that, there's going to be like another,

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
here's another classic standby prediction that you all think is fucking stupid,

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000
but I'm going to say it again, Minecraft 2.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I think it's going to be, well, Halo 6 is probably what they're going to bring.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I just think that is not jaw-dropping.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Halo 6 is just, oh, okay, yeah.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Halo 6, Royale, Battle Royale.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Yeah, okay, sure.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
We got Minecraft 2.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000
What's that?

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.000
We got Minecraft 2 times 2 plus K.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Oh, Minecraft 4K.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Did that finally come out?

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
No.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
No, I think the patch is like any day now, though.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
I think it's supposed to be around E3.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
So that's finally coming.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Microsoft 2 squared, 2 squared K.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Maybe they will announce that that comes out, but you know.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
What would a Minecraft 2 be?

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Kaishudo says Microsoft can make a huge move and just cancel the Xbox One.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000
For some reason, as you were starting your buildup,

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
I thought that's actually what you were going to say,

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
and it made no sense to me.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Microsoft's not going to cancel Xbox One.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Yeah, no, absolutely not.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
No, they're not ready to get out of living room business yet.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I think this is a better prediction, what TigerClaw says in chat.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000
How about if Microsoft announces a new Battletoads?

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000
You know, they have been teasing that genitalia for, I don't know,

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000
how many years on the concept of a new Battletoads game,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
and we know, like, what was the thing where, like,

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Aaron Greenberg fucking went out there in a fucking Battletoads jacket,

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
or one of those Xbox executives went out there in a fucking Battletoads jacket

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
and was like, announce it already, you fuck!

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Like, he just won't do it.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
So, maybe this will be the year.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.000
He's like, you know, hey, we'll put it in Ready Player One.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
We'll go ahead and put it as a playable character.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
It wasn't an inoculancing.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Just fucking announce it, bitch.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Like, just stop it.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Stop teasing me.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
They have the collection that has it in there.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Maybe this is the year.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000
This is the year for Battletoads, maybe.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
We're bringing you Battletoads.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Backwards compatibility.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I can't fit this.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I can't fit this cartridge into the CD drive.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Why isn't this working?

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Alright.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Microsoft's big thing now is the 4K gaming.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
That's where they're gonna go all in.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
The 4K on the Xbox One X is superior to the 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro,

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
so I hope they just own it.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000
And so maybe that'll be their thing,

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
is they're just gonna say,

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
we've got this in 4K, we've got this in 4K.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
You know, developers, developers, developers in 4K.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Can I please have my Crackdown 3 already?

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Can I please have that or is this...

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Why 4K? Why not do 5K?

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
That'll be, and then they'll have the PlayStation 5K.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
It'll only be on 27-inch max.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Alright, anyway.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Alright.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000
As Sharon under Matt says,

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.000
game retailers are pressuring them to make the game

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
because they're tired of fielding calls about

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
if they have Battletoads.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:13.000
That the choice of retailers is funny there,

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:16.000
considering they kind of are the only retailer,

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
at least brick and mortar-wise, that exists anymore.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.000
They started a whole online campaign for you.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Tell your, you know how they have like,

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.000
tell your cable provider that you want blah blah blah blah blah.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Tell your retailer that you want Battletoads.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000
It's not, it's not gonna do shit, but anyway.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Now we live in a Tweety Facebook-y era.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
That's what we're talking about.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
We live in a Tweety Facebook-y era.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
That's the stuff that gets noticed, but anyway.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Alright, well there's some E3 predictions for you.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I mean, honestly, you know, I'm always,

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.000
it's one of those things where

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
I just don't realize it until you see it.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I was actually, I thought of it a little bit late,

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.000
but more proof that the only one

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
gets paid attention to are Twits.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Tweets, Twits.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Oh, Tweet, Twits.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Yeah, I get it.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Twitter.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Nice Twitties.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Alright, anyway.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.000
That's it for email?

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
I thought I'd thought direct messages.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:07.000
I got nothing.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:08.000
You got nothing.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Actually, if you ever want a good laugh,

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.000
just Google image search like Tweety Bird graphics

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.000
because there are all these things that like

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000
wine box drinking moms will leave like images

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
of Thug Tweety Bird on each other's pages.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Hold my mochi.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000
I'm going in.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Yep.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000
No, Google image search it.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Google image search like Thug Tweety Bird

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
or something like that and you get all these

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
like crazy results where you're like,

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
like the Tweety Bird on Blingy and all this other stuff.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
It came up in one of our chats the other day,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
which I thought was hilarious.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Anyway, going back to video gaming topic,

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
that's it for email.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.000
So participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
if you would like to send us an email in the future.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Maybe you'd like to send us your favorite Tweety Bird meme.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Let's get into some more news though

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
before we get to phone calls.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Loki.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Alright, so let's talk about the current

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
and brand new game consoles.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
In this case, we're talking about the Atari.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:05.000
So the Atari retro console has launched

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
their pre-order campaign and apparently

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000
that's gone well for them because it crashed Indiegogo.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
It looks neat.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I'm not exactly sure what this is,

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
but I like the interface.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
It looks neat with all their Atari games.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:22.000
But we got more details on what it is.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.000
So it's basically, it runs Linux

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:28.000
and it's on a Radeon R7 processor,

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
a 32 gigabyte hard drive,

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:33.000
four gigs of DDR4 RAM and expandable storage.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Plus it connects to the internet,

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000
supports streaming video and online multiplayer games.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
And they even have voice control.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
So that's pretty neat.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
They haven't said too much about

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
what games are going to be on there,

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.000
but apparently the wood paneled model

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
is going to go for $339.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.000
And they look like the controllers are similar

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
to like a PlayStation controller.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000
They said they have a cheaper option,

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I guess, that's the Onyx model with no controllers.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
That's $199.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.000
I'm hoping that this supports some sort of Bluetooth controllers

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
because otherwise that's kind of lame.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
How am I going to get some controllers for this thing?

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Yeah, that's what it said

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
at the end of the previous section.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
So, cool.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Are you surprised this is doing so well?

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
I am, especially after the whole

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Coleco chameleon thing.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
I thought people would be kind of hesitant,

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
especially with Atari.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
How they were trying to kickstart was at

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Theme Park,

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Roller Coaster Tycoon or something like that,

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
but it's like the shitty one from mobile.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I do feel like the audience

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
that would be getting a retro Atari

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
is very different from those that were

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
keeping an eye on Coleco chameleon.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
I just think it's very different types of audiences,

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
if you know what I mean.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
By the way, before you finish,

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I have a very important follow-up.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
So I sent Shane that

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
blue PlayStation 4 thing,

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
and he said, I would own it

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
if it was a pro system.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
I didn't realize it's not a pro,

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
and he said, it was announced earlier this week

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
and I'm mad it's not a pro system because

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
it's beautiful. So I was right that he would be

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
into that blue system, but it's not a pro.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
By the way, tell Shane I have

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
coconut pocky for him.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
What is it, like dbrand

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
or other skinning sites that

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
you can get a blue skin for your pro?

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
That's true. I'm sure he has

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
some type of blue PlayStation 4 already

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
anyway, but just not that.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
I do need to get a pro. I've been thinking about getting a

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
pro and

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
a 4K TV at some point.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I just don't know how much better that's going to

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
really make VR games and stuff.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I don't think it's marginally better.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Marginally.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
The whole thing that Bobby is saying about the 4K

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
now that he has this whole state of the art

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
theater thing he set up,

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
he notices very much that

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Microsoft Xbox One X

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
does the 4K.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
I don't have an Xbox One yet.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
But we knew that.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
We kind of knew that. Even though the

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
PlayStation has 4K support,

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
it still doesn't have the technology

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
and the chips in it to really

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
do beefy 4K games.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
That would be why I'd want

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Xbox One X.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
However,

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
with that being said,

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I don't really need

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
an Xbox One X because I have a PC

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
that can run Microsoft games.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
That's the problem that they run into.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
They make all their games on PC

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
and it's like, why the hell am I going to buy a system

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
for cross-platform games

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
that I have a system that can play them on already?

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Because it's getting hard to get a graphics

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
card that does 4K because of

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
fucking Bitcoin.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Well, I don't have a 4K monitor so I don't give a shit

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
but I don't have a 4K TV either.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
I have a 4K monitor and do you know how hard it is to get a

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
VO card right now because of fucking Bitcoin?

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
I feel like the only way I'm going to be able

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
to get a graphics card is to pay for it with Bitcoin.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Anyway.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Moving on.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
One thing I could

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
play if I wanted to. Actually, I thought about picking

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
it up was the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
collection because it does look like a pretty

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
sweet collection of games

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
and of course that's available on the Switch

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
and I think it's on other systems too.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
I would obviously get something like that

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
on the Switch. Yes, it is on Playstation 4 and

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Xbox One as well as PC.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
So the collection

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
the collection

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
it came out here in the States

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
it's been delayed in Japan.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
They have delayed it in Japan to fall of 2018

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
but this might actually

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
be a good thing because you may

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
or may not recall

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
the folks in Japan weren't super happy

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
about this collection because

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
it's all English titles

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
voicing and text. Meaning the Japanese

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
versions were just kind of

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
thrown away. Well in a message posted

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
on the official website the producer

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
of Street Fighter Tomoaki

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Aino shared

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
that they are going to do a fall 2018 release

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
for the Street Fighter 30th

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Anniversary collection international

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
and said we apologize for the trouble

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
this may have caused to those of you who were looking forward to it

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
but please wait a little longer

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
for additional new information

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
besides the release period.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
So it sounds like they are going to be making

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
some changes

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
to potentially maybe let them at least

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
flip over to Japanese voice acting

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
and all that stuff and where

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
you know Vega will be

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
M. Bison

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
and Sagat will be

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
all those different changes that they made in the game.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Correcting that triangle

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
all that stuff

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I mean that would be kind of messed up

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
There would be some people

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I bet that would actually be really into

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
being able to get some of the Japanese

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
versions here in the states

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
you know so I kind of hope

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
that if they do fix it they still have some type

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
of DLC or patch or something

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
where our versions can get the Japanese

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
stuff. I think that would be cool but

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
I'm not going to hold my breath but

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
I just think it would be cool. Anyway

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
needlecrash in chat at live.vognetwork.com

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
says collection isn't bad

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
it's pretty good but the

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
online is iffy at times.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Japan needs to get their versions of

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Street Fighter Zero.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Alright let's move on

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
DarkSakura what do you have for us coming up next?

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Well

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
people have been

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
stupid about Battlefield 5

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
because it involves

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
women in a World War 2 setting

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
and basically

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
DICE basically said

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
and I'm going to quote here

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
first of all let me be clear about one thing

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
player choice in female playable characters

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
are here to stay.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
And then he went on to

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
explain that it is important to be able to play as a character

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
you identify with for

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
immersion and to customize the way

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
that you want to and I like

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
this quote too. We want Battlefield 5 to represent

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
all of those who are part of the greatest drama in human

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
history and give players a choice to

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
choose and customize

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
the characters they play with.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
And now here's a history lesson

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
little boys

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
who didn't pay attention in fucking school

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
did you know that there

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
was an entire battalion of female snipers

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
out of Russia?

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Did you know

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
that one of the

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
highest kill counts for female

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
snipers was a Czech sniper?

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Did you also know that there were a number

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
of women working for the resistance

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
in Germany and occupied areas

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
that were releasing propaganda

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
hiding children, helping to get

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
people out who were

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
non-combatant civilians

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
and there were plenty of fucking

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
people enlisted in

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
the armed services

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
who were women

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
who performed medic functions

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
who drove tanks, who drove

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
delivery and who

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
whether or not it was documented

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
did participate in combat.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
So get off of your sexist little

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I don't know shit about history

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
you know ass hattery fucking

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
read a book and shut up.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Also it's a fucking

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
video game and like a lot of the

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
stuff you're doing in the video game

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
didn't really fucking happen in history so you

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
know what if we want to you know

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
maybe bend some things a little bit to be more

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
inclusive so women can play women in the game

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
does it really like

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
change anything about

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
battlefield? But they all should know their fucking history.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
And that is true too I'm not denying anything

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
that you're saying there. Well you're saying battlefield

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
is not realistic I mean I can't jump out of a

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
plane, snipe somebody with a rocket launcher

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
and then land back in that plane again

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
and take off. But women!

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
That's where I draw

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
the line. Goes to show

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
you're still

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
have a long way to go. Wow Raginator

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
is actually like making great points

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
tonight I don't know what the fuck they put in the water

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
over there but Raginator says

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
wah I want realism in

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
my games Gondi sets off

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
nukes which is a popular

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
civilization joke if you

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
play civilization it's like Gondi's the most

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
aggressive leader in the game because of a bug

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
in the original civilization. Dungeon buster

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
historically accurate fixes tank in seconds.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
So

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
anyway

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
I just

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
I just think

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
that cause the big point that these assholes

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
are trying to make is

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
from a historical standpoint

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
when history disproves them

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
already. Sorry

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
I make it a point to study history

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
because you know they say those who

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
who don't know their history are

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
doomed to repeat it we're fucking reliving it

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
right now but

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
you pay attention

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
to it you learn from it

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
and if you knew anything about fucking

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
history first of all you probably wouldn't be playing

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
battlefield but

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
but second of all

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
you would you would know how fucking weak your

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
argument is I mean if

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
you're this poorly

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
prepared for a battle of wits

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
just don't participate

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
here's you know what

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
I Jamie I'm a big fan

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
of giving people a taste of their own medicine

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
so here's what I think you should do let's

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
say let's say I'm a dude and I'm gonna tell you

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
hey Jamie

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
women don't belong in battlefield

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
this is what I think your response should be you ready

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
shut up and go make me a

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
sandwich all right so Jamie

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
a women shouldn't be in battlefield

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
shut up and go get me a pizza

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
I have standards

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
I think

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
you know what

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
I think you just you just give it

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
right back to them the same way

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
it's been you know

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
no I would literally be shut

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
up and go back to fucking school

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
and while you're there get a pizza

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
and while you're there bring me a bread tangle

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
of pizza

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
okay do we remember our strong bad

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
email teen girl squad

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
all right speaking of teen

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
girl squad Loki what's next in

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
the news Loki

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
is so and so this isn't

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
team girl squad but it's

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
team Sonic racing

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
so this was yet another game that was leaked by

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Walmart and now confirmed by

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Sega and they had a

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
teaser trailer that showed nothing except for

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Sonic and

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
his

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
friends racing

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
so I guess we'll

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
look forward to that coming out makes

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
sense that they have Sonic and all-stars racing

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
transformed as your Xbox game of the month

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
so it does make sense

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
and actually that was a good racing game remember

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
that was the one with Danica Patrick as

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
one of the characters yes Sonic

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
and all his shitty friends and Danica

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Patrick it's like and

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
and they also had was at the Sega

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Outrun cabinet they

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
had like ooh la la they had a bunch of like

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Sega characters that were really you know

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
infamous in there this is only Sonic team racing

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
because Sonic he has enough

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
shitty friends to make a whole racing team

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
yeah I really hope that even if it's like

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
team Sonic racing sure maybe

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
it starts with Sonic and his you know Knuckles

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
and all his shitty buddies can we have

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
can we make cannon like

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
you know how they have Sonic and

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
you know all that stuff

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
you know they don't have the Wario version

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
of Sonic can we have Sanic as

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
the Wario version of Sonic

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Sanic and Danky King yeah

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Sanic no why not why not

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
when

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Court

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Ann takes over

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
I mean Sonic is it's pretty

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
you know they're pretty meme-y

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
on their

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
their Twitter so I forgot about that

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Bobby Blackwell says I recently replayed Sonic

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
and All-Stars Racing Transformed Wreck-It Ralph

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
was in there too I totally forgot

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
about that that is totally

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
true was yeah Wreck-It Ralph was like

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
one of the things you unlocked huh yeah

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
I remember that now so anyway

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
but not leastly there is a

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
PlayStation E3 experience

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
coming to theaters near you

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000

11th so yeah you can

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
go to a nearby theater near you

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
tickets will be up this Tuesday

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
at 11am pacific you have

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
to be committed to show up 30 minutes

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
before show time if you're not there

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
30 minutes before show time they're gonna give your fucking seat away

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
so you better look out for that

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
so anyway if you wanna

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
if you live in Northern California

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
near us and you wanna go to one of these

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
events too fucking bad

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
there aren't any here not even

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
in the Bay Area this year the only

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
events in California there are

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
two of them in Los Angeles

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
one at Century City and one at

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
LA Live here's what

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
cracks me the fuck up about that

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
do you know where LA Live is?

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
it's next door to E3 it's next door

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
to the fucking convention center

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
so like I mean I realize

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
the press conference is in a different theater

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
in a different part of LA but it's not that far

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
away I'm sorry but your press conference is in a different

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
theater good lord

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
so they have one literally next door

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
to E3 but they don't have one up here

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
in Northern California

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
I don't understand why it's so

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
limited maybe they're paying for the space

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
I don't know what it is well they have to pay for

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
the theaters I guess they're

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
renting all these theaters I thought they just did it through

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Fathom Events or one of those things that kind of already

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
I don't know I mean what do you

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
really get from this stuff like a free like

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Avatar or some bullshit

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
what are we really getting I mean

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
I don't know just watch it on

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
TV there's several people in chat suggesting

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
that they put it in VR Kajuda

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
saying they need to put the Sony press conference in

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
VR cheap asses and as

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Matt says they should actually do it in VR

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Bobby Blackwolf talking about his

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
new basement home theater says

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
curiously there's no listing for my home theater

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
for this experience well Bobby do you really

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
want to have like 30 strangers showing

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
up at your house so maybe it's best that

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
you have a private viewing for

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
you and the misses and maybe any buddies

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
that you invite over to watch it

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
in your 4K of vision

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
which can you watch the press conference I know you

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
can watch Microsoft's thing in 4K because

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Mixer does 4K but does

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Twitch I

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
think actually there's a Sony event

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
viewer they have that I would

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
assume that works and I don't know if that does

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
4K well I don't

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
know yeah

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
they're losers oh Bobby says I only have

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
six seats in the theater well you

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
could that's you the misses and

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
and two other couples grab some floor

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
yeah yeah get some some

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
pillows or something like that lawn chairs

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
anyway

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
I'll be watching it on

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
my couch that's how I'll be watching

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
actually I like to do ironic things

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
and what I mean by that is that I will watch

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
the Sony press conference on my

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Xbox and then I'll watch

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
the Microsoft press conference on my PlayStation

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
4 and there's usually ways to do this

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
so actually

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
no I kind of lied because the Microsoft one I'll

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
probably watch on my computer

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
because on my 4K monitor I could actually

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
watch it in 4K so that with

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Mixer so that would be kind of nice so

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
we'll see Bobby Blackwell

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
says Twitch can do 4K most

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
just don't which makes sense because like

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
I don't have the bandwidth to stream

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
4K but Sony probably has

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
the bandwidth to stream 4K so they

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
might do it we'll see you may have the bandwidth

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
but you don't have the bandwidth cap for that

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
uh the Skype line is open if you'd like

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
or maybe something else you can give us a call at

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Skype while we uh continue to

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
debate uh Twitch and 4K and all that stuff

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
I was gonna say you know that Twitch app

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
that's on the PlayStation 4 it would be really nice

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
if that would fucking come out for Xbox One already

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
cause that Twitch app is so

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
dated on Xbox One now

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
like and also like

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
when did they stop doing communities

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
highlights on Twitch

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
that's my favorite part of

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
using Twitch on my desktop

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
is that you can actually look at communities

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
so I can look at say the small

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
streamer community or the LGBT community

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
or Twitch unity which is a big thing

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
they were pushing why can't I get that

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
on the phone app or the

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Xbox One app and I forgot to look and see if it's in

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
the PlayStation 4 app cause the PlayStation 4

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
is currently in my studio

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
so I can hopefully uh do um

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
more streaming from it at some point

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
yeah SJ100Matt says

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
oh god that Twitch app on Xbox One sucks

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
it used to be the best one

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
like when it was first out because it was the only

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
one that would let you force the

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
source formatting and

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
it's how you would ensure that you get a high definition

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
feed coming to your TV

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
so anyway Orange Lounge Radio all

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
one word on Skype yeah

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Hulk I think you're onto something

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Xbox only likes Mixer now they hate Twitch

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
no updates for Twitch on Xbox One

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
I think that might be partially true

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
I mean obviously Microsoft is going to prefer Mixer

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
but I think they would be dumb

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
to just ignore that

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Twitch is a thing

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
it's not Microsoft that's doing those updates

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
so it's Twitch that's making the updates

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
alright well we're gonna take a call

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
hey uh it's Ragingator

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
hey Ragingator what's on your mind tonight

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
um

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
actually

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
when Dark Soccer did

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
the Classic Game of the Week

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
that gave me an idea

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
for my

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
call tonight

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
well as she's saying

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
indirectly she

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
mentioned college and all that

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
and that got me thinking back

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
to my college

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
days

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
not to get into too much detail

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
cause you wouldn't make a whole lot of sense

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
unless you're local but

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
I went to Erie Community College

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
North Campus

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
and

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
it's one of those multi-building

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
campuses and in the

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
student center they had

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
what they called the Coffee House

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I think

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
to give you a little bit of an

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
analogy think

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
if you ever saw 90210 back in the day

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
think the Peach Pit

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
yeah

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
it's kind of like that stuff

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
or the Max

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
from Saved by the Bell

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
yeah that too

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
but

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
they served food there

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
and they also

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
had like

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
one of those

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
low

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
I forget what it's called

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
the hockey games with the handles on it

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
you slide the players around

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
hockey

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
yeah so a lot of us had these types of things in our town

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
so what do you want to know about it

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
yeah well I was going to say

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
those of you

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
in the

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
studio

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
and anyone in chat

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
those of you that went to

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
college did your

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
campuses have arcade machines

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
on

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
campus and did you play

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
them and which games

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
did you play in particular

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
and enjoy there did you call us

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
campus have arcades

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
of some sort and what did you play there

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Dar Sacra well I talked about the

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
one at Solomon's that was right across from the campus

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
so University of South Alabama

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
at the time didn't have it but

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
across I mean they had

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Mortal Kombat 2 they had

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
another Mortal Kombat 2 that was one of the early betas

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
they had NBA Jam

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
they had a couple of pins like

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
some of those mid 90's ones

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
not Adams Family

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
they had

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Beta Theater of Magic they had a few

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
of the other ones

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
they had

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
just a bunch of fighting games really

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
and then of course I worked at an arcade

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
but yeah my college campus didn't really

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
have anything like that and then out here

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
when I was going to school

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
there was a DDR machine at Sac State

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
not at Sac State but at

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
American

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
American River College oh right

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
yeah and that

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
got gotten rid of really quick

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
I've been to other colleges

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
oh no South Alabama the other

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
thing we had we had the little arcade in my game room

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
where I worked so we had the World Cup

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Soccer Pinball we had

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Killer Instinct I don't know

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
why I didn't think about it because I fucking worked there

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
maybe I was trying to put it out of my head we had a

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Cyber Slide we had

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
Dark Salkers

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
we had King of Fighters 94

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
they switched out for 95 we

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
had

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Street Fighter Alpha

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
we had

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Fatal Fury Special

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
all kinds of stuff

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
you know sadly I went to school

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
a couple hours north of here in a town called

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Chico which is a little bit north of the Sacramento

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
area and I went to college there

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
and I don't really remember

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
there being I don't there wasn't an arcade on

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
campus I would have known about that there was a student union

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
but I don't remember there being any like video games

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
there like that and to be

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
honest I don't even remember like maybe

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
some of the bars would have an incidental pinball

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
machine here and there but not a lot of arcade games

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
so I was kind of robbed of all that I

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
remember there was a place called

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Ray's that was a video

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
store so to kind of date it a little

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
bit and they had an arcade that was the place

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
you would go to like play arcade games

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
and pinball stuff but it was on like the other side of town

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
so we rarely got to go over

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
there and there was also Chuck E. Cheese which we

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
would you know that was before the kids really

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
took it over and you could still find

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
like regular arcade games there

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
so we would go there sometimes

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
but that was really you know I wasn't as big

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
of a gamer in my college years

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
because there was a lot of other stuff I was going through

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
but I also remember that

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
like in the dorms

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
the fact that I had a Super Nintendo

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
and Mario Kart was a huge deal

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
like the dudes were coming over to play Mario Kart

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
like all the time and so that was like

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
a big deal and then the guys upstairs

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
got a Nintendo 64

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
and you can imagine how that went then they got

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Mario Kart and it was just like non-stop

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
you know and then myself

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
and my best friend in the dorms who lived

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
next door to me he was in the room next door

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
we would do dial-up

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Duke and Nukem 3D matches

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
and the other guys would get into it like they would

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
they would walk over and see where I'm at

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
and then they'd go run over to his room and say okay

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Rob's over in this part waiting for you or whatever

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
and they would do the same thing like they would like try to

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
try to ruin it all the time but we had a good time

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
doing that so that was that was fun

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
so that was what I remember with gaming in college

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
but I do remember also

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
before I went off to Chico

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
I did a few things at the community college

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
like one summer I think I did like a summer program

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
during my junior year or something like that

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
and I do remember that the

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
cafeteria there had a very small arcade

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
and the one that I would always play

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Altered Beast

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
was the game that I loved to play

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Rise from the Oak Wave

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
it totally looked like garbage

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
on the Genesis compared to the arcade version

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
but luckily you can play that arcade version now

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
on that Playstation 3 collection they did

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
yeah anyway

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Loki I don't know

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
did you do any like

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
arcade gaming in college around your community

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
no

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
no not really I mean

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
no

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
I did a lot of arcade gaming when I was younger

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
yeah

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
we'd go to different arcades to play different games

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
cause we'd get to have like the

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
7-11 would have the Street Fighter

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Street Fighter 2

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
and then there was a diner that had

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Captain Commando and then there was a

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Rico's Pizza that had a bunch of other games

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
oh yeah Rico's had

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
and there was a local movie theater that had

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
some more games so we just like kind of

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
ride between those and stuff and play different games

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
we spent a lot of money playing Captain Commando

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
a lot

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
but not so much when I was in college

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
cause college is, that was like

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Golf Land

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
time oh that was right when we

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
we all kind of first met

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
that's true

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
there was many arcades

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
I just

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
got a quick question

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
now since I'm not

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
from California

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
is it safe to say that Golf Land is

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
basically your areas equivalent

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
to like Putt Putt Golf

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
or am I way off

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
I don't know Putt Putt Golf but I assume

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
you do yeah it's the same thing

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
I grew up in Alabama

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
so we had Putt Putt

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
with the big arcade in there you know we also had

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
a place called Mount Asia

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
that was actually like a multi level

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Putt Putt

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
plus arcade

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
I mean that was where I played, what was that?

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Trog

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
oh fuck yeah I do remember Trog

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
and then of course

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
here Dan would tell me about

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
the mine shaft all the time

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
I fucking love the mine shaft that place is the bomb

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
we drove by there on the way out today

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
it's like an abandoned RV place

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
but all the little buildings

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
and stuff and the underground is still there

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
all the structure is still there if somebody wanted to

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
buy it and turn it into a mini golf place again

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
I always refer to the movie

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
The Karate Kid I don't know if you've seen it

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
but there's a scene in the movie when they go on a date

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
and they go to like this big mini

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
golf place and there's arcade machines and stuff

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
and like I remember they're playing the

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
skeet shooting game and he jumps out like don't shoot

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
and she shoots him you know and all that stuff

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
so I figure like every

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
big city has a place like that

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
and so that's golf land for us

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
and what I'm assuming is putt putt golf for you guys

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
and all that stuff so

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
alright

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
well Rachael I'm gonna let you go see if we get any more calls

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
but thanks for the call buddy

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
bye bye you too

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
I'll keep it open just a couple more minutes but not too much

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
longer since we are past nine o'clock

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
and I do want to get to a live

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
stream here in a little bit without keeping

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Bobby up too late he's a night owl

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
anyway but still do you have any

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
last minute stories you want to get to yes I do have

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
one well we see if any calls come in yeah so

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
guitar hero live the GHT

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
service is closing down in

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
December wow

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
okay that is December 1st

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
it'll be shutting down did this just come in

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
well uh yeah it was pretty

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
pretty decent so yeah

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
so the ability to purchase more hero coins

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
um ended a few days

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
I guess on June 1st

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
and it says the

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
iOS version of live

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
uh which is gone from the app store now

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
and they you know players will no

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
longer be able to use their banked hero cash

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
and extra items until or they'll be able to use

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
those until the service shuts down

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
so that's one thing you have to remember with all these

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
games that pushed them you know as being

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
live services like Call of Duty

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
Black Ops 3 or

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
4 you know

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
they eventually shut these live services

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
down when they become not popular anymore

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
that's true I kind of forgot

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
that that was a thing to be honest until you

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
said it shutting down I was like I've seen these

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
like they have guitar hero live

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
like you can get them for like 10

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
15 dollars now like the

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
stores but the ones I've seen have been like for

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and I'm like

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
I don't really want to buy and that's the version

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
with the guitar too by the way

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
yeah all right

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
well I don't see any other calls

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
coming in so I think we are going to go ahead and

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
wrap up for the night so I

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
am going to start to go around and get everybody's

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
final thoughts and

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
thank everybody for being here tonight

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
as I always say at the end of every show

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
be sure to tell a friend or two about

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
the show help us spread the word because

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
we are the show where every gamer has a voice

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
but if the voices aren't here

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
to air then we can't

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
air them so again

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
a nice 5 star review on a site like iTunes

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
also goes an awful long way so if you just let us know

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
like where you heard this podcast from or whatever

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
then you know

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
help us out

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
leave a nice review

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
so I would thank Jason

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
for being here tonight but

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
he fell asleep and I tried

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
to tap him to wake him up he's not responding

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
so he's breathing so don't worry he's fine

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
I hear tiny little snoring

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
so I know he's okay but

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
got a feather? well keep in mind here's

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
the thing he was on the road

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
and he told me he's like I think

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
in the past 48 hours I've slept for like 5

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
so I'm not going to give him too

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
hard of a time or make fun of

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
the fact that our show is that boring

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
yeah I think he's just

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
I don't want his computer to fall either so if he stays

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
asleep I'll close that for him

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
but I will go ahead and thank

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
him for being here anyway even though he

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
fell asleep I tried to

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
wake him up

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
so I'll go around and give everybody else a final thought

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
DarkSocras do you have the mic? do you have a final thought tonight?

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
people need to not voice

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
their opinions when no one has

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
asked them for it like the guy

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
who looked completely homeless

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
living in his truck who said

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
that he thought that my fiat was garbage

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
I told him

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
well at least it serves a purpose unlike you

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
alright ouch

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
my final thought is

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
I

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
I'm going to miss my short

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
work week this week

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
with my 4 day work week was awesome

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
but it's back to 5 days I have a very busy work week

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
next week but

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Pride will be next weekend it looks like I'll probably

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
end up going to that and then Chicago is just 3 weeks away

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
I'm excited for June

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
it'll be fun last but not least Loki your

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
final thought tonight my final

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
thought is I would like to work

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
on games some more

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
like actually working against

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
I'm trying to get an office

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
like a desk because it's hard to

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
work on a laptop just one screen

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
I need like 3 screens or 4 screens

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
probably 3 screens

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
trying to get a desk set up with 2 24 inch monitors

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
on there as well so

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
it'll help with coding and everything

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
alright well that's going to do it

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
