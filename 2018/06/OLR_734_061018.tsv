0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	It's the most wonderful time of the year
18000	23000	When we learn of the games in the near future
23000	27000	We'll discuss mentor hope and so on this show
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Thanks for that, Jason. Hi, welcome back everybody to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	45000	It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 734 of our show for this June 10th, 2018
45000	50000	And yes, it is that time of the year, the most wonderful time of the year to be a gamer
50000	54000	Because we get to find out all the games that we'll be playing about a year and a half from now
54000	58000	It used to be the games that we would play this holiday, but now it's eh, the games we'll play about a year and a half from now
58000	62000	Just kidding, we're not that cynical about it, but it is kind of funny
62000	69000	It's E3 week everybody, and we're here in studio to talk about all the latest and greatest that is unfolding literally before our eyes tonight
69000	73000	My name, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E
73000	76000	Her name, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers
76000	77000	Oh, hi
77000	78000	How are you, Ms. Summers?
78000	79000	Tired
79000	81000	I know, you had a prideful day, right?
81000	82000	I did
82000	83000	Today was Sacramento Pride
83000	87000	I worked a booth at Pride and wandered around all over the place
87000	90000	But I was there with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence
90000	94000	And some of the San Francisco Sisters came out and it was great to see them again
94000	100000	And I just had a really good time, but by the time I was ready to go, I was fucking ready
100000	107000	And I went home and cleaned off all the makeup and exfoliated and sheet masked
107000	110000	And nearly fell asleep with the sheet mask on my face
111000	115000	It's like the equivalent of a waffle iron she puts on her face to remove all the...
115000	116000	No
116000	119000	Well, the makeup may be as thick as a waffle iron
119000	122000	You were all nervous about coming here with no makeup on tonight
122000	125000	Lights, camera, and me without a stitch of makeup on
125000	127000	That's a very obscure movie reference if you get it
127000	132000	I came with the pink powder zit spot stuff on my face
132000	134000	I was gonna say you look marvelous, darling
134000	135000	Thank you
135000	139000	You don't need makeup, but I understand it is part of the sister ritual
139000	144000	Well, yeah, but the thing is that I like, you know, going out with a little bit on
144000	146000	Just because it's artistry for me
146000	148000	And today I was just like...
148000	149000	Lazy Sunday
149000	151000	I do appreciate your rainbow watch, though
151000	152000	You've got a very prideful watch
152000	154000	Oh, yeah, I switched to my pride band
154000	159000	Your LGBTQIA+, et cetera, et cetera
159000	162000	No, I ordered the new pride band
162000	166000	And it didn't arrive yet because I have the new face on my watch, too
166000	168000	Yeah, that has little dancy lines
168000	172000	It is really cool, but I actually like the older pride band better
172000	174000	The new one I wish was on, like, a black background
174000	177000	With the stripes, it would have been better to me
177000	181000	I do want to also introduce the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
181000	183000	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network
183000	185000	vognetwork.com
185000	189000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern
189000	193000	And tonight, obviously, our show is being interrupted by one of the E3 press conferences
193000	194000	But I'll get to that in a minute
194000	196000	But if you are listening live, you can go to live.vognetwork.com
196000	200000	Where JD is saying you don't need makeup, especially for radio
200000	203000	That's true, you know, I've been told plenty of times that I have a face that's perfect for radio
203000	206000	Anyway, also a man fit for radio
206000	208000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki
208000	210000	I don't know how to take that, but sure
210000	212000	It's a compliment, question mark, no I'm just kidding
212000	213000	How are you doing, Loki?
213000	214000	I'm fine
214000	215000	Good, good
215000	217000	Enjoying all these announcements so far?
217000	219000	Most of them, yeah
219000	220000	Yeah
220000	221000	Not so much EAA, but you know
221000	223000	Alright, well, let's jump right in
223000	227000	We only have about 20 minutes before we get to Bethesda's press conference
227000	229000	So here's how it's going to work
229000	232000	So tonight, it's about 6.07 Pacific time
232000	235000	As we're broadcasting live here at the Voice Geeks Network
235000	238000	We are going to kind of pause our show at 6.30
238000	241000	So that we can all watch Bethesda's E3 press conference together
241000	243000	Because there will likely be some big news that comes out of that
243000	246000	We know we're going to get a better look at Fallout 76
246000	249000	Even more so than we saw at Microsoft's event today
249000	251000	So we're going to watch that together
251000	253000	For those of you that are listening live
253000	257000	We have decided this year to do it a little differently than we have in the years past
257000	260000	And as long as the bandwidth cooperates
260000	264000	That's a big footnote because here in the studio the bandwidth is sometimes crappy
264000	266000	We will provide you live commentary tonight
266000	269000	So if you want to keep OLR on while Bethesda's thing is going
269000	272000	We will do live commentary as Bethesda's event is going
272000	275000	Because you guys have asked for it, the live folks in previous years
275000	279000	And if you don't want to listen to that, that's fine
279000	281000	I will not be offended if you turn it off
281000	283000	And come back to us when it's all over
283000	286000	And we'll continue on with news and our regular segments
286000	289000	As we come back into the show
289000	291000	I don't know how long Bethesda is tonight
291000	293000	I don't know if they're 60 minutes or 90 minutes
293000	295000	So I would think they're only 60
295000	298000	Because I wouldn't think they have 90 minutes worth of stuff to announce
298000	302000	But if they were to surprise the hell out of us with Elder Scrolls 6
302000	304000	Which I don't think they will at this point
304000	306000	What continents do they have left?
307000	310000	The undiscovered one that we never knew about until now
310000	313000	That's the clever video game trope
313000	315000	But anyway, I'm not expecting that though
315000	318000	I assume that Fallout 76 is their big title
318000	321000	Maybe they would tease a little bit Elder Scrolls for next year
321000	323000	But I just don't see that happening
323000	325000	But anyway, let's talk about until then
325000	327000	Let's talk about what we've seen so far
327000	330000	So yesterday EA did their bit
330000	332000	And Loki, you watched the whole thing, right?
332000	334000	Yeah, I watched everything
334000	335000	What were your thoughts on EA?
335000	336000	I think it was kind of let down
336000	338000	But I mean, it's typical EA
338000	339000	They didn't really announce too much
339000	343000	Even with Battlefield 5, they did this whole preview thing like a week before
343000	345000	But they didn't really show too much
345000	348000	They kind of talked a little bit about multiplayer
348000	350000	There's going to be, of course, some changes
350000	353000	They reiterated that there's no loot boxes or season passes
353000	357000	However, I overheard someone talking about
357000	361000	The pre-order stuff that they had for Battlefield 5
361000	363000	And then it mentioned airdrops
363000	366000	Which were possibly something alluding to
366000	369000	They're going to have a couple of Macs hooked up to airdrop
369000	371000	Yeah, so a couple
371000	375000	Basically alluding to that there might be some sort of content or something that comes in
375000	376000	But I don't know
376000	380000	So we'll see when it comes out if they actually stick to the no loot box thing
380000	381000	But that's what they said
381000	384000	They announced that they're going to be doing Battle Royale as well for it
384000	386000	Because everybody's got to jump on that bandwagon
386000	388000	And then talking about customization
388000	391000	Their destruction systems getting even better
391000	395000	And they had some other stuff like Grand Operations and whatnot
396000	398000	Then along with that
398000	400000	Of course, they talked about FIFA 19
400000	402000	So they have this new
402000	405000	They have a trial for 18 available now
405000	407000	And then some new Champions League mode
407000	410000	They talked about their EA Cloud streaming service
410000	413000	Which they didn't really say what that was yet
413000	415000	But something that's going to be coming
415000	418000	And that includes this Origin Access Premier
418000	421000	Where you'll be able to access games as they come out
421000	422000	Through Origin
422000	424000	It's $15 a month or $100 a year
424000	427000	How's this different from the EA thing they already have on Xbox?
427000	428000	Or is it kind of like the same thing?
428000	429000	No, EA is
429000	430000	The EA Pass
430000	431000	EA Play
431000	432000	I don't even know what the fuck they call it
432000	433000	I think this is on PC
433000	435000	So there's like a new one for PC
435000	437000	And the one on PC will be new stuff
437000	439000	Whereas the EA catalog on Xbox One
439000	441000	I think it's both new
441000	442000	New and old stuff
442000	443000	Okay
443000	444000	I'm confused
444000	446000	There's a lot of stuff they're trying to sell me
446000	447000	Of course, it's EA
447000	449000	Well that's business, whatever
449000	451000	And then Respawn has a new game coming out
451000	453000	A new Star Wars game
453000	455000	That's going to take place between episodes 3 and 4
455000	457000	This was a holiday 2019
457000	459000	Called Jedi Fallen Order
459000	463000	And then of course they showed off
463000	465000	Some more updates for Battlefield 2
465000	466000	It's going to have a new season
466000	468000	Which is going to be
468000	471000	So that took place in the prequel stuff
471000	473000	So they have new heroes and villains
473000	475000	So General Grievous, Obi-Wan
475000	478000	Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker
478000	480000	And a new Starfighter mode
480000	483000	There's also going to be stuff coming out for the solo movie
483000	485000	So content from that
485000	488000	They announced Unravel 2 which is out today
488000	491000	And so a sequel to their other indie game Unravel
491000	493000	That was kind of part of that EA original thing
493000	495000	Yeah, that was a pleasant little surprise
495000	497000	Especially the fact that it's out today
497000	500000	NBA Live 19 and Madden 19
500000	502000	They showed some trailers for that
502000	507000	Then they had this thing for Command & Conquer Rivals
507000	509000	Which is a new mobile strategy game
509000	512000	Which looked terrible and they spent way too much time on it
512000	514000	You were a big Command & Conquer fan though
514000	515000	I was
515000	517000	This looks like Clash of Clans or something
517000	518000	So no thanks
518000	520000	Ouch, okay
520000	523000	So then they got to Anthem
523000	525000	So Anthem, they had a new trailer
525000	526000	They talked about it once again
526000	528000	No loot boxes or anything like that
528000	530000	They will have cosmetic items but it'll be like
530000	532000	You know what you're getting when you're purchasing them
532000	534000	You can play the game solo
534000	536000	They're going to have a demo for it
536000	538000	Also different clips
538000	540000	They are showing some of the gameplay and stuff
540000	542000	There's four different classes you can play as
542000	544000	Different, what they call
544000	546000	I don't remember what they're calling their
546000	548000	Javelins, their suits, yeah
548000	551000	I still am an extremely bitter Betty
551000	553000	And probably unrationally so, I will own that
553000	555000	When it comes to Anthem, due to
555000	558000	How much of a middle finger
558000	560000	I feel like EA has been giving us
560000	562000	When it comes to Mass Effect
562000	564000	But there's two things
564000	566000	That gave me a little bit of positivity
566000	568000	One, Casey Hudson
568000	570000	Went on record and said Mass Effect's
570000	572000	Not done, I don't even know if you saw that
572000	574000	But Casey Hudson did
574000	576000	I did and then I rolled my eyes really hard
576000	578000	At least they're not done
578000	580000	They're not going to abandon Mass Effect
580000	582000	We're going to have more books
582000	584000	I got the sense they meant games
584000	586000	What I want is that Quarian DLC
586000	588000	Yeah, I don't blame you
588000	590000	But if they decide, you know what, we're going to go
590000	592000	Somewhere completely different next
592000	594000	Or we're going to do, I don't know what's left to do
594000	596000	Maybe they would have to do a prequel to The Shepherd's
596000	598000	Story or something, I don't know where they would go next
598000	600000	But maybe they'll
600000	602000	Do a really fucking ballsy thing
602000	604000	And do Mass Effect 4
604000	606000	They had N7 skins by the way
606000	608000	For the Javelins, I did notice that when they were doing
608000	610000	Their little thing
610000	612000	Keep it, but anyway
612000	614000	I will say this though, at least with as much
614000	616000	Very angry gamer face when it comes to
616000	618000	Anthem right now, because of the hurt I feel
618000	620000	In my heart
620000	622000	I was very encouraged by the fact
622000	624000	That they went out of their way to say
624000	626000	You can do this completely solo
626000	628000	So that tells me there is something to Anthem
628000	630000	Besides just wanting to copy
630000	632000	Destiny completely
632000	634000	If you can play this completely solo
634000	636000	I'm a little more like
636000	638000	Alright
638000	640000	So show me some more video, let's see
640000	642000	I don't know yet though
642000	644000	I'll go back and watch that whole thing later
644000	646000	But just right now, right now I'm still
646000	648000	Feeling hurt
648000	650000	Some folks in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
650000	652000	SHJ100Matt says Anthem looks really neat
652000	654000	Dungeon Buster says they're trying to
654000	656000	In quotes, figure out Mass Effect
656000	658000	You know, aren't we all
658000	660000	And then there was also
660000	662000	Another indie game that they were showing off
662000	664000	Which I can't remember the name of it
664000	666000	Right now, but it was basically this big
666000	668000	Flooded world type thing
668000	670000	That looked kind of cool
670000	672000	So, that was
672000	674000	That, but yeah
674000	676000	With the Command and Conquer rivals though
676000	678000	I can't trust them at all, because I mean look at Dungeon Keeper
678000	680000	That they released, it was just terrible
680000	682000	They like ruined that franchise
682000	684000	By just destroying it with all the crap that you would get
684000	686000	With
686000	688000	Just, you know, your typical mobile game
688000	690000	I don't know, not a fan
690000	692000	Of that
692000	694000	So that was pretty much EA right there
694000	696000	Alright, so let's talk about Microsoft
696000	698000	Which I did watch, I did watch Microsoft
698000	700000	Yeah, Microsoft, they had tons of games
700000	702000	To announce, so lots of stuff they showed off
702000	704000	So a brief tease for a game called
704000	706000	Halo Infinite, not sure what that's
706000	708000	Gonna be, but it is in the Halo universe
708000	710000	Looked like an MMO maybe
710000	712000	It looked really pretty, like when they were showing all the
712000	714000	Really diverse landscapes and stuff
714000	716000	Especially because I was doing the whole
716000	718000	Watching on Mixer in 4K
718000	720000	And I was really impressed with how
720000	722000	Good it looked, so there is that
722000	724000	They had a new
724000	726000	Sequel for Ori
726000	728000	And the Will of the Wisps, that looked pretty nice
728000	730000	That was pretty gorgeous
730000	732000	A new game from software
732000	734000	Or from
734000	736000	From software
736000	738000	Sekiro Shadows Die Twice
738000	740000	Which is almost like a samurai
740000	742000	Ninja Dark Souls
742000	744000	Which is what people are kind of assuming from what we saw
744000	746000	But that looked pretty sweet
746000	748000	But here's the thing, I just have to
748000	750000	Get this out, like although Microsoft
750000	752000	Showed a lot of great games
752000	754000	Like how many of them are Microsoft
754000	756000	Xbox exclusive
756000	758000	Or even Microsoft Xbox
758000	760000	Windows exclusive
760000	762000	A lot of the stuff they showed
762000	764000	Is coming to multiple things
764000	766000	You know what I mean, and that's the one area
766000	768000	Where I do think Microsoft
768000	770000	Still, don't get me wrong
770000	772000	I'm not trying to derail what was
772000	774000	A fun, especially
774000	776000	As the opening act, I think a
776000	778000	Fun tone of games, games, games
778000	780000	To show us at E3
780000	782000	Even if a lot of them were for 2019
782000	784000	We found out
784000	786000	Last night I think the Kingdom Hearts
786000	788000	Was going to get bumped a little bit
788000	790000	We just found out that Crackdown 3
790000	792000	Now it's going to get bumped a little bit
792000	794000	So don't get me wrong, they had this great games, games, games tone
794000	796000	But how much of that was really like
796000	798000	But you need to go get an Xbox One today
798000	800000	Because you are missing the fuck out
800000	802000	If you don't do it
802000	804000	That was the impression I was getting
804000	806000	But don't get me wrong
806000	808000	I enjoyed it just as a
808000	810000	Games keynote
811000	813000	Sorry, I don't mean to jump ahead
813000	815000	But there were some things where I was like
815000	817000	Okay, this is why I own an Xbox One
817000	819000	Because I want to be able to play this
819000	821000	This is why I have a beefy PC
821000	823000	So I can play this
823000	825000	I just had to get that off my chest
825000	827000	They showed off Fallout 76
827000	829000	Which is kind of surprising
829000	831000	Being that we are about to see Bethesda
831000	833000	Which looked interesting
833000	835000	It is a typical Fallout game
835000	837000	Four times the size of the map from Fallout 4
837000	839000	And it looked pretty
840000	842000	So there doesn't seem to be any
842000	844000	Oh, it's an MMO
844000	846000	Or all these things people were anticipating
846000	848000	It could be co-op
848000	850000	They had a new game
850000	852000	That's in
852000	854000	A new game called
854000	856000	The Awesome Adventures of Captain's Spirit
856000	858000	Which is in, I forget, the universe of
858000	860000	Life is Strange
860000	862000	Square Enix's
862000	864000	That's coming out free on the 26th
864000	866000	Well, I imagine it's like Life is Strange
866000	868000	Where the first episode is free
869000	871000	That's cool
871000	873000	They showed Crackdown 3
873000	875000	February is when that's coming out
875000	877000	How did you like that though?
877000	879000	It looks nice
879000	881000	I'm excited for it
881000	883000	I just wish it was coming out this year
883000	885000	Yeah, but they gotta take the time to get it right
885000	887000	How much time do they fucking need?
887000	889000	It's been like four years now
889000	891000	4K is probably a bigger pain in the ass
891000	893000	than people think
893000	895000	I love the Tron look of it
895000	897000	For the record
898000	900000	As God's Edition
900000	902000	February 26th
902000	904000	It's kind of remastered and everything
904000	906000	Metro Exodus
906000	908000	Everybody in chat is trying to correct me
908000	910000	On the whole free thing where they say
910000	912000	100% free
912000	914000	But doesn't that still leave the door open?
914000	916000	Sure, the first episode that they just showed us
916000	918000	That is this
918000	920000	Is 100% free
920000	922000	But then they're gonna sell more episodes
922000	924000	Don't you make video games to make money?
924000	926000	There's gotta be a catch here
927000	929000	If it is 100% free
929000	931000	If it's a one-off side story thing
931000	933000	That's maybe trying to push back copies of Life is Strange
933000	935000	Then great
935000	937000	I still took 100% free
937000	939000	To mean
939000	941000	It's like a little teaser for something else
941000	943000	JD says
943000	945000	It's a promo for Life is Strange 2
945000	947000	Okay
947000	949000	Then fine
949000	951000	It's 100% free
951000	953000	Sorry Loki
953000	955000	I gotta pay attention to chat
956000	958000	They showed off a new trailer for Metro Exodus
958000	960000	Which looked pretty cool
960000	962000	Kingdom Hearts 3 had a new trailer
962000	964000	Metro is coming out February 22
964000	966000	Kingdom Hearts January 29th
966000	968000	They showed off
968000	970000	I don't know if they mentioned it before
970000	972000	The Frozen world
972000	974000	They have Frozen and stuff
974000	976000	As much as I'm over Frozen
976000	978000	Again
978000	980000	Getting to watch that in 4K
980000	982000	You can just see how fucking good it looks
982000	984000	With all the particle effects
984000	986000	And the additional neon
986000	988000	They throw in it
988000	990000	The summons and the way that Wreck-It Ralph
990000	992000	Looks like a digitized arcade
992000	994000	It looks
994000	996000	Really good
996000	998000	The graphics have come so far
998000	1000000	From Kingdom Hearts 2
1000000	1002000	They showed off
1002000	1004000	There's two expansions coming for Sea of Thieves
1004000	1006000	Cursed
1006000	1008000	Cursed Sails
1008000	1010000	I don't remember the other one
1010000	1012000	They have those coming out
1013000	1015000	They showed off another trailer for Battlefield 5
1015000	1017000	Which is the one that EA was telling you
1017000	1019000	Tune in for this peek at the
1019000	1021000	Blah blah blah
1021000	1023000	It was so brief
1023000	1025000	I thought they were going to do a deeper dive into it
1025000	1027000	But they didn't
1027000	1029000	What they did do a pretty deep dive into
1029000	1031000	Was Forza Horizon 4
1031000	1033000	Which is going to be coming out in October
1033000	1035000	What's awesome about that is
1035000	1037000	In Britain this time
1037000	1039000	They have the different seasons
1039000	1041000	I don't know if that's going to sync with the actual seasons
1041000	1043000	What part of the world is it going to sync to
1043000	1045000	I don't know but it looked cool
1045000	1047000	I'm down for that
1047000	1049000	We Happy Few is going to be finished
1049000	1051000	August 10th
1051000	1053000	They of course announced that they had bought a bunch of companies
1053000	1055000	This was the biggest news
1055000	1057000	The whole night in my opinion
1057000	1059000	They acquired four and built one
1059000	1061000	Right?
1061000	1063000	That's huge
1063000	1065000	The fact that they have Ninja Theory
1065000	1067000	I kind of think this is something they should have done
1067000	1069000	Two or three years ago
1069000	1071000	They identified that their exclusives
1071000	1073000	Were not really holding up
1073000	1075000	Next to Sony's as well
1075000	1077000	But I guess better late than never
1077000	1079000	The problem is you're not really going to see the effects of this
1079000	1081000	For another couple years I don't think
1081000	1083000	And these new games that these companies are making
1083000	1085000	But no disrespect
1085000	1087000	I still think Xbox is in a much better place
1087000	1089000	Under Phil Spencer than it was previously
1089000	1091000	So again, no hate
1091000	1093000	It would have been really exciting
1093000	1095000	To see this a couple years ago
1095000	1097000	And then of course
1097000	1099000	We showed off another trailer for PUBG
1099000	1101000	Then there was a bunch of different announcements
1101000	1103000	Tales of Vesperia
1103000	1105000	Definitive Edition coming out this winter
1105000	1107000	Also on the Switch
1107000	1109000	Tom Clancy's The Division 2
1109000	1111000	Why Ubisoft?
1111000	1113000	Why did you have to do the fake
1113000	1115000	Co-op chatter?
1115000	1117000	That fake Co-op chatter is like
1117000	1119000	The one time a year
1119000	1121000	Where I feel like I can actually hear
1121000	1123000	People playing a game together online
1123000	1125000	And treating each other with respect
1125000	1127000	It's like a nice change of pace
1127000	1129000	Where I'm like, wait a minute
1129000	1131000	Two women are playing this demo with two guys
1131000	1133000	And they're not being asked about their boobs
1133000	1135000	They're being treated respectfully
1135000	1137000	The guys aren't calling each other
1137000	1139000	Fancy ass guys
1139000	1141000	You know what I mean?
1141000	1143000	Everybody is being very respectful
1143000	1145000	And I'm like, I almost prefer
1145000	1147000	Fake dialogue planet
1147000	1149000	How do I get an account on Xbox fake?
1149000	1151000	Alright, well whatever
1151000	1153000	They had a new trailer for Shadow of the Tomb Raider
1153000	1155000	They have a session
1155000	1157000	Which is basically
1157000	1159000	Standing in for Skate 4
1159000	1161000	Because there is no Skate 4
1161000	1163000	And the new Tomb Raider
1163000	1165000	Lara Croft's No Good
1165000	1167000	Very Bad Day in Latin America
1167000	1169000	And then we have
1169000	1171000	A new MMORPG called
1171000	1173000	Black Desert
1173000	1175000	Which is supposed to be out this fall
1175000	1177000	Black Desert Online is already on PC
1177000	1179000	Is that not the same thing?
1179000	1181000	And they showed it last year too by the way
1181000	1183000	Don't be wrong
1183000	1185000	It looked really good
1185000	1187000	I remember last year going, wow this game looks really good
1187000	1189000	And somebody tweeted me
1189000	1191000	Black Desert Online is already on PC and it's not good
1191000	1193000	And I was like, oh well alright
1193000	1195000	Womp womp
1195000	1197000	Then they had of course Devil May Cry 5
1197000	1199000	Which they showed off
1199000	1201000	Cuphead in the delicious last course
1201000	1203000	Which is DLC for Cuphead
1203000	1205000	That sounds like fun
1205000	1207000	And they have a new playable character
1207000	1209000	And crying
1209000	1211000	Cuphead of course
1211000	1213000	But work Miss Chalice
1213000	1215000	There's a new character
1215000	1217000	Miss Chalice
1217000	1219000	It's like Mugman with a bow in her hair
1219000	1221000	No I'm just kidding
1221000	1223000	Totally fleshed out character
1223000	1225000	They had a game called Tunic
1225000	1227000	Which looks like Zelda
1227000	1229000	That was my favorite thing
1229000	1231000	Second favorite thing
1231000	1233000	The Legend of Little Cute Fox
1233000	1235000	Jump Force
1235000	1237000	Which is Shonen Jump
1237000	1239000	It looked like a fighting game
1239000	1241000	Anime is real
1241000	1243000	Dying Light 2
1243000	1245000	Battletoads
1245000	1247000	Actually new Battletoads
1247000	1249000	But they didn't show anything
1249000	1251000	They didn't show anything but say it's happening
1251000	1253000	And it had a sense of humor
1253000	1255000	Don't get me wrong
1255000	1257000	It's nice to have that confirmation of the thing we've been saying should be happening for years
1257000	1259000	Just Cause 4
1259000	1261000	Which is awesome
1261000	1263000	That's coming out this year as well
1263000	1265000	And then this is where they started teasing all the Gears of War stuff
1265000	1267000	So they first said
1267000	1269000	Oh yeah we got new Gears of War
1269000	1271000	Gears of War Pop figure
1271000	1273000	Mobile game
1273000	1275000	There was like awww
1275000	1277000	And they're like just kidding
1277000	1279000	We actually have a real Gears game coming out
1279000	1281000	Gears Tactics
1281000	1283000	And then they're like oh just kidding
1283000	1285000	Gears 5
1285000	1287000	So there's a new Gears game coming
1287000	1289000	The three of them
1289000	1291000	And they're going in a completely different direction with Gears with this
1291000	1293000	They switch the protagonist to
1293000	1295000	My Gears characters as well
1295000	1297000	But the way it's set up you're not playing as Phoenix
1297000	1299000	You're playing as the female
1299000	1301000	In their group
1301000	1303000	Who I don't know her name so I apologize
1303000	1305000	But then it looks like her and one of the other guys
1305000	1307000	That was kind of like the side character
1307000	1309000	In the earlier games
1309000	1311000	This is their game
1311000	1313000	So they go off together
1313000	1315000	I'm all for strong female leads
1315000	1317000	So let's make those
1317000	1319000	People that don't get it cry
1319000	1321000	And that was supposed to be
1321000	1323000	The end of the show and then the one more thing
1323000	1325000	They showed off a trailer for Cyberpunk
1325000	1327000	2077 it looked fucking awesome
1327000	1329000	That looked hot
1329000	1331000	Yeah that looked really hot
1331000	1333000	If you don't know that's being done by CD Projekt Red
1333000	1335000	Who did The Witcher 3
1335000	1337000	And obviously The Witcher before that
1337000	1339000	Witcher 3 is an extremely cinematic game
1339000	1341000	So now it's like okay instead of like the medieval
1341000	1343000	Setting that The Witcher games were in
1343000	1345000	Now it's going to be like a cyberpunk setting
1345000	1347000	It has a really great look to it
1347000	1349000	And then of course they were talking about Games Pass as well
1349000	1351000	You still get all these
1351000	1353000	First party games out day in
1353000	1355000	Date with Crackdown 3
1355000	1357000	And Forza
1357000	1359000	Horizon 4 are going to be coming out
1359000	1361000	Their Netflix type of thing
1361000	1363000	Which by the way since you went through it so fast
1363000	1365000	I did not get a chance to fanboy about Forza Horizon 4
1365000	1367000	But it looks so good
1367000	1369000	It looks so good
1369000	1371000	Oh my god it was like one of those things
1371000	1373000	I had my tweet deck up on one screen
1373000	1375000	While I'm watching the press event
1375000	1377000	On the other screen and as I'm watching the tweet
1377000	1379000	That go by there's all these people that are like
1379000	1381000	Yawn car game
1381000	1383000	Yawn potty break I gotta go poop
1383000	1385000	It's a Forza game and I'm like
1385000	1387000	If I knew where you lived
1387000	1389000	I would be banging pots and pans over your head
1389000	1391000	While you sleep until you play Forza
1391000	1393000	Forza Horizon
1393000	1395000	Specifically because look look I get it I get it
1395000	1397000	I'm not super into the Gran Turismo games
1397000	1399000	Or even the mainline Forza series
1399000	1401000	The car sim games don't do it for me
1401000	1403000	But Horizon is like
1403000	1405000	Mario Kart
1405000	1407000	Without the items
1407000	1409000	And it's like in a real setting
1409000	1411000	With awesome like
1411000	1413000	Euro rave
1413000	1415000	Techno stuff
1415000	1417000	And it's fucking great
1417000	1419000	They have seasons now so like they're showing off this one lake
1419000	1421000	And they're all well in the winter it'll be frozen
1421000	1423000	You can drive over the lake and yes
1423000	1425000	Yes so I'm down and down
1425000	1427000	Locopogo says I don't even like Forza games
1427000	1429000	Forza Horizons look great
1429000	1431000	That is the correct attitude to have on my Twitter
1431000	1433000	Thank you very much
1433000	1435000	Everybody's backing up a little bit there
1435000	1437000	And well we're almost at conference time
1437000	1439000	But I just want to mention one last thing
1439000	1441000	Because they did talk about a bunch of games
1441000	1443000	PlayStation T is a bunch of stuff
1443000	1445000	But of course we have to talk about Tetris Effect
1445000	1447000	Oh my god like
1447000	1449000	E3 is done
1449000	1451000	Tetris Effect I am so here for it
1451000	1453000	Yay
1453000	1455000	It's like Tetris getting the luminous effect
1455000	1457000	Mizuguchi Tetris
1457000	1459000	And again the people replying to that on Twitter
1459000	1461000	They're like it's just Tetris
1461000	1463000	I'm like I will cyberbully you
1463000	1465000	Like I am all for
1465000	1467000	I am all for treating people with respect
1467000	1469000	And dignity online
1469000	1471000	But if you come after Tetris Effect
1471000	1473000	I will cyberbully you
1473000	1475000	I will alright
1475000	1477000	Alright let's do this
1477000	1479000	Alright so we're gonna have to switch over to Bethesda
1479000	1481000	So for the podcast listeners we're gonna get a little break

1485000	1487000	Save break you're gonna hear some silence

1507000	1509000	To Orange Lounge Radio
1509000	1511000	Live here during this
1511000	1513000	Special E3 edition
1513000	1515000	We just got done watching
1515000	1517000	The Bethesda press conference
1517000	1519000	So for the live folks
1519000	1521000	You guys
1521000	1523000	Actually yeah sorry we have a
1523000	1525000	The joy of live radio is that we have our
1525000	1527000	Live thing playing okay I just need to
1527000	1529000	Like turn off the system over here
1529000	1531000	So we get no more input from
1531000	1533000	YouTube on auto forwarding us to other streams
1533000	1535000	Anyway so
1535000	1537000	Some of you were listening along some of you weren't
1537000	1539000	I saw mostly encouraging words there in
1539000	1541000	Chat on the commentary but not everybody
1541000	1543000	Is in the commentary so some of you didn't listen
1543000	1545000	To it and that's fine so let's talk a little
1545000	1547000	About especially for the sake of the podcast folks
1547000	1549000	What we just saw although
1549000	1551000	Before we get into that let me quickly
1551000	1553000	What you may not have heard if
1553000	1555000	You're listening on the podcast feed
1555000	1557000	During that time that Bethesda's thing was going on
1557000	1559000	Jamie had to bow out
1559000	1561000	So she is no longer here
1561000	1563000	In the studio but who is
1563000	1565000	Joining us in the studio is an old friend
1565000	1567000	Of the show an old friend
1567000	1569000	Of mine goes way back we used to do some
1569000	1571000	Other shows together welcome back
1571000	1573000	To OLR everybody Extover
1573000	1575000	Hey hi nice to have you here
1575000	1577000	I'm doing uh oh
1577000	1579000	You didn't ask how I was doing
1579000	1581000	When Sky's on a show happening
1581000	1583000	Oh
1583000	1585000	That little thing
1585000	1587000	How are you doing? I'm doing fine
1587000	1589000	How are you? Good good
1589000	1591000	I'm great you know watching some video
1591000	1593000	Games yeah nice
1593000	1595000	So alright fun time of the year
1595000	1597000	It is it's like the gamers
1597000	1599000	Gamers Christmas in some ways right
1599000	1601000	It's when we get to see what's coming out not for holiday
1601000	1603000	Anymore but for next year
1603000	1605000	I know yeah mostly next year
1605000	1607000	Yeah alright
1607000	1609000	Let's run down kind of some of the things we just saw
1609000	1611000	So overall what did you guys think of the Bethesda
1611000	1613000	It was really padded out
1613000	1615000	Yeah I don't know
1615000	1617000	If it needed to be 90 minutes
1617000	1619000	But you know there was still some
1619000	1621000	Good stuff it was interesting and this is
1621000	1623000	What I wanted to ask on the commentary feed
1623000	1625000	That I said I'll wait and ask this on the main show
1625000	1627000	So we were kind of talking at the end there
1627000	1629000	So obviously Fallout 76 was one of the last things
1629000	1631000	They showed and so we got the confirmation
1631000	1633000	That it's going to be like an online
1633000	1635000	Type of game that's the direction it's going
1635000	1637000	So it's going to be a little more multiplayer
1637000	1639000	Which looks really cool you know
1639000	1641000	I never have gotten super into the Fallout games
1641000	1643000	But I imagine like if you are a fan of
1643000	1645000	Fallout like this is probably like the type of thing you've been waiting
1645000	1647000	A very long time for so I know there's probably
1647000	1649000	Going to be a lot of happy people about that
1649000	1651000	And then I was kind of thinking okay well that's
1651000	1653000	Where they're going to end it right
1653000	1655000	Well they didn't end it with that they had this Elder Scrolls
1655000	1657000	Blades that they showed off which you
1657000	1659000	Were saying was originally a PSP thing
1659000	1661000	I thought it was a PSP thing I remember they were doing
1661000	1663000	A PSP game or they were trying
1663000	1665000	To do a PSP game but you know
1665000	1667000	You just can't run the Elder Scrolls
1667000	1669000	On a PSP right so
1669000	1671000	It just didn't turn out
1671000	1673000	That it would be anything but so then
1673000	1675000	They kind of had that going and said okay this is going
1675000	1677000	To be on mobile
1677000	1679000	It's going to be on Switch
1679000	1681000	Consoles it's going to be on virtual reality
1681000	1683000	Like if it fucking has a screen
1683000	1685000	We're putting it on there almost
1685000	1687000	An illusion to that little funny bit they did
1687000	1689000	Where they did Skyrim on the Alexa
1689000	1691000	That was hilarious yeah that was really funny
1691000	1693000	Does it have a mode to clean that shit up?
1693000	1695000	That was my favorite line of holding
1695000	1697000	So but then after that they said
1697000	1699000	You know we want to tease you
1699000	1701000	About stuff out in the future too
1701000	1703000	Because I think they probably have a sense
1703000	1705000	That we're all sitting here going
1705000	1707000	Elder Scrolls 6 Elder Scrolls 6
1707000	1709000	Elder Scrolls 6 so sure enough
1709000	1711000	They give us first a game called
1711000	1713000	Starfield which is
1713000	1715000	It was nothing except
1715000	1717000	It's a space game it's a new IP that's all we know
1717000	1719000	And then there it was
1719000	1721000	The Elder Scrolls 6 but
1721000	1723000	All we really saw was like
1723000	1725000	A landscape
1725000	1727000	Elder Scrolls 6 is coming after Starfield
1727000	1729000	Some music
1729000	1731000	Well not necessarily because Starfield
1731000	1733000	Could be mid next year
1733000	1735000	Maybe not you're right
1735000	1737000	Or 2021
1737000	1739000	So anyway what did you guys think
1739000	1741000	Of that concept of
1741000	1743000	Leaving us at the very
1743000	1745000	End with a really big
1745000	1747000	Tease and you know honestly
1747000	1749000	Microsoft kind of did this too
1749000	1751000	When they said we're working on
1751000	1753000	The next Xbox I mean
1753000	1755000	Xboxes
1755000	1757000	Oh yeah okay they said they're working on the next
1757000	1759000	Xboxes plural
1759000	1761000	Little bit of a tease in itself too I mean
1761000	1763000	We all know these hardware
1763000	1765000	Things are planned years out
1765000	1767000	So of course Sony is working on
1767000	1769000	PlayStation 5 I see where you're going with that
1769000	1771000	So what do you think though about these
1771000	1773000	Extended teases
1773000	1775000	I mean we're making all these jokes about how we're
1775000	1777000	Seeing games in 2019 but now
1777000	1779000	These like final notes that we're getting left on
1779000	1781000	On these press conferences are
1781000	1783000	Here's the long play
1783000	1785000	Oh I think it's designed for people
1785000	1787000	For the consumers
1787000	1789000	To keep that in mind
1789000	1791000	It's like designed for us to be like
1791000	1793000	Oh I have a lot more to look forward to
1793000	1795000	So I just I need to keep
1795000	1797000	Subscribing to their newsletter
1797000	1799000	Or just like hey you know we've heard you
1799000	1801000	Working on it you know you can stop asking us
1801000	1803000	Now it is in development it's just true
1803000	1805000	It's a long ways out you know type of thing
1805000	1807000	But I mean did they have
1807000	1809000	To confirm that they're working on an Elder Scrolls
1809000	1811000	Game we all of course they're fucking doing
1811000	1813000	Elder Scrolls 6 I think they did
1813000	1815000	No I think they still needed to
1815000	1817000	They needed to like try to meet expectations
1817000	1819000	Okay for what it's worth
1819000	1821000	I'll give them this It's just like Metroid Prime
1821000	1823000	4 last year all we saw was
1823000	1825000	Like yeah we're working on it I'll give them this
1825000	1827000	At least it was like Elder Scrolls 6
1827000	1829000	And not Elder Scrolls
1829000	1831000	Forever
1831000	1833000	You know or something
1833000	1835000	But I think it's different
1835000	1837000	Than the Metroid Prime 4
1837000	1839000	I feel like Metroid Prime 4
1839000	1841000	Is happening this year I feel like it's not
1841000	1843000	Quite the extended tease
1843000	1845000	But I think the way it's different
1845000	1847000	Is that I mean I don't know I can't speak
1847000	1849000	For the Elder Scrolls fandom
1849000	1851000	But with the Metroid fandom
1851000	1853000	We were all like
1853000	1855000	Anxious because we thought Nintendo
1855000	1857000	Had given up on Metroid
1857000	1859000	Honestly we didn't think we didn't
1859000	1861000	Know for sure if it was in the cards right
1861000	1863000	So that was like a big surprise
1863000	1865000	But did you did the Elder Scrolls
1865000	1867000	Community like did they ever
1867000	1869000	Doubt that another Elder Scrolls
1869000	1871000	Game was ever gonna come out I thought for sure
1871000	1873000	That they would do something like an
1873000	1875000	Elder Scrolls 4 remastered
1875000	1877000	Or something like that you know just like
1877000	1879000	Yeah I thought there'd be like an Oblivion remaster
1879000	1881000	Like a remaster just you know bring it into the new engine
1881000	1883000	There still could be
1883000	1885000	It's not something they need to announce months and months out
1885000	1887000	You know
1887000	1889000	Anything else you guys want to highlight from that conference
1889000	1891000	That we saw for those of you listening on the podcast feed
1891000	1893000	We will offer that comment some people
1893000	1895000	Cause we kind of got a little bit off topic
1895000	1897000	In some places so if you have an hour
1897000	1899000	There was much much
1899000	1901000	Objectification of the developers
1901000	1903000	By the males
1903000	1905000	Not including myself
1905000	1907000	Why would you do that? Rob
1907000	1909000	Anyway you robbed me
1909000	1911000	If you want to hear that
1911000	1913000	That will be posted on our social media channels
1913000	1915000	This is an exclusive over at Twitter
1915000	1917000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
1917000	1919000	It'll also be on our Facebook
1919000	1921000	Facebook.com slash orange launch radio
1921000	1923000	And it'll be posted first
1923000	1925000	In our Discord over at vognetwork.com
1925000	1927000	Slash Discord so check it out
1927000	1929000	I think that the very first part
1929000	1931000	Of the whole conference
1931000	1933000	Should have just like they should have not
1933000	1935000	Done it I mean I get it for entertainment
1935000	1937000	Value yay we have a big rock band
1937000	1939000	But you know what nobody in the audience
1939000	1941000	Was excited
1941000	1943000	They showed the audience and they're all like
1943000	1945000	Really old white nerds
1945000	1947000	I just realized you are way louder than
1947000	1949000	Jamie is
1949000	1951000	Sorry for the volume issues
1951000	1953000	Old white nerds sitting in
1953000	1955000	There going like looking
1955000	1957000	Like they don't belong
1957000	1959000	Well no they're probably just like dude I came here to see video games
1959000	1961000	Not watching Andrew WK not that
1961000	1963000	We hate Andrew WK but it's like dude
1963000	1965000	Come on
1965000	1967000	Let's get the show on the road here
1967000	1969000	To watch a concert or watch a
1969000	1971000	You know a band play
1971000	1973000	I thought it wasn't like
1973000	1975000	I thought the Rage 2
1975000	1977000	Thing went on a little long
1977000	1979000	Yes
1979000	1981000	It looks okay
1981000	1983000	It's by Avalanche they did you know
1983000	1985000	They've done the Just Cause games
1985000	1987000	Avalanche actually
1987000	1989000	I'm sorry my studio is confused here
1989000	1991000	I think they did
1991000	1993000	I think Avalanche was Just Cause
1993000	1995000	And Mad Max
1995000	1997000	That or it might have been
1997000	1999000	What was the other one that was EA
1999000	2001000	I don't remember no that was Pandemic
2001000	2003000	Never mind
2003000	2005000	So yeah they did Mad Max and stuff
2005000	2007000	So it looks very much like Mad Max or like a
2007000	2009000	Borderlands type game just you know not with the
2009000	2011000	Stylized graphics
2011000	2013000	Just a couple other quick things I want to hit and then I'll open it up
2013000	2015000	If you guys have anything you want to add but
2015000	2017000	Doom Infinite so we have
2017000	2019000	Eternal
2019000	2021000	It's a stupid name
2021000	2023000	Insert forever
2023000	2025000	Synonym here
2025000	2027000	It's the new Rage in gaming
2027000	2029000	Doom Eternal
2029000	2031000	They said that's a thing
2031000	2033000	But they didn't really show us
2033000	2035000	Stay tuned for QuakeCon for more
2035000	2037000	Which was lame
2037000	2039000	A little bit of a disappointment
2039000	2041000	I guess it wasn't much more than they showed at the end
2041000	2043000	They had to make room for
2043000	2045000	Andrew WK
2045000	2047000	We knew that Doom would get a sequel
2047000	2049000	So that's not too surprising
2049000	2051000	And it's probably still a ways out
2052000	2054000	Yeah that's kind of like a little spin off
2054000	2056000	And then that Elder Scrolls
2056000	2058000	card game is coming to Switch
2058000	2060000	Except they didn't really say that
2060000	2062000	You just see it in the trailer
2062000	2064000	They were very clearly playing it on a Nintendo Switch
2064000	2066000	So it does seem like
2066000	2068000	Bethesda is showing the Switch a lot of love
2068000	2070000	If you're a Nintendo fan you probably love them
2070000	2072000	Bethesda right now because they also just put Fallout
2072000	2074000	Shelter out right now on the
2074000	2076000	Switch so I bet there's some people probably
2076000	2078000	downloading it
2078000	2080000	Fallout Shelter they said was now right?
2080000	2082000	Am I crazy? Didn't they say they were putting that out right now?
2082000	2084000	I don't remember. I'm glad they did
2084000	2086000	So anyway
2086000	2088000	Alright
2088000	2090000	And they're saying in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
2090000	2092000	S2100Matt says
2092000	2094000	Apparently Andrew WK did another concert
2094000	2096000	after the show
2096000	2098000	Kaijuto in chat says E3 should be fun
2098000	2100000	Not just trailers and predictable crowd reactions
2100000	2102000	I know but like with other like
2102000	2104000	They've done that before with I don't know if it was
2104000	2106000	Microsoft or Sony they'll do like a musical number
2106000	2108000	Like either at the end I think
2108000	2110000	Do it for the crowd
2110000	2112000	Warm them up and everything
2112000	2114000	But like you know if you tell me to tune in at 6.30
2114000	2116000	to see game trailers I want to see game trailers
2116000	2118000	Or like if you're doing that concert
2118000	2120000	where he's playing live you know playing the song live
2120000	2122000	Do it to like gameplay
2122000	2124000	video or something like that
2124000	2126000	Mix it in
2126000	2128000	Things like that assume
2128000	2130000	that all of us that like games
2130000	2132000	like Rage also like that kind of music
2132000	2134000	And I don't like that kind of music
2134000	2136000	But yet I do like
2136000	2138000	games like Rage
2138000	2140000	So for me it's not entertaining
2140000	2142000	I don't care what people say
2142000	2144000	That's not entertaining
2144000	2146000	That's just padding the show and saying
2146000	2148000	Hey we got this famous person
2148000	2150000	Love us because we're cool
2150000	2152000	and hip but we got this stupid
2152000	2154000	heavy metal band
2154000	2156000	Hey we got this famous person
2156000	2158000	It's fine whatever
2158000	2160000	I would say overall though
2160000	2162000	I do feel very positive on Bethesda
2162000	2164000	I do like that they were
2164000	2166000	willing to tease past the next year
2166000	2168000	You know and I kinda
2168000	2170000	You know and I've talked about this on a previous
2170000	2172000	OLR like the movie industry
2172000	2174000	Fuck we know Marvel's plan for like the next four
2174000	2176000	years right so why doesn't the
2176000	2178000	gaming industry like are they afraid
2178000	2180000	that somebody's gonna steal the idea or something like
2180000	2182000	I don't know yes I would actually see yes
2182000	2184000	because look at like look at all these
2184000	2186000	battle royale games coming up I guess that's true
2186000	2188000	But okay for all we know Elder Scrolls 6
2188000	2190000	is battle royale
2190000	2192000	We don't need to necessarily know that tonight
2192000	2194000	Elder Scrolls 6 should be multiplayer that'd be pretty awesome
2194000	2196000	I don't wanna even tease
2196000	2198000	the potential but it could be
2198000	2200000	but it could be alright anyway
2200000	2202000	Moving on
2202000	2204000	So anything else you guys wanna say on
2204000	2206000	Bethesda?
2206000	2208000	No I don't have anything
2208000	2210000	It was alright it just seemed like a bit slower paced this year
2210000	2212000	and they really dragged it out I don't think it needed to be 90 minutes
2212000	2214000	long and I just felt last year
2214000	2216000	they announced it was like more kind of exciting announcements
2216000	2218000	They had some that were pretty cool
2218000	2220000	but most of it was just kinda like
2220000	2222000	I'm bored
2222000	2224000	Honestly last year because they did the whole
2224000	2226000	Bethesda land thing and that was all
2226000	2228000	really it was you know
2228000	2230000	I felt like it was more concise
2230000	2232000	you know what I mean it felt like everything was just like
2232000	2234000	in this neat little package
2234000	2236000	so we didn't have time
2236000	2238000	to like pan or have those awkward
2238000	2240000	moments cause it was all like you know pre-done
2240000	2242000	Yeah
2242000	2244000	Okay so I am gonna do our gaming weeks
2244000	2246000	real quick here I will ask Loki
2246000	2248000	can you be prepared to run through some headlines here in a moment
2248000	2250000	just as soon as we are done
2250000	2252000	so we can touch on some other things that have been happening
2252000	2254000	during E3 we'll talk about our gaming weeks
2254000	2256000	a quick housekeeping thing though since Jamie
2256000	2258000	did have to leave earlier than expected cause we
2258000	2260000	thought that thing would only be an hour
2260000	2262000	and it ended up being 90 minutes there's actually
2262000	2264000	not gonna be a classic game this week so it's
2264000	2266000	kind of a rarity in OLR history
2266000	2268000	so we're gonna roll she actually I guess
2268000	2270000	I gotta say this she was going to do a peripheral
2270000	2272000	tonight so we will roll that over
2272000	2274000	till next week which is our big
2274000	2276000	and it's a good knowing
2276000	2278000	what it already is it is a good one
2278000	2280000	for the 16th anniversary of the show that's all
2280000	2282000	I'll say it's a good choice for
2282000	2284000	our anniversary which is coming up next week
2284000	2286000	so we will
2286000	2288000	though talk about our gaming weeks so
2288000	2290000	Exeter I'll actually start with you if you want to talk about any
2290000	2292000	video games you've been playing what are games
2292000	2294000	you're enjoying lately
2294000	2296000	like Greece I know you've been very busy
2296000	2298000	preparing for your move but surely you've snuck
2298000	2300000	a game in here and there
2300000	2302000	so you know I'm addicted
2302000	2304000	to Binding of Isaac so really that's my
2304000	2306000	that's my go to game to like
2306000	2308000	just pick up and play you know
2308000	2310000	and not worry about anything like
2310000	2312000	you know worrying about paying attention to
2312000	2314000	story or anything like that just to pick up
2314000	2316000	and play a game so I can spend
2316000	2318000	hours in it
2318000	2320000	and so that's that's
2320000	2322000	that's pretty much what I've been playing
2322000	2324000	oh
2324000	2326000	I did play a little bit of
2326000	2328000	Overwatch on my Xbox
2328000	2330000	you know I was
2330000	2332000	I was actually testing
2332000	2334000	I was doing it to test out the
2334000	2336000	Wi-Fi on the Xbox because we were
2336000	2338000	we were putting as
2338000	2340000	everybody heard on the live
2340000	2342000	on the Bethesda stream or whatever
2342000	2344000	I am moving to North Carolina
2344000	2346000	so we've had to unhook
2346000	2348000	everything and so because I unhooked
2348000	2350000	the ethernet cable I was like I wonder
2350000	2352000	what the Wi-Fi is like so I tested Overwatch
2352000	2354000	and I ended up playing like three hours
2354000	2356000	of Overwatch and I'm like oh my
2356000	2358000	god like you just can easily get sucked
2358000	2360000	back into that game right yeah
2360000	2362000	but but yeah
2362000	2364000	I have a lot of games that
2364000	2366000	I'm meaning to go back to
2366000	2368000	but I just
2368000	2370000	haven't for whatever reason
2370000	2372000	like I started a way out
2372000	2374000	I've been playing it with Flaco Jones
2374000	2376000	and we
2376000	2378000	we had a really good time playing that so
2378000	2380000	but that's dependent on his schedule
2380000	2382000	you know being available right so
2382000	2384000	so we're not gonna play I'm not gonna
2384000	2386000	finish it until I know that he's
2386000	2388000	available to finish it so anyway
2388000	2390000	alright
2390000	2392000	I'll talk about Mike
2392000	2394000	are we allowed to talk about where your man
2394000	2396000	works or do we want to keep that off here?
2396000	2398000	oh I think we've already said he works for Ubisoft
2398000	2400000	but he wouldn't
2400000	2402000	talk obviously
2402000	2404000	I don't know
2404000	2406000	even you don't know what he's working on?
2406000	2408000	well it was announced today
2408000	2410000	Division 2
2410000	2412000	so you knew
2412000	2414000	so I know what he's going to be working on
2414000	2416000	I don't know the details or anything
2416000	2418000	but yeah he got transferred
2418000	2420000	he was so
2420000	2422000	he
2422000	2424000	worked for San Francisco
2424000	2426000	Studio, Ubisoft
2426000	2428000	you can see him in Rocksmith
2428000	2430000	promo videos if I remember right wasn't he
2430000	2432000	in the Rocksmith promo?
2432000	2434000	he worked a lot
2434000	2436000	on Rocksmith and then he worked
2436000	2438000	very heavily on South Park
2438000	2440000	the Fractured But Whole
2440000	2442000	and he I giggle every time
2442000	2444000	I know I know I giggle
2444000	2446000	and then he
2446000	2448000	decided that
2448000	2450000	Bay Area expensive
2450000	2452000	hard to raise a family
2452000	2454000	we eventually want to have kids
2454000	2456000	so he thought
2456000	2458000	it might be a better idea to
2458000	2460000	just try and get a transfer to the
2460000	2462000	Ubisoft studio in
2462000	2464000	North Carolina and
2464000	2466000	basically their name is Red Storm
2466000	2468000	Entertainment and they work on a lot of the
2468000	2470000	Tom Clancy
2470000	2472000	so Division is
2472000	2474000	the game that they work on
2474000	2476000	in tandem with
2476000	2478000	Massive Entertainment
2478000	2480000	Massive is the main studio
2480000	2482000	and they're the ones in Sweden
2482000	2484000	Malmo, Sweden
2484000	2486000	alright awesome awesome
2486000	2488000	so cool
2488000	2490000	if he ever wants to come
2490000	2492000	via Skype and promote whenever the game's out
2492000	2494000	cool cool there's some fans of
2494000	2496000	Division in chat so we'll see
2496000	2498000	alright anyway
2498000	2500000	so let's talk about other gaming weeks
2501000	2503000	yeah I didn't play a whole ton of stuff
2503000	2505000	I played more Mario Odyssey
2505000	2507000	just still trying to get the rest of the Power Moons
2507000	2509000	so I've been going through all that stuff
2509000	2511000	I played more Pokemon
2511000	2513000	Quest
2513000	2515000	I've evolved a few things on there now
2515000	2517000	you play that more than anyone I know
2517000	2519000	but it's such a grind though
2519000	2521000	it's alright
2521000	2523000	it's getting kind of boring so I'll play it while I'm doing
2523000	2525000	other things because
2525000	2527000	basically it's on autoplay so I just
2527000	2529000	set it up, hit a button
2529000	2531000	and come back in two minutes
2531000	2533000	and it's done
2533000	2535000	yeah you can autoplay it
2535000	2537000	I don't know if you've played a game like
2537000	2539000	Non-Stop Night or something like that
2539000	2541000	where basically the character auto
2541000	2543000	they autorun and you have the option
2543000	2545000	to where you can control their special moves
2545000	2547000	to when they do them or you can just say
2547000	2549000	just autoplay and I find
2549000	2551000	that when I do the autoplay stuff it ends up
2551000	2553000	passing more levels than I do if I'm trying to control it
2553000	2555000	so I'm like ah fuck it who cares
2555000	2557000	I just let it play itself
2558000	2560000	and then what else
2563000	2565000	I downloaded a game called
2565000	2567000	Totally Accurate Battlegrounds
2567000	2569000	it looks fucking hilarious
2569000	2571000	which by the same people
2571000	2573000	they did Totally Accurate
2573000	2575000	Battle Simulator and also
2577000	2579000	Cluster Trucks and some other stuff
2579000	2581000	definitely a game I want to check out
2581000	2583000	it was free for like 100 hours
2583000	2585000	and now
2585000	2587000	you can get it for 5 bucks
2587000	2589000	but it's a battle royale game
2589000	2591000	much like PUBG or something like that
2591000	2593000	it's its own
2593000	2595000	unique spin on it
2595000	2597000	where it's just really bad
2597000	2599000	as far as the physics and everything are just shit
2599000	2601000	the characters look like shit
2601000	2603000	because they look like the
2603000	2605000	Totally Accurate Battle Simulator
2605000	2607000	characters they have these big bug eyes
2607000	2609000	and everything is just really weird
2609000	2611000	you can do gangster style
2611000	2613000	where they'll beatbox and turn the guns sideways
2613000	2615000	they have guns that are
2615000	2617000	enormous that will launch you across the map
2617000	2619000	when you fire them
2619000	2621000	what's this game that's out right now
2621000	2623000	I'm wondering if it's the same game
2623000	2625000	where you turn into a chicken
2625000	2627000	when you get shot enough
2627000	2629000	I saw it being streamed on Twitch
2629000	2631000	and they make this like
2631000	2633000	horrible
2633000	2635000	that could be the same game
2635000	2637000	I don't know
2637000	2639000	that sounds like something they would do though
2639000	2641000	it was the number one game streaming on
2641000	2643000	Twitch because that Ninja guy
2643000	2645000	was playing it
2645000	2647000	it could be that
2647000	2649000	I don't know but
2649000	2651000	it's a silly game they've done
2651000	2653000	other stuff they did a game called Stick Fight
2653000	2655000	that's pretty awesome
2655000	2657000	they have some pretty fun games that have come out
2657000	2659000	I think that
2659000	2661000	it sounds like it could be
2661000	2663000	I'm going to check real quick to see what was more popular
2663000	2665000	games no they don't even have it on there
2665000	2667000	but yeah it could be
2667000	2669000	something that he played
2669000	2671000	I probably will check it out
2671000	2673000	I watched some streamers play it
2673000	2675000	it looked hilarious
2675000	2677000	you know how in
2677000	2679000	Fortnite if you drop out of this
2679000	2681000	flying bus thing
2681000	2683000	this one you're on the cluster trucks
2683000	2685000	and you get launched out
2685000	2687000	into whatever you aim at
2687000	2689000	it is a little creepy
2689000	2691000	because they've got these giant blocks
2691000	2693000	as the arena is closing in on you
2693000	2695000	they kind of ominously come down
2695000	2697000	and crash into the ground
2697000	2699000	so it's pretty cool
2699000	2701000	but it's really funny
2701000	2703000	and then Pokemon Go
2703000	2705000	because they started that whole water thing
2705000	2707000	so I've been getting my water Pokemon on
2707000	2709000	and yeah
2709000	2711000	it was a little bit angerous
2711000	2713000	that freaking water event is going on
2713000	2715000	and I still can't find more Lotads
2715000	2717000	that's like the one thing
2717000	2719000	that you can
2719000	2721000	I don't want to say easily get but I feel like the one
2721000	2723000	non-regional, non-legendary
2723000	2725000	the one thing I have left
2725000	2727000	to get is
2727000	2729000	well wait I take that back because I still don't have Luna Stone
2729000	2731000	I have Soul Rock but I don't have Luna Stone so I need one of those
2731000	2733000	and then I need that Lotad's final form
2733000	2735000	I have the second form
2735000	2737000	but I don't have the final form
2737000	2739000	Lone Bray is the second form I think
2739000	2741000	I've been getting a lot of Mudkips
2741000	2743000	yeah no there's tons of that and then Sirskit was one of the other ones I needed
2743000	2745000	that I was missing but I got
2745000	2747000	that because there's Sirskits everywhere right now
2747000	2749000	so that was something I was able to do
2749000	2751000	okay
2751000	2753000	let's see talking about my gaming week
2753000	2755000	it's a bit simple I've also been playing Pokemon Go
2755000	2757000	obviously
2757000	2759000	got sucked back into Heroes of the Storm
2759000	2761000	that's one of those games that comes in waves
2761000	2763000	it's like my love of Blizzard stuff
2763000	2765000	it's like I play Overwatch for a couple weeks
2765000	2767000	and I play Diablo 3 for a couple weeks
2767000	2769000	now it's Heroes of the Storm I'm back on that bus
2769000	2771000	so I've been having fun with that
2771000	2773000	and yeah just checking out some of the character changes
2773000	2775000	and leveling up my own characters
2775000	2777000	there's an event going on right now that's kind of fun
2777000	2779000	it's like a luchador themed thing going on
2779000	2781000	so I was able to get the little pictures
2781000	2783000	like my new
2783000	2785000	little picture looks like a corgi in a luchador's
2785000	2787000	outfit it's amazing
2787000	2789000	so that was worth the event right there
2789000	2791000	otherwise
2791000	2793000	yes Bobby after last week's
2793000	2795000	show I played Just Shapes and Beats
2795000	2797000	with Bobby on stream and that game
2797000	2799000	was fun I had a good time playing
2799000	2801000	Just Shapes and Beats great music
2801000	2803000	great soundtrack in that game
2803000	2805000	is the Mortal Kombat theme in there? not that we
2805000	2807000	found unless it's like an unlock later down
2807000	2809000	the line but I have a feeling that was
2809000	2811000	probably a license that cost him more money
2811000	2813000	so it's not in there now unless one of you
2813000	2815000	guys has unlocked it oh
2815000	2817000	apparently it is it is the last
2817000	2819000	unlock says the chat oh that's
2819000	2821000	awesome that they made it in there okay cool
2821000	2823000	so hopefully I'll
2823000	2825000	hopefully I'll get that far at some point
2825000	2827000	nice
2827000	2829000	so besides that
2829000	2831000	I've been playing more Hyrule Warriors
2831000	2833000	on Switch cause I missed the
2833000	2835000	boat when it was on Wii U and 3DS so now I'm
2835000	2837000	finally playing it and that game is also a lot of fun
2837000	2839000	and then still some more Final Fantasy 14
2839000	2841000	finally I have not played
2841000	2843000	my buddy Shane online
2843000	2845000	in months and so we actually have been doing
2845000	2847000	for those of you that play Final Fantasy 14
2847000	2849000	we decided to do some of the Eureka
2849000	2851000	leveling which is like this separate
2851000	2853000	kind of zone that has like a separate leveling
2853000	2855000	for your character and there's a lot
2855000	2857000	of stuff in there that kind of reminds us of Final Fantasy
2857000	2859000	11 which if you know
2859000	2861000	Shane and I's friendship we played Final Fantasy
2861000	2863000	11 online for
2863000	2865000	years Loki was a part of that too
2865000	2867000	so Eureka kind of has a lot of throwbacks to how
2867000	2869000	11 works so it's just like losing
2869000	2871000	XP when you die and all that stuff
2871000	2873000	so but it's
2873000	2875000	separate from the other like
2875000	2877000	that's the interesting thing that 14 does cause it did
2877000	2879000	this in Deep Dungeon too is that your XP
2879000	2881000	in there is separate from the regular game XP
2881000	2883000	so it's kind of neat that they have all these other side things
2883000	2885000	but that's all I'll say about my gaming
2885000	2887000	week so again follow us on
2887000	2889000	social media twitter.com slash OLR we're also
2889000	2891000	on Facebook facebook.com slash Orange Lounge
2891000	2893000	Radio we will be here next
2893000	2895000	week for our 16th
2895000	2897000	anniversary show but we will not
2897000	2899000	be here in two weeks I will be off
2899000	2901000	that weekend I am going to be in Chicago
2901000	2903000	seeing some
2903000	2905000	of my friends out there celebrating
2905000	2907000	my 40th birthday if you can believe it
2907000	2909000	is at the end of the month so gonna be celebrating that
2909000	2911000	so anyhow let's get into some
2911000	2913000	headlines some of the other things we have yet to talk
2913000	2915000	about tonight so you're gonna
2915000	2917000	we don't have a show roll tonight we're
2917000	2919000	doing this a little more free form so Loki
2919000	2921000	do you have some stuff we can talk about some talking points?
2921000	2923000	we're talking about the big thing so
2923000	2925000	valve
2925000	2927000	here we go
2927000	2929000	so valve
2929000	2931000	you may remember
2931000	2933000	we talked a few weeks back how valve was
2933000	2935000	planning on banning
2935000	2937000	these visual novel games
2937000	2939000	because they were too risque for steam
2939000	2941000	so now basically
2941000	2943000	they've decided that they're
2943000	2945000	gonna take a hands off approach on it
2945000	2947000	saying that hey
2947000	2949000	we've decided the right approach is to
2949000	2951000	allow everything onto the steam store
2951000	2953000	except for things that we decide are illegal or
2953000	2955000	straight up trolling so
2955000	2957000	the pendulum swung the other direction
2957000	2959000	yes so swung the other direction
2959000	2961000	and so
2961000	2963000	what did we get from that? well we got
2963000	2965000	school shooter simulator
2965000	2967000	whatever that was active shooter simulator
2967000	2969000	which ended up getting pulled off
2969000	2971000	and then the newest game
2971000	2973000	of the week that people
2973000	2975000	you know want to talk about that was totally a trolling
2975000	2977000	game AIDS
2977000	2979000	simulator
2979000	2981000	and that also got taken off of steam
2983000	2985000	well I mean at least they took it off
2985000	2987000	eventually okay they took it off
2987000	2989000	but how many
2989000	2991000	how many sold
2991000	2993000	because some people will buy that shit
2993000	2995000	because they like to troll
2995000	2997000	and so they want to bump that shit up in the rankings
2997000	2999000	and like people I knew were seeing
2999000	3001000	that game as a recommended game
3001000	3003000	because you like this other stuff because other people were buying
3003000	3005000	it and steam was happy to take a
3005000	3007000	30% cut of that stuff like
3007000	3009000	they need to have less of a reactionary
3009000	3011000	thing and be proactive
3011000	3013000	steam valve should fucking
3013000	3015000	know better at this point seriously
3015000	3017000	what the fuck is happening at valve
3017000	3019000	it is 20 steam is
3019000	3021000	coming from your no 20
3021000	3023000	it no but here's my point yeah it is
3023000	3025000	2018 what the fuck is
3025000	3027000	valve doing right now yes I know the actual
3027000	3029000	answer is they're working on HTC Vive
3029000	3031000	and VR but like that
3031000	3033000	is kind of like in my opinion that's kind of like
3033000	3035000	its own little thing that's kind of like
3035000	3037000	separate from the company that bought us
3037000	3039000	portal 2 okay here's the thing
3039000	3041000	guys the valve that we all
3041000	3043000	know and love the cake is a lie
3043000	3045000	all that shit 2011
3045000	3047000	portal 2 came out in 2011
3047000	3049000	that was 7 fucking years ago
3049000	3051000	and look I get they're working
3051000	3053000	on this Vive stuff they're doing this other stuff or whatever
3053000	3055000	but like valve has been slipping
3055000	3057000	y'all valve has been slipping
3057000	3059000	hardcore and especially when it comes to steam
3059000	3061000	because you know what the last interesting
3061000	3063000	steam sale was probably also in
3063000	3065000	2011 so like
3065000	3067000	valve because they
3067000	3069000	have the strong dominant end of the market
3069000	3071000	right now feels like they can do
3071000	3073000	this shit and like look I get
3073000	3075000	that the bad games got pulled
3075000	3077000	that's fine my point is
3077000	3079000	this whole cockamamie attitude of
3079000	3081000	and it wasn't just the fact that they were like
3081000	3083000	oh we're gonna allow everything on steam it was the way
3083000	3085000	they delivered that message of well
3085000	3087000	there should be some offensive
3087000	3089000	things that should offend
3089000	3091000	you and if we're not if we don't have that
3091000	3093000	then we're not doing it right and I'm like
3093000	3095000	um
3095000	3097000	I would not walk into a store
3097000	3099000	that sold that shit
3101000	3103000	so why am I gonna walk into yours
3103000	3105000	you cocky fuck
3105000	3107000	yeah they're trying to the thing is valve
3107000	3109000	needs an attitude adjustment right
3109000	3111000	the fuck now and it is up
3111000	3113000	to the people that sorry extra I'll
3113000	3115000	let you have a quick it is up to the people that have been
3115000	3117000	lifting them up for no
3117000	3119000	reason over the past
3119000	3121000	five years and I say no
3121000	3123000	reason because again okay sure maybe
3123000	3125000	you like dota 2 maybe you're into the
3125000	3127000	vibe stuff whatever you can lift them up on those
3127000	3129000	platforms as far as steam goes
3129000	3131000	steam has been fucking slipping
3131000	3133000	for several years now
3133000	3135000	the storefront is not as
3135000	3137000	good as it used to be the
3137000	3139000	sales are not like steam sales
3139000	3141000	are just kind of a meh now you know what I mean
3141000	3143000	like steve's been slipping over the few years
3143000	3145000	and after this fuckery
3145000	3147000	I'm sorry but like gog
3147000	3149000	itch.io humble bundle
3149000	3151000	are all starting to look more attractive right now
3151000	3153000	so don't think you're fucking invincible
3153000	3155000	valve that's my
3155000	3157000	point sorry extra go ahead no I didn't mean
3157000	3159000	to talk over um I just wanted to say
3159000	3161000	that like when you when you
3161000	3163000	get as big as as
3163000	3165000	steam or you get as big
3165000	3167000	as valve
3167000	3169000	you can't just give up on responsibility
3169000	3171000	I think that they're
3171000	3173000	they're trying to justify irresponsibility
3173000	3175000	that's all it is to me
3175000	3177000	you know and I don't see
3177000	3179000	people I saw
3179000	3181000	their announcement and I looked at the comments
3181000	3183000	and they were horrible they were like yay valve
3183000	3185000	free speech I you know
3185000	3187000	come on guys with the free speech stuff
3187000	3189000	this has nothing to do with free speech
3189000	3191000	it has everything to do with
3191000	3193000	being a good curator
3193000	3195000	of content for your customers
3195000	3197000	and this is not good curation
3197000	3199000	no one is preventing free speech by not putting
3199000	3201000	your game on the steam storefront it's the fucking
3201000	3203000	internet you can put it anywhere you want
3203000	3205000	thank you thank you thank you thank you
3205000	3207000	if you want to release aid simulator
3207000	3209000	in your stifling stinky little
3209000	3211000	black hole of the internet then that's
3211000	3213000	what the internet is for have
3213000	3215000	have fun actually I don't even want to tell you to have fun
3215000	3217000	just go fuck yourself honestly
3217000	3219000	but you have a little space to go do it in but like I don't understand
3219000	3221000	like the whole point like they made this big deal
3221000	3223000	like they're like okay we need to get rid of
3223000	3225000	Greenlight cause it's not working
3225000	3227000	but I think it was doing more
3227000	3229000	like so this filter
3229000	3231000	that we had wasn't working let's just get
3231000	3233000	rid of the filter like how the fuck
3233000	3235000	is that any better like that doesn't make any
3235000	3237000	sense the filter is that oh
3237000	3239000	we're charging $100 to submit a game
3239000	3241000	but you get it back you know if it sells
3241000	3243000	they don't want to be responsible
3243000	3245000	they don't and they don't want to hire a bigger team
3245000	3247000	to be responsible either they're a small team
3247000	3249000	that is a big problem too
3249000	3251000	their customer service sucks
3251000	3253000	yeah stop letting so many games
3253000	3255000	on your platform then cause it's drowning
3255000	3257000	out all of us it is finally time for the
3257000	3259000	rest of us to hold them fucking accountable so that
3259000	3261000	is why I'm here on this show today to say
3261000	3263000	because I've been accused of this in the past
3263000	3265000	and it will no longer happen
3265000	3267000	Valve does not get a free pass
3267000	3269000	anymore I don't fucking
3269000	3271000	care if they have these gigantic sales
3271000	3273000	or what have you you know what everybody's got a fucking
3273000	3275000	sale this is the internet GOGS has
3275000	3277000	sales Humble Bundle has sales
3277000	3279000	Valve does not get a free pass
3279000	3281000	anymore because they are Valve
3281000	3283000	that is
3283000	3285000	that is why I'm setting forth today and that ties
3285000	3287000	to this comment in our chat over at
3287000	3289000	live.vognetwork.com
3289000	3291000	e3inator in chat says Rob Roberts really
3291000	3293000	if you get right down to it Valve doesn't
3293000	3295000	have to do jack shit why because
3295000	3297000	they're making money hand over fist and
3297000	3299000	laughing all the way to the bank they can wipe their
3299000	3301000	asses with one thousand dollar bills if they
3301000	3303000	so choose you know what
3303000	3305000	not on my watch Satan
3305000	3307000	we're done with that and you're right
3307000	3309000	it has to start with the rest of us saying
3309000	3311000	you know what there are
3311000	3313000	other places to buy some fucking games
3313000	3315000	nobody knows that better than you
3315000	3317000	raginator there are
3317000	3319000	other places to buy games and find deals
3319000	3321000	make Valve
3321000	3323000	fight for first place
3323000	3325000	the attitude that they could print money and
3325000	3327000	they don't have to care is
3327000	3329000	is pointless to me so
3329000	3331000	so that's the same thing as saying
3331000	3333000	Martin Shkreli you know that guy
3333000	3335000	who raised the pharmacy
3335000	3337000	you know pharmaceutical drugs
3337000	3339000	is practically too rich to
3339000	3341000	care you know whatever but we all
3341000	3343000	like rose up and said no
3343000	3345000	you know what I mean and look where
3345000	3347000	he is now he's in prison
3347000	3349000	I'm not saying
3349000	3351000	Gabe should go to prison I'm just saying
3351000	3353000	no I am I'm saying they should go to prison
3353000	3355000	no I'm not I'm saying that
3355000	3357000	like somebody at his level
3357000	3359000	needs to come out and say
3359000	3361000	we fucked up exactly
3361000	3363000	I need I need that to happen
3363000	3365000	they need to take
3365000	3367000	we fucked up PS
3367000	3369000	as an apology Half Life 3
3369000	3371000	3
3371000	3373000	I'll take the first part at least
3373000	3375000	anyway
3375000	3377000	Rama says in chat when Valve brings us
3377000	3379000	Half Life 3 then I'll give a fuck
3379000	3381000	Bob Coffee says it's time for GOG to shine
3381000	3383000	Bobby Blackwolf wants to point
3383000	3385000	out he isn't in prison for the drug stuff he's in prison
3385000	3387000	for tax evasion yeah I know but you know
3387000	3389000	what Karma is a bitch
3389000	3391000	exactly yeah I don't care
3391000	3393000	what the actual circumstances
3393000	3395000	we got mad at him and he
3395000	3397000	got like in trouble and we're
3397000	3399000	all happy about it alright so anyway
3399000	3401000	I guess I don't
3401000	3403000	need to keep going off but my point
3403000	3405000	is from now on
3405000	3407000	Valve needs to earn that number one
3407000	3409000	spot as far as I'm concerned
3409000	3411000	because I will be looking for where the deals
3411000	3413000	on other games are I'm not gonna sit here and go
3413000	3415000	I'm gonna delete my fucking Steam account because you and I
3415000	3417000	both know that's not true I got too many games to do
3417000	3419000	exactly I got too many games locked in there
3419000	3421000	and like if I want to play Civ 6
3421000	3423000	I'm going to have to do it on Steam but I
3423000	3425000	can sit here and go I'm gonna think
3425000	3427000	twice before I just drop money
3427000	3429000	on a PC game on Steam because it's
3429000	3431000	on Steam and because you know
3431000	3433000	of the fucking trading cards or whatever is keeping
3433000	3435000	me on Steam I'm gonna start saying
3435000	3437000	you know GOG
3437000	3439000	that's a thing Humble Bundle that's
3439000	3441000	a thing itch.io that's a pretty cool thing
3441000	3443000	and Battle.net
3443000	3445000	uh fuck it
3445000	3447000	do you know how serious
3447000	3449000	I am everybody I'm about to show you how
3449000	3451000	fucking serious I am
3451000	3453000	I'll update my Origin account
3453000	3455000	oh yeah
3455000	3457000	oh no oh no bitch
3457000	3459000	nope I want
3459000	3461000	you all to pay fucking attention that's
3461000	3463000	how serious I am I'm gonna
3463000	3465000	update my Origin account
3465000	3467000	oh but you were gonna do that anyway when they brought
3467000	3469000	out their next Mass Effect
3469000	3471000	game right? in 2025
3477000	3479000	I love thank you guys for
3479000	3481000	playing along and chat oh shit now let's
3481000	3483000	not go overboard no I'm fucking serious
3483000	3485000	next thing you'll be telling me that you want to reinstall Uplay
3485000	3487000	or something like that I forgot
3487000	3489000	about you know what and if Uplay
3489000	3491000	has got a deal I play
3491000	3493000	I'm a proud member
3493000	3495000	of Uplay and I'm
3495000	3497000	biased you're biased alright
3497000	3499000	to be fair to give them props
3499000	3501000	I do like the fact that you can earn like points
3501000	3503000	or achievement points or whatever to like
3503000	3505000	get free shit in other games
3505000	3507000	yeah I like that too I like that but that's the
3507000	3509000	only thing I like I fucking hate everything else about it
3509000	3511000	I was about to be like oh I love that too
3511000	3513000	which ones do you play?
3513000	3515000	my whole like thing
3515000	3517000	give us another headline cause I hate that I'm the angry
3517000	3519000	bitch tonight
3519000	3521000	this is your role Loki I'm sorry
3521000	3523000	he's hand picking the stories that'll piss me off
3523000	3525000	uh Pokemon Let's Go
3525000	3527000	Pikachu and Eevee require an
3527000	3529000	online subscription of course
3529000	3531000	because it's Nintendo and they want to sell that subscription
3531000	3533000	oh it's Nintendo's new thing
3533000	3535000	that kind of actually does surprise me
3535000	3537000	isn't it like a single player game?
3537000	3539000	yeah I was under the impression it was gonna be a single player thing
3539000	3541000	does it only require the online
3541000	3543000	thing for like trading
3543000	3545000	with maybe it needs it to access
3545000	3547000	Pokemon Bank well wait a minute no it's not a mainline
3547000	3549000	game so you wouldn't it says it will have online
3549000	3551000	play functionality battling trading
3551000	3553000	with other players over the internet
3553000	3555000	but will the entire game require
3555000	3557000	is this gonna be another
3557000	3559000	Nintendo thing?
3559000	3561000	I think that's I think he just said it
3561000	3563000	like I think that's what you get there are
3563000	3565000	some things in Pokemon games you go online
3565000	3567000	for trading battling etc you want any
3567000	3569000	of that I'm thinking about I'm over
3569000	3571000	like paying for the subscription it's $20
3571000	3573000	a year I don't fucking care I spend
3573000	3575000	I spend more than that show of hands is anyone
3575000	3577000	not buying the Nintendo thing I know
3577000	3579000	I'm totally buying the Nintendo thing
3579000	3581000	Loki is buying the Nintendo
3581000	3583000	thing it's 20 fucking dollars
3583000	3585000	I mean that's like a couple
3585000	3587000	of meals and we have
3587000	3589000	when Tuesday happens and they announce
3589000	3591000	everything that's coming with it I think we'll be all like
3591000	3593000	okay let me put it this way the only
3593000	3595000	reason why I'm still
3595000	3597000	um giving them shit about it is
3597000	3599000	because I don't wanna just like them go
3599000	3601000	oh well it's only $20 well
3601000	3603000	but that doesn't give me an excuse to not do anything
3603000	3605000	for that $20 other than
3605000	3607000	oh well now we're letting you play online
3607000	3609000	even though we just didn't let you to do that
3609000	3611000	earlier for free but
3611000	3613000	I'm gonna give him a chance on this whole new
3613000	3615000	virtual console thing we'll see let's
3615000	3617000	let's I'm crossing my fingers it's
3617000	3619000	not gonna suck we'll see I have mod
3619000	3621000	chips if that's not the case
3621000	3623000	alright Tuesday's coming
3623000	3625000	there'll be a lot more coming on Tuesday
3625000	3627000	Tyco Drum Master
3627000	3629000	sorry I'm just gonna say
3629000	3631000	the one thing I
3631000	3633000	hear consistently
3633000	3635000	from more casual
3635000	3637000	but I bet a lot of you fit in this category too
3637000	3639000	the one thing I hear consistently about Tuesday
3639000	3641000	is this
3641000	3643000	I hope Nintendo announces a new
3643000	3645000	anyone wanna fill in the blank?
3645000	3647000	the number one thing I hear from casuals
3647000	3649000	no from casuals
3649000	3651000	no
3651000	3653000	Mario game?
3653000	3655000	I hope Nintendo announces a new
3655000	3657000	and it would be something that would completely
3657000	3659000	people would throw that $20 down
3659000	3661000	in a heartbeat
3661000	3663000	Animal Crossing
3663000	3665000	I want a new Animal Crossing
3665000	3667000	god dammit
3667000	3669000	I hate Animal Crossing
3669000	3671000	do you or do you hate the love it?
3671000	3673000	I hate it
3673000	3675000	I hate that every version of Animal Crossing that comes out
3675000	3677000	has less features than the one before it
3677000	3679000	and by less features I mean
3679000	3681000	none of them have virtual console games in them
3681000	3683000	I do wanna give JD a cookie in our chat
3683000	3685000	room because he answered, I love that the chat
3685000	3687000	jumped in, JD said new
3687000	3689000	IP
3689000	3691000	I will give you a cookie for that
3691000	3693000	the good news is I'm gonna give you a cookie
3693000	3695000	the bad news is it's oatmeal raisin
3695000	3697000	I want excite bike to come back
3697000	3699000	that's what I would shell down money
3699000	3701000	excite truck
3701000	3703000	yes!
3703000	3705000	excite bots bullshit
3705000	3707000	no! you should never have to play mini
3707000	3709000	games in the middle of a fucking race
3709000	3711000	that is dumb, that is dumb shit
3711000	3713000	excite truck though
3713000	3715000	act deft is getting angry
3715000	3717000	over here because you started to say taiko drum master
3717000	3719000	and I cut you off, sorry, taiko drum master
3719000	3721000	the Nintendo switch version
3721000	3723000	is coming to Asia in English
3723000	3725000	on August 9th
3725000	3727000	so yes, you may not necessarily get it
3727000	3729000	in North America, although I thought they were gonna
3729000	3731000	release it over here as well
3731000	3733000	but they're gonna be doing an English patch for free
3733000	3735000	on August 9th
3735000	3737000	so remember, the switch is region free
3737000	3739000	so if you want it, you can import it
3739000	3741000	you know what games I like better
3741000	3743000	than taiko drum master?
3743000	3745000	are the persona dancing games
3745000	3747000	there's a lot of those coming out
3747000	3749000	oh I know, well I mean persona dancing
3749000	3751000	all night, persona 4
3751000	3753000	I platinumed that
3753000	3755000	why can't we have both extrovert?
3755000	3757000	well I'm just saying I like it better
3757000	3759000	I can have both
3759000	3761000	there's
3761000	3763000	a new unannounced Diablo game
3763000	3765000	coming thanks to a
3765000	3767000	development job listing
3767000	3769000	that's all we know
3769000	3771000	but there's hope
3771000	3773000	it's gonna be so erect at Blizzcon
3773000	3775000	if they announce Diablo 4
3775000	3777000	that's another one
3777000	3779000	where I assume that they have been
3779000	3781000	working on something
3781000	3783000	since the necromancer didn't
3783000	3785000	end up being an expansion
3785000	3787000	then I'm assuming Diablo 3 is done
3787000	3789000	I mean, it could be
3789000	3791000	another Diablo expansion
3791000	3793000	it could be this switch thing
3793000	3795000	that maybe would be the
3795000	3797000	way to do this new Diablo 3
3797000	3799000	but there's a part of me that says
3799000	3801000	you know what, they're just gonna
3801000	3803000	whip out the number 4, why not?
3803000	3805000	Diablo 3 kinda had that cloud
3805000	3807000	over it ever since the beginning with the auction house
3807000	3809000	and all that other stuff, even though it's a great
3809000	3811000	game now, like
3811000	3813000	because Diablo is a console and PC
3813000	3815000	thing for them, it doesn't
3815000	3817000	necessarily have that exact same sort of
3817000	3819000	foreverness that Overwatch does
3819000	3821000	although, I don't know, the rifts and stuff
3821000	3823000	are still interesting, I still play them
3823000	3825000	why not? Let's do Diablo 4
3825000	3827000	the only thing that's weird about Diablo 4
3827000	3829000	is that Blizzard
3829000	3831000	hasn't done a
3831000	3833000	sequel game in a very long time
3833000	3835000	like the last sequel game I can think of
3835000	3837000	when was Starcraft 2?
3837000	3839000	because I think it was Diablo 3
3839000	3841000	so that's the only weird
3841000	3843000	thing about it, is that Blizzard
3843000	3845000	isn't exactly known for cranking out the sequels
3845000	3847000	and when they do announce it
3847000	3849000	it takes a very long time for them to get
3849000	3851000	that's true, they'll announce it now and then it's really
3851000	3853000	out in 3 years, so we'll see
3853000	3855000	oh shit, you know, I just realized
3855000	3857000	something, which makes
3857000	3859000	the Square Enix thing very exciting
3859000	3861000	tomorrow
3861000	3863000	they have that Marvel project, fuck yeah
3863000	3865000	fuck yeah
3865000	3867000	that's a good chance that we're gonna see that Marvel
3867000	3869000	project tomorrow, I can't wait
3869000	3871000	speaking of which, the rumor with that
3871000	3873000	Marvel project is
3873000	3875000	a reboot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance
3875000	3877000	which I am totally down for
3877000	3879000	oh, interesting
3879000	3881000	Ultimate Alliance is fucking awesome
3881000	3883000	those games weren't like bad
3883000	3885000	or needing a reboot, but I guess then again
3885000	3887000	they do this all the time with games, they just kind of start over
3887000	3889000	maybe it could be just similar
3889000	3891000	like a similar type of gameplay or something
3891000	3893000	I'm down, that's cool
3893000	3895000	Hitman 2 is something that's
3895000	3897000	also gonna be probably shown off
3897000	3899000	Sony confirmed that
3899000	3901000	Sony confirmed Hitman 2 I think
3901000	3903000	yeah, so they've got that coming out and they've got
3903000	3905000	this collector's edition with a rubber duck
3905000	3907000	that's kinda cool
3907000	3909000	what else
3909000	3911000	we have the lineup for
3911000	3913000	Sega and Atlas
3913000	3915000	so they're gonna be showing off
3915000	3917000	Shining Resonance
3917000	3919000	Refrain, that's coming out on
3919000	3921000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC
3921000	3923000	Team Sonic Racing
3923000	3925000	which is also on PlayStation 4, Xbox One
3925000	3927000	Switch and PC
3927000	3929000	Valkyria Chronicles 4
3929000	3931000	on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and the Switch
3931000	3933000	and Yakuza Kiwami
3933000	3935000	on PlayStation 4
3935000	3937000	and then one
3937000	3939000	thing that they'll be showing but that won't be playable there
3939000	3941000	is Total War Three Kingdoms on PC
3941000	3943000	and then
3943000	3945000	I wanna say that there was another
3945000	3947000	like Catherine, Catherine Full
3947000	3949000	Body was something else that was being announced
3949000	3951000	and then
3951000	3953000	I feel like that Catherine thing they'd already announced though
3953000	3955000	and then, and then
3955000	3957000	that was a PSX reveal or something wasn't it?
3957000	3959000	and then Atlas, they've got some more
3959000	3961000	stuff that they said they found including
3961000	3963000	you know there's, they found websites
3963000	3965000	for Persona 3 Dancing Moon Knight
3965000	3967000	and Persona 5 Dancing Star Knight
3967000	3969000	and of course those
3969000	3971000	have been confirmed
3971000	3973000	and both
3973000	3975000	look amazing
3975000	3977000	so, neat
3977000	3979000	let's see what else we got
3979000	3981000	here, while you're looking I'm gonna go ahead and open
3981000	3983000	up the Skype line if anyone does wanna give us a call
3983000	3985000	Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype
3985000	3987000	if you wanna talk to us about an E3
3987000	3989000	that's already happened or that's
3989000	3991000	going to happen, maybe you
3991000	3993000	have some things you wanna talk about with
3993000	3995000	Sony or Nintendo tomorrow, let me ask
3995000	3997000	Xtifer, cause we don't get to hear from you
3997000	3999000	a lot here at OLR
3999000	4001000	but I know you're a big gamer, what
4001000	4003000	what do you hope for from Sony and
4003000	4005000	Nintendo?
4005000	4007000	I'm looking forward most out of all
4007000	4009000	of E3
4009000	4011000	for the Death Stranding
4011000	4013000	stuff
4014000	4016000	gameplay finally?
4016000	4018000	I'd be satisfied with another
4018000	4020000	trailer, honestly
4020000	4022000	I need to see the game
4022000	4024000	I'd love to see the game
4024000	4026000	it'd be great, it'd be great
4026000	4028000	if there's another trailer that is also
4028000	4030000	very cryptic, I'll watch it for days
4030000	4032000	but be angry that we didn't get gameplay
4032000	4034000	at the same time
4034000	4036000	but when it comes to Nintendo
4036000	4038000	obviously I think it would be
4038000	4040000	Metroid Prime 4
4040000	4042000	you're a big fan of Metroid Prime
4042000	4044000	I love Metroid anything
4044000	4046000	I'm hoping for Mario Maker
4046000	4048000	I would like to see a Mario Maker port
4048000	4050000	too, I feel like I'm in the minority
4050000	4052000	I just wonder how, I mean I
4052000	4054000	get how it would work
4054000	4056000	on the docked, but it'd be kinda more clunky
4056000	4058000	compared to
4058000	4060000	using it portable, right?
4060000	4062000	Yeah, but there's no reason you can't create portable
4062000	4064000	and then play docked
4064000	4066000	part of the fun of Mario Maker is playing
4066000	4068000	all the crazy fucking stages
4068000	4070000	Mario Maker, like that, but here's the twist
4070000	4072000	it's two player because
4072000	4074000	the Switch has two
4074000	4076000	like maybe co-op or something
4076000	4078000	like that, what a twist
4078000	4080000	split screen, yeah because you know they're gonna
4080000	4082000	wanna use their two player gimmick
4082000	4084000	thing that they have going on, co-op
4084000	4086000	I don't think there's
4086000	4088000	any, maybe
4088000	4090000	I'm pretty sure they won't show anything else
4090000	4092000	with Bayonetta 3, but
4092000	4094000	maybe, maybe
4094000	4096000	a new trailer, maybe a little teaser
4096000	4098000	yeah, maybe another morsel or something
4098000	4100000	Let's get to the phones, we got a call coming in, let's do it
4100000	4102000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
4102000	4104000	Hi, this is Ray G. Nader
4104000	4106000	Hey Ray G. Nader, what's up buddy?
4106000	4108000	I know a whole lot, well
4108000	4110000	since the topic is pretty much
4110000	4112000	solely E3
4112000	4114000	I'll chime in on that
4114000	4116000	Go ahead
4116000	4118000	Sorry if I'm a little measly looking there
4118000	4120000	sick as a dog, but
4120000	4122000	well
4122000	4124000	take what I'm about to see
4124000	4126000	with a little bit of
4126000	4128000	a grain of salt
4128000	4130000	I always do, ba-da-bum
4130000	4132000	I missed
4132000	4134000	some of
4134000	4136000	some portions
4136000	4138000	of the conferences because I was
4138000	4140000	supposed to be out and about
4140000	4142000	but based on what I did see
4142000	4144000	overall
4144000	4146000	I was pleased with what
4146000	4148000	I saw
4148000	4150000	Now if I were to be
4150000	4152000	nitpicky about one
4152000	4154000	thing
4154000	4156000	is that
4156000	4158000	while I kind of saw this coming
4158000	4160000	in the back of my mind
4160000	4162000	I was kind of sort of hoping
4162000	4164000	that
4164000	4166000	I would hear about a new Magic
4166000	4168000	Together game
4168000	4170000	that was in the works
4170000	4172000	That's something up your alley
4172000	4174000	Oh yeah, well you know me, I talk about
4174000	4176000	those Magic Together games
4176000	4178000	all the time, in fact
4178000	4180000	the newest one
4180000	4182000	Magic Duels came out
4182000	4184000	I believe in
4184000	4186000	2014 or 2015
4186000	4188000	and that was like
4188000	4190000	three, four years ago
4190000	4192000	so I think we're kind of
4192000	4194000	overdue for a new one
4194000	4196000	and you know
4196000	4198000	Grand is not as popular
4198000	4200000	as say Gears of War, Halo
4200000	4202000	or Mass Effect, but it does have
4202000	4204000	a pretty strong following
4204000	4206000	Sure, of course
4206000	4208000	with the trading card game and everything, of course
4208000	4210000	Yeah, and plus
4210000	4212000	knowing that, but
4212000	4214000	Grand is not as
4214000	4216000	extensive as actual
4216000	4218000	card game, but at the same time
4218000	4220000	it's a whole lot cheaper than
4220000	4222000	going out and getting the booster packs
4222000	4224000	and trying to find
4224000	4226000	the rare cards individually
4226000	4228000	you know, you'll save a lot of money
4228000	4230000	that way, so
4230000	4232000	that's why I love
4232000	4234000	the game myself, so
4234000	4236000	but
4236000	4238000	there was
4238000	4240000	I loved everything else
4240000	4242000	you know, the
4242000	4244000	talk about Doom
4244000	4246000	the Fallout
4246000	4248000	talk, you know
4248000	4250000	Let me ask you this question, RageNator
4250000	4252000	because there's a comment in our chat
4252000	4254000	where Kaijuto says, take it from a guy that plays a lot of
4254000	4256000	card games, there are so many better games than Magic
4256000	4258000	well, I mean, opinion
4258000	4260000	is a big thing, but I'm curious
4260000	4262000	RageNator, especially because
4262000	4264000	we're talking about Bethesda, Bethesda does have their
4264000	4266000	Elder Scrolls based card game
4266000	4268000	do you ever try some of the others?
4268000	4270000	Uh, no
4270000	4272000	honestly, yeah
4272000	4274000	really, I mean, the main reason why
4274000	4276000	I got into the
4276000	4278000	Magic the Gathering
4278000	4280000	video games is because
4280000	4282000	I've been involved with
4282000	4284000	the card game way back when
4284000	4286000	I was in high school, back in the Stone Age
4286000	4288000	so, I'm already familiar
4288000	4290000	with concepts and
4290000	4292000	the mechanics and this and
4292000	4294000	other, and plus now there's the
4294000	4296000	Paul and the Stabs thing for me
4296000	4298000	so, I'm not saying
4298000	4300000	that these other games are any
4300000	4302000	way, shape or form
4302000	4304000	bad games, I'm not saying that
4304000	4306000	if other people love these
4306000	4308000	I totally get it, it's like me and
4308000	4310000	Elder Scrolls Online when we were talking during the
4310000	4312000	thing, it's like, I just
4312000	4314000	tend to gravitate towards Final Fantasy 14
4314000	4315000	It's your comfort zone
4315000	4317000	Yeah, it's my comfort zone, it's not that Elder Scrolls Online
4317000	4319000	is bad, it's just, it's
4319000	4321000	the game that other people like, you know
4321000	4323000	some people like action movies, some people
4323000	4325000	like comedies, some people like
4325000	4327000	There's a lot of people that don't understand
4327000	4329000	my love for Binding of Isaac
4329000	4331000	but, it's my comfort zone, it's my game
4331000	4333000	with choice, you know
4333000	4335000	Yeah, I kinda like what you like, it's cool
4335000	4337000	I'm curious if you do the
4337000	4339000	experimenting with the other games, that's all
4339000	4341000	Uh, no, I
4341000	4343000	well, I did manage to get
4343000	4345000	a free copy of GWENT
4345000	4347000	through DLG
4347000	4349000	but honestly, let's be
4349000	4351000	honest here, I haven't even
4351000	4353000	installed it yet, I haven't
4353000	4355000	fired it up yet
4355000	4357000	and honestly, I probably
4357000	4359000	never will
4359000	4361000	I'm not saying that these other
4361000	4363000	games are anyway bad
4363000	4365000	other people love them
4365000	4367000	There's just only so much time in a day, I understand
4367000	4369000	Yeah, well
4369000	4371000	I'll probably get a free off the lines that way
4371000	4373000	if someone else wants a call
4373000	4375000	but have a nice night
4375000	4377000	Thanks, thanks for the call, take care buddy, bye
4377000	4379000	Such a nice guy, that regenator
4379000	4381000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
4381000	4383000	if you wanna give us a call
4383000	4385000	For such a, for such a
4385000	4387000	testosterone-y filled name
4387000	4389000	Like Rage?
4389000	4391000	Maybe it's just one of those ironic
4391000	4393000	It's one of those ironic names, maybe
4393000	4395000	I don't know, I don't know, or maybe like
4395000	4397000	he's like Terminator, he terminates the Rage
4397000	4399000	The Rage stops here
4399000	4401000	I think that's what he was going with
4401000	4403000	Perhaps, perhaps
4403000	4405000	Loki, any other headlines you wanna run down with us?
4405000	4407000	Uh, yeah, Final Fantasy XV is getting mod support on PC
4407000	4409000	or I should say it has mod support on PC now
4409000	4411000	Oh, like official mod support
4411000	4413000	So like, now we can have
4413000	4415000	Nudie mods officially
4415000	4417000	There's pictures of Keyblades
4417000	4419000	and Thomas the Tank Engine
4419000	4421000	I feel like we knew this was coming because I remember this guy
4421000	4423000	the guy behind Final Fantasy XV
4423000	4425000	Don't make nudie mods
4425000	4427000	Please, we're just gonna ask the community
4427000	4429000	nicely to not make the nudie mods
4429000	4431000	and like, within
4431000	4433000	30 seconds the nudie mods were here
4433000	4435000	If not, look
4435000	4437000	If you're not into dudes
4437000	4439000	I'm sure they've got a Sydney
4439000	4441000	like, and the
4441000	4443000	Dragoon, Ariana, what was her name
4443000	4445000	the Dragoon lady, I'm sure they get naked too
4445000	4447000	so whatever you're into
4447000	4449000	And Valve, Valve is just like
4449000	4451000	whatever the fuck you wanna do
4451000	4453000	you know, just don't troll people
4453000	4455000	Okay
4455000	4457000	Valve and I are fighting right now so
4457000	4459000	I don't care what they're doing
4459000	4461000	Valve can go do whatever they want
4461000	4463000	in their corner right now where I'm just side-eyeing them
4463000	4465000	Speaking of mods
4465000	4467000	of course, you know, with the emulated version
4467000	4469000	of Breath of the Wild
4469000	4471000	people have modded Mario
4471000	4473000	and Valve's are in there
4473000	4475000	Because why not?
4475000	4477000	Because you can do all that kind of shit
4477000	4479000	You sure can
4479000	4481000	I don't know
4481000	4483000	if we talked about this or not
4483000	4485000	but there's a new game streaming service
4485000	4487000	I guess they're saying with Facebook
4487000	4489000	facebook.gg
4489000	4491000	Oh yeah, this is like their answer to Twitch
4491000	4493000	and Mixer
4493000	4495000	and all that stuff
4495000	4497000	They're doing this facebook.gg
4497000	4499000	Are we still mad at Facebook right now?
4499000	4501000	Are we on a cooling off period?
4501000	4503000	Facebook is like
4503000	4505000	that person you hang out with that you know
4505000	4507000	is nothing but drama and trouble
4507000	4509000	but like once in a while
4509000	4511000	like they're cool
4511000	4513000	So it's like you're guarded
4513000	4515000	when you hang out with Facebook
4515000	4517000	Facebook's kind of like the friend
4517000	4519000	that I
4519000	4521000	never really
4521000	4523000	It's more of an acquaintance
4523000	4525000	not a friend
4525000	4527000	I feel like Facebook doesn't need to be in this space
4527000	4529000	There's a lot of spaces Facebook is getting into
4529000	4531000	where I'm like Facebook, I think you should just stay out
4531000	4533000	Exactly, it's trying to be a jack of all trades
4533000	4535000	but it's really horrible
4535000	4537000	Game streaming is one of them
4537000	4539000	It's just like, it's not going to happen
4539000	4541000	I don't know, I just read an article recently
4541000	4543000	I say that, but I think actually
4543000	4545000	because so many people are glued to Facebook
4545000	4547000	it's going to pop up in people's
4547000	4549000	feeds so easily
4549000	4551000	I read an article recently about how
4551000	4553000	they question Mark Zuckerberg
4553000	4555000	when he was
4555000	4557000	questioned by Congress
4557000	4559000	about the shadow
4559000	4561000	profiles, about how they make
4561000	4563000	profiles for people that don't even have
4563000	4565000	Facebook accounts
4565000	4567000	and I was like, that really rubbed
4567000	4569000	me the wrong way
4569000	4571000	and his answers were not very
4571000	4573000	reassuring
4573000	4575000	and so I'm like, wow
4575000	4577000	So I don't feel like I can trust
4577000	4579000	them, you know what I mean? In fact
4579000	4581000	I went into their privacy settings
4581000	4583000	just recently, which basically
4583000	4585000	their UI is so
4585000	4587000	convoluted, and we all know
4587000	4589000	this, right? But I was trying to go
4589000	4591000	into every single Facebook privacy
4591000	4593000	setting, which is like a headache in itself
4593000	4595000	and turn everything off
4595000	4597000	because I don't want to allow anything
4597000	4599000	but even that, I don't trust
4599000	4601000	because they don't
4601000	4603000	have that there, so why would I trust
4603000	4605000	them with a streaming thing?
4605000	4607000	Honestly, my
4607000	4609000	biggest comment with this is
4609000	4611000	I will still be streaming on my Twitch
4611000	4613000	channel over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts
4613000	4615000	Go give me a follow, please
4615000	4617000	That's really all I have to say
4617000	4619000	Not that Amazon is
4619000	4621000	really that much better, but
4621000	4623000	At least
4623000	4625000	I feel like Twitch, for the most
4625000	4627000	part, when they have
4627000	4629000	issues, they're really good at resolving
4629000	4631000	them quickly and doing better, you
4631000	4633000	know, and maybe it wasn't always that
4633000	4635000	way, but like lately, you know
4635000	4637000	so I can't
4637000	4639000	I enjoy being a Twitch streamer
4639000	4641000	you know, when I have the time for it
4641000	4643000	which isn't all the time, but when I have the time for it, I enjoy it
4643000	4645000	so, and honestly
4645000	4647000	if Twitch wasn't around, Mixer's not bad
4647000	4649000	there's a lot to like about Mixer
4649000	4651000	I wish I had the time where I could
4651000	4653000	do a stream here and there, you know
4653000	4655000	but I just, I don't have that kind of time, sadly
4655000	4657000	but I watched the Xbox
4657000	4659000	thing on Mixer today and it looked great in 4K
4659000	4661000	so, because my monitor
4661000	4663000	on my computer is 4K
4663000	4665000	so it looked great. I watched it on YouTube because
4665000	4667000	I was out and about
4667000	4669000	when it was going on. I forgot it was
4669000	4671000	early on. It was a weird hour
4671000	4673000	They always do their
4673000	4675000	concerts. I'm not talking about
4675000	4677000	Bethesda. They always do their
4677000	4679000	conferences early
4679000	4681000	in the day, right? Well, it's early
4681000	4683000	for us, but
4683000	4685000	it was 4 o'clock on the East Coast
4685000	4687000	so a little more reasonable. So maybe they're just trying to be
4687000	4689000	friendly to the East Coast
4689000	4691000	but Sony always tells them like 6 o'clock
4691000	4693000	in the afternoon. Also
4693000	4695000	not just us, but Europe, that would've been
4695000	4697000	9 in the evening in Europe, so let's not
4697000	4699000	forget Microsoft's a global thing
4699000	4701000	so it makes a lot more sense
4701000	4703000	for them to go so early so that way it's
4703000	4705000	you know, because when Sony does
4705000	4707000	their thing, it's always later. That's gonna
4707000	4709000	be like 2 in the morning for Europe
4709000	4711000	so that's not as nice for them. So that's
4711000	4713000	part of the reason why, you know, there are
4713000	4715000	morning press conferences with ether. But I think that
4715000	4717000	maybe Sony has it in their mind, you know, well
4717000	4719000	this, you know, E3 is
4719000	4721000	primarily like North American
4721000	4723000	announcements, whereas Gamescom
4723000	4725000	is like more Europe, you know?
4725000	4727000	Yeah, at least Sony kind of
4727000	4729000	gives a little bit to Gamescom too, you know?
4729000	4731000	Yeah, because they have those like
4731000	4733000	E3 style press conferences. Plus they have
4733000	4735000	PSX too. And you know what?
4735000	4737000	I think for Sony more, the thing
4737000	4739000	they have to consider is
4739000	4741000	Japan. And so for Japan,
4741000	4743000	it is the morning when
4743000	4745000	Sony goes. So I think they all just kind of
4745000	4747000	have to consider like, you know, because you can't
4747000	4749000	do anything that's gonna be a
4749000	4751000	great time for Japan, the US, and
4751000	4753000	Europe. So you just kind of have to pick two.
4753000	4755000	I just assume E3 has
4755000	4757000	already happened because Japan is in the
4757000	4759000	future. Yes.
4759000	4761000	Alright. Oh, back to Loki.
4761000	4763000	See if there's any other stories you want to cover.
4763000	4765000	I was trying to find out what
4765000	4767000	happened with the Devolver Digital
4767000	4769000	thing. All I know is it
4769000	4771000	involved the physical loot coin that you
4771000	4773000	can buy for a very large amount of money
4773000	4775000	that keeps changing price.
4775000	4777000	I'm not really sure what else.
4777000	4779000	I am so
4779000	4781000	wanting to see this. Everybody in chat was
4781000	4783000	screaming about Metal Wolf Chaos, I guess was the
4783000	4785000	thing. Yeah, I thought that was rumored
4785000	4787000	to be something they were going to be bringing out.
4787000	4789000	Devolver Digital was my highlight
4789000	4791000	last year. They were like the best.
4791000	4793000	It made no sense.
4793000	4795000	Tim and Eric.
4795000	4797000	They're kind of like the
4797000	4799000	frat kid game company in some
4799000	4801000	ways. You have to admit it was
4801000	4803000	funny last year. I didn't watch it. We were
4803000	4805000	doing this show. You didn't watch the
4805000	4807000	stream of it? No.
4807000	4809000	There's a new
4809000	4811000	serious Sam game
4811000	4813000	coming out. I don't know.
4813000	4815000	But the actual
4815000	4817000	you have to watch that, Rob, if you've
4817000	4819000	never watched it. It's really funny.
4819000	4821000	Sorry, that was my
4821000	4823000	Google chat that just went off. Again?
4823000	4825000	I know. It's like, God, I think it's safe
4825000	4827000	to keep it open so I can have a show roll up.
4827000	4829000	Well, to be fair, we didn't have a show roll tonight.
4829000	4831000	We just had an email, so that's why I had it up.
4831000	4833000	It was irony. Anyway.
4833000	4835000	And you know what the funniest thing about it?
4835000	4837000	There was a message from Alan going, what are you doing?
4837000	4839000	What do you think I'm doing?
4843000	4845000	He also knows that the show lately has been
4845000	4847000	wrapping around 8.30, so he's probably curious
4847000	4849000	if we're done yet or not. But I think we are
4849000	4851000	about winding up. Yeah, I think we've run out of
4851000	4853000	some stuff to talk about right now.
4853000	4855000	We've run out of steam. Well, we haven't
4855000	4857000	run out of steam, but there's like a
4857000	4859000	Dead or Alive 6 reveal trailer.
4859000	4861000	There's a lot more we'll be talking about, I'm sure,
4861000	4863000	after everything's done. Yeah, next week's gonna be crazy
4863000	4865000	because we're gonna have Sony and Nintendo to talk about.
4865000	4867000	Happy E3 week, everybody.
4867000	4869000	Try not to be too cynical.
4869000	4871000	Not everything sucks.
4871000	4873000	There should be something you enjoy this week,
4873000	4875000	so I hope, hey, I got Tetris
4875000	4877000	Effect. If nothing else,
4877000	4879000	I have Tetris Effect. I'm telling you that
4879000	4881000	that is, and do you have,
4881000	4883000	by the way, just for shits,
4883000	4885000	do you have the Tetris Effect
4885000	4887000	when you play a prolonged
4887000	4889000	amount of time? Oh, do I suffer from it?
4889000	4891000	It's not, you don't suffer from it,
4891000	4893000	but it's something that a lot of people haven't. I do.
4893000	4895000	Um, I get it with other video
4895000	4897000	games. Really? Yeah. I'll dream
4897000	4899000	about other video games like that.
4899000	4901000	Well, no, no, I mean when,
4901000	4903000	well, that's one thing. Isn't that
4903000	4905000	kind of the same thing?
4905000	4907000	I think it goes, it also goes
4907000	4909000	into the fact that when you play something like that
4909000	4911000	with like basic shapes for a long period of time,
4911000	4913000	then you actually, when you close your eyes,
4913000	4915000	you almost see it in your head.
4915000	4917000	And that's what happens to me.
4917000	4919000	It's called the Tetris Effect. With all the music
4919000	4921000	games I've played over the years? Like, I've totally seen
4921000	4923000	Falling Notes. Exactly. That's what it,
4923000	4925000	that's the Tetris Effect. Yeah. And that's the actual
4925000	4927000	official name of that
4927000	4929000	phenomenon. Yeah. So that
4929000	4931000	trailer was so cool the way they did that, yeah.
4931000	4933000	Like, it pisses, again,
4933000	4935000	if you're one of those people out there on Twitter
4935000	4937000	that's like, a fucking Tetris
4937000	4939000	game, that should be, like, do not
4939000	4941000	Oh, fuck you. Tetris is the best game in the world.
4941000	4943000	Seriously, I will cyber-bully you.
4943000	4945000	Like, you think Steam got
4945000	4947000	it bad tonight? Just wait until I find out where you are.
4947000	4949000	There's a reason why they keep
4949000	4951000	re-releasing that game. It's because
4951000	4953000	it's a tried and true formula and it works.
4953000	4955000	Exactly. And, like,
4955000	4957000	seriously, seriously, the first time
4957000	4959000	I played Luminous, my reaction was,
4959000	4961000	man, can you imagine if they made, like, a Tetris game like this?
4961000	4963000	And, like, we're fucking getting it. So,
4963000	4965000	sit down, shut up,
4965000	4967000	and eat pie. And eat your rice.
4967000	4969000	I don't know.
4969000	4971000	It's not coming to the Switch, though, which is unfortunate.
4971000	4973000	Well, no,
4973000	4975000	yeah, it's exclusive. Not out the gate.
4975000	4977000	Right now, it's exclusive for Sony.
4977000	4979000	That Luminous reboot, though, is out at the end of June.
4979000	4981000	This is true.
4981000	4983000	And that is on the Switch.
4983000	4985000	I just like the soundtrack for Tetris Effect.
4985000	4987000	I just want everything to be on Switch, because
4987000	4989000	I just, I wish it was more powerful
4989000	4991000	that they could put more of the other things.
4991000	4993000	Did you notice, though, that Microsoft kind of snuck that
4993000	4995000	in there, where they were like, you can play on your phone,
4995000	4997000	and even though I know we're all laughing at that, like, ha ha,
4997000	4999000	I feel like that was kind of
4999000	5001000	like their way to say, like, well, you know,
5001000	5003000	you can play anywhere on Microsoft, too.
5003000	5005000	It's just a little different.
5005000	5007000	Yeah.
5007000	5009000	I get it. A little bit. Yeah, I get it.
5009000	5011000	But I appreciated that Microsoft
5011000	5013000	is kind of trying to slyly go, you know.
5013000	5015000	Anyway,
5015000	5017000	go ahead and chat.
5017000	5019000	SG100Matt, I like this little piece of positivity here.
5019000	5021000	We get tied up in
5021000	5023000	winners and losers of E3, when
5023000	5025000	in reality, the winners are all of us gamers,
5025000	5027000	and the losers are the hate-filled
5027000	5029000	people who want to put down others
5029000	5031000	and make gaming an unhealthy place
5031000	5033000	for everyone. Be a winner, folks.
5033000	5035000	Aw, we could bake a cake.
5035000	5037000	Winners don't use cynicism.
5037000	5039000	FBI warning.
5039000	5041000	2018. Follow your dreams.
5041000	5043000	NBC star.
5043000	5045000	Let's see. E3inator
5045000	5047000	in chat says, Tetris is overrated,
5047000	5049000	Rob Roberts.
5049000	5051000	Okay. You want to talk about reading?
5051000	5053000	Let's talk about reading.
5053000	5055000	Aren't you the guy that just
5055000	5057000	called into the show to talk about Magic
5057000	5059000	the Gathering? I can see
5059000	5061000	where he got his name.
5061000	5063000	He's enraging us.
5063000	5065000	That's all I'm gonna say.
5065000	5067000	You're not the nice little guy that called in earlier.
5067000	5069000	I gave you all those compliments,
5069000	5071000	and now I think you're shit.
5071000	5073000	You're not shit.
5073000	5075000	You just have an opinion.
5075000	5077000	Yeah, you just have some really bad opinions.
5077000	5079000	I mean,
5079000	5081000	we all sometimes have incorrect
5081000	5083000	opinions, and it's just about, you know.
5083000	5085000	And I kind of like Magic
5085000	5087000	the Gathering, but like the old school card game
5087000	5089000	the most. Nothing beats the card game.
5089000	5091000	You know, Matt, my boyfriend,
5091000	5093000	he likes Magic the Gathering.
5093000	5095000	He used to like it a lot. He doesn't play it now.
5095000	5097000	I used to play
5097000	5099000	the shit out of it. He has a ton of old cards
5099000	5101000	in his... I used to play
5101000	5103000	in high school, and then I found out one day we were
5103000	5105000	completely playing it wrong.
5105000	5107000	The rules of that game are kind of complicated.
5107000	5109000	Now you've got YouTube's tutorials and shit
5109000	5111000	and computer games to help you understand the rules
5111000	5113000	of Magic the Gathering, but trying to read it out of a book
5113000	5115000	we were playing it wrong.
5115000	5117000	What I want to know is, where does the title
5117000	5119000	like, why is it called The Gathering?
5119000	5121000	Like, what do you gather
5121000	5123000	in it? Do you gather magic?
5123000	5125000	Yes, you tap your lands.
5125000	5127000	You tap your lands!
5127000	5129000	Tap the land, bitch!
5129000	5131000	Is it Magic comma The Gathering?
5131000	5133000	No.
5133000	5135000	Like, is Magic the title of The Gathering?
5135000	5137000	Magic colon The Gathering.
5137000	5139000	Oh, Magic colon...
5139000	5141000	I want to know
5141000	5143000	what caused the
5143000	5145000	original people to come up with this title.
5145000	5147000	Magic colon
5147000	5149000	The Gathering.
5149000	5151000	Wait, wait, is Magic the IP
5151000	5153000	and The Gathering is the name
5153000	5155000	of the game?
5155000	5157000	Listen, you gather the magic
5157000	5159000	to summon the monsters while you tap the lands.
5159000	5161000	Why is it so complicated?
5161000	5163000	That's the game's core mechanic.
5163000	5165000	Yeah, but when you think about it,
5165000	5167000	though...
5167000	5169000	I don't know.
5169000	5171000	I just wish...
5171000	5173000	I agree with Dungeon Buster. Dungeon Buster says,
5173000	5175000	Magic colon The Gathering sounds dangerous.
5179000	5181000	We're gonna leave it at that.
5181000	5183000	That was a joke I knew Extro would like.
5183000	5185000	I like that joke.
5185000	5187000	Anything else to share with us, Lowkey, or are we shutting it down?
5187000	5189000	Ah, we can shut it down. I was just checking the Wikipedia page
5189000	5191000	for Magic the Gathering to see if they had an explanation.
5191000	5193000	Explain yourself!
5193000	5195000	You know, I'm glad I can
5195000	5197000	provoke these moments of
5197000	5199000	education. It's what I
5199000	5201000	live for.
5201000	5203000	You're welcome.
5203000	5205000	Alright,
5205000	5207000	so here we go.
5207000	5209000	Let's explain what it was.
5209000	5211000	The game,
5211000	5213000	while the game is simply called Magic
5213000	5215000	through most of playtesting,
5215000	5217000	when the game had to be officially named,
5217000	5219000	a lawyer informed them that the name Magic
5219000	5221000	was too generic to be named.
5221000	5223000	Mana Clash was instead
5223000	5225000	chosen to be the name used
5225000	5227000	in the first solicitation of the game.
5227000	5229000	However, everybody involved in the game
5229000	5231000	continued to refer to it as Magic.
5231000	5233000	After further consultation with
5233000	5235000	the lawyer, it was decided
5235000	5237000	to name the game Magic the Gathering,
5237000	5239000	thus enabling the name to be
5239000	5241000	trademarked. So that's why they don't
5241000	5243000	just call it Magic. Interesting.
5243000	5245000	But you know what? Mana Clash sounds...
5245000	5247000	You can't trademark Magic.
5247000	5249000	Mana Clash sounds
5249000	5251000	like an 80s synth-pop band.
5251000	5253000	But it also, in the context of today's
5253000	5255000	media and everything,
5255000	5257000	it sounds like a generic mobile game.
5257000	5259000	It probably is a game
5259000	5261000	called Mana Clash on the store right now.
5261000	5263000	And it's probably a match three game.
5263000	5265000	Mana Clash!
5265000	5267000	Alright, anyway.
5267000	5269000	We're going to wrap things up. Extrovert, the chatters
5269000	5271000	are loving you tonight. S2100 Matt says
5271000	5273000	don't be a stranger. Call in when you get settled in.
5273000	5275000	You're missed here. And Judge Boeser said thank you for
5275000	5277000	suggesting... S2100 Matt is suggesting
5277000	5279000	that you should have... Oh, I don't know about this.
5279000	5281000	I don't know about this. But he's suggesting
5281000	5283000	you should have a segment called
5283000	5285000	Hot Game Developer of the Week.
5285000	5287000	You know my
5287000	5289000	habits when it comes to podcasts.
5289000	5291000	I'll always miss that.
5291000	5293000	He'll do it for 12
5293000	5295000	weeks.
5295000	5297000	And they'll be like, oh, like
5297000	5299000	five weeks later. It's like, you're like,
5299000	5301000	do you want to do it again?
5301000	5303000	Guys, there's something about
5303000	5305000	the guys on the show, I think the revival went
5305000	5307000	for like 12 episodes, right?
5307000	5309000	Pokestop podcast went for 12 episodes.
5309000	5311000	Shaking and crying, we have 13
5311000	5313000	episodes and we've been off for five weeks.
5313000	5315000	Okay, so it's you. It's your fault.
5315000	5317000	I think it might be. You're the constant
5317000	5319000	in this. Alright, no.
5319000	5321000	No, no. I'm going to own up to the guys on the show.
5321000	5323000	But, but, but
5323000	5325000	um, most... And I am
5325000	5327000	trying to get Victoria in gear for us to move again.
5327000	5329000	And it is partially my fault why we put it
5329000	5331000	on a stop for a while. Most revivals
5331000	5333000	only last 13 episodes.
5333000	5335000	Roseanne.
5335000	5337000	Yes, but that's
5337000	5339000	because the last time I checked
5339000	5341000	I don't post stupid shit
5341000	5343000	on my Twitter.
5343000	5345000	I have to say, I have something
5345000	5347000	to say.
5347000	5349000	No, shaking and crying is coming back.
5349000	5351000	It's just, you notice, it's been a little
5351000	5353000	bit. So some of you might think it's been
5353000	5355000	ending, but as long
5355000	5357000	as Victoria isn't stopping, we
5357000	5359000	shouldn't be stopping. Anyway, sorry.
5359000	5361000	I was just going to say, you know, I, by the way
5361000	5363000	I've, people that
5363000	5365000	have listened to the show know I take
5365000	5367000	Ambien. I'm a friend to the
5367000	5369000	Ambien. I speak Ambienese.
5369000	5371000	Right. And so I have
5371000	5373000	taken it for 13 years on and off.
5373000	5375000	Do you play with Amiibo on Ambien?
5375000	5377000	No, I don't. I don't.
5377000	5379000	I play with my Amiibo on Ambien.
5379000	5381000	Right.
5381000	5383000	I'd like to play
5383000	5385000	with some of those guys on the show.
5385000	5387000	On Bethesda.
5387000	5389000	Okay, so I'm going to
5389000	5391000	summarize beside the point,
5391000	5393000	but what I want to say is
5393000	5395000	never have I
5395000	5397000	ever wanted to post
5397000	5399000	a racist tweet on Ambien.
5399000	5401000	Just going to go, just going to make
5401000	5403000	that clear, right?
5403000	5405000	Okay, just so that's clear. You've never been
5405000	5407000	compelled to just get on there. No, no, because
5407000	5409000	the thing about Ambien is you still
5409000	5411000	know right from wrong when you're on
5411000	5413000	it, so you're not going to do things that
5413000	5415000	aren't you. It's like you're not allowed to murder
5415000	5417000	it. Like guns don't kill people.
5417000	5419000	Ambien kills people. Exactly.
5419000	5421000	So let's say that I did
5421000	5423000	make a racist tweet on Ambien.
5423000	5425000	That would mean I'm a racist.
5425000	5427000	Uh huh.
5427000	5429000	Connect the dots there, Rob.
5429000	5431000	I kind of already did.
5431000	5433000	Like Roseanne, she's
5433000	5435000	canceled. Like literally and
5435000	5437000	figuratively. I didn't like the show anyway.
5437000	5439000	It came on as like, this is
5439000	5441000	just too much propaganda
5441000	5443000	bullshit nonsense.
5443000	5445000	It got so bad. It got
5445000	5447000	so bad in my opinion. Like I'm like,
5447000	5449000	this isn't funny anymore.
5449000	5451000	Anyway, wow. So this is
5451000	5453000	not the Roseanne podcast. No, it's
5453000	5455000	not. It's not. So I think, I think
5455000	5457000	we're ready to wrap up.
5457000	5459000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, you have
5459000	5461000	said stupid shit, Rob. Like Super Metroid
5461000	5463000	is better than Chrono Trigger on
5463000	5465000	your Twitter, so that's hate speech.
5465000	5467000	Well, I mean
5467000	5469000	when you're going to spell the truth. Facts are facts, America.
5470000	5472000	Honestly,
5472000	5474000	I can't judge Chrono Trigger. I
5474000	5476000	never played it. Here's the thing.
5476000	5478000	I always get shit
5478000	5480000	over that line, which I, I'm going to
5480000	5482000	stand by. I'm going to stand by. You can
5482000	5484000	put it on my fucking tombstone. Super Metroid
5484000	5486000	is the greatest video game ever made. Here's
5486000	5488000	the thing though. When have I ever said
5488000	5490000	Chrono Trigger is a bad game?
5490000	5492000	Like, and that's the whole thing. This is like gaming
5492000	5494000	in a nutshell. Can't we
5494000	5496000	just enjoy both?
5496000	5498000	Can't we enjoy both?
5498000	5500000	Isn't there room
5500000	5502000	in your collection for
5502000	5504000	both? And also, if we're going to go further,
5504000	5506000	what if you did think
5506000	5508000	Chrono Trigger was a bad game?
5508000	5510000	What does that matter? You're not actually
5510000	5512000	destroying world peace. That's just your opinion.
5512000	5514000	It's true. Lavos
5514000	5516000	destroyed world peace. I didn't do shit.
5516000	5518000	I don't care if you don't like my favorite
5518000	5520000	things, but like, I mean
5520000	5522000	I might get a little irked and be like,
5522000	5524000	well, they're stupid.
5524000	5526000	That's like when you talk shit about Forza Horizon
5526000	5528000	4. I'd be like, that's your wrong opinion.
5528000	5530000	But go ahead.
5530000	5532000	Well, it's kind of a derivative game.
5534000	5536000	You know, with those cars. I think you meant to say
5536000	5538000	a deriving game. It is a deriving
5538000	5540000	game. A deriving, yeah. And you drive
5540000	5542000	in the winter and the summer
5542000	5544000	and the autumn and we're gonna leave it at
5544000	5546000	that before I'm gonna put
5546000	5548000	you in Valve's corner.
5548000	5550000	Nobody belongs in that corner
5550000	5552000	except for Valve, Rob. Nobody puts
5552000	5554000	Valve in a corner. Yeah.
5554000	5556000	Nobody wants to put Valve in a corner.
5558000	5560000	This hurts me more than it hurts you, Valve.
5560000	5562000	Are we done?
5562000	5564000	Can we sign off now? Alright. Yes.
5564000	5566000	That's it. We're gonna be back in another
5566000	5568000	seven days to do this all again.
5568000	5570000	Without Extfer. No, but they can't.
5570000	5572000	Sorry, guys.
5572000	5574000	I appreciated you being here. You're a lot of fun as always.
5574000	5576000	Do you have anything you want to plug?
5576000	5578000	Like, things that people should follow you on
5578000	5580000	if they miss you? You know, you can follow
5580000	5582000	me on Twitter. I'm
5582000	5584000	GamerExtfer. It's
5584000	5586000	G-A-Y... Why do I always have to
5586000	5588000	spell this stuff? Well, cause there's...
5588000	5590000	Well, Extfer is E-X-T-O-F-E-R.
5590000	5592000	It's not X-T-O-F-E-R.
5592000	5594000	It's E-X-T-O-F-E-R.
5594000	5596000	But Gamer is G-A-Y-M-E-R.
5596000	5598000	Like Gay,
5598000	5600000	Gamer, GamerX. Right.
5600000	5602000	Happy Pride. Yes.
5602000	5604000	You should spell that name. That is
5604000	5606000	what I would think. There you go.
5606000	5608000	Cool. I don't have
5608000	5610000	anything else, though. I don't have anything else I do
5610000	5612000	lately. I don't stream
5612000	5614000	anymore. Support Ubisoft cause
5614000	5616000	then... Yeah, yeah. Buy the
5616000	5618000	Fractured But Whole.
5618000	5620000	Because, you know, it's nice to show
5620000	5622000	people support. A lot of hard
5622000	5624000	working people worked on that game.
5624000	5626000	That's right.
5626000	5628000	Still haven't played through all the DLC.
5628000	5630000	I know. He keeps telling me to
5630000	5632000	play through the latest one.
5632000	5634000	The second DLC. He says
5634000	5636000	it's really good. I bought the Season Pass
5636000	5638000	and I was like, that's what I typically do
5638000	5640000	with games. Like, I'm gonna buy the Season Pass.
5640000	5642000	And then I stopped playing the game. I did Fallout 4.
5642000	5644000	I did that with Call of Duty.
5644000	5646000	And I did it with that one.
5646000	5648000	I'm sure there's other games.
5648000	5650000	Skyrim. It happens.
5650000	5652000	It happens. Alright.
5652000	5654000	So as I always say at the end of the show, thank you
5654000	5656000	so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. If you enjoyed
5656000	5658000	what you heard here at the show, leave us
5658000	5660000	a nice five star review on iTunes or
5660000	5662000	tell a friend or wherever you hear the show.
5662000	5664000	iTunes, Google Play, whatever. And tell a friend or
5664000	5666000	two about the show. Help us spread the word because
5666000	5668000	we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5668000	5670000	And we can't get the
5670000	5672000	voices out here to air unless
5672000	5674000	y'all know about the show. If you didn't
5674000	5676000	enjoy tonight's OLR, try
5676000	5678000	to download one of the other episodes
5678000	5680000	that didn't get interrupted with E3
5680000	5682000	and Extoverne.
5682000	5684000	I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
5684000	5686000	No, I consider that a compliment.
5686000	5688000	Anyway, if you didn't enjoy
5688000	5690000	tonight's episode, you're just wrong. Sorry.
5690000	5692000	Hate to say it. Anyway.
5692000	5694000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5694000	5696000	Dexter, do you have a final thought?
5696000	5698000	I want to
5698000	5700000	sleep with that guy and his dad on
5700000	5702000	the Bethesda conference.
5704000	5706000	Maybe you should keep that thought
5706000	5708000	internal. I don't know if my boyfriend
5708000	5710000	would really appreciate
5710000	5712000	the final thought. Probably not.
5712000	5714000	Loki, can you give us a real final thought, please?
5714000	5716000	I'm looking forward to seeing all of the
5716000	5718000	game announcements this week.
5718000	5720000	Hopefully there's nothing
5720000	5722000	disappointing. Death Stranding.
5722000	5724000	My final thought is I'm gonna hold out
5724000	5726000	hope for Super Metroid 2.
5726000	5728000	Have a good night, everybody.
5728000	5730000	We'll see you in seven days. What about F-Zero? What are the odds
5730000	5732000	of F-Zero this year?
5732000	5734000	I hope so. None to none. Can I play the credit
5734000	5736000	music now? We'll see you in seven days. Bye.
5752000	5754000	The views and opinions
5754000	5756000	expressed in this program do not
5756000	5758000	necessarily reflect those of the staff
5758000	5760000	of Orange Lounge Radio or
