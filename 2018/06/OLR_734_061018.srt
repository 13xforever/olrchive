00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's the most wonderful time of the year

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
When we learn of the games in the near future

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll discuss mentor hope and so on this show

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thanks for that, Jason. Hi, welcome back everybody to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 734 of our show for this June 10th, 2018

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And yes, it is that time of the year, the most wonderful time of the year to be a gamer

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Because we get to find out all the games that we'll be playing about a year and a half from now

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It used to be the games that we would play this holiday, but now it's eh, the games we'll play about a year and a half from now

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Just kidding, we're not that cynical about it, but it is kind of funny

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's E3 week everybody, and we're here in studio to talk about all the latest and greatest that is unfolding literally before our eyes tonight

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
My name, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Her name, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, hi

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
How are you, Ms. Summers?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Tired

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I know, you had a prideful day, right?

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I did

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Today was Sacramento Pride

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I worked a booth at Pride and wandered around all over the place

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But I was there with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And some of the San Francisco Sisters came out and it was great to see them again

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And I just had a really good time, but by the time I was ready to go, I was fucking ready

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I went home and cleaned off all the makeup and exfoliated and sheet masked

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And nearly fell asleep with the sheet mask on my face

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's like the equivalent of a waffle iron she puts on her face to remove all the...

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, the makeup may be as thick as a waffle iron

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You were all nervous about coming here with no makeup on tonight

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Lights, camera, and me without a stitch of makeup on

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's a very obscure movie reference if you get it

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I came with the pink powder zit spot stuff on my face

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was gonna say you look marvelous, darling

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't need makeup, but I understand it is part of the sister ritual

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, yeah, but the thing is that I like, you know, going out with a little bit on

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Just because it's artistry for me

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And today I was just like...

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Lazy Sunday

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I do appreciate your rainbow watch, though

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You've got a very prideful watch

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, yeah, I switched to my pride band

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Your LGBTQIA+, et cetera, et cetera

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, I ordered the new pride band

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And it didn't arrive yet because I have the new face on my watch, too

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, that has little dancy lines

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It is really cool, but I actually like the older pride band better

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The new one I wish was on, like, a black background

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
With the stripes, it would have been better to me

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I do want to also introduce the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
vognetwork.com

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And tonight, obviously, our show is being interrupted by one of the E3 press conferences

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But I'll get to that in a minute

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But if you are listening live, you can go to live.vognetwork.com

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Where JD is saying you don't need makeup, especially for radio

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's true, you know, I've been told plenty of times that I have a face that's perfect for radio

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Anyway, also a man fit for radio

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know how to take that, but sure

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a compliment, question mark, no I'm just kidding

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How are you doing, Loki?

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm fine

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Good, good

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Enjoying all these announcements so far?

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Most of them, yeah

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Not so much EAA, but you know

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Alright, well, let's jump right in

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We only have about 20 minutes before we get to Bethesda's press conference

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So here's how it's going to work

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So tonight, it's about 6.07 Pacific time

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
As we're broadcasting live here at the Voice Geeks Network

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We are going to kind of pause our show at 6.30

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So that we can all watch Bethesda's E3 press conference together

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Because there will likely be some big news that comes out of that

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We know we're going to get a better look at Fallout 76

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Even more so than we saw at Microsoft's event today

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So we're going to watch that together

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
For those of you that are listening live

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We have decided this year to do it a little differently than we have in the years past

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And as long as the bandwidth cooperates

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's a big footnote because here in the studio the bandwidth is sometimes crappy

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We will provide you live commentary tonight

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So if you want to keep OLR on while Bethesda's thing is going

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We will do live commentary as Bethesda's event is going

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Because you guys have asked for it, the live folks in previous years

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And if you don't want to listen to that, that's fine

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I will not be offended if you turn it off

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And come back to us when it's all over

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And we'll continue on with news and our regular segments

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As we come back into the show

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know how long Bethesda is tonight

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't know if they're 60 minutes or 90 minutes

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I would think they're only 60

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because I wouldn't think they have 90 minutes worth of stuff to announce

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But if they were to surprise the hell out of us with Elder Scrolls 6

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Which I don't think they will at this point

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What continents do they have left?

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The undiscovered one that we never knew about until now

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's the clever video game trope

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But anyway, I'm not expecting that though

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I assume that Fallout 76 is their big title

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Maybe they would tease a little bit Elder Scrolls for next year

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But I just don't see that happening

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But anyway, let's talk about until then

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's talk about what we've seen so far

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So yesterday EA did their bit

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And Loki, you watched the whole thing, right?

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, I watched everything

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What were your thoughts on EA?

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think it was kind of let down

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But I mean, it's typical EA

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They didn't really announce too much

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Even with Battlefield 5, they did this whole preview thing like a week before

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But they didn't really show too much

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They kind of talked a little bit about multiplayer

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There's going to be, of course, some changes

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They reiterated that there's no loot boxes or season passes

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
However, I overheard someone talking about

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The pre-order stuff that they had for Battlefield 5

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then it mentioned airdrops

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Which were possibly something alluding to

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They're going to have a couple of Macs hooked up to airdrop

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, so a couple

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Basically alluding to that there might be some sort of content or something that comes in

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But I don't know

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So we'll see when it comes out if they actually stick to the no loot box thing

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But that's what they said

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They announced that they're going to be doing Battle Royale as well for it

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because everybody's got to jump on that bandwagon

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And then talking about customization

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Their destruction systems getting even better

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And they had some other stuff like Grand Operations and whatnot

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then along with that

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course, they talked about FIFA 19

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So they have this new

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They have a trial for 18 available now

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And then some new Champions League mode

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They talked about their EA Cloud streaming service

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Which they didn't really say what that was yet

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But something that's going to be coming

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And that includes this Origin Access Premier

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Where you'll be able to access games as they come out

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Through Origin

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's $15 a month or $100 a year

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
How's this different from the EA thing they already have on Xbox?

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Or is it kind of like the same thing?

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, EA is

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The EA Pass

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
EA Play

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't even know what the fuck they call it

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think this is on PC

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So there's like a new one for PC

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And the one on PC will be new stuff

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Whereas the EA catalog on Xbox One

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think it's both new

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
New and old stuff

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm confused

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There's a lot of stuff they're trying to sell me

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Of course, it's EA

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well that's business, whatever

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And then Respawn has a new game coming out

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A new Star Wars game

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's going to take place between episodes 3 and 4

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This was a holiday 2019

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Called Jedi Fallen Order

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And then of course they showed off

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Some more updates for Battlefield 2

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's going to have a new season

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Which is going to be

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So that took place in the prequel stuff

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So they have new heroes and villains

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So General Grievous, Obi-Wan

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And a new Starfighter mode

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There's also going to be stuff coming out for the solo movie

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So content from that

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They announced Unravel 2 which is out today

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And so a sequel to their other indie game Unravel

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That was kind of part of that EA original thing

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, that was a pleasant little surprise

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Especially the fact that it's out today

188
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
NBA Live 19 and Madden 19

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
They showed some trailers for that

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then they had this thing for Command & Conquer Rivals

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Which is a new mobile strategy game

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Which looked terrible and they spent way too much time on it

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You were a big Command & Conquer fan though

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I was

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This looks like Clash of Clans or something

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So no thanks

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ouch, okay

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So then they got to Anthem

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So Anthem, they had a new trailer

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They talked about it once again

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No loot boxes or anything like that

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They will have cosmetic items but it'll be like

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You know what you're getting when you're purchasing them

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You can play the game solo

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They're going to have a demo for it

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Also different clips

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They are showing some of the gameplay and stuff

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's four different classes you can play as

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Different, what they call

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't remember what they're calling their

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Javelins, their suits, yeah

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I still am an extremely bitter Betty

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And probably unrationally so, I will own that

214
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
When it comes to Anthem, due to

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How much of a middle finger

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I feel like EA has been giving us

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When it comes to Mass Effect

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But there's two things

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That gave me a little bit of positivity

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
One, Casey Hudson

221
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Went on record and said Mass Effect's

222
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Not done, I don't even know if you saw that

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But Casey Hudson did

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I did and then I rolled my eyes really hard

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
At least they're not done

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They're not going to abandon Mass Effect

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We're going to have more books

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I got the sense they meant games

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What I want is that Quarian DLC

230
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, I don't blame you

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But if they decide, you know what, we're going to go

232
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Somewhere completely different next

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Or we're going to do, I don't know what's left to do

234
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Maybe they would have to do a prequel to The Shepherd's

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Story or something, I don't know where they would go next

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But maybe they'll

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Do a really fucking ballsy thing

238
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And do Mass Effect 4

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They had N7 skins by the way

240
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
For the Javelins, I did notice that when they were doing

241
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Their little thing

242
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Keep it, but anyway

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I will say this though, at least with as much

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Very angry gamer face when it comes to

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Anthem right now, because of the hurt I feel

246
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
In my heart

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I was very encouraged by the fact

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That they went out of their way to say

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can do this completely solo

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So that tells me there is something to Anthem

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Besides just wanting to copy

252
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Destiny completely

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If you can play this completely solo

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm a little more like

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Alright

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So show me some more video, let's see

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't know yet though

258
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll go back and watch that whole thing later

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But just right now, right now I'm still

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Feeling hurt

261
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Some folks in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
SHJ100Matt says Anthem looks really neat

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Dungeon Buster says they're trying to

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
In quotes, figure out Mass Effect

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You know, aren't we all

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And then there was also

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Another indie game that they were showing off

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Which I can't remember the name of it

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Right now, but it was basically this big

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Flooded world type thing

271
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That looked kind of cool

272
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So, that was

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That, but yeah

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
With the Command and Conquer rivals though

275
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I can't trust them at all, because I mean look at Dungeon Keeper

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That they released, it was just terrible

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They like ruined that franchise

278
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
By just destroying it with all the crap that you would get

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
With

280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Just, you know, your typical mobile game

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know, not a fan

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Of that

283
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So that was pretty much EA right there

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Alright, so let's talk about Microsoft

285
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Which I did watch, I did watch Microsoft

286
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah, Microsoft, they had tons of games

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
To announce, so lots of stuff they showed off

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So a brief tease for a game called

289
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Halo Infinite, not sure what that's

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Gonna be, but it is in the Halo universe

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Looked like an MMO maybe

292
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It looked really pretty, like when they were showing all the

293
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Really diverse landscapes and stuff

294
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Especially because I was doing the whole

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Watching on Mixer in 4K

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I was really impressed with how

297
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Good it looked, so there is that

298
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They had a new

299
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Sequel for Ori

300
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And the Will of the Wisps, that looked pretty nice

301
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That was pretty gorgeous

302
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
A new game from software

303
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Or from

304
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
From software

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Sekiro Shadows Die Twice

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Which is almost like a samurai

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Ninja Dark Souls

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Which is what people are kind of assuming from what we saw

309
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But that looked pretty sweet

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But here's the thing, I just have to

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Get this out, like although Microsoft

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Showed a lot of great games

313
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Like how many of them are Microsoft

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Xbox exclusive

315
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Or even Microsoft Xbox

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Windows exclusive

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
A lot of the stuff they showed

318
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Is coming to multiple things

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know what I mean, and that's the one area

320
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Where I do think Microsoft

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Still, don't get me wrong

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not trying to derail what was

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
A fun, especially

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
As the opening act, I think a

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Fun tone of games, games, games

326
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
To show us at E3

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Even if a lot of them were for 2019

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We found out

329
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Last night I think the Kingdom Hearts

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Was going to get bumped a little bit

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We just found out that Crackdown 3

332
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Now it's going to get bumped a little bit

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So don't get me wrong, they had this great games, games, games tone

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But how much of that was really like

335
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But you need to go get an Xbox One today

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because you are missing the fuck out

337
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If you don't do it

338
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That was the impression I was getting

339
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But don't get me wrong

340
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I enjoyed it just as a

341
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Games keynote

342
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Sorry, I don't mean to jump ahead

343
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But there were some things where I was like

344
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay, this is why I own an Xbox One

345
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Because I want to be able to play this

346
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is why I have a beefy PC

347
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So I can play this

348
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I just had to get that off my chest

349
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They showed off Fallout 76

350
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Which is kind of surprising

351
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Being that we are about to see Bethesda

352
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Which looked interesting

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It is a typical Fallout game

354
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Four times the size of the map from Fallout 4

355
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And it looked pretty

356
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So there doesn't seem to be any

357
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, it's an MMO

358
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Or all these things people were anticipating

359
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It could be co-op

360
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They had a new game

361
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's in

362
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
A new game called

363
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The Awesome Adventures of Captain's Spirit

364
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Which is in, I forget, the universe of

365
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Life is Strange

366
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Square Enix's

367
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's coming out free on the 26th

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Well, I imagine it's like Life is Strange

369
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Where the first episode is free

370
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's cool

371
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They showed Crackdown 3

372
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
February is when that's coming out

373
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How did you like that though?

374
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It looks nice

375
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm excited for it

376
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I just wish it was coming out this year

377
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, but they gotta take the time to get it right

378
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
How much time do they fucking need?

379
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's been like four years now

380
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
4K is probably a bigger pain in the ass

381
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
than people think

382
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I love the Tron look of it

383
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
For the record

384
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
As God's Edition

385
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
February 26th

386
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's kind of remastered and everything

387
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Metro Exodus

388
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Everybody in chat is trying to correct me

389
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
On the whole free thing where they say

390
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
100% free

391
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But doesn't that still leave the door open?

392
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sure, the first episode that they just showed us

393
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That is this

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is 100% free

395
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But then they're gonna sell more episodes

396
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't you make video games to make money?

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There's gotta be a catch here

398
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If it is 100% free

399
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If it's a one-off side story thing

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's maybe trying to push back copies of Life is Strange

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Then great

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I still took 100% free

403
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
To mean

404
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's like a little teaser for something else

405
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
JD says

406
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's a promo for Life is Strange 2

407
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Okay

408
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then fine

409
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's 100% free

410
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Sorry Loki

411
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I gotta pay attention to chat

412
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They showed off a new trailer for Metro Exodus

413
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Which looked pretty cool

414
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 had a new trailer

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Metro is coming out February 22

416
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Kingdom Hearts January 29th

417
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They showed off

418
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't know if they mentioned it before

419
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The Frozen world

420
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They have Frozen and stuff

421
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
As much as I'm over Frozen

422
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Again

423
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Getting to watch that in 4K

424
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You can just see how fucking good it looks

425
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
With all the particle effects

426
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And the additional neon

427
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They throw in it

428
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The summons and the way that Wreck-It Ralph

429
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Looks like a digitized arcade

430
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It looks

431
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Really good

432
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The graphics have come so far

433
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
From Kingdom Hearts 2

434
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They showed off

435
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There's two expansions coming for Sea of Thieves

436
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Cursed

437
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Cursed Sails

438
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't remember the other one

439
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
They have those coming out

440
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
They showed off another trailer for Battlefield 5

441
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Which is the one that EA was telling you

442
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Tune in for this peek at the

443
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Blah blah blah

444
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It was so brief

445
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I thought they were going to do a deeper dive into it

446
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But they didn't

447
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What they did do a pretty deep dive into

448
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Was Forza Horizon 4

449
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Which is going to be coming out in October

450
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What's awesome about that is

451
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
In Britain this time

452
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They have the different seasons

453
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't know if that's going to sync with the actual seasons

454
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What part of the world is it going to sync to

455
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't know but it looked cool

456
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm down for that

457
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We Happy Few is going to be finished

458
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
August 10th

459
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
They of course announced that they had bought a bunch of companies

460
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This was the biggest news

461
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The whole night in my opinion

462
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They acquired four and built one

463
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Right?

464
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's huge

465
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The fact that they have Ninja Theory

466
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I kind of think this is something they should have done

467
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Two or three years ago

468
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They identified that their exclusives

469
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Were not really holding up

470
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Next to Sony's as well

471
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But I guess better late than never

472
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The problem is you're not really going to see the effects of this

473
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
For another couple years I don't think

474
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And these new games that these companies are making

475
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But no disrespect

476
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I still think Xbox is in a much better place

477
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Under Phil Spencer than it was previously

478
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So again, no hate

479
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It would have been really exciting

480
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
To see this a couple years ago

481
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And then of course

482
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
We showed off another trailer for PUBG

483
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Then there was a bunch of different announcements

484
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Tales of Vesperia

485
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Definitive Edition coming out this winter

486
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Also on the Switch

487
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Tom Clancy's The Division 2

488
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Why Ubisoft?

489
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Why did you have to do the fake

490
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Co-op chatter?

491
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That fake Co-op chatter is like

492
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The one time a year

493
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Where I feel like I can actually hear

494
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
People playing a game together online

495
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And treating each other with respect

496
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's like a nice change of pace

497
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Where I'm like, wait a minute

498
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Two women are playing this demo with two guys

499
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And they're not being asked about their boobs

500
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They're being treated respectfully

501
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The guys aren't calling each other

502
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Fancy ass guys

503
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You know what I mean?

504
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Everybody is being very respectful

505
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And I'm like, I almost prefer

506
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Fake dialogue planet

507
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How do I get an account on Xbox fake?

508
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Alright, well whatever

509
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
They had a new trailer for Shadow of the Tomb Raider

510
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They have a session

511
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Which is basically

512
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Standing in for Skate 4

513
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Because there is no Skate 4

514
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And the new Tomb Raider

515
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Lara Croft's No Good

516
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Very Bad Day in Latin America

517
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then we have

518
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
A new MMORPG called

519
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Black Desert

520
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Which is supposed to be out this fall

521
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Black Desert Online is already on PC

522
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Is that not the same thing?

523
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And they showed it last year too by the way

524
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Don't be wrong

525
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It looked really good

526
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I remember last year going, wow this game looks really good

527
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And somebody tweeted me

528
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Black Desert Online is already on PC and it's not good

529
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And I was like, oh well alright

530
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Womp womp

531
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Then they had of course Devil May Cry 5

532
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Which they showed off

533
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Cuphead in the delicious last course

534
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Which is DLC for Cuphead

535
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That sounds like fun

536
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And they have a new playable character

537
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And crying

538
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Cuphead of course

539
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But work Miss Chalice

540
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There's a new character

541
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Miss Chalice

542
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's like Mugman with a bow in her hair

543
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
No I'm just kidding

544
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Totally fleshed out character

545
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They had a game called Tunic

546
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Which looks like Zelda

547
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That was my favorite thing

548
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Second favorite thing

549
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The Legend of Little Cute Fox

550
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Jump Force

551
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Which is Shonen Jump

552
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It looked like a fighting game

553
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Anime is real

554
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Dying Light 2

555
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Battletoads

556
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Actually new Battletoads

557
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But they didn't show anything

558
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They didn't show anything but say it's happening

559
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And it had a sense of humor

560
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't get me wrong

561
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's nice to have that confirmation of the thing we've been saying should be happening for years

562
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Just Cause 4

563
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Which is awesome

564
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's coming out this year as well

565
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And then this is where they started teasing all the Gears of War stuff

566
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So they first said

567
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh yeah we got new Gears of War

568
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Gears of War Pop figure

569
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Mobile game

570
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
There was like awww

571
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And they're like just kidding

572
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
We actually have a real Gears game coming out

573
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Gears Tactics

574
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then they're like oh just kidding

575
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Gears 5

576
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So there's a new Gears game coming

577
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The three of them

578
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And they're going in a completely different direction with Gears with this

579
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
They switch the protagonist to

580
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
My Gears characters as well

581
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But the way it's set up you're not playing as Phoenix

582
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You're playing as the female

583
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
In their group

584
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Who I don't know her name so I apologize

585
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But then it looks like her and one of the other guys

586
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That was kind of like the side character

587
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
In the earlier games

588
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This is their game

589
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So they go off together

590
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm all for strong female leads

591
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So let's make those

592
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
People that don't get it cry

593
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And that was supposed to be

594
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The end of the show and then the one more thing

595
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They showed off a trailer for Cyberpunk

596
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
2077 it looked fucking awesome

597
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That looked hot

598
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah that looked really hot

599
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
If you don't know that's being done by CD Projekt Red

600
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Who did The Witcher 3

601
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And obviously The Witcher before that

602
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Witcher 3 is an extremely cinematic game

603
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So now it's like okay instead of like the medieval

604
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Setting that The Witcher games were in

605
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Now it's going to be like a cyberpunk setting

606
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It has a really great look to it

607
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And then of course they were talking about Games Pass as well

608
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You still get all these

609
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
First party games out day in

610
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Date with Crackdown 3

611
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And Forza

612
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Horizon 4 are going to be coming out

613
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Their Netflix type of thing

614
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Which by the way since you went through it so fast

615
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I did not get a chance to fanboy about Forza Horizon 4

616
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But it looks so good

617
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It looks so good

618
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh my god it was like one of those things

619
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I had my tweet deck up on one screen

620
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
While I'm watching the press event

621
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
On the other screen and as I'm watching the tweet

622
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That go by there's all these people that are like

623
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yawn car game

624
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yawn potty break I gotta go poop

625
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's a Forza game and I'm like

626
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If I knew where you lived

627
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I would be banging pots and pans over your head

628
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
While you sleep until you play Forza

629
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Forza Horizon

630
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Specifically because look look I get it I get it

631
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm not super into the Gran Turismo games

632
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Or even the mainline Forza series

633
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The car sim games don't do it for me

634
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But Horizon is like

635
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Mario Kart

636
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Without the items

637
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And it's like in a real setting

638
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
With awesome like

639
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Euro rave

640
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Techno stuff

641
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And it's fucking great

642
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They have seasons now so like they're showing off this one lake

643
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And they're all well in the winter it'll be frozen

644
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You can drive over the lake and yes

645
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes so I'm down and down

646
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Locopogo says I don't even like Forza games

647
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Forza Horizons look great

648
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That is the correct attitude to have on my Twitter

649
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Thank you very much

650
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Everybody's backing up a little bit there

651
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And well we're almost at conference time

652
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
But I just want to mention one last thing

653
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Because they did talk about a bunch of games

654
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
PlayStation T is a bunch of stuff

655
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But of course we have to talk about Tetris Effect

656
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh my god like

657
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
E3 is done

658
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Tetris Effect I am so here for it

659
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yay

660
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's like Tetris getting the luminous effect

661
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Mizuguchi Tetris

662
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And again the people replying to that on Twitter

663
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
They're like it's just Tetris

664
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm like I will cyberbully you

665
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Like I am all for

666
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I am all for treating people with respect

667
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And dignity online

668
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But if you come after Tetris Effect

669
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I will cyberbully you

670
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I will alright

671
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Alright let's do this

672
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Alright so we're gonna have to switch over to Bethesda

673
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000

Actually yeah sorry we have a

692
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The joy of live radio is that we have our

693
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Live thing playing okay I just need to

694
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Like turn off the system over here

695
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So we get no more input from

696
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
YouTube on auto forwarding us to other streams

697
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Anyway so

698
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Some of you were listening along some of you weren't

699
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I saw mostly encouraging words there in

700
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Chat on the commentary but not everybody

701
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Is in the commentary so some of you didn't listen

702
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
To it and that's fine so let's talk a little

703
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
About especially for the sake of the podcast folks

704
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What we just saw although

705
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Before we get into that let me quickly

706
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What you may not have heard if

707
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You're listening on the podcast feed

708
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
During that time that Bethesda's thing was going on

709
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Jamie had to bow out

710
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So she is no longer here

711
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
In the studio but who is

712
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Joining us in the studio is an old friend

713
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's when we get to see what's coming out not for holiday

731
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Anymore but for next year

732
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I know yeah mostly next year

733
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah alright

734
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Let's run down kind of some of the things we just saw

735
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So overall what did you guys think of the Bethesda

736
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It was really padded out

737
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yeah I don't know

738
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
If it needed to be 90 minutes

739
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But you know there was still some

740
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Good stuff it was interesting and this is

741
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What I wanted to ask on the commentary feed

742
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That I said I'll wait and ask this on the main show

743
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So we were kind of talking at the end there

744
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So obviously Fallout 76 was one of the last things

745
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
They showed and so we got the confirmation

746
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That it's going to be like an online

747
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Type of game that's the direction it's going

748
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So it's going to be a little more multiplayer

749
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Which looks really cool you know

750
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I never have gotten super into the Fallout games

751
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But I imagine like if you are a fan of

752
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Fallout like this is probably like the type of thing you've been waiting

753
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
A very long time for so I know there's probably

754
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Going to be a lot of happy people about that

755
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And then I was kind of thinking okay well that's

756
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Where they're going to end it right

757
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Well they didn't end it with that they had this Elder Scrolls

758
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Blades that they showed off which you

759
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Were saying was originally a PSP thing

760
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I thought it was a PSP thing I remember they were doing

761
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
A PSP game or they were trying

762
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
To do a PSP game but you know

763
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You just can't run the Elder Scrolls

764
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
On a PSP right so

765
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It just didn't turn out

766
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That it would be anything but so then

767
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
They kind of had that going and said okay this is going

768
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
To be on mobile

769
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's going to be on Switch

770
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Consoles it's going to be on virtual reality

771
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Like if it fucking has a screen

772
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We're putting it on there almost

773
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
An illusion to that little funny bit they did

774
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Where they did Skyrim on the Alexa

775
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That was hilarious yeah that was really funny

776
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Does it have a mode to clean that shit up?

777
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That was my favorite line of holding

778
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So but then after that they said

779
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You know we want to tease you

780
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
About stuff out in the future too

781
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Because I think they probably have a sense

782
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That we're all sitting here going

783
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Elder Scrolls 6 Elder Scrolls 6

784
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Elder Scrolls 6 so sure enough

785
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
They give us first a game called

786
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Starfield which is

787
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It was nothing except

788
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's a space game it's a new IP that's all we know

789
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And then there it was

790
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The Elder Scrolls 6 but

791
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
All we really saw was like

792
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
A landscape

793
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Elder Scrolls 6 is coming after Starfield

794
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Some music

795
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Well not necessarily because Starfield

796
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Could be mid next year

797
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Maybe not you're right

798
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Or 2021

799
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So anyway what did you guys think

800
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Of that concept of

801
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Leaving us at the very

802
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
End with a really big

803
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Tease and you know honestly

804
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Microsoft kind of did this too

805
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
When they said we're working on

806
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The next Xbox I mean

807
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Xboxes

808
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh yeah okay they said they're working on the next

809
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Xboxes plural

810
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Little bit of a tease in itself too I mean

811
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
We all know these hardware

812
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Things are planned years out

813
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So of course Sony is working on

814
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
PlayStation 5 I see where you're going with that

815
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So what do you think though about these

816
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Extended teases

817
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I mean we're making all these jokes about how we're

818
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Seeing games in 2019 but now

819
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
These like final notes that we're getting left on

820
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
On these press conferences are

821
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Here's the long play

822
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Oh I think it's designed for people

823
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
For the consumers

824
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
To keep that in mind

825
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's like designed for us to be like

826
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Oh I have a lot more to look forward to

827
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So I just I need to keep

828
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Subscribing to their newsletter

829
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Or just like hey you know we've heard you

830
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Working on it you know you can stop asking us

831
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Now it is in development it's just true

832
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's a long ways out you know type of thing

833
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But I mean did they have

834
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
To confirm that they're working on an Elder Scrolls

835
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Game we all of course they're fucking doing

836
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Elder Scrolls 6 I think they did

837
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
No I think they still needed to

838
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
They needed to like try to meet expectations

839
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Okay for what it's worth

840
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll give them this It's just like Metroid Prime

841
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
4 last year all we saw was

842
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Like yeah we're working on it I'll give them this

843
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
At least it was like Elder Scrolls 6

844
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And not Elder Scrolls

845
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Forever

846
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You know or something

847
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
But I think it's different

848
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Than the Metroid Prime 4

849
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I feel like Metroid Prime 4

850
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Is happening this year I feel like it's not

851
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Quite the extended tease

852
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But I think the way it's different

853
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Is that I mean I don't know I can't speak

854
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
For the Elder Scrolls fandom

855
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But with the Metroid fandom

856
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We were all like

857
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Anxious because we thought Nintendo

858
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Had given up on Metroid

859
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Honestly we didn't think we didn't

860
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Know for sure if it was in the cards right

861
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So that was like a big surprise

862
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But did you did the Elder Scrolls

863
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Community like did they ever

864
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Doubt that another Elder Scrolls

865
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Game was ever gonna come out I thought for sure

866
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That they would do something like an

867
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Elder Scrolls 4 remastered

868
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Or something like that you know just like

869
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah I thought there'd be like an Oblivion remaster

870
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Like a remaster just you know bring it into the new engine

871
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
There still could be

872
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's not something they need to announce months and months out

873
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You know

874
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Anything else you guys want to highlight from that conference

875
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That we saw for those of you listening on the podcast feed

876
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We will offer that comment some people

877
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Cause we kind of got a little bit off topic

878
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
In some places so if you have an hour

879
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
There was much much

880
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Objectification of the developers

881
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
By the males

882
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Not including myself

883
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Why would you do that? Rob

884
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Anyway you robbed me

885
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
If you want to hear that

886
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000

I think that the very first part

895
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Of the whole conference

896
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Should have just like they should have not

897
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Done it I mean I get it for entertainment

898
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Value yay we have a big rock band

899
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But you know what nobody in the audience

900
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Was excited

901
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
They showed the audience and they're all like

902
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Really old white nerds

903
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I just realized you are way louder than

904
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Jamie is

905
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Sorry for the volume issues

906
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Old white nerds sitting in

907
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
There going like looking

908
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Like they don't belong

909
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Well no they're probably just like dude I came here to see video games

910
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Not watching Andrew WK not that

911
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We hate Andrew WK but it's like dude

912
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Come on

913
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Let's get the show on the road here

914
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
To watch a concert or watch a

915
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You know a band play

916
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I thought it wasn't like

917
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I thought the Rage 2

918
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Thing went on a little long

919
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yes

920
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It looks okay

921
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's by Avalanche they did you know

922
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
They've done the Just Cause games

923
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Avalanche actually

924
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm sorry my studio is confused here

925
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I think they did

926
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I think Avalanche was Just Cause

927
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And Mad Max

928
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That or it might have been

929
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What was the other one that was EA

930
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I don't remember no that was Pandemic

931
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Never mind

932
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So yeah they did Mad Max and stuff

933
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So it looks very much like Mad Max or like a

934
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Borderlands type game just you know not with the

935
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Stylized graphics

936
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Just a couple other quick things I want to hit and then I'll open it up

937
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
If you guys have anything you want to add but

938
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Doom Infinite so we have

939
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Eternal

940
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's a stupid name

941
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Insert forever

942
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Synonym here

943
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's the new Rage in gaming

944
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Doom Eternal

945
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
They said that's a thing

946
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But they didn't really show us

947
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Stay tuned for QuakeCon for more

948
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Which was lame

949
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
A little bit of a disappointment

950
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I guess it wasn't much more than they showed at the end

951
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
They had to make room for

952
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Andrew WK

953
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We knew that Doom would get a sequel

954
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So that's not too surprising

955
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And it's probably still a ways out

956
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah that's kind of like a little spin off

957
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And then that Elder Scrolls

958
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
card game is coming to Switch

959
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Except they didn't really say that

960
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You just see it in the trailer

961
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
They were very clearly playing it on a Nintendo Switch

962
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So it does seem like

963
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Bethesda is showing the Switch a lot of love

964
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
If you're a Nintendo fan you probably love them

965
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Bethesda right now because they also just put Fallout

966
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Shelter out right now on the

967
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Switch so I bet there's some people probably

968
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
downloading it

969
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Fallout Shelter they said was now right?

970
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Am I crazy? Didn't they say they were putting that out right now?

971
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't remember. I'm glad they did

972
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So anyway

973
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Alright

974
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And they're saying in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

975
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
S2100Matt says

976
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Apparently Andrew WK did another concert

977
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
after the show

978
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Kaijuto in chat says E3 should be fun

979
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Not just trailers and predictable crowd reactions

980
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I know but like with other like

981
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
They've done that before with I don't know if it was

982
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Microsoft or Sony they'll do like a musical number

983
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Like either at the end I think

984
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Do it for the crowd

985
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Warm them up and everything

986
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But like you know if you tell me to tune in at 6.30

987
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
to see game trailers I want to see game trailers

988
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Or like if you're doing that concert

989
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
where he's playing live you know playing the song live

990
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Do it to like gameplay

991
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
video or something like that

992
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Mix it in

993
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Things like that assume

994
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
that all of us that like games

995
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
like Rage also like that kind of music

996
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And I don't like that kind of music

997
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But yet I do like

998
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
games like Rage

999
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So for me it's not entertaining

1000
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't care what people say

1001
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
That's not entertaining

1002
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That's just padding the show and saying

1003
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Hey we got this famous person

1004
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Love us because we're cool

1005
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and hip but we got this stupid

1006
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
heavy metal band

1007
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Hey we got this famous person

1008
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's fine whatever

1009
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I would say overall though

1010
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I do feel very positive on Bethesda

1011
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I do like that they were

1012
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
willing to tease past the next year

1013
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You know and I kinda

1014
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You know and I've talked about this on a previous

1015
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
OLR like the movie industry

1016
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Fuck we know Marvel's plan for like the next four

1017
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
years right so why doesn't the

1018
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
gaming industry like are they afraid

1019
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
that somebody's gonna steal the idea or something like

1020
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I don't know yes I would actually see yes

1021
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
because look at like look at all these

1022
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
battle royale games coming up I guess that's true

1023
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But okay for all we know Elder Scrolls 6

1024
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
is battle royale

1025
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
We don't need to necessarily know that tonight

1026
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Elder Scrolls 6 should be multiplayer that'd be pretty awesome

1027
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't wanna even tease

1028
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
the potential but it could be

1029
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
but it could be alright anyway

1030
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Moving on

1031
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So anything else you guys wanna say on

1032
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Bethesda?

1033
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No I don't have anything

1034
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It was alright it just seemed like a bit slower paced this year

1035
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and they really dragged it out I don't think it needed to be 90 minutes

1036
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
long and I just felt last year

1037
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
they announced it was like more kind of exciting announcements

1038
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
They had some that were pretty cool

1039
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
but most of it was just kinda like

1040
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm bored

1041
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Honestly last year because they did the whole

1042
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Bethesda land thing and that was all

1043
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
really it was you know

1044
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I felt like it was more concise

1045
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
you know what I mean it felt like everything was just like

1046
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
in this neat little package

1047
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
so we didn't have time

1048
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
to like pan or have those awkward

1049
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
moments cause it was all like you know pre-done

1050
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah

1051
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay so I am gonna do our gaming weeks

1052
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
real quick here I will ask Loki

1053
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
can you be prepared to run through some headlines here in a moment

1054
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
just as soon as we are done

1055
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
so we can touch on some other things that have been happening

1056
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
during E3 we'll talk about our gaming weeks

1057
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
a quick housekeeping thing though since Jamie

1058
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
did have to leave earlier than expected cause we

1059
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
thought that thing would only be an hour

1060
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and it ended up being 90 minutes there's actually

1061
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
not gonna be a classic game this week so it's

1062
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
kind of a rarity in OLR history

1063
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
so we're gonna roll she actually I guess

1064
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I gotta say this she was going to do a peripheral

1065
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
tonight so we will roll that over

1066
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
till next week which is our big

1067
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
and it's a good knowing

1068
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
what it already is it is a good one

1069
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
for the 16th anniversary of the show that's all

1070
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'll say it's a good choice for

1071
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
our anniversary which is coming up next week

1072
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
so we will

1073
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
though talk about our gaming weeks so

1074
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Exeter I'll actually start with you if you want to talk about any

1075
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
video games you've been playing what are games

1076
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
you're enjoying lately

1077
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
like Greece I know you've been very busy

1078
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
preparing for your move but surely you've snuck

1079
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
a game in here and there

1080
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
so you know I'm addicted

1081
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to Binding of Isaac so really that's my

1082
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
that's my go to game to like

1083
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
just pick up and play you know

1084
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and not worry about anything like

1085
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
you know worrying about paying attention to

1086
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
story or anything like that just to pick up

1087
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and play a game so I can spend

1088
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
hours in it

1089
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and so that's that's

1090
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
that's pretty much what I've been playing

1091
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
oh

1092
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I did play a little bit of

1093
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Overwatch on my Xbox

1094
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
you know I was

1095
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I was actually testing

1096
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I was doing it to test out the

1097
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Wi-Fi on the Xbox because we were

1098
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
we were putting as

1099
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
everybody heard on the live

1100
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
on the Bethesda stream or whatever

1101
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I am moving to North Carolina

1102
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
so we've had to unhook

1103
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
everything and so because I unhooked

1104
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
the ethernet cable I was like I wonder

1105
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
what the Wi-Fi is like so I tested Overwatch

1106
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and I ended up playing like three hours

1107
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
of Overwatch and I'm like oh my

1108
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
god like you just can easily get sucked

1109
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
back into that game right yeah

1110
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
but but yeah

1111
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I have a lot of games that

1112
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm meaning to go back to

1113
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but I just

1114
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
haven't for whatever reason

1115
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
like I started a way out

1116
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I've been playing it with Flaco Jones

1117
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and we

1118
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
we had a really good time playing that so

1119
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
but that's dependent on his schedule

1120
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
you know being available right so

1121
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
so we're not gonna play I'm not gonna

1122
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
finish it until I know that he's

1123
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
available to finish it so anyway

1124
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
alright

1125
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'll talk about Mike

1126
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
are we allowed to talk about where your man

1127
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
works or do we want to keep that off here?

1128
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
oh I think we've already said he works for Ubisoft

1129
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
but he wouldn't

1130
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
talk obviously

1131
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't know

1132
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
even you don't know what he's working on?

1133
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
well it was announced today

1134
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Division 2

1135
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
so you knew

1136
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
so I know what he's going to be working on

1137
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I don't know the details or anything

1138
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
but yeah he got transferred

1139
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
he was so

1140
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
he

1141
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
worked for San Francisco

1142
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Studio, Ubisoft

1143
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
you can see him in Rocksmith

1144
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
promo videos if I remember right wasn't he

1145
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
in the Rocksmith promo?

1146
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
he worked a lot

1147
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
on Rocksmith and then he worked

1148
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
very heavily on South Park

1149
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the Fractured But Whole

1150
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and he I giggle every time

1151
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I know I know I giggle

1152
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and then he

1153
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
decided that

1154
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Bay Area expensive

1155
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
hard to raise a family

1156
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
we eventually want to have kids

1157
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
so he thought

1158
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
it might be a better idea to

1159
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
just try and get a transfer to the

1160
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Ubisoft studio in

1161
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
North Carolina and

1162
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
basically their name is Red Storm

1163
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Entertainment and they work on a lot of the

1164
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Tom Clancy

1165
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
so Division is

1166
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
the game that they work on

1167
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
in tandem with

1168
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Massive Entertainment

1169
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Massive is the main studio

1170
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and they're the ones in Sweden

1171
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Malmo, Sweden

1172
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
alright awesome awesome

1173
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
so cool

1174
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
if he ever wants to come

1175
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
via Skype and promote whenever the game's out

1176
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
cool cool there's some fans of

1177
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Division in chat so we'll see

1178
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
alright anyway

1179
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
so let's talk about other gaming weeks

1180
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
yeah I didn't play a whole ton of stuff

1181
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I played more Mario Odyssey

1182
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
just still trying to get the rest of the Power Moons

1183
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
so I've been going through all that stuff

1184
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I played more Pokemon

1185
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Quest

1186
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I've evolved a few things on there now

1187
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
you play that more than anyone I know

1188
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
but it's such a grind though

1189
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
it's alright

1190
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
it's getting kind of boring so I'll play it while I'm doing

1191
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
other things because

1192
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
basically it's on autoplay so I just

1193
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
set it up, hit a button

1194
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and come back in two minutes

1195
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and it's done

1196
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
yeah you can autoplay it

1197
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I don't know if you've played a game like

1198
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Non-Stop Night or something like that

1199
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
where basically the character auto

1200
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
they autorun and you have the option

1201
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to where you can control their special moves

1202
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
to when they do them or you can just say

1203
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
just autoplay and I find

1204
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
that when I do the autoplay stuff it ends up

1205
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
passing more levels than I do if I'm trying to control it

1206
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
so I'm like ah fuck it who cares

1207
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I just let it play itself

1208
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and then what else

1209
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I downloaded a game called

1210
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Totally Accurate Battlegrounds

1211
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
it looks fucking hilarious

1212
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
which by the same people

1213
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
they did Totally Accurate

1214
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Battle Simulator and also

1215
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Cluster Trucks and some other stuff

1216
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
definitely a game I want to check out

1217
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
it was free for like 100 hours

1218
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and now

1219
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
you can get it for 5 bucks

1220
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
but it's a battle royale game

1221
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
much like PUBG or something like that

1222
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
it's its own

1223
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
unique spin on it

1224
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
where it's just really bad

1225
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
as far as the physics and everything are just shit

1226
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
the characters look like shit

1227
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
because they look like the

1228
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Totally Accurate Battle Simulator

1229
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
characters they have these big bug eyes

1230
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and everything is just really weird

1231
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
you can do gangster style

1232
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
where they'll beatbox and turn the guns sideways

1233
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
they have guns that are

1234
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
enormous that will launch you across the map

1235
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
when you fire them

1236
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
what's this game that's out right now

1237
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm wondering if it's the same game

1238
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
where you turn into a chicken

1239
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
when you get shot enough

1240
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I saw it being streamed on Twitch

1241
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and they make this like

1242
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
horrible

1243
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
that could be the same game

1244
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I don't know

1245
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
that sounds like something they would do though

1246
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
it was the number one game streaming on

1247
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Twitch because that Ninja guy

1248
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
was playing it

1249
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
it could be that

1250
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I don't know but

1251
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
it's a silly game they've done

1252
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
other stuff they did a game called Stick Fight

1253
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
that's pretty awesome

1254
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
they have some pretty fun games that have come out

1255
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think that

1256
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
it sounds like it could be

1257
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm going to check real quick to see what was more popular

1258
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
games no they don't even have it on there

1259
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
but yeah it could be

1260
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
something that he played

1261
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I probably will check it out

1262
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I watched some streamers play it

1263
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
it looked hilarious

1264
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
you know how in

1265
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Fortnite if you drop out of this

1266
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
flying bus thing

1267
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
this one you're on the cluster trucks

1268
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and you get launched out

1269
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
into whatever you aim at

1270
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
it is a little creepy

1271
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
because they've got these giant blocks

1272
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
as the arena is closing in on you

1273
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
they kind of ominously come down

1274
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and crash into the ground

1275
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
so it's pretty cool

1276
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
but it's really funny

1277
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
and then Pokemon Go

1278
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
because they started that whole water thing

1279
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
so I've been getting my water Pokemon on

1280
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and yeah

1281
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
it was a little bit angerous

1282
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
that freaking water event is going on

1283
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and I still can't find more Lotads

1284
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
that's like the one thing

1285
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
that you can

1286
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I don't want to say easily get but I feel like the one

1287
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
non-regional, non-legendary

1288
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
the one thing I have left

1289
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
to get is

1290
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
well wait I take that back because I still don't have Luna Stone

1291
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I have Soul Rock but I don't have Luna Stone so I need one of those

1292
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and then I need that Lotad's final form

1293
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I have the second form

1294
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
but I don't have the final form

1295
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Lone Bray is the second form I think

1296
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I've been getting a lot of Mudkips

1297
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
yeah no there's tons of that and then Sirskit was one of the other ones I needed

1298
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
that I was missing but I got

1299
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
that because there's Sirskits everywhere right now

1300
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
so that was something I was able to do

1301
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
okay

1302
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
let's see talking about my gaming week

1303
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
it's a bit simple I've also been playing Pokemon Go

1304
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
obviously

1305
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
got sucked back into Heroes of the Storm

1306
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
that's one of those games that comes in waves

1307
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
it's like my love of Blizzard stuff

1308
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
it's like I play Overwatch for a couple weeks

1309
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
and I play Diablo 3 for a couple weeks

1310
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
now it's Heroes of the Storm I'm back on that bus

1311
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
so I've been having fun with that

1312
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and yeah just checking out some of the character changes

1313
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and leveling up my own characters

1314
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
there's an event going on right now that's kind of fun

1315
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
it's like a luchador themed thing going on

1316
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
so I was able to get the little pictures

1317
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
like my new

1318
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
little picture looks like a corgi in a luchador's

1319
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
outfit it's amazing

1320
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
so that was worth the event right there

1321
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
otherwise

1322
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
yes Bobby after last week's

1323
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
show I played Just Shapes and Beats

1324
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
with Bobby on stream and that game

1325
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
was fun I had a good time playing

1326
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Just Shapes and Beats great music

1327
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
great soundtrack in that game

1328
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
is the Mortal Kombat theme in there? not that we

1329
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
found unless it's like an unlock later down

1330
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
the line but I have a feeling that was

1331
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
probably a license that cost him more money

1332
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
so it's not in there now unless one of you

1333
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
guys has unlocked it oh

1334
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
apparently it is it is the last

1335
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
unlock says the chat oh that's

1336
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
awesome that they made it in there okay cool

1337
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
so hopefully I'll

1338
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
hopefully I'll get that far at some point

1339
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
nice

1340
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
so besides that

1341
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I've been playing more Hyrule Warriors

1342
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
on Switch cause I missed the

1343
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
boat when it was on Wii U and 3DS so now I'm

1344
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
finally playing it and that game is also a lot of fun

1345
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
and then still some more Final Fantasy 14

1346
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
finally I have not played

1347
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
my buddy Shane online

1348
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
in months and so we actually have been doing

1349
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
for those of you that play Final Fantasy 14

1350
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
we decided to do some of the Eureka

1351
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
leveling which is like this separate

1352
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
kind of zone that has like a separate leveling

1353
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
for your character and there's a lot

1354
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
of stuff in there that kind of reminds us of Final Fantasy

1355
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
11 which if you know

1356
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Shane and I's friendship we played Final Fantasy

1357
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
11 online for

1358
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
years Loki was a part of that too

1359
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
so Eureka kind of has a lot of throwbacks to how

1360
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
11 works so it's just like losing

1361
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
XP when you die and all that stuff

1362
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
so but it's

1363
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
separate from the other like

1364
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that's the interesting thing that 14 does cause it did

1365
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
this in Deep Dungeon too is that your XP

1366
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
in there is separate from the regular game XP

1367
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
so it's kind of neat that they have all these other side things

1368
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
but that's all I'll say about my gaming

1369
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
week so again follow us on

1370
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
social media twitter.com slash OLR we're also

1371
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000

Radio we will be here next

1373
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
week for our 16th

1374
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
anniversary show but we will not

1375
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
be here in two weeks I will be off

1376
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
that weekend I am going to be in Chicago

1377
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
seeing some

1378
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
of my friends out there celebrating

1379
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
my 40th birthday if you can believe it

1380
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
is at the end of the month so gonna be celebrating that

1381
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
so anyhow let's get into some

1382
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
headlines some of the other things we have yet to talk

1383
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
about tonight so you're gonna

1384
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
we don't have a show roll tonight we're

1385
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
doing this a little more free form so Loki

1386
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
do you have some stuff we can talk about some talking points?

1387
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
we're talking about the big thing so

1388
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
valve

1389
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
here we go

1390
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
so valve

1391
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
you may remember

1392
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
we talked a few weeks back how valve was

1393
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
planning on banning

1394
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
these visual novel games

1395
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
because they were too risque for steam

1396
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
so now basically

1397
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
they've decided that they're

1398
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
gonna take a hands off approach on it

1399
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
saying that hey

1400
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
we've decided the right approach is to

1401
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
allow everything onto the steam store

1402
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
except for things that we decide are illegal or

1403
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
straight up trolling so

1404
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
the pendulum swung the other direction

1405
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
yes so swung the other direction

1406
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and so

1407
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
what did we get from that? well we got

1408
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
school shooter simulator

1409
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
whatever that was active shooter simulator

1410
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
which ended up getting pulled off

1411
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and then the newest game

1412
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
of the week that people

1413
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
you know want to talk about that was totally a trolling

1414
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
game AIDS

1415
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
simulator

1416
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and that also got taken off of steam

1417
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
well I mean at least they took it off

1418
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
eventually okay they took it off

1419
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
but how many

1420
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
how many sold

1421
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
because some people will buy that shit

1422
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
because they like to troll

1423
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
and so they want to bump that shit up in the rankings

1424
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
and like people I knew were seeing

1425
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
that game as a recommended game

1426
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
because you like this other stuff because other people were buying

1427
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
it and steam was happy to take a

1428
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
30% cut of that stuff like

1429
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
they need to have less of a reactionary

1430
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
thing and be proactive

1431
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
steam valve should fucking

1432
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
know better at this point seriously

1433
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
what the fuck is happening at valve

1434
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
it is 20 steam is

1435
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
coming from your no 20

1436
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
it no but here's my point yeah it is

1437
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
2018 what the fuck is

1438
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
valve doing right now yes I know the actual

1439
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
answer is they're working on HTC Vive

1440
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and VR but like that

1441
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
is kind of like in my opinion that's kind of like

1442
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
its own little thing that's kind of like

1443
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
separate from the company that bought us

1444
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
portal 2 okay here's the thing

1445
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
guys the valve that we all

1446
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
know and love the cake is a lie

1447
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
all that shit 2011

1448
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
portal 2 came out in 2011

1449
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
that was 7 fucking years ago

1450
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and look I get they're working

1451
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
on this Vive stuff they're doing this other stuff or whatever

1452
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
but like valve has been slipping

1453
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
y'all valve has been slipping

1454
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
hardcore and especially when it comes to steam

1455
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
because you know what the last interesting

1456
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
steam sale was probably also in

1457
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
2011 so like

1458
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
valve because they

1459
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
have the strong dominant end of the market

1460
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
right now feels like they can do

1461
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
this shit and like look I get

1462
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
that the bad games got pulled

1463
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
that's fine my point is

1464
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
this whole cockamamie attitude of

1465
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
and it wasn't just the fact that they were like

1466
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
oh we're gonna allow everything on steam it was the way

1467
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
they delivered that message of well

1468
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
there should be some offensive

1469
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
things that should offend

1470
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
you and if we're not if we don't have that

1471
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
then we're not doing it right and I'm like

1472
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
um

1473
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I would not walk into a store

1474
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
that sold that shit

1475
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
so why am I gonna walk into yours

1476
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
you cocky fuck

1477
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
yeah they're trying to the thing is valve

1478
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
needs an attitude adjustment right

1479
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
the fuck now and it is up

1480
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
to the people that sorry extra I'll

1481
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
let you have a quick it is up to the people that have been

1482
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
lifting them up for no

1483
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
reason over the past

1484
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
five years and I say no

1485
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
reason because again okay sure maybe

1486
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
you like dota 2 maybe you're into the

1487
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
vibe stuff whatever you can lift them up on those

1488
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
platforms as far as steam goes

1489
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
steam has been fucking slipping

1490
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
for several years now

1491
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
the storefront is not as

1492
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
good as it used to be the

1493
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
sales are not like steam sales

1494
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
are just kind of a meh now you know what I mean

1495
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
like steve's been slipping over the few years

1496
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and after this fuckery

1497
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm sorry but like gog

1498
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
itch.io humble bundle

1499
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
are all starting to look more attractive right now

1500
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
so don't think you're fucking invincible

1501
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
valve that's my

1502
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
point sorry extra go ahead no I didn't mean

1503
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
to talk over um I just wanted to say

1504
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that like when you when you

1505
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
get as big as as

1506
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
steam or you get as big

1507
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
as valve

1508
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
you can't just give up on responsibility

1509
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I think that they're

1510
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
they're trying to justify irresponsibility

1511
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
that's all it is to me

1512
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
you know and I don't see

1513
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
people I saw

1514
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
their announcement and I looked at the comments

1515
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and they were horrible they were like yay valve

1516
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
free speech I you know

1517
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
come on guys with the free speech stuff

1518
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
this has nothing to do with free speech

1519
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
it has everything to do with

1520
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
being a good curator

1521
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
of content for your customers

1522
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and this is not good curation

1523
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
no one is preventing free speech by not putting

1524
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
your game on the steam storefront it's the fucking

1525
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
internet you can put it anywhere you want

1526
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
thank you thank you thank you thank you

1527
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
if you want to release aid simulator

1528
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
in your stifling stinky little

1529
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
black hole of the internet then that's

1530
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
what the internet is for have

1531
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
have fun actually I don't even want to tell you to have fun

1532
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
just go fuck yourself honestly

1533
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
but you have a little space to go do it in but like I don't understand

1534
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
like the whole point like they made this big deal

1535
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
like they're like okay we need to get rid of

1536
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Greenlight cause it's not working

1537
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
but I think it was doing more

1538
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
like so this filter

1539
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
that we had wasn't working let's just get

1540
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
rid of the filter like how the fuck

1541
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
is that any better like that doesn't make any

1542
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
sense the filter is that oh

1543
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
we're charging $100 to submit a game

1544
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
but you get it back you know if it sells

1545
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
they don't want to be responsible

1546
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
they don't and they don't want to hire a bigger team

1547
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
to be responsible either they're a small team

1548
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
that is a big problem too

1549
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
their customer service sucks

1550
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
yeah stop letting so many games

1551
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
on your platform then cause it's drowning

1552
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
out all of us it is finally time for the

1553
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
rest of us to hold them fucking accountable so that

1554
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
is why I'm here on this show today to say

1555
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
because I've been accused of this in the past

1556
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and it will no longer happen

1557
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Valve does not get a free pass

1558
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
anymore I don't fucking

1559
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
care if they have these gigantic sales

1560
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
or what have you you know what everybody's got a fucking

1561
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
sale this is the internet GOGS has

1562
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
sales Humble Bundle has sales

1563
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Valve does not get a free pass

1564
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
anymore because they are Valve

1565
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
that is

1566
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
that is why I'm setting forth today and that ties

1567
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
to this comment in our chat over at

1568
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
live.vognetwork.com

1569
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
e3inator in chat says Rob Roberts really

1570
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
if you get right down to it Valve doesn't

1571
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
have to do jack shit why because

1572
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
they're making money hand over fist and

1573
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
laughing all the way to the bank they can wipe their

1574
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
asses with one thousand dollar bills if they

1575
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
so choose you know what

1576
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
not on my watch Satan

1577
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
we're done with that and you're right

1578
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
it has to start with the rest of us saying

1579
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
you know what there are

1580
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
other places to buy some fucking games

1581
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
nobody knows that better than you

1582
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
raginator there are

1583
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
other places to buy games and find deals

1584
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
make Valve

1585
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
fight for first place

1586
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
the attitude that they could print money and

1587
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
they don't have to care is

1588
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
is pointless to me so

1589
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
so that's the same thing as saying

1590
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Martin Shkreli you know that guy

1591
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
who raised the pharmacy

1592
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
you know pharmaceutical drugs

1593
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
is practically too rich to

1594
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
care you know whatever but we all

1595
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
like rose up and said no

1596
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
you know what I mean and look where

1597
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
he is now he's in prison

1598
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm not saying

1599
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Gabe should go to prison I'm just saying

1600
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
no I am I'm saying they should go to prison

1601
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
no I'm not I'm saying that

1602
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
like somebody at his level

1603
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
needs to come out and say

1604
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
we fucked up exactly

1605
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I need I need that to happen

1606
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
they need to take

1607
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
we fucked up PS

1608
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
as an apology Half Life 3

1609
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
3

1610
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I'll take the first part at least

1611
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
anyway

1612
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Rama says in chat when Valve brings us

1613
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Half Life 3 then I'll give a fuck

1614
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Bob Coffee says it's time for GOG to shine

1615
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Bobby Blackwolf wants to point

1616
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
out he isn't in prison for the drug stuff he's in prison

1617
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
for tax evasion yeah I know but you know

1618
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
what Karma is a bitch

1619
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
exactly yeah I don't care

1620
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
what the actual circumstances

1621
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
we got mad at him and he

1622
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
got like in trouble and we're

1623
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
all happy about it alright so anyway

1624
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I guess I don't

1625
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
need to keep going off but my point

1626
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
is from now on

1627
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Valve needs to earn that number one

1628
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
spot as far as I'm concerned

1629
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
because I will be looking for where the deals

1630
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
on other games are I'm not gonna sit here and go

1631
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I'm gonna delete my fucking Steam account because you and I

1632
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
both know that's not true I got too many games to do

1633
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
exactly I got too many games locked in there

1634
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000

00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
can sit here and go I'm gonna think

1637
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
twice before I just drop money

1638
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
on a PC game on Steam because it's

1639
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000

00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000

next thing you'll be telling me that you want to reinstall Uplay

1664
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000

1665
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000

I'm a proud member

1668
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
of Uplay and I'm

1669
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
biased you're biased alright

1670
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
to be fair to give them props

1671
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I do like the fact that you can earn like points

1672
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
or achievement points or whatever to like

1673
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
get free shit in other games

1674
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
yeah I like that too I like that but that's the

1675
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
only thing I like I fucking hate everything else about it

1676
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I was about to be like oh I love that too

1677
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
which ones do you play?

1678
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
my whole like thing

1679
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
give us another headline cause I hate that I'm the angry

1680
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
bitch tonight

1681
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
this is your role Loki I'm sorry

1682
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
he's hand picking the stories that'll piss me off

1683
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
uh Pokemon Let's Go

1684
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Pikachu and Eevee require an

1685
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
online subscription of course

1686
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
because it's Nintendo and they want to sell that subscription

1687
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
oh it's Nintendo's new thing

1688
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
that kind of actually does surprise me

1689
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
isn't it like a single player game?

1690
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
yeah I was under the impression it was gonna be a single player thing

1691
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
does it only require the online

1692
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
thing for like trading

1693
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
with maybe it needs it to access

1694
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Pokemon Bank well wait a minute no it's not a mainline

1695
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
game so you wouldn't it says it will have online

1696
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
play functionality battling trading

1697
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
with other players over the internet

1698
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
but will the entire game require

1699
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
is this gonna be another

1700
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Nintendo thing?

1701
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I think that's I think he just said it

1702
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
like I think that's what you get there are

1703
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
some things in Pokemon games you go online

1704
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
for trading battling etc you want any

1705
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
of that I'm thinking about I'm over

1706
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
like paying for the subscription it's $20

1707
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
a year I don't fucking care I spend

1708
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I spend more than that show of hands is anyone

1709
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
not buying the Nintendo thing I know

1710
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'm totally buying the Nintendo thing

1711
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Loki is buying the Nintendo

1712
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
thing it's 20 fucking dollars

1713
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I mean that's like a couple

1714
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
of meals and we have

1715
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
when Tuesday happens and they announce

1716
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
everything that's coming with it I think we'll be all like

1717
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
okay let me put it this way the only

1718
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
reason why I'm still

1719
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
um giving them shit about it is

1720
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
because I don't wanna just like them go

1721
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
oh well it's only $20 well

1722
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
but that doesn't give me an excuse to not do anything

1723
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
for that $20 other than

1724
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
oh well now we're letting you play online

1725
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
even though we just didn't let you to do that

1726
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
earlier for free but

1727
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'm gonna give him a chance on this whole new

1728
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
virtual console thing we'll see let's

1729
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
let's I'm crossing my fingers it's

1730
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
not gonna suck we'll see I have mod

1731
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
chips if that's not the case

1732
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
alright Tuesday's coming

1733
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
there'll be a lot more coming on Tuesday

1734
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Tyco Drum Master

1735
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
sorry I'm just gonna say

1736
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
the one thing I

1737
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
hear consistently

1738
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
from more casual

1739
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
but I bet a lot of you fit in this category too

1740
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
the one thing I hear consistently about Tuesday

1741
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
is this

1742
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I hope Nintendo announces a new

1743
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
anyone wanna fill in the blank?

1744
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
the number one thing I hear from casuals

1745
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
no from casuals

1746
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
no

1747
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Mario game?

1748
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I hope Nintendo announces a new

1749
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
and it would be something that would completely

1750
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
people would throw that $20 down

1751
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
in a heartbeat

1752
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Animal Crossing

1753
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I want a new Animal Crossing

1754
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
god dammit

1755
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I hate Animal Crossing

1756
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
do you or do you hate the love it?

1757
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I hate it

1758
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I hate that every version of Animal Crossing that comes out

1759
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
has less features than the one before it

1760
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
and by less features I mean

1761
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
none of them have virtual console games in them

1762
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I do wanna give JD a cookie in our chat

1763
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
room because he answered, I love that the chat

1764
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
jumped in, JD said new

1765
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
IP

1766
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I will give you a cookie for that

1767
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
the good news is I'm gonna give you a cookie

1768
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
the bad news is it's oatmeal raisin

1769
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I want excite bike to come back

1770
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
that's what I would shell down money

1771
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
excite truck

1772
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
yes!

1773
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
excite bots bullshit

1774
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
no! you should never have to play mini

1775
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
games in the middle of a fucking race

1776
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
that is dumb, that is dumb shit

1777
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
excite truck though

1778
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
act deft is getting angry

1779
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
over here because you started to say taiko drum master

1780
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and I cut you off, sorry, taiko drum master

1781
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
the Nintendo switch version

1782
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
is coming to Asia in English

1783
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
on August 9th

1784
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
so yes, you may not necessarily get it

1785
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
in North America, although I thought they were gonna

1786
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
release it over here as well

1787
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
but they're gonna be doing an English patch for free

1788
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
on August 9th

1789
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
so remember, the switch is region free

1790
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
so if you want it, you can import it

1791
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
you know what games I like better

1792
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
than taiko drum master?

1793
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
are the persona dancing games

1794
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
there's a lot of those coming out

1795
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
oh I know, well I mean persona dancing

1796
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
all night, persona 4

1797
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I platinumed that

1798
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
why can't we have both extrovert?

1799
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
well I'm just saying I like it better

1800
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I can have both

1801
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
there's

1802
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
a new unannounced Diablo game

1803
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
coming thanks to a

1804
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
development job listing

1805
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
that's all we know

1806
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
but there's hope

1807
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
it's gonna be so erect at Blizzcon

1808
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
if they announce Diablo 4

1809
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
that's another one

1810
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
where I assume that they have been

1811
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
working on something

1812
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
since the necromancer didn't

1813
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
end up being an expansion

1814
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
then I'm assuming Diablo 3 is done

1815
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I mean, it could be

1816
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
another Diablo expansion

1817
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
it could be this switch thing

1818
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
that maybe would be the

1819
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
way to do this new Diablo 3

1820
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
but there's a part of me that says

1821
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
you know what, they're just gonna

1822
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
whip out the number 4, why not?

1823
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Diablo 3 kinda had that cloud

1824
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
over it ever since the beginning with the auction house

1825
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and all that other stuff, even though it's a great

1826
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
game now, like

1827
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
because Diablo is a console and PC

1828
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
thing for them, it doesn't

1829
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
necessarily have that exact same sort of

1830
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
foreverness that Overwatch does

1831
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
although, I don't know, the rifts and stuff

1832
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
are still interesting, I still play them

1833
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
why not? Let's do Diablo 4

1834
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
the only thing that's weird about Diablo 4

1835
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
is that Blizzard

1836
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
hasn't done a

1837
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
sequel game in a very long time

1838
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
like the last sequel game I can think of

1839
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
when was Starcraft 2?

1840
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
because I think it was Diablo 3

1841
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
so that's the only weird

1842
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
thing about it, is that Blizzard

1843
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
isn't exactly known for cranking out the sequels

1844
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
and when they do announce it

1845
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
it takes a very long time for them to get

1846
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
that's true, they'll announce it now and then it's really

1847
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
out in 3 years, so we'll see

1848
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
oh shit, you know, I just realized

1849
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
something, which makes

1850
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
the Square Enix thing very exciting

1851
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
tomorrow

1852
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
they have that Marvel project, fuck yeah

1853
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
fuck yeah

1854
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
that's a good chance that we're gonna see that Marvel

1855
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
project tomorrow, I can't wait

1856
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
speaking of which, the rumor with that

1857
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Marvel project is

1858
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
a reboot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance

1859
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
which I am totally down for

1860
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
oh, interesting

1861
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Ultimate Alliance is fucking awesome

1862
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
those games weren't like bad

1863
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
or needing a reboot, but I guess then again

1864
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
they do this all the time with games, they just kind of start over

1865
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
maybe it could be just similar

1866
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
like a similar type of gameplay or something

1867
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'm down, that's cool

1868
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Hitman 2 is something that's

1869
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
also gonna be probably shown off

1870
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Sony confirmed that

1871
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Sony confirmed Hitman 2 I think

1872
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
yeah, so they've got that coming out and they've got

1873
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
this collector's edition with a rubber duck

1874
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
that's kinda cool

1875
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
what else

1876
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
we have the lineup for

1877
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Sega and Atlas

1878
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
so they're gonna be showing off

1879
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Shining Resonance

1880
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Refrain, that's coming out on

1881
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC

1882
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Team Sonic Racing

1883
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
which is also on PlayStation 4, Xbox One

1884
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Switch and PC

1885
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Valkyria Chronicles 4

1886
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and the Switch

1887
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
and Yakuza Kiwami

1888
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
on PlayStation 4

1889
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
and then one

1890
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
thing that they'll be showing but that won't be playable there

1891
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
is Total War Three Kingdoms on PC

1892
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
and then

1893
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I wanna say that there was another

1894
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
like Catherine, Catherine Full

1895
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Body was something else that was being announced

1896
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
and then

1897
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I feel like that Catherine thing they'd already announced though

1898
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
and then, and then

1899
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
that was a PSX reveal or something wasn't it?

1900
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and then Atlas, they've got some more

1901
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
stuff that they said they found including

1902
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
you know there's, they found websites

1903
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
for Persona 3 Dancing Moon Knight

1904
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
and Persona 5 Dancing Star Knight

1905
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
and of course those

1906
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
have been confirmed

1907
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
and both

1908
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
look amazing

1909
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
so, neat

1910
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
let's see what else we got

1911
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
here, while you're looking I'm gonna go ahead and open

1912
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
up the Skype line if anyone does wanna give us a call

1913
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype

1914
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
if you wanna talk to us about an E3

1915
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
that's already happened or that's

1916
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
going to happen, maybe you

1917
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
have some things you wanna talk about with

1918
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Sony or Nintendo tomorrow, let me ask

1919
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Xtifer, cause we don't get to hear from you

1920
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
a lot here at OLR

1921
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
but I know you're a big gamer, what

1922
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
what do you hope for from Sony and

1923
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Nintendo?

1924
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I'm looking forward most out of all

1925
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
of E3

1926
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
for the Death Stranding

1927
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
stuff

1928
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
gameplay finally?

1929
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I'd be satisfied with another

1930
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
trailer, honestly

1931
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I need to see the game

1932
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'd love to see the game

1933
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
it'd be great, it'd be great

1934
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
if there's another trailer that is also

1935
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
very cryptic, I'll watch it for days

1936
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
but be angry that we didn't get gameplay

1937
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
at the same time

1938
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
but when it comes to Nintendo

1939
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
obviously I think it would be

1940
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Metroid Prime 4

1941
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
you're a big fan of Metroid Prime

1942
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I love Metroid anything

1943
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I'm hoping for Mario Maker

1944
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I would like to see a Mario Maker port

1945
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
too, I feel like I'm in the minority

1946
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I just wonder how, I mean I

1947
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
get how it would work

1948
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
on the docked, but it'd be kinda more clunky

1949
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
compared to

1950
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
using it portable, right?

1951
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah, but there's no reason you can't create portable

1952
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
and then play docked

1953
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
part of the fun of Mario Maker is playing

1954
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
all the crazy fucking stages

1955
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Mario Maker, like that, but here's the twist

1956
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
it's two player because

1957
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
the Switch has two

1958
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
like maybe co-op or something

1959
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
like that, what a twist

1960
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
split screen, yeah because you know they're gonna

1961
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
wanna use their two player gimmick

1962
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
thing that they have going on, co-op

1963
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I don't think there's

1964
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
any, maybe

1965
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I'm pretty sure they won't show anything else

1966
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
with Bayonetta 3, but

1967
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
maybe, maybe

1968
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
a new trailer, maybe a little teaser

1969
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
yeah, maybe another morsel or something

1970
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Let's get to the phones, we got a call coming in, let's do it

1971
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1972
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Hi, this is Ray G. Nader

1973
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Hey Ray G. Nader, what's up buddy?

1974
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I know a whole lot, well

1975
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
since the topic is pretty much

1976
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
solely E3

1977
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'll chime in on that

1978
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Go ahead

1979
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Sorry if I'm a little measly looking there

1980
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
sick as a dog, but

1981
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
well

1982
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
take what I'm about to see

1983
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
with a little bit of

1984
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
a grain of salt

1985
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I always do, ba-da-bum

1986
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I missed

1987
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
some of

1988
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
some portions

1989
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
of the conferences because I was

1990
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
supposed to be out and about

1991
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
but based on what I did see

1992
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
overall

1993
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I was pleased with what

1994
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I saw

1995
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Now if I were to be

1996
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
nitpicky about one

1997
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
thing

1998
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
is that

1999
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
while I kind of saw this coming

2000
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
in the back of my mind

2001
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I was kind of sort of hoping

2002
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
that

2003
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I would hear about a new Magic

2004
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Together game

2005
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
that was in the works

2006
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That's something up your alley

2007
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Oh yeah, well you know me, I talk about

2008
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
those Magic Together games

2009
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
all the time, in fact

2010
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
the newest one

2011
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Magic Duels came out

2012
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I believe in

2013
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
2014 or 2015

2014
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and that was like

2015
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
three, four years ago

2016
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
so I think we're kind of

2017
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
overdue for a new one

2018
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
and you know

2019
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Grand is not as popular

2020
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
as say Gears of War, Halo

2021
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
or Mass Effect, but it does have

2022
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
a pretty strong following

2023
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Sure, of course

2024
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
with the trading card game and everything, of course

2025
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah, and plus

2026
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
knowing that, but

2027
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Grand is not as

2028
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
extensive as actual

2029
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
card game, but at the same time

2030
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
it's a whole lot cheaper than

2031
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
going out and getting the booster packs

2032
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and trying to find

2033
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
the rare cards individually

2034
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
you know, you'll save a lot of money

2035
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
that way, so

2036
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
that's why I love

2037
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
the game myself, so

2038
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
but

2039
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
there was

2040
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I loved everything else

2041
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
you know, the

2042
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
talk about Doom

2043
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
the Fallout

2044
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
talk, you know

2045
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Let me ask you this question, RageNator

2046
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
because there's a comment in our chat

2047
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
where Kaijuto says, take it from a guy that plays a lot of

2048
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
card games, there are so many better games than Magic

2049
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
well, I mean, opinion

2050
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
is a big thing, but I'm curious

2051
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
RageNator, especially because

2052
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
we're talking about Bethesda, Bethesda does have their

2053
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Elder Scrolls based card game

2054
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
do you ever try some of the others?

2055
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Uh, no

2056
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
honestly, yeah

2057
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
really, I mean, the main reason why

2058
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I got into the

2059
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Magic the Gathering

2060
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
video games is because

2061
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I've been involved with

2062
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
the card game way back when

2063
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I was in high school, back in the Stone Age

2064
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
so, I'm already familiar

2065
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
with concepts and

2066
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
the mechanics and this and

2067
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
other, and plus now there's the

2068
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Paul and the Stabs thing for me

2069
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
so, I'm not saying

2070
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
that these other games are any

2071
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
way, shape or form

2072
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
bad games, I'm not saying that

2073
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
if other people love these

2074
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I totally get it, it's like me and

2075
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Elder Scrolls Online when we were talking during the

2076
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
thing, it's like, I just

2077
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
tend to gravitate towards Final Fantasy 14

2078
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It's your comfort zone

2079
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Yeah, it's my comfort zone, it's not that Elder Scrolls Online

2080
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
is bad, it's just, it's

2081
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
the game that other people like, you know

2082
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
some people like action movies, some people

2083
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
like comedies, some people like

2084
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
There's a lot of people that don't understand

2085
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
my love for Binding of Isaac

2086
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
but, it's my comfort zone, it's my game

2087
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
with choice, you know

2088
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Yeah, I kinda like what you like, it's cool

2089
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I'm curious if you do the

2090
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
experimenting with the other games, that's all

2091
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Uh, no, I

2092
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
well, I did manage to get

2093
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
a free copy of GWENT

2094
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
through DLG

2095
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
but honestly, let's be

2096
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
honest here, I haven't even

2097
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
installed it yet, I haven't

2098
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
fired it up yet

2099
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
and honestly, I probably

2100
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
never will

2101
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'm not saying that these other

2102
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
games are anyway bad

2103
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
other people love them

2104
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
There's just only so much time in a day, I understand

2105
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Yeah, well

2106
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I'll probably get a free off the lines that way

2107
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
if someone else wants a call

2108
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
but have a nice night

2109
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Thanks, thanks for the call, take care buddy, bye

2110
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Such a nice guy, that regenator

2111
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

2112
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
if you wanna give us a call

2113
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
For such a, for such a

2114
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
testosterone-y filled name

2115
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Like Rage?

2116
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Maybe it's just one of those ironic

2117
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's one of those ironic names, maybe

2118
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I don't know, I don't know, or maybe like

2119
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
he's like Terminator, he terminates the Rage

2120
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
The Rage stops here

2121
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I think that's what he was going with

2122
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Perhaps, perhaps

2123
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Loki, any other headlines you wanna run down with us?

2124
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Uh, yeah, Final Fantasy XV is getting mod support on PC

2125
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
or I should say it has mod support on PC now

2126
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Oh, like official mod support

2127
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
So like, now we can have

2128
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Nudie mods officially

2129
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
There's pictures of Keyblades

2130
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
and Thomas the Tank Engine

2131
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I feel like we knew this was coming because I remember this guy

2132
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
the guy behind Final Fantasy XV

2133
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Don't make nudie mods

2134
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Please, we're just gonna ask the community

2135
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
nicely to not make the nudie mods

2136
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
and like, within

2137
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
30 seconds the nudie mods were here

2138
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
If not, look

2139
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
If you're not into dudes

2140
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I'm sure they've got a Sydney

2141
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
like, and the

2142
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Dragoon, Ariana, what was her name

2143
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
the Dragoon lady, I'm sure they get naked too

2144
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
so whatever you're into

2145
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And Valve, Valve is just like

2146
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
whatever the fuck you wanna do

2147
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
you know, just don't troll people

2148
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Okay

2149
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Valve and I are fighting right now so

2150
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I don't care what they're doing

2151
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Valve can go do whatever they want

2152
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
in their corner right now where I'm just side-eyeing them

2153
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Speaking of mods

2154
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
of course, you know, with the emulated version

2155
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
of Breath of the Wild

2156
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
people have modded Mario

2157
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and Valve's are in there

2158
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Because why not?

2159
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Because you can do all that kind of shit

2160
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You sure can

2161
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I don't know

2162
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
if we talked about this or not

2163
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
but there's a new game streaming service

2164
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I guess they're saying with Facebook

2165
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
facebook.gg

2166
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Oh yeah, this is like their answer to Twitch

2167
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
and Mixer

2168
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
and all that stuff

2169
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
They're doing this facebook.gg

2170
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Are we still mad at Facebook right now?

2171
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Are we on a cooling off period?

2172
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Facebook is like

2173
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
that person you hang out with that you know

2174
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
is nothing but drama and trouble

2175
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
but like once in a while

2176
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
like they're cool

2177
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So it's like you're guarded

2178
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
when you hang out with Facebook

2179
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Facebook's kind of like the friend

2180
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
that I

2181
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
never really

2182
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It's more of an acquaintance

2183
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
not a friend

2184
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I feel like Facebook doesn't need to be in this space

2185
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
There's a lot of spaces Facebook is getting into

2186
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
where I'm like Facebook, I think you should just stay out

2187
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Exactly, it's trying to be a jack of all trades

2188
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
but it's really horrible

2189
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Game streaming is one of them

2190
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It's just like, it's not going to happen

2191
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I don't know, I just read an article recently

2192
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I say that, but I think actually

2193
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
because so many people are glued to Facebook

2194
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
it's going to pop up in people's

2195
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
feeds so easily

2196
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I read an article recently about how

2197
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
they question Mark Zuckerberg

2198
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
when he was

2199
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
questioned by Congress

2200
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
about the shadow

2201
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
profiles, about how they make

2202
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
profiles for people that don't even have

2203
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Facebook accounts

2204
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
and I was like, that really rubbed

2205
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
me the wrong way

2206
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
and his answers were not very

2207
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
reassuring

2208
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
and so I'm like, wow

2209
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So I don't feel like I can trust

2210
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
them, you know what I mean? In fact

2211
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I went into their privacy settings

2212
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
just recently, which basically

2213
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
their UI is so

2214
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
convoluted, and we all know

2215
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
this, right? But I was trying to go

2216
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
into every single Facebook privacy

2217
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
setting, which is like a headache in itself

2218
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
and turn everything off

2219
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
because I don't want to allow anything

2220
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
but even that, I don't trust

2221
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
because they don't

2222
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
have that there, so why would I trust

2223
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
them with a streaming thing?

2224
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Honestly, my

2225
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
biggest comment with this is

2226
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I will still be streaming on my Twitch

2227
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
channel over twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts

2228
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Go give me a follow, please

2229
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That's really all I have to say

2230
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Not that Amazon is

2231
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
really that much better, but

2232
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
At least

2233
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I feel like Twitch, for the most

2234
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
part, when they have

2235
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
issues, they're really good at resolving

2236
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
them quickly and doing better, you

2237
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
know, and maybe it wasn't always that

2238
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
way, but like lately, you know

2239
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
so I can't

2240
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I enjoy being a Twitch streamer

2241
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
you know, when I have the time for it

2242
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
which isn't all the time, but when I have the time for it, I enjoy it

2243
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
so, and honestly

2244
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
if Twitch wasn't around, Mixer's not bad

2245
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
there's a lot to like about Mixer

2246
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I wish I had the time where I could

2247
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
do a stream here and there, you know

2248
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
but I just, I don't have that kind of time, sadly

2249
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
but I watched the Xbox

2250
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
thing on Mixer today and it looked great in 4K

2251
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
so, because my monitor

2252
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
on my computer is 4K

2253
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
so it looked great. I watched it on YouTube because

2254
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I was out and about

2255
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
when it was going on. I forgot it was

2256
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
early on. It was a weird hour

2257
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
They always do their

2258
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
concerts. I'm not talking about

2259
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Bethesda. They always do their

2260
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
conferences early

2261
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
in the day, right? Well, it's early

2262
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
for us, but

2263
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
it was 4 o'clock on the East Coast

2264
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
so a little more reasonable. So maybe they're just trying to be

2265
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
friendly to the East Coast

2266
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
but Sony always tells them like 6 o'clock

2267
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
in the afternoon. Also

2268
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
not just us, but Europe, that would've been

2269
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
9 in the evening in Europe, so let's not

2270
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
forget Microsoft's a global thing

2271
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
so it makes a lot more sense

2272
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
for them to go so early so that way it's

2273
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
you know, because when Sony does

2274
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
their thing, it's always later. That's gonna

2275
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
be like 2 in the morning for Europe

2276
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
so that's not as nice for them. So that's

2277
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
part of the reason why, you know, there are

2278
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
morning press conferences with ether. But I think that

2279
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
maybe Sony has it in their mind, you know, well

2280
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
this, you know, E3 is

2281
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
primarily like North American

2282
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
announcements, whereas Gamescom

2283
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
is like more Europe, you know?

2284
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Yeah, at least Sony kind of

2285
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
gives a little bit to Gamescom too, you know?

2286
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Yeah, because they have those like

2287
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
E3 style press conferences. Plus they have

2288
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
PSX too. And you know what?

2289
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I think for Sony more, the thing

2290
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
they have to consider is

2291
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Japan. And so for Japan,

2292
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
it is the morning when

2293
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Sony goes. So I think they all just kind of

2294
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
have to consider like, you know, because you can't

2295
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
do anything that's gonna be a

2296
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
great time for Japan, the US, and

2297
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Europe. So you just kind of have to pick two.

2298
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I just assume E3 has

2299
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
already happened because Japan is in the

2300
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
future. Yes.

2301
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Alright. Oh, back to Loki.

2302
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
See if there's any other stories you want to cover.

2303
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I was trying to find out what

2304
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
happened with the Devolver Digital

2305
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
thing. All I know is it

2306
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
involved the physical loot coin that you

2307
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
can buy for a very large amount of money

2308
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
that keeps changing price.

2309
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I'm not really sure what else.

2310
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I am so

2311
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
wanting to see this. Everybody in chat was

2312
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
screaming about Metal Wolf Chaos, I guess was the

2313
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
thing. Yeah, I thought that was rumored

2314
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
to be something they were going to be bringing out.

2315
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Devolver Digital was my highlight

2316
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
last year. They were like the best.

2317
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
It made no sense.

2318
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Tim and Eric.

2319
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
They're kind of like the

2320
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
frat kid game company in some

2321
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
ways. You have to admit it was

2322
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
funny last year. I didn't watch it. We were

2323
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
doing this show. You didn't watch the

2324
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
stream of it? No.

2325
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
There's a new

2326
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
serious Sam game

2327
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
coming out. I don't know.

2328
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But the actual

2329
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
you have to watch that, Rob, if you've

2330
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
never watched it. It's really funny.

2331
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Sorry, that was my

2332
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Google chat that just went off. Again?

2333
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I know. It's like, God, I think it's safe

2334
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
to keep it open so I can have a show roll up.

2335
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Well, to be fair, we didn't have a show roll tonight.

2336
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
We just had an email, so that's why I had it up.

2337
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
It was irony. Anyway.

2338
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
And you know what the funniest thing about it?

2339
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
There was a message from Alan going, what are you doing?

2340
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
What do you think I'm doing?

2341
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
He also knows that the show lately has been

2342
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
wrapping around 8.30, so he's probably curious

2343
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
if we're done yet or not. But I think we are

2344
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
about winding up. Yeah, I think we've run out of

2345
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
some stuff to talk about right now.

2346
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
We've run out of steam. Well, we haven't

2347
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
run out of steam, but there's like a

2348
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Dead or Alive 6 reveal trailer.

2349
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
There's a lot more we'll be talking about, I'm sure,

2350
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
after everything's done. Yeah, next week's gonna be crazy

2351
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
because we're gonna have Sony and Nintendo to talk about.

2352
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Happy E3 week, everybody.

2353
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Try not to be too cynical.

2354
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Not everything sucks.

2355
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
There should be something you enjoy this week,

2356
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
so I hope, hey, I got Tetris

2357
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Effect. If nothing else,

2358
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I have Tetris Effect. I'm telling you that

2359
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
that is, and do you have,

2360
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
by the way, just for shits,

2361
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
do you have the Tetris Effect

2362
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
when you play a prolonged

2363
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
amount of time? Oh, do I suffer from it?

2364
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It's not, you don't suffer from it,

2365
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
but it's something that a lot of people haven't. I do.

2366
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Um, I get it with other video

2367
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
games. Really? Yeah. I'll dream

2368
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
about other video games like that.

2369
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Well, no, no, I mean when,

2370
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
well, that's one thing. Isn't that

2371
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
kind of the same thing?

2372
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I think it goes, it also goes

2373
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
into the fact that when you play something like that

2374
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
with like basic shapes for a long period of time,

2375
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
then you actually, when you close your eyes,

2376
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
you almost see it in your head.

2377
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And that's what happens to me.

2378
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
It's called the Tetris Effect. With all the music

2379
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
games I've played over the years? Like, I've totally seen

2380
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Falling Notes. Exactly. That's what it,

2381
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
that's the Tetris Effect. Yeah. And that's the actual

2382
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
official name of that

2383
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
phenomenon. Yeah. So that

2384
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
trailer was so cool the way they did that, yeah.

2385
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Like, it pisses, again,

2386
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
if you're one of those people out there on Twitter

2387
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
that's like, a fucking Tetris

2388
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
game, that should be, like, do not

2389
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Oh, fuck you. Tetris is the best game in the world.

2390
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Seriously, I will cyber-bully you.

2391
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Like, you think Steam got

2392
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
it bad tonight? Just wait until I find out where you are.

2393
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
There's a reason why they keep

2394
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
re-releasing that game. It's because

2395
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
it's a tried and true formula and it works.

2396
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Exactly. And, like,

2397
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
seriously, seriously, the first time

2398
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I played Luminous, my reaction was,

2399
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
man, can you imagine if they made, like, a Tetris game like this?

2400
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And, like, we're fucking getting it. So,

2401
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
sit down, shut up,

2402
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
and eat pie. And eat your rice.

2403
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I don't know.

2404
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
It's not coming to the Switch, though, which is unfortunate.

2405
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Well, no,

2406
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
yeah, it's exclusive. Not out the gate.

2407
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Right now, it's exclusive for Sony.

2408
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
That Luminous reboot, though, is out at the end of June.

2409
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
This is true.

2410
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And that is on the Switch.

2411
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I just like the soundtrack for Tetris Effect.

2412
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I just want everything to be on Switch, because

2413
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I just, I wish it was more powerful

2414
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
that they could put more of the other things.

2415
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Did you notice, though, that Microsoft kind of snuck that

2416
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
in there, where they were like, you can play on your phone,

2417
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
and even though I know we're all laughing at that, like, ha ha,

2418
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I feel like that was kind of

2419
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
like their way to say, like, well, you know,

2420
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
you can play anywhere on Microsoft, too.

2421
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It's just a little different.

2422
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Yeah.

2423
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I get it. A little bit. Yeah, I get it.

2424
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
But I appreciated that Microsoft

2425
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
is kind of trying to slyly go, you know.

2426
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Anyway,

2427
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
go ahead and chat.

2428
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
SG100Matt, I like this little piece of positivity here.

2429
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
We get tied up in

2430
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
winners and losers of E3, when

2431
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
in reality, the winners are all of us gamers,

2432
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
and the losers are the hate-filled

2433
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
people who want to put down others

2434
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
and make gaming an unhealthy place

2435
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
for everyone. Be a winner, folks.

2436
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Aw, we could bake a cake.

2437
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Winners don't use cynicism.

2438
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
FBI warning.

2439
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
2018. Follow your dreams.

2440
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
NBC star.

2441
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Let's see. E3inator

2442
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
in chat says, Tetris is overrated,

2443
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Rob Roberts.

2444
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Okay. You want to talk about reading?

2445
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Let's talk about reading.

2446
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Aren't you the guy that just

2447
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
called into the show to talk about Magic

2448
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
the Gathering? I can see

2449
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
where he got his name.

2450
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
He's enraging us.

2451
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
That's all I'm gonna say.

2452
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
You're not the nice little guy that called in earlier.

2453
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I gave you all those compliments,

2454
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and now I think you're shit.

2455
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
You're not shit.

2456
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
You just have an opinion.

2457
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Yeah, you just have some really bad opinions.

2458
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I mean,

2459
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
we all sometimes have incorrect

2460
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
opinions, and it's just about, you know.

2461
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And I kind of like Magic

2462
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
the Gathering, but like the old school card game

2463
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
the most. Nothing beats the card game.

2464
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You know, Matt, my boyfriend,

2465
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
he likes Magic the Gathering.

2466
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
He used to like it a lot. He doesn't play it now.

2467
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I used to play

2468
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
the shit out of it. He has a ton of old cards

2469
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
in his... I used to play

2470
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
in high school, and then I found out one day we were

2471
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
completely playing it wrong.

2472
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
The rules of that game are kind of complicated.

2473
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Now you've got YouTube's tutorials and shit

2474
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
and computer games to help you understand the rules

2475
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
of Magic the Gathering, but trying to read it out of a book

2476
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
we were playing it wrong.

2477
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
What I want to know is, where does the title

2478
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
like, why is it called The Gathering?

2479
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Like, what do you gather

2480
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
in it? Do you gather magic?

2481
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Yes, you tap your lands.

2482
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
You tap your lands!

2483
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Tap the land, bitch!

2484
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Is it Magic comma The Gathering?

2485
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
No.

2486
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Like, is Magic the title of The Gathering?

2487
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Magic colon The Gathering.

2488
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Oh, Magic colon...

2489
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I want to know

2490
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
what caused the

2491
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
original people to come up with this title.

2492
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Magic colon

2493
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
The Gathering.

2494
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Wait, wait, is Magic the IP

2495
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
and The Gathering is the name

2496
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
of the game?

2497
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Listen, you gather the magic

2498
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
to summon the monsters while you tap the lands.

2499
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Why is it so complicated?

2500
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
That's the game's core mechanic.

2501
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Yeah, but when you think about it,

2502
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
though...

2503
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I don't know.

2504
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I just wish...

2505
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I agree with Dungeon Buster. Dungeon Buster says,

2506
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Magic colon The Gathering sounds dangerous.

2507
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
We're gonna leave it at that.

2508
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
That was a joke I knew Extro would like.

2509
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I like that joke.

2510
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Anything else to share with us, Lowkey, or are we shutting it down?

2511
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Ah, we can shut it down. I was just checking the Wikipedia page

2512
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
for Magic the Gathering to see if they had an explanation.

2513
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Explain yourself!

2514
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
You know, I'm glad I can

2515
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
provoke these moments of

2516
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
education. It's what I

2517
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
live for.

2518
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
You're welcome.

2519
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Alright,

2520
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
so here we go.

2521
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Let's explain what it was.

2522
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
The game,

2523
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
while the game is simply called Magic

2524
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
through most of playtesting,

2525
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
when the game had to be officially named,

2526
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
a lawyer informed them that the name Magic

2527
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
was too generic to be named.

2528
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Mana Clash was instead

2529
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
chosen to be the name used

2530
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
in the first solicitation of the game.

2531
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
However, everybody involved in the game

2532
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
continued to refer to it as Magic.

2533
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
After further consultation with

2534
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
the lawyer, it was decided

2535
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
to name the game Magic the Gathering,

2536
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
thus enabling the name to be

2537
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
trademarked. So that's why they don't

2538
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
just call it Magic. Interesting.

2539
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
But you know what? Mana Clash sounds...

2540
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
You can't trademark Magic.

2541
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Mana Clash sounds

2542
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
like an 80s synth-pop band.

2543
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
But it also, in the context of today's

2544
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
media and everything,

2545
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
it sounds like a generic mobile game.

2546
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
It probably is a game

2547
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
called Mana Clash on the store right now.

2548
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And it's probably a match three game.

2549
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Mana Clash!

2550
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Alright, anyway.

2551
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
We're going to wrap things up. Extrovert, the chatters

2552
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
are loving you tonight. S2100 Matt says

2553
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
don't be a stranger. Call in when you get settled in.

2554
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
You're missed here. And Judge Boeser said thank you for

2555
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
suggesting... S2100 Matt is suggesting

2556
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
that you should have... Oh, I don't know about this.

2557
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I don't know about this. But he's suggesting

2558
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
you should have a segment called

2559
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Hot Game Developer of the Week.

2560
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
You know my

2561
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
habits when it comes to podcasts.

2562
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I'll always miss that.

2563
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
He'll do it for 12

2564
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
weeks.

2565
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And they'll be like, oh, like

2566
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
five weeks later. It's like, you're like,

2567
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
do you want to do it again?

2568
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Guys, there's something about

2569
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
the guys on the show, I think the revival went

2570
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
for like 12 episodes, right?

2571
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Pokestop podcast went for 12 episodes.

2572
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Shaking and crying, we have 13

2573
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
episodes and we've been off for five weeks.

2574
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Okay, so it's you. It's your fault.

2575
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I think it might be. You're the constant

2576
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
in this. Alright, no.

2577
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
No, no. I'm going to own up to the guys on the show.

2578
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
But, but, but

2579
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
um, most... And I am

2580
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
trying to get Victoria in gear for us to move again.

2581
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And it is partially my fault why we put it

2582
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
on a stop for a while. Most revivals

2583
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
only last 13 episodes.

2584
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Roseanne.

2585
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Yes, but that's

2586
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
because the last time I checked

2587
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I don't post stupid shit

2588
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
on my Twitter.

2589
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I have to say, I have something

2590
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
to say.

2591
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
No, shaking and crying is coming back.

2592
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
It's just, you notice, it's been a little

2593
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
bit. So some of you might think it's been

2594
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
ending, but as long

2595
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
as Victoria isn't stopping, we

2596
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
shouldn't be stopping. Anyway, sorry.

2597
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I was just going to say, you know, I, by the way

2598
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I've, people that

2599
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
have listened to the show know I take

2600
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Ambien. I'm a friend to the

2601
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Ambien. I speak Ambienese.

2602
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Right. And so I have

2603
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
taken it for 13 years on and off.

2604
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Do you play with Amiibo on Ambien?

2605
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
No, I don't. I don't.

2606
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I play with my Amiibo on Ambien.

2607
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Right.

2608
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I'd like to play

2609
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
with some of those guys on the show.

2610
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
On Bethesda.

2611
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Okay, so I'm going to

2612
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
summarize beside the point,

2613
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
but what I want to say is

2614
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
never have I

2615
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
ever wanted to post

2616
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
a racist tweet on Ambien.

2617
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Just going to go, just going to make

2618
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
that clear, right?

2619
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Okay, just so that's clear. You've never been

2620
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
compelled to just get on there. No, no, because

2621
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
the thing about Ambien is you still

2622
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
know right from wrong when you're on

2623
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
it, so you're not going to do things that

2624
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
aren't you. It's like you're not allowed to murder

2625
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
it. Like guns don't kill people.

2626
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Ambien kills people. Exactly.

2627
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
So let's say that I did

2628
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
make a racist tweet on Ambien.

2629
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
That would mean I'm a racist.

2630
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Uh huh.

2631
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Connect the dots there, Rob.

2632
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I kind of already did.

2633
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Like Roseanne, she's

2634
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
canceled. Like literally and

2635
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
figuratively. I didn't like the show anyway.

2636
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
It came on as like, this is

2637
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
just too much propaganda

2638
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
bullshit nonsense.

2639
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
It got so bad. It got

2640
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
so bad in my opinion. Like I'm like,

2641
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
this isn't funny anymore.

2642
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Anyway, wow. So this is

2643
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
not the Roseanne podcast. No, it's

2644
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
not. It's not. So I think, I think

2645
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
we're ready to wrap up.

2646
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, you have

2647
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
said stupid shit, Rob. Like Super Metroid

2648
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
is better than Chrono Trigger on

2649
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
your Twitter, so that's hate speech.

2650
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Well, I mean

2651
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
when you're going to spell the truth. Facts are facts, America.

2652
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Honestly,

2653
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I can't judge Chrono Trigger. I

2654
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
never played it. Here's the thing.

2655
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I always get shit

2656
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
over that line, which I, I'm going to

2657
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
stand by. I'm going to stand by. You can

2658
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
put it on my fucking tombstone. Super Metroid

2659
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
is the greatest video game ever made. Here's

2660
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
the thing though. When have I ever said

2661
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Chrono Trigger is a bad game?

2662
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Like, and that's the whole thing. This is like gaming

2663
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
in a nutshell. Can't we

2664
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
just enjoy both?

2665
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Can't we enjoy both?

2666
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Isn't there room

2667
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
in your collection for

2668
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
both? And also, if we're going to go further,

2669
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
what if you did think

2670
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Chrono Trigger was a bad game?

2671
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
What does that matter? You're not actually

2672
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
destroying world peace. That's just your opinion.

2673
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
It's true. Lavos

2674
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
destroyed world peace. I didn't do shit.

2675
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I don't care if you don't like my favorite

2676
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
things, but like, I mean

2677
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I might get a little irked and be like,

2678
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
well, they're stupid.

2679
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
That's like when you talk shit about Forza Horizon

2680
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
4. I'd be like, that's your wrong opinion.

2681
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
But go ahead.

2682
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Well, it's kind of a derivative game.

2683
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
You know, with those cars. I think you meant to say

2684
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
a deriving game. It is a deriving

2685
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
game. A deriving, yeah. And you drive

2686
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
in the winter and the summer

2687
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
and the autumn and we're gonna leave it at

2688
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
that before I'm gonna put

2689
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
you in Valve's corner.

2690
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Nobody belongs in that corner

2691
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
except for Valve, Rob. Nobody puts

2692
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Valve in a corner. Yeah.

2693
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Nobody wants to put Valve in a corner.

2694
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
This hurts me more than it hurts you, Valve.

2695
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Are we done?

2696
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Can we sign off now? Alright. Yes.

2697
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That's it. We're gonna be back in another

2698
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
seven days to do this all again.

2699
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Without Extfer. No, but they can't.

2700
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Sorry, guys.

2701
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I appreciated you being here. You're a lot of fun as always.

2702
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Do you have anything you want to plug?

2703
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Like, things that people should follow you on

2704
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
if they miss you? You know, you can follow

2705
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
me on Twitter. I'm

2706
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
GamerExtfer. It's

2707
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
G-A-Y... Why do I always have to

2708
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
spell this stuff? Well, cause there's...

2709
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Well, Extfer is E-X-T-O-F-E-R.

2710
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
It's not X-T-O-F-E-R.

2711
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
It's E-X-T-O-F-E-R.

2712
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
But Gamer is G-A-Y-M-E-R.

2713
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Like Gay,

2714
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Gamer, GamerX. Right.

2715
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Happy Pride. Yes.

2716
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
You should spell that name. That is

2717
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
what I would think. There you go.

2718
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Cool. I don't have

2719
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
anything else, though. I don't have anything else I do

2720
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
lately. I don't stream

2721
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
anymore. Support Ubisoft cause

2722
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
then... Yeah, yeah. Buy the

2723
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Fractured But Whole.

2724
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Because, you know, it's nice to show

2725
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
people support. A lot of hard

2726
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
working people worked on that game.

2727
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
That's right.

2728
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Still haven't played through all the DLC.

2729
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I know. He keeps telling me to

2730
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
play through the latest one.

2731
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
The second DLC. He says

2732
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it's really good. I bought the Season Pass

2733
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
and I was like, that's what I typically do

2734
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
with games. Like, I'm gonna buy the Season Pass.

2735
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And then I stopped playing the game. I did Fallout 4.

2736
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I did that with Call of Duty.

2737
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And I did it with that one.

2738
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I'm sure there's other games.

2739
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Skyrim. It happens.

2740
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
It happens. Alright.

2741
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So as I always say at the end of the show, thank you

2742
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. If you enjoyed

2743
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
what you heard here at the show, leave us

2744
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
a nice five star review on iTunes or

2745
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
tell a friend or wherever you hear the show.

2746
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
iTunes, Google Play, whatever. And tell a friend or

2747
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
two about the show. Help us spread the word because

2748
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2749
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
And we can't get the

2750
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
voices out here to air unless

2751
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
y'all know about the show. If you didn't

2752
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
enjoy tonight's OLR, try

2753
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
to download one of the other episodes

2754
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
that didn't get interrupted with E3

2755
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
and Extoverne.

2756
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

2757
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
No, I consider that a compliment.

2758
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Anyway, if you didn't enjoy

2759
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
tonight's episode, you're just wrong. Sorry.

2760
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Hate to say it. Anyway.

2761
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2762
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Dexter, do you have a final thought?

2763
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I want to

2764
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
sleep with that guy and his dad on

2765
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
the Bethesda conference.

2766
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Maybe you should keep that thought

2767
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
internal. I don't know if my boyfriend

2768
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
would really appreciate

2769
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
the final thought. Probably not.

2770
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Loki, can you give us a real final thought, please?

2771
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I'm looking forward to seeing all of the

2772
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
game announcements this week.

2773
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Hopefully there's nothing

2774
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
disappointing. Death Stranding.

2775
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
My final thought is I'm gonna hold out

2776
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
hope for Super Metroid 2.

2777
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Have a good night, everybody.

2778
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
We'll see you in seven days. What about F-Zero? What are the odds

2779
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
of F-Zero this year?

2780
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I hope so. None to none. Can I play the credit

2781
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
music now? We'll see you in seven days. Bye.

2782
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
The views and opinions

2783
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
expressed in this program do not

2784
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
necessarily reflect those of the staff

2785
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
of Orange Lounge Radio or

2786
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
VOG Network, but you know

2787
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
they were all still true.

2788
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
See you next week.

2789
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Thanks for watching!
