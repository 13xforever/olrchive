Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on June the 3rd of 2018, episode number 733 of our show.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's right, June is underway, it's a big month. Happy Pride Month folks. Happy me turning 40 at the end of this month. Happy OLR's birthday month. June is a very busy month. Isn't it DarkSakura or Jamie Summers over there with a mic?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah it is.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How are you?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm tired.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You tired?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well wake up girl, we got three hours to fill.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I got woke up.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Somebody shook my ass out of bed and said, you gotta go to Placerville.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Ew, ew, why does anybody want to go to Placerville?

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Placerville is pretty though.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, there's some cool things up there.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That was like...

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Wasn't that the one they used to call Hangtown?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know, I'm not from your country.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I think it was back in the day. Anyway, I hope you're doing well. Let's also check in with Techmaster Loki.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Also the VoG Network birthday.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's right. VoG Network was also born in June. Thank you for the reminder. We kind of passed it. It was June 1st.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But yes, celebrating six years here at the Voice Geeks Network.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So a big toast to not only of course Bobby Black Wolf who's on before us every Sunday night because we do tape live at the Voice Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific at 9 o'clock Eastern right after said Bobby Black Wolf's show.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Not only just a big toast to him but all of the contributors to the different shows from our network.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know, all the way from the people that have been with us from the very, very beginning.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Shows like, you know, Critical Myth, Pod Culture, Electric Sisterhood.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All the way up to shows like our newest addition to the network Faraway Nearby.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So a toast to everybody who's been participating with the Voice Geeks Network and all our big shows.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can check out more information on all the shows here at vognetwork.com.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Great plug, Loki.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No problem.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Speaking of plugs, I see you've plugged your switch into your computer to keep it running charged or whatever.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes, because my kids were playing with it all day long and I haven't got a chance to really play around with it.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I see. Does that work okay? Like charging it through your laptop and then your laptop is in the wall? Is that given enough of a charge to keep going?

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's apparently working.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Alright, good to know.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A couple percent higher than it was.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But sadly, hooking that into your laptop will not allow you to suddenly get in there and grab all the files, right?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, I hope they have a mod chip that'll be coming in a couple weeks to do that.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Of course, of course. I knew there was something with that. Alright, fair enough.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Also, say hello. We have a guest in studio tonight and it's been a little while since we've had a fourth chair.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But I think it's great that we're welcoming him back. You guys actually hear this guy every week on OLR.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But you may not have heard him here in studio for, God, it's probably been a couple years.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Welcome back, Jason.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're gonna get to hear me for a lot more than 13 seconds tonight.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's right. And you have that down. You know exactly your window that you get.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
One of these days, though, we're gonna change the intro on you and I'm hoping to give you something.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, what I'm hoping is that in whatever future intro we use, it'll be a loop.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So if you need more time, you can extend the loop. If there's less time, you can just delete the loop.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Which means that I get to actually do all of the audio editing in the process. But yes.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Doesn't that sound fun?

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a great idea because sometimes, you know, I just want to sit back and say, on June 2nd of 2018,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
when the Sacramento weather finally hit 100 degrees, the scorching sun above and the hot rods in the parking lot

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
led us to a discussion about the... Anyways.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
On the seventh day, Microsoft said, let there be GitHub.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Nice. Nice.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All right. Anyway, that little current news going on there.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, oh, our chat room's lighting up over at live.vognetwork.com.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
SSJ saying welcome back to the studio and Eric RPG saying press X to Jason, which I'm sure you've never heard before.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I... nobody... I have a shirt that says that.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Jason. Jason.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And shockingly, nobody has actually used the reference against me.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay. Until now.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I haven't actually heard it plenty. So thank you.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So, Jason, I know, obviously, you know, if I don't say this enough on the show,

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
like this show wouldn't like fucking exist right now if it wasn't for you.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Like, I hope folks realize that.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, I'm just, you know, I'm just kind of awesome.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You do it. Yeah. Yeah.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You'll go. Hold on, though.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We'll keep that ego check.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But you do a ton behind the scenes.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You do like the orange laundry dot com website, even though, yes, it's old.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And we've talked about that.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The fact that, you know, we have a podcast generating custom thing, a place to host the shows and everything.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's all because of you as well as the audio intros and outros that you do every week.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So big, big thanks to that.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What else are you doing in gaming these days in the past couple of years?

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I know like you do a lot with at least like watching Twitch and supporting Twitch.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Like you were the one that made me go to TwitchCon and finally kind of like sell me on this concept of broadcasting games for people to watch that now, like two years later, I'm actually like doing.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah. Yeah.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
TwitchCon was only two hours away from me at the start.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's like it's practically your backyard, Rob.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I know. It's just Moscone. Exactly.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's not like traffic is God awful.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I have to get in the car. I have to pay a toll to get over the bridge.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Five bucks over the pretty water.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I unfortunately like gaming.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What is what is most relevant and most interesting is that the Colorado chapter of the IGDA when when the Twitch Colorado group formed the folks at Cigna, Colorado Independent Game Developer Association, attended the first meetup.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And so there's been a strengthening of the gaming and geek tech nerd communities by nature of getting together.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So I've actually been pained, returning the favor and kind and attending some of the Cigna hangouts.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I'm not a game developer myself.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And everybody asks, everybody there asks, what are you working on?

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, I'm not I'm not a game developer myself.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I consider myself more of a kind of an integrator, maybe, maybe web service at best kind of person.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But I am gaming adjacent and I would love to be able to see the things the things that exist in my backyard back in Colorado that I didn't know about.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I think here locally with Sacramento, even though now we have the Sacramento Game Developers Collective, which is very similar in concept to IGDA and all that.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What what they one thing I've kind of learned with working with them is that there is a lot more in-game development than just necessarily knowing how to program games.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Right. For example, I know like, you know, and I'll just I don't think I'm saying anything that's like a big secret.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But like when Bree was here from from that group and they were talking about the SAC Indie Arcade, which sadly it didn't happen this year, you guys.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We're really hoping it's going to be back next year. But Bree was on the show before and she kind of admitted she didn't really like super get into games.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And so she started getting involved with this.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But when it came to like promotion, when it came to like how to get in touch with the media and how to get your game like exposed and all that, like the business side of things that sometimes people doing the programming.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't always think about like she was like rock solid on that stuff.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That was a huge strength for her because she had worked with the radio background, all that.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So my point with that and bringing up, you know, former guests on the show is that it does remind us that like, oh, yeah, there is a lot more in the game industry besides just programmers getting in there, making the game.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Because then the question is, well, where's your music going to come from?

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Where's your voiceovers going to come from, Jason?

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Where's your voice of voice of God going to come from the other vog?

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Nobody's poached me yet, but nobody yet.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Absolutely. Like it, like any like any production, like any art form, like any anything, it's not just the programmers.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It is also the artists, both in the visual and the acoustic and any other sense.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It actually it absolutely is promotion dissemination.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There is a certain there is a certain distribution and marketing Web site of indie games that goes by the name Game Jolt.

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The owners are nomads, but they currently reside in Colorado.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And so I back as a lot of nomads do only only for their 14 K and then they move on.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
They move on to the next mountain.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I see. But why? I just thought it was the legalization of a certain substance that brought a lot of nomads there.

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then, oh, wait, wait, they got it in California now to the entire coast.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Just just start in SoCal, swim all the way up. And no matter where you land, it's green.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Or as Raginator in our chat room asks, Sega nomads.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That won't even get you to the next city.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That is like the second funny joke Raginator said in our chat room in like this year.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Congratulations, buddy.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Also, I tripped over ours literally.

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It is it is a brick.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It hurts when it falls on your foot, just saying.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
All right. So anyway, where were we? Oh, yes.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So the moral of the story is, I bet these companies like, you know, your companies, these organizations like Colorado, IGDA, you know, the sat and any game developer in your city where you live.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You know, if you've been wanting to get involved with game development like they actually probably want more people.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That aren't just programmers. I mean, if that's something you want to do, cool.

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But like, you know, if you are a music guy, if you're an art person, if you're a marketing person, if you're a Web site creator.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I mean, these all these things go into how to get a game out.

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And even even if it's even if there's no digital aspect to it.

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Cigna's holiday party at the end of last year had a had a tabletop.

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry, but every time you say that name, I think of health insurance.

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can't like I'm like, wait, Cigna, what the fuck do they have to do with anything?

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The holiday party had a tabletop board and card game creator and like logic, even even if you're not a programmer yourself.

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Your ability to create design rules is just as important for for balancing, for fairness or for even tipping the scales and making knowing how to make something demonstrably significantly hard.

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So it's it's it's a production like it's not it's not as literal as when I my my very first job was working for a newspaper whenever whenever I would tell someone that, oh, you're a writer.

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No. Oh, you edit. No, I fix the computers of the people that do.

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, yeah, and it's important for sure. For sure.

146
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No, that's that's you know, it's you know, when you see these companies, like if you were to go to like Blizzard's website, they're always hiring for people.

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Right. So you could see like what kind of roles is Blizzard trying to fill right now?

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They're always going to have somebody that's like a project manager. And like, what does that person have to do?

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Basically, corral all the cats, you know, and make sure that the project manager will be responsible for making sure that the game actually comes out when they say it's going to come out.

150
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Organization like proper organization of people and tasks is a huge is an incredible skill.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
For sure. Anyway, great chat.

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, welcome back to the show, Jason. And it's good to have you here. And please feel free to chime in as necessary on our stories tonight.

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I should ask you real quick, though, because we were talking about this a little bit at lunch TwitchCon this year. Is that something you're going to go?

154
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I do already have well, I don't have my tickets yet. They haven't even frickin gone on sale. I have a hotel room, though.

155
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And yes, when to as soon as tickets go on sale, I absolutely will be. I will be once again in your backyard in San Jose.

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But I told you my problem with the weekend. Why are they doing Halloween weekend? Seriously?

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Because they that's been their time slot. I know that are the weekend before.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I know at least one couple that's getting married Halloween weekend and then there'll be a Rocky Horror thing for sure.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So I'm a little I want to go like really big because now that I actually do more streaming, I actually want to and like I know people that are going to be there.

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They're going is like, fuck, I really want to meet these people.

161
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So what you're saying is we need the hyperloop to be done in the next four months so you can just get down there in half an hour.

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Can you can you give Elon Musk a call? I mean, I am one of those tunnels. I am one of his customers.

163
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I have some cloud, doesn't it? Perhaps. Perhaps.

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, well, I was going to ask you this real quick and then we'll get into news with the Twitch stuff.

165
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You don't really do a lot of broadcasting, right? So is this like a similar thing to the game development?

166
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What what do you do? Because you you've always been like a big supporter of Twitch and streaming and all that.

167
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What what is your role in that? I am not a game developer. I'm developer adjacent.

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I am not a Twitch broadcaster. I am broadcasting adjacent. I am a Jason.

169
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Jason, you're broadcasting adjacent. Jason, come on.

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on. I was literally picking up the microphone to make that joke.

171
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's pretty funny. OK. Anyway, I I have dabbled in streaming to kind of understand, especially like OBS has some really.

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's a it's a it's it's a language that you need to learn. It's a it's a way of putting things together that you need to learn.

173
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And I I've been a tech support person my entire professional my entire life period.

174
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And so that's just kind of the role that I take on. I'm a community member for friends.

175
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I know I have a couple of IRL friends that stream a coworker.

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
A former coworker was a gate was my gateway drug into Twitch. And by referral, friends of friends and all that kind of stuff.

177
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I go in and I help people out and I make friends by reference.

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I, you know, I meet new people. TwitchCon especially has has exemplified that.

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So I'll take part and be a community member and provide knowledge and insight as possible as necessary.

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Really rad. And I think, you know, especially for the larger streamers, which is not something I've had to deal with personally, because I'm you know, I'm still kind of I'm a affiliate, but I'm I'm still kind of small fry.

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Right. You know, I'm a small French fry, not a jumbo size. But like those guys that are like partners and stuff like they need like teams to be able to just moderate their channels to like take the garbage out basically.

182
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And sometimes it's kind of a thankless job sort of thing, you know?

183
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yep. So, yeah, you're you're doing a very important role there with all that. So. All right. Awesome. Great.

184
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If you guys want to ask Jason any questions, you can over at live.vognetwork.com.

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In fact, actually, Bobby Black Wolf is speaking up going, maybe I need to talk to Jason because I'm fighting OBS for some stuff with plugins or browser source stuff.

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So I guess the consulting door is open. All right.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I am reachable on the Internet. I go by VX JasonXV.

188
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's right. And actually, funny enough, like OBS, you were kind of talking about like getting that software, you know, it's not just for streaming.

189
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can make regular movies with that, like record things.

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And I've actually used like so for my dumb Facebook game that I got way too involved with earlier this month, you have to record these little like, you know, like like they would do on the TV show.

191
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's just like them sitting there talking shit about everybody.

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So that's what you have to do is you have to record yourself talking shit about everybody for like five minutes every every game round, basically.

193
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So I used OBS to do it so I could use my green screen to like pretend that I was in the forest or like actually people started requesting like, could you do one in the Grand Canyon?

194
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So I did it when it was in the Grand Canyon. And so like I would use my green screen. That was all through OBS.

195
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So I would record little things in OBS and I would use good old Windows Movie Maker to string it all together.

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But actually, well, but then I learned like, how do I step up my game? And there's some free video editing program that's like really big Redfish or something.

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't remember the name of it now. Red Lantern. I don't remember what it's called.

198
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Red Lantern is a very angry.

199
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't know. I don't I don't think that's really somebody in chat will yell it out.

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But it's a it was a movie editing thing that's free. And I actually started to learn like how to use it.

201
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And like it was like, God, this ridiculous fucking game is teaching me these like real life skills. What the fuck?

202
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
If you want as well, I would be more than happy to bring over my Mac and let you use iMovie.

203
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, yeah.

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
iMovie will work on your iPhone.

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Now, if I shoot films on my phone, which I have done, I definitely use iMovie for that because it's super simple.

206
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And it will migrate over into the desktop version.

207
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, that's that's with all with the cloud and all that good stuff. Yes, of course, of course. Anyway.

208
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
All right. Well, let's move on.

209
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We've got to get into gaming and we're going to get into, of course, our gaming weeks.

210
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But first, we actually have a kickoff topic. I know we were like 20 minutes in the show.

211
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We've got to get to our kickoff topic, which has to do with Pokemons.

212
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's right. E3 is just around the corner next week.

213
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Actually, we're going to have kind of a different a very different O.L.R. show.

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So we're still debating. And maybe you guys can have a say with this.

215
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We are considering one of two options.

216
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We're either going to cut our show short so that Bethesda's press conference, we can kind of go watch that.

217
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Then come back and give our thoughts.

218
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But Loki is kind of suggesting that maybe we do something that I said we'd never do and actually do the live commentary this year.

219
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Sure. Let's do it. All right.

220
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So that may be playing live. We complain complaining live or say that's really cool.

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No, I think I think less less cynicism, more optimism would be the optimistic.

222
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm still hoping for another Elder Scrolls game, even if it's like some stupid like, oh, hey, we're remastering Oblivion now.

223
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll take that. Yeah, we'll see that.

224
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Maybe what we'll do, maybe I am thinking, all right, some folks are saying live commentary worth a shot.

225
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Screw Bethesda. They're going to be let down. What I might do.

226
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And so this would be important for the podcast folks.

227
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What I'll probably do is we'll still do it live for those that want to listen.

228
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They can and those that don't want to don't have to.

229
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then what we'll do for the podcast is we'll make that section of the show like a special download on our social media.

230
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But we won't actually be part of the regular podcast. So that that's kind of where my head's at right now.

231
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We'll let you all know what to expect next week.

232
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But anyway, my point was with E3 literally around the corner is next week.

233
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
E3 is next. Well, you know, a week from next next business.

234
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We next business. Well, no, you are right. It is next week because of all the keynote.

235
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, yes, that's true. Oh, yeah, that's true. The keynotes are starting on Saturday.

236
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is your whole lesson of discussion? Yes. Six days away when the first keynote is going to be first out the gate.

237
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So anyway, but we have leaks are starting to show up, which are getting confirmed by some of the publishers.

238
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We'll talk about that a little later in the show, but also some people wanting to get the jump on some of the announcements.

239
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And the Pokemon Company was one of those companies that wanted to get the jump on those announcements.

240
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
They did a little thing in Japan during this week this week.

241
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So they talked about the latest of what's going on with Pokemon.

242
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So the first thing that they announced is that they have a little side game called Pokemon Quest.

243
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And Pokemon Quest came out for the Nintendo Switch for free this week.

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And it is slated for mobile in about a month. It'll be coming out on iOS and Android.

245
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You can download it on the switch right now. It's very obvious it's a mobile game.

246
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's all touch screen. It is. It is all touch screen.

247
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I mean, you can't if you dock it or even if you are still in handout, you can use the little controllers to move around.

248
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I didn't even realize this until I was streaming it earlier this week, actually.

249
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And Bobby or somebody chimed in and said, did you know you can use L and R to change at the bottom?

250
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I didn't even realize that.

251
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Or you could just do what I do and just let the game play itself because it ends up beating levels that I can't do on my own.

252
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So I'm like, eh, fine.

253
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That may not be a bad idea, actually.

254
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Anyhow, the little free to play thing came out and it's basically blockymon.

255
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Like they look like very blockymon.

256
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Cubivore Pokemon.

257
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It is cubivore Pokemon. Well, when I first saw it, I was like, oh shit, here's Pokemon's Minecraft.

258
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But it actually is nothing like that at all.

259
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's more of Crossy Roads. I was just gonna say Crossymon.

260
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Crossy Roads Pokemon.

261
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's a good way of putting it.

262
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So anyway, the thing about it is that, you know, you can't really, like, you're playing a story mode-esque sort of thing by yourself.

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But you're not trading with friends. You're not interacting with friends.

264
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can't see how friends are progressing.

265
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:12,000
For a mobile game, well, what will be a mobile game, you know, for what's right now on the Switch, there's really no sense of competition with your friends whatsoever.

266
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's a shockingly antisocial mobile game.

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes, and so therefore, all the free to play elements are just like, you know, pay this money to get items or just sit there and wait.

268
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's like that Harry Potter game.

269
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Like you have energy.

270
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, it's that whole thing, which is a little bit eh, but it is free.

271
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So, you know, there is that.

272
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But for me, I think it's one of those things where it's like, I played it a few times this week, and I'm done.

273
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know, that was cute.

274
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Next.

275
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You know, meanwhile, these other games are coming out, and I don't have the time to check out my silly little Pokemon.

276
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Maybe when it's on mobile, so I can do it from places like, you know, a doctor's office or a waiting room or sitting at the airport or something, like, maybe it would make more sense in those places.

277
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Which I guess technically you could use the Switch in those places too, but I just, I don't take my Switch with me everywhere.

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I take my mobile phone with me everywhere.

279
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So it's going to make more sense there.

280
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But, Loki, I couldn't help but notice you have been playing it.

281
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I noticed that was the game that was on your Switch, so that kind of surprises me.

282
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You're into Pokemon Quest?

283
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, it's fun. I've played it for a few hours already.

284
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
How far are you right now?

285
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
To like the, not the, like the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels, because they unlock three at a time.

286
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So I'm to there.

287
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Wow, okay.

288
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I haven't got any evolutions or anything, but I have a shit ton of Pokemon though.

289
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Okay, wow, okay. You just keep, you keep using the little cooking thing?

290
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Do you just let it cook whatever it wants, or do you actually...

291
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
No, I looked up online how to, like, do those.

292
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, okay. I was like, there's got to do it.

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But, I mean, it's easy to figure out too. It's just like, okay, all red, all blue, all, you know.

294
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Oh, okay.

295
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's not that hard.

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Alright.

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's really smart.

298
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And Bobby wants to know, have you hacked it yet, Loki?

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Um, I paid money to unlock some stuff, because I thought it was worth...

300
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You gave those people money?

301
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a game, yeah. I'm supporting the game, because I played it for like eight hours.

302
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So I'm like, okay, well, I think it's...

303
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
No, I just...

304
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Throw them some money, so I did it.

305
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I would not have thought that Pokemon Quest on Switch, out of all of the things out there,

306
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
would have been the thing to finally get you to open up, well, I mean, I know you've opened it up before,

307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
but would be something to get you to open up your wallet.

308
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm just, I'm pleasantly surprised, that's all.

309
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I just figured I'd throw them some money.

310
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Alright, fair enough.

311
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So there you go.

312
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Headline of the week, y'all.

313
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Loki spent money on Pokemon Quest.

314
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Alright, so Pokemon Quest is out, but that's not the thing people really wanted to know about.

315
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
People wanted to know about, where's the real game coming out on Switch?

316
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And Nintendo had kind of two answers for that.

317
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
In a sense, they had a literal two answer with, let's go Pikachu and let's go Eevee.

318
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Which was a game, I think they leaked, these were leaked a while ago.

319
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, the leaks turned out to be pretty legit, because those were the leaked titles that came out.

320
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And so, yeah, I mean, that would not be a thing.

321
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I think most people would guess, is that Eevee was now a starter Pokemon of sorts.

322
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Which, I mean, that makes people very happy, I'm sure, because Eevee is, you know, people love Eevee and the Eeveelutions.

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So, that's really cool.

324
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And then Pikachu, of course, has always been a bit of the mascot of the Pokemon series,

325
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
thanks in no small part to the cartoon.

326
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So anyway, these games were confirmed, they will be coming out for the Switch, but they're not your traditional Pokemon RPG.

327
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
In fact, these games look like they are, I mean, I guess the easiest way to say it,

328
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
would be it's a bit of a hybrid of Pokemon Go and the more traditional Pokemon RPGs.

329
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What I mean by that is that it looks like you will be catching Pokemon with a very similar ball throwing type of mechanic

330
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
that you use on the mobile phones when you play Pokemon Go.

331
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
In fact, speaking of Pokemon Go, there does appear to be a way that you will be able to bring in monsters

332
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
that you've caught in Pokemon Go into your Let's Go game.

333
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No word yet if that's like an isolated area, because if you look really closely at the trailer,

334
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
you see it mention something called Go Park or something like that.

335
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So it's unknown if it's like something you bring into the full game or just like this one mode that kind of works with it.

336
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee is going to have their own little Bluetooth peripheral.

337
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's a little Pokeball.

338
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And you can also bring them back into Pokemon Go too.

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yes, yes, apparently. So yeah, that's got a lot of Pokemon Go players pretty excited.

340
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So anyway, the accessory is a little Pokeball and then I guess it makes, I don't know, makes a little Pokemon noises as well.

341
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's Pokeball Plus that they are saying will be available in November.

342
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
For a day and then gone for three months.

343
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's fucking generous. For five minutes and then it will be gone.

344
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That's a portion of the day.

345
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
If you want one of these things, you better be ready to fight.

346
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Because we all know Nintendo cannot keep these types of things on the shelves for shit.

347
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We don't know how to supply our vendors.

348
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm just telling you all, so that when this happens, we can say, oh yes, we knew this was coming.

349
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
This is going to be the thing that you're not going to be able to fucking find, but you're going to want it.

350
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh no, customer fainted.

351
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Trainer used eBay. It's super effective, but you now have zero dollars.

352
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Breaks list, use scalper.

353
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So anyway, so Pikachu and Eevee.

354
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But I say it looks like it's kind of a hybrid because when you look at the battle, the battle doesn't look like Pokemon Go at all.

355
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Because the battle is just mash the screen as fast as you can type of thing.

356
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But in this one, you can clearly see that the Pokemon comes out and you can choose one of three moves.

357
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Like there's a little screenshot with Pikachu being able to use Thunder Shock or Quick Attack.

358
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And he's limited to how many times he can do it, just like in the games.

359
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So it does seem like there is a little bit of a hybrid there.

360
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So you might catch your Pokemon like Pokemon Go, even though you are on the Switch.

361
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's a single player experience.

362
00:25:49,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But I got to admit, as somebody who loves Pokemon Go, who appreciates the single player games but never seems to have the attention to completely get through them,

363
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm looking at this going, wow, this seems like a really kind of perfect blend of the things I'm into.

364
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I understand there's people out there that just for whatever reason, they don't go outside as often.

365
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And so this is a chance to play a game like Pokemon Go, but from the comfort of their own home or what have you.

366
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So, I mean, that's really cool, too.

367
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But, I mean, just as, I guess, for no other better term, but a filthy fucking casual when it comes to Pokemon.

368
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Like, I'm like super into this.

369
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So it's interesting to me to watch some of the, you know, reaction over on Twitter.

370
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You've got some people that are like into it, like I am.

371
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Some people that think it's trash.

372
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You know, they're like, pass, you know, whatever this is.

373
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Now, if you're one of those people that's like, pass, well, the good news is for you, they confirmed this is not Gen 8.

374
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Pokemon Gen 8 is coming in 2019.

375
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But...

376
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So the next Pokemon mainline game is a year away.

377
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It'll be what, like holiday 2019.

378
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But that is, again, and I talked about this on a previous episode.

379
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
If you look at the number of years between mainline Pokemon gens, you should have expected 2019.

380
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But, this game is going to be the way to unlock one of the Gen 8 Pokemon before the game.

381
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Ah, I see. Okay, I didn't realize.

382
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Now, I heard that there was going to be an extra Pokemon in this game.

383
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And it's going to be a brand new Pokemon.

384
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, so the thing, and also if you didn't already pick this up, the thing about Let's Go Pikachu, Let's Go Eevee is that it is Gen 1.

385
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's Kanto Pokemon only, basically.

386
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And it's only using one Joy-Con.

387
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's controlled completely with like the analog stick, basically.

388
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm also still kind of curious how that's going to work with Pokemon Go.

389
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
If Go has three generations, and I would think by the holiday...

390
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Probably only port over certain Pokemon.

391
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah, maybe. Maybe only certain ones are going to be able to go back and forth.

392
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We'll have to really see how that all shakes out.

393
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Or maybe if these games, like Pokemon Go, are built to expand to Gen 2, Gen 3, Gen 4.

394
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I mean, it would probably make more sense to Nintendo to sell those things separately.

395
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But they could also be awesome DLC.

396
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I mean, would you guys pay for DLC that was Gen 2, Gen 3, and so forth?

397
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
If the game's good.

398
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, if the game's good.

399
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think it looks cool. I'm excited to get it for my kids because, you know, my youngest son is really small.

400
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He plays Super Mario Odyssey.

401
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
He doesn't really understand everything in it and gets stuck a lot.

402
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But my oldest son beat Super Mario Odyssey, so...

403
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Nice.

404
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I was surprised having played through the whole...

405
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You know, I'm just surprised he did that.

406
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But like, it would be nice to have a game that they could both play together that is pretty easy to control.

407
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So, I'm down with that.

408
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
bonds006 in chat says,

409
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
This is how Ninty and Game Freak is gonna get me to buy a Switch. Damn you, gaming god.

410
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's over at live.vognetwork.com.

411
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You know, I'm in a group of Pokemon Go raiders and you have all sorts of different levels of gamers in there.

412
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And there's some people that don't really play a lot of console games.

413
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But some of the folks in there are talking about,

414
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So, how much is it to get a Switch?

415
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Like, what other games are on the Switch?

416
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So, like, if I wanted to get it for this game, what else would I be able to play?

417
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You know, like, they're asking those types of questions where some people are thinking about it.

418
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Like, especially because it has the Go functionality.

419
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And, like, if you're not a Pokemon Go player, one thing you need to understand,

420
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
there are still a lot of people playing Pokemon Go.

421
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And I don't... At least from my perspective, there's a lot of older folks that are playing.

422
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
When I say older, I kind of have to loop myself into that crowd because I'm also in my 40s.

423
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But I notice, like, there's definitely a crowd of, like, late 30, 40, 50-year-olds that are, like, super into Pokemon Go.

424
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because that's why I keep running into it all these raids.

425
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's a very interesting... Like, the core audience right now for Pokemon Go is very interesting to me.

426
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yes, there's kids that do it too, but I think there's also...

427
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Like, I see a lot of parents who bring their kids.

428
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And then I think a lot of kids are just kind of off doing their own thing.

429
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
They're not necessarily trying to get shiny Ho-Os and things like this.

430
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But, like, when it comes to the raids and the hardcore stuff, like, I notice a lot of, like, older people.

431
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And I think folks that are just like,

432
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So, okay, well, like, if I got a Nintendo Switch, it might help me in this game.

433
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Like, I'll consider it.

434
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Like, it's, like, super interesting to me.

435
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That's the most expensive DLC I've ever heard.

436
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I know, right? But there's people that'll do it.

437
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Like, people are just going, like...

438
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And plus... Oh, man, the best part, I don't even think I should get into it here on OLR.

439
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But, like, some of the drama that comes up between, like, grown-ass men and women about, like...

440
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And I told that motherfucker he needs to stay off my fucking gym until I get my coins.

441
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And if that motherfucker knocks me off that gym before I get my fucking 50 coins,

442
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm gonna go to every gym in this goddamn neighborhood and look at that motherfucker and I'm gonna knock him off.

443
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Like, that...

444
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I wish I could say I'm exaggerating a conversation that I've overheard. I am not.

445
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Like, Pokemon Go has its own set of drama.

446
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But I don't want to scare people off from Pokemon Go either.

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You can stay... It's very easy to stay away from that and turn that off.

448
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But I'm just saying, like...

449
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's, like, you know that's, like, the equivalent, like, a dollar worth of, like...

450
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, these are grown-ass men and women who fucking fight about gym control.

451
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Mommy fainted.

452
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And, okay, thank you. Thank you. Chatter's backing me up.

453
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, I believe that conversation happened.

454
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Bonds006 says, yes, the gym battle drama gets real.

455
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Actf says, I have friends that are getting back into Pokemon Go because of this new game.

456
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, that's kind of the general vibe I've been getting on Twitter, too,

457
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
is that I've seen a lot of people that are suddenly like,

458
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm gonna reinstall Pokemon Go and see what I've missed because I need to be prepared for this Switch game.

459
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You've missed a lot.

460
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
They've been... I gotta say, the quest is something that they've done in all these different events each week.

461
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Really helping.

462
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So, I mean, love it or hate it,

463
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
there's no denying that Pokemon Go is, like, transforming Pokemon and therefore Nintendo.

464
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I mean, the fact that this game is happening.

465
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And I gotta say, I'm super fucking excited for it.

466
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And all those people that...

467
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm here for it.

468
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah, no, seriously, like, for all the people that are just like,

469
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
oh, I hate this and stuff, think about it this way.

470
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You're getting all these people that are gonna be more into Pokemon.

471
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Now this is kind of the next step to a traditional Pokemon RPG.

472
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So when the new Pokemon RPG comes out, that's even more people that'll play it.

473
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't see how there's a downside to this.

474
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah.

475
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Jamie, you've been a little quiet.

476
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I know you're not as into Pokemon Go.

477
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Well, you play here and there, but what are your thoughts on this whole, like, direction for Let's Go?

478
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I was actually kind of excited.

479
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah?

480
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, I mean, it's the first new Pokemon game I've been super interested in, so...

481
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And even Dan, who's like, eh, Pokemon, whatever,

482
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
he's, like, really liking that controller.

483
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The Pokeball controller.

484
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah, it is pretty cool.

485
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I like how it kind of glows.

486
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Like, it reminds me, what was that old, like, 80's cartoon,

487
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
where when the little robot talks, it would glow?

488
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's what it looks like with the little Pokeballs doing.

489
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Mmm.

490
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But, I mean, the whole concept is very interesting,

491
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and I was even super excited.

492
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I was like, you know, I think I found a Pokemon game that I want.

493
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Nice.

494
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But I would get the Eevee one.

495
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Well, that's fine, because I've pre-ordered Pikachu.

496
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Because, I don't know what it is, but every gamer I know,

497
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and I don't know what it is, has pre-ordered Eevee.

498
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I did not realize that Eevee was, like, the unofficial, like, LGBTQ plus mascot.

499
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Um, but...

500
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I just think Eevee's cuter.

501
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Eevee is cute, but I got Pikachu because, A, I'm old school and hipster,

502
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and Pikachu's what got me into, like, the anime and stuff.

503
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
No, but for real, if all these people I know are getting Eevee,

504
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
then I'm gonna get Pikachu, so I have people to trade with.

505
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because Pikachu's got some weak-ass evolutions is why I would go with, you know...

506
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You know what, but he's fucking cute, so shut up.

507
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The first thing I'm gonna do, though, with my Eevee is make it a Flareon.

508
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If you can, though.

509
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Flareon was first gen.

510
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Oh, yeah, sorry. Flareon was gen one. Yes, sorry, sorry.

511
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't know why my brain went to, when you said Flareon,

512
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
my brain brought up a picture of an Umbreon.

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because it's gonna be my little flame name.

514
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yeah.

515
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
There you go. See, Bobby Blackwolf in chat, that's the key to a happy marriage.

516
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Bobby Blackwolf says,

517
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
My wife has told me she's getting Eevee. I'm getting Pikachu.

518
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Do you like, by the way, there was no discussion there.

519
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It was just, my wife told me she's doing this.

520
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
As it normally goes.

521
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Is that right, right, Jamie? All right.

522
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Actually, even, you know, Alan is super into Pokemon Go,

523
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and I think he's kind of, like, looking at this going,

524
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
huh, huh, so is this something that'll help me, too, if you get this?

525
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Or, you know, are we gonna have to get him his own Nintendo Switch?

526
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Help me, God. All right, anyway.

527
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So, yeah, I'm really excited about those games.

528
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And then, of course, gen eight, as we mentioned, at some point next year.

529
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So, for those that aren't feeling this Go thing, you know,

530
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
you can wait till next year for the RPG.

531
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So, you got that.

532
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So, anyway.

533
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Jason, what are your thoughts on the Pokemon Let's Go?

534
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
When I was younger, I told myself that I would get back into Pokemon

535
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
when the technological sophistication is...

536
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
...sufficiently upgrades.

537
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Somehow, I told myself that was Diamond. Pokemon Diamond.

538
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And, yeah, it had, like, system to system,

539
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
the cave mechanic that I barely even remember the details to.

540
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But I've touched, I played maybe an hour and a half of Diamond

541
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and never again.

542
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Well, to be fair, that's, like, gen four, right?

543
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's, like, the worst gen.

544
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I couldn't say because I just didn't really make any progress on it.

545
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I know Bulbasaur, Twirtle, Charizard,

546
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Charizard, Charmander weren't the starters.

547
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Nope.

548
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But, yeah, like, for, I don't even remember the logic

549
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
that went into that decision.

550
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
This is significant.

551
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This is new.

552
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This is interesting.

553
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah, I sank in, I don't know how many hours,

554
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
twenty-something, probably mid-twenties level of Pokemon Go.

555
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Unaligned, thank you very much.

556
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I never chose a team, which probably means, like,

557
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
the game isn't going to be available to me.

558
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Anyways, yeah, I enjoyed Pokemon Go.

559
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm keeping an eye on this kind of stuff because it is very interesting to me.

560
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It is a very significant part of my pre-teen and teenage years,

561
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but certainly kind of the formative teenage years,

562
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and with all of these new features and possibilities

563
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and Pokemon Company and Game Freak and everybody

564
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
starting to be able to actually take advantage of them.

565
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It looks very interesting.

566
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Nothing like, I think buying it is inevitable.

567
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm not over the hump quite yet,

568
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
but it's something that I am certainly keeping an active eye on.

569
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah, there's something to be said, too,

570
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
because you mentioned that I just remember the starters weren't

571
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Bulbasaur, Charmander, that whole thing,

572
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
but yet this is going back to a Gen 1 kind of reboot,

573
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and I think maybe part of the reason for that is to get those people.

574
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's just like Pokemon Go did.

575
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Hey, remember Pikachu and Bulbasaur and all this stuff

576
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
you remember from when you were a kid?

577
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I think there's something about that particular first generation,

578
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
even though I know some people are burned the fuck out on reboots

579
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and all that stuff.

580
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Folks, there are like 800 Pokemon.

581
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Can we stop with the first 150?

582
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Not to mention only being limited to 150 and not,

583
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
oh god, there's so damn many.

584
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Right. So anyway, alright.

585
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well, there's some thoughts on Pokemon Let's Go.

586
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Hopefully we'll get some of your thoughts later in the show,

587
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
either in our mailbag or, of course, there's also our Skype line

588
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
at Orange Lounge Radio.

589
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But for now, before we get into the news of the week,

590
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
we want to get to our gaming weeks.

591
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

592
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

593
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I bought some games.

594
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I haven't started them yet because Steam had a couple of things on sale.

595
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
One of them, well, great, now my Steam is trying to update

596
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
so I can't look at what they are.

597
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And I put my receipts away.

598
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'll get my receipts in a second.

599
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I did play, I'm starting to try to actively level in Pokemon Go again.

600
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And, of course, you know I like my idle pouring.

601
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Okay, so the game that I bought was,

602
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I bought Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines for five bucks.

603
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And I bought the Dark Souls Remastered

604
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
because it's on sale for 20 bucks right now.

605
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And I know I bought something else, but, oh yeah,

606
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I bought Shatter based on recommendation from a couple of the listeners.

607
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So, we'll see if I like it.

608
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Actually, no, I had already bought it, but someone,

609
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I think it was Rage Nator, told me that I'd like the soundtrack,

610
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
but it wouldn't let me buy the soundtrack for myself.

611
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It was really weird.

612
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The Steam's DLC, I mean, for every other kind of DLC,

613
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
it makes sense that you would have to have the base game,

614
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
but just because of the way that you have to have the game

615
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
to download the soundtrack, yeah, it's a mess.

616
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yeah, so with that then, I was, since I had to get a new phone,

617
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I went back to go finish playing the new Puzzle Bobble game.

618
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah, I have to start completely over on Puzzle Bobble,

619
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and I was like on stage 80 when I quit, when I had to replace my phone.

620
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So, a little bit aggravated by that.

621
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Apparently a set of Corsos on sale for 15% off, so that's cool.

622
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
If you like your car games.

623
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons is on sale for $2.99.

624
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm buying it right now.

625
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So, anyway, it's really been kind of a busy week

626
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
because I did just come back from DragCon before that,

627
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and then all of the Bay Area stuff I've been doing.

628
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Probably this month is not going to be a very great gaming time for me

629
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
because I have two Pride events, sorry, three Pride events.

630
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Are you doing Sacramento Pride this coming weekend?

631
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm doing Sacramento Pride.

632
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I may actually go after all. I know I said I wasn't going to go,

633
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
but one of my friends was like, we should go, we should go.

634
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And I'm like, all right.

635
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
If we have a booth, I'll let you know.

636
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But, yeah, I'm doing Sacramento Pride, Rainbow Festival, and San Francisco Pride.

637
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So, it may be just mostly Pokemon for this month.

638
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That's all right.

639
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah.

640
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's still a game.

641
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's going to be me next month

642
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
because next month I'm going to be in rehearsals for,

643
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I guess I can say this now,

644
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm going to be in Clue the movie here locally on July 28th.

645
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Kermit flail.

646
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Kermit flail.

647
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
At the Colonial.

648
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I think the reason why people like Jamie are taking a particular interest

649
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
in what's happening here, I'm going to be playing Mrs. Peacock.

650
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So, if you've ever seen Clue the movie, you know that Mrs. Peacock,

651
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
like she starts the movie like she's kind of normal

652
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and then she kind of goes like completely neurotic.

653
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So, I remember about 10 years ago, I saw a stage adaptation of the movie Clue.

654
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I think it was totally bootleg and probably would have got shut down

655
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
if Paramount found out about it.

656
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But that was the first idea where it planted in my head

657
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
where Mrs. Peacock is like 15 times funnier as a drag queen.

658
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And so, I was kind of like, all right, like acting goals.

659
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So, here we are, July 28th, acting goals.

660
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm going to play Mrs. Peacock.

661
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So, I'm like actually like super excited about it.

662
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
But now I'm realizing like, oh God, I have to shave my beard.

663
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm going to miss my beard and I have to shave lots of other stuff too.

664
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But thankfully, Mrs. Peacock's dress is pretty big.

665
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So, I won't have to go too crazy. But yeah, I'm excited about it.

666
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
This means no tucking.

667
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah, that's one of the big reasons.

668
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And let me tell you, it's a big reason. No, I'm kidding.

669
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's one of the big reasons why I was willing to play a part like that

670
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
is because the dress is pretty conservative.

671
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So, I didn't have to like go like all out, you know what I mean?

672
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So, but it'll be fun. It's going to be a good time.

673
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm pretty handy with hot glue so I can help make a fascinator.

674
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Not when it comes to that.

675
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I meant the fascinator. Her weird hat thing that she's...

676
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Is it just me or we went for the topic of tucking to where Jamie goes,

677
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I have a hot glue gun. No!

678
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
No, everyone knows that you use boat tape to tuck, okay?

679
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yes, I'm aware, yes.

680
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Or a friend of mine uses gaff tape.

681
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yes, anyway.

682
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Not duct tape.

683
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Hey, for someone who don't have the junks, she knows a bit about tucking, okay?

684
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You can, you can, you know what?

685
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And if you want to hear more, there's a YouTube for it.

686
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
There's all sorts of YouTubes for everything.

687
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So, go enlighten yourself if you are curious how that part works.

688
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But meanwhile, we are a video gaming podcast.

689
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So, I'm going to take it over to Loki for how was your gaming week?

690
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
This week, I played a lot of stuff on the Switch.

691
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So, I finished... I don't remember if I beat Mario Odyssey this week or last week,

692
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
but I finished Mario Odyssey, just the regular storyline.

693
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So, now it's, of course, getting all the Power Moons and everything.

694
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So, now I have all of the Power Moons in the Sand Kingdom.

695
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Actually, all but one.

696
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
One which is following this taxi around, which that's pretty super easy to get.

697
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So, I'm not worried about that right now.

698
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And then, let's see what else.

699
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I picked up a few games on the Switch as well.

700
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So, they had some sale with some of their LEGO games.

701
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And so, I picked those up.

702
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So, I've got LEGO Worlds, which my kids have been playing a lot.

703
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And that's kind of... Yeah, it's been a while since I played LEGO Worlds,

704
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
because I was in when it was in early access, when I first got released.

705
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And so, I played it back when it was just being made.

706
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And it was very early and rough around the edges.

707
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Now, it's completely different. So, I'm kind of interested in it.

708
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's all right.

709
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And of course, the LEGO Ninjago game, because that was half off as well,

710
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
because I like the movie.

711
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And what else?

712
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The Pokémon Quest game, I've been playing quite a bit of that.

713
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Pokémon GO, I've been playing more of that,

714
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
just because they've had a lot of their stone and earth types.

715
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And so, I've been trying to just level up some of the ones I don't have yet.

716
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Fucking lack of fucking shinies is driving me crazy.

717
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I have not gotten a shiny anything since...

718
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
What was the Dragon Water one?

719
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Dratini?

720
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Dratini, yeah, since Dratini. That's the last shiny that I got.

721
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Wow.

722
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And I played quite a bit. I mean, I don't know.

723
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I know, me too. I run my gacha a lot, and I'm just not getting my needs met.

724
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Yeah, so to me, I don't even know that there's shinies, because I never get them.

725
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And then what else?

726
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah, I think that's about it.

727
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I picked some stuff up on Steam. I don't remember what it was, though.

728
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It was just a Humble Bundle.

729
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So whatever that last one was, I think it was the multiplayer one.

730
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I think I wanted it just for this stick fight game, because that game's awesome.

731
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Same guy as it did, you know, the Total Epic Battle Simulator,

732
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and Cluster Trucks, and stuff like that.

733
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So I wanted to support them, and the game looks awesome.

734
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I watched some people play that.

735
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Cluster Truck is fucking fantastic.

736
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It is a great game.

737
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I lament not playing it more, but the fact that I've played it since its official release...

738
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh god, what was that? End of 2016 or something like that?

739
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Yeah, it was more like that.

740
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
All sorts of fun.

741
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But yeah, I mean, I had finished everything.

742
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The only thing I don't have on that is I haven't played the PC version enough to where I've gotten...

743
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,000
They had Halloween special levels and stuff like that that I wanted to try out, and I don't have those yet.

744
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So I had to play through that.

745
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And then I did play a little bit more Bloodstained Curse of the Moon,

746
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and I think that was it.

747
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It was mostly Switch stuff, just because it's very convenient to play that, especially after my kids go to bed,

748
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
because I just pop it off the dock and away I go.

749
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So that's been my week.

750
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Alright, Jason, you want to tell us about your gaming week?

751
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I have been eyeballing the Switch for a while.

752
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I was in San Diego in, well, April now.

753
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's June, so not last month.

754
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I was in San Diego in April, and on the way back, visited a friend of mine in Arizona that had one,

755
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and beat the entirety of Odyssey with a modicum of Power Moon chasing, finding, puzzling.

756
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I beat the entirety of the story, kind of rushed it towards the end, but I legitimately beat that game.

757
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And as I expected, everything about the Switch's design is phenomenal.

758
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You see the underpinnings of what the Wii and the Wii U brought,

759
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and they turned it into such a great presentation package.

760
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So many things that they're doing with Labo and other accessories,

761
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and all of the wireless capability of the Switch is phenomenal.

762
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
All of this I'm putting together to say, I own a Switch!

763
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So, my gaming week has been playing Odyssey on my own system,

764
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:57,000
over again doing a lot more Power Moon hunting, and that's the only retail title I owned.

765
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I've been a fan of 2020 Super Baseball since it's existed, both in arcade and on the SNES,

766
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and seeing that on the store, I picked that up immediately.

767
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I touched on Pokemon Quest just to see how it played, get a feel for those mechanics.

768
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It was kind of interesting, yeah, but getting most of the way through Odyssey again,

769
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:33,000
a little bit of downtime, my brain is wiped from the 48 hours of driving that I've been doing.

770
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Working mostly in Odyssey and Downtime, I actually read Ready Player One.

771
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That's gaming related. I hadn't read that back in the day.

772
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Did you see the movie already?

773
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yes, I caught the movie.

774
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's completely separate.

775
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, it is, but I think thematically, with the intent of the base ideas that went into the book,

776
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:14,000
they took the important bits and then made, not better references, certainly different references,

777
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
more modern references than the movie.

778
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I enjoyed the movie and I read the entire book, and that was great.

779
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Gaming Week has been reading Ready Player One, catching up on Odyssey,

780
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
a little bit of dabbling of some other stuff, some other random stuff on the store,

781
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and I think that's pretty much it.

782
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Because I'm not on a weekly basis, I have been playing Borderlands with two friends of mine

783
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,000
for quite a few months now, once a week on Sundays every week when I'm not traveling,

784
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and I have officially beaten Borderlands 2 for the first time all the way through, finally.

785
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Nice.

786
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And so we started, we were kind of back and forth between the DLC and the pre-sequel and all that kind of stuff.

787
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
We'll get to it eventually, but we're actually doing True Vault Hunter mode,

788
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
which, because I had never beaten, I never did that either,

789
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
so seeing mostly the name renames more than anything else,

790
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
but even some of the quirks of making armored racks and armored psychos

791
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and a lot of those things even worse and even harder and more frustrating to deal with has been really interesting.

792
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So Borderlands 2 for the past couple weeks with some friends of mine,

793
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
and yeah, fill in time where possible and when not traveling.

794
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Alright, well that's fun. Borderlands Friends, that's a nice little weekly thing to do.

795
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I need to play through the pre-sequel still. I'm hoping for three this year.

796
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yup, yup. I'm hoping for three.

797
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I think that's a pretty safe bet that that'll happen, but we'll see.

798
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Anyway, my Game of the Week, I'll try to keep it fast since we've had a lot of Game of the Weeks,

799
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
but I've been playing more Pokémon GO. I got my Latias so I can calm down about having my Pokédex very filled,

800
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
although one of my friends is visiting Texas right now, so he just sent me a picture.

801
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
He just caught a Corrosola, so I'm a little jealous. These region locked stupid Pokémon,

802
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
but oh well, one of these days I'll catch some region locks of my own.

803
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Let's see, I've also been playing on the Switch. I also was playing Pokémon Quest a little bit.

804
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I've been continuing in Hyrule Warriors, which I think I was playing after the show last week,

805
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and still having a good time playing that, but all these other games that are coming out that are getting my attention,

806
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
including, I finally got my code on the Switch so I could play Bloodstained Curse of the Moon on the Switch,

807
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
so I actually did a stream of that for probably a good hour, hour and a half earlier this week,

808
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and I played through like, I don't know, six or seven levels.

809
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I got all the way to the boss with the, that's kind of like the succubus girl that has little umbrellas,

810
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
like that was the last thing I beat.

811
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Yeah, so I was trying to explain it to my kids.

812
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Why is there bathtub red? I'm like, it's blood.

813
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Because it's full of heart candy, you know, I don't know, you just have to kind of, yeah.

814
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So anyway, I like, you know, especially, it's funny because as I was playing through the stream,

815
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I was like, you know, oh my god, this is just like Castlevania, this is just like Castlevania,

816
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
like these monsters are just like Castlevania.

817
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Exactly, yeah.

818
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I do like those like small little subtle things that they change, like the different candle colors,

819
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
so you know if it has a weapon in it type of thing.

820
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I really like the character switching mechanic, like the old dude that's an alchemist,

821
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
like some of his attacks are badass, like that ice thing saved my ass, I don't know how many times.

822
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So, and I remember there's even one of these boss fights I was doing.

823
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Oh yeah, it was the painting, the painting that fucking like ate one of my characters.

824
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I was like, what the fuck? The painting just like one shot at me.

825
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So I was like, fuck this, so I played the old guy and I just shot it with an ice beam,

826
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and then just walked up to him and went, beep, with the little rod and the painting shattered.

827
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I was like, well that made it easy.

828
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So anyway, I like that variance between the different characters and thought that that was really cool.

829
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And I've been playing on the simple mode, I've been playing in casual mode,

830
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
or sometimes as we call it here on the show, Bobby Black Wolf mode.

831
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's not, there's nothing wrong with it, it's just you have infinite continuous, so what?

832
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Exactly, so what? It's still the same thing.

833
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It's funny because I haven't played this game yet, I bought it and I'm going to play it after the show,

834
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and it's called Just Shapes and Beats, which is a game that Jason referenced in the introduction there.

835
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Just Shapes and Beats has been shown at conventions for like years and years now,

836
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and I remember like the Mortal Kombat theme was always like a song.

837
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Did the Mortal Kombat theme even make the final game? I don't think it did.

838
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I don't think so.

839
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I think it's just like, yeah, I think it's just like other bit tunes.

840
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I guess Bobby would know because he's been playing.

841
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It sure was a highlight, yeah.

842
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Well because everybody knows that song.

843
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
If not all three PAX outs that I've been to 2016, 2017, 2018, it was absolutely 2017 and 18,

844
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,000
and when you get kind of towards the middle of the show floor, test your mind.

845
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And so I saw it at MAGFest, I think both times I was at MAGFest I saw it, so kind of a similar thing really.

846
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I mean, I make fun of it, but you know, hats off to them for putting something, for being able to get it together,

847
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and consistently having a crowd and getting it out the door.

848
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Well anyway, the thing with that game, Just Shapes and Beats, I noticed because I haven't played it yet,

849
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
but I went through to configure the options just to make sure that when I broadcast it after the show tonight,

850
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
because Bobby and I are going to do a co-stream after the show tonight,

851
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I want to make sure that when I broadcast it, it's going to look fine.

852
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So I was going through different options, and I noticed one of them was about a casual mode,

853
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and it said something about, in this mode you have two times more health to help you basically get through the story mode and stuff,

854
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
and it said something like, there's no judgment in playing this mode, just have a good time with a little heart emoji,

855
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and I thought that was really funny, so I like that they did that.

856
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Anything that talks about a casual mode will always remind me of my Devil May Cry 3,

857
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
that I was just horrendously terrible at it, so much so that I unlocked easy mode,

858
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
and I turned off the game and never played it again.

859
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You know what, there's so many people that will go to the park and play basketball on casual mode,

860
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
or play baseball on casual mode, so you know what, sometimes you're going to play a video game on casual mode.

861
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And that's also why basketball was created, because they could just land shots all day if they just didn't have to run around all the time.

862
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Oh my god, alright.

863
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Is it the 90s yet? Have we traveled back yet?

864
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Dated reference.

865
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Bonds006 in chat says, I own the term filthy casual, I play all my games on casual.

866
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Hey, no shame in that.

867
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Well, my thought with Bloodstained 2 is that knowing it's like an 8-bit version, I'm like, it's not going to be that long of a game,

868
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
so once I play through it on casual and I beat it on casual, if I like it enough, then I'll go through and play it on normal now.

869
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And it's like, okay, now I'll kind of know what to expect, and I think I'm actually kind of glad I did it that way,

870
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
because there are things like the branching paths and the upgrades,

871
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
and there are things where I'm like, okay, I'm glad I kind of know this in advance of playing it on normal mode.

872
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I think that will help.

873
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So, anyway, that's enough for my gaming week and what I have been playing this week.

874
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
By the way, though, it did come to my memory this week.

875
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I recalled that we had talked about a Minecraft Realms for VoG.

876
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
We got distracted with all this other stuff.

877
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Oh yes, I have not forgotten.

878
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So that is something that I want us to hopefully get underway this week,

879
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
so stay tuned to our Discord for all the details over at vognetwork.com slash Discord,

880
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
and once we have something up and running, I'll be sure to post more information there,

881
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
but that is something I'd like us to do this summer for all the Minecraft players.

882
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Are we going to do survival or creative?

883
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I think we're going to do survival so that there is actually a game.

884
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I won't play then.

885
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh, but it'll be easy survival.

886
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But I don't like survival mode at all.

887
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:32,000
All right, well, creative is just, I mean, there's no reason we can't have two realms,

888
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
but if I'm paying for it, I'm going to pay for the survival realm.

889
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I'll just play by myself.

890
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
All right.

891
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Yeah, I think just with creative, it's cool because it's art on a canvas,

892
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
but I don't think there's as much.

893
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And I think when you did yours, yours was on creative, right?

894
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It started off survival, and then we just went creative

895
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
because we were going to do a lot more stuff in there.

896
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Bobby Blacko says, is there a survival peaceful where there's survival mode,

897
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
but there's no creepers?

898
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We'll look into that.

899
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Yes, you can do that.

900
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah, because creepers are fucking annoying anyway.

901
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Just no creepers specifically or is that PvP?

902
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I think you can turn PvP on and off, but I think there's a mode where it's still like,

903
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
the thing is though, in crafting mode, you have access to anything when you want.

904
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Peaceful though, I don't remember if there's animals though with peaceful.

905
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I don't remember.

906
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
We'll look into it. We'll figure it out.

907
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Creepers aren't that bad. You'll just get used to not having to deal with it.

908
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You can turn off creeper, I think where you can turn it off where the explosions don't break anything.

909
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
They just hurt you.

910
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, that's the annoying part.

911
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I think you can turn that off, I think.

912
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
We'll look into it this week.

913
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Alright, anyhow, that is enough though for our gaming weeks.

914
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
As far as announcements go, next week will be a little bit of a shorter slash different show

915
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
because E3 is going to start on Saturday and run through,

916
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
let's see, we have preferences on Sunday and then Monday,

917
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and then the actual show starts Tuesday as well as the last press conference,

918
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
or in this case Nintendo Direct, is Tuesday morning.

919
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So there will be lots and lots coming through E3,

920
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
but we'll kind of be in the midst of that when we do our show next week.

921
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
In two weeks, we will be celebrating 16 years of Orange Lawns Radio.

922
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
This show is old enough to drive right off a cliff.

923
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
That is where we're at with 16 years of Orange Lawns Radio.

924
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And then we will be off the week of the 24th.

925
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It's a good thing that this show ends in the 9 o'clock hour Pacific

926
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
because when you're 16 on your provisional license, you can't drive after 10.

927
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Oh, is that true?

928
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Depends on where you are.

929
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yeah, it depends on where you are.

930
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Is that not US-wide by now?

931
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That's not US-wide.

932
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Well, keep in mind, in Mississippi, permit age is 14.

933
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Yeah.

934
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh, wow.

935
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You get your license when you're 15,

936
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
but I don't think it's required yet to have driver's ed to get it at 15.

937
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
They've changed a lot in California.

938
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I think even when you have your license, like 16, 17, 18,

939
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
you can't have other kids in the car or something weird.

940
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
They have some really weird lawyer.

941
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yeah, those are the same rules.

942
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
At least for me, when I had my provisional license,

943
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
because I'm the youngest one in the room,

944
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
for me, when I went through the driver's license process growing up in New Mexico,

945
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
obviously, with your permit, you had to have an adult, a parent.

946
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I think it was any adult, not just a parent.

947
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But with a provisional license, you could not drive after 10 before 6

948
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
with more than one other friend.

949
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
All of these can be overridden with a parent in the car.

950
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And I think the only other requirement is that you're supposed to have,

951
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
like, 50 hours of driving by the time you get your actual license.

952
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I remember getting pulled over at 2 in the morning once when I was 16,

953
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
but I had legit, because my dad worked for the railroad,

954
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
so he was on call 24 hours a day.

955
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I had legit taken my dad to work at 1 in the morning

956
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
so I could use the car on the weekend for something else.

957
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I got pulled over, and I was by myself,

958
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
and I think the cop was more concerned with, like,

959
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
what the hell is he doing out at 2 in the morning by himself?

960
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Give me your fake ID.

961
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah, right?

962
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Just take it with you.

963
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Anyway, no, they didn't have quite those same rules when I was 16.

964
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Anyway, all right.

965
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio

966
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, magazine.

967
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Uh, let's move on.

968
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Let's talk about news.

969
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
We got gaming news to get to, starting with Loki.

970
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Let's get into news.

971
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Do we have news? Okay.

972
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
A few things.

973
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I guess we'll get to that, finally.

974
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So, we talked about how PUBG was kind of a little upset

975
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
that there was this competitor, Fortnite,

976
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
that was, you know, coming out

977
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
and just kind of taking over the market

978
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
that they had kind of built up a little bit

979
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
with the whole battle royale genre.

980
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And, you know, their complaints before were like,

981
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
well, hey, they're ripping us off

982
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
because, you know, this uses a frying pan in this game,

983
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and actually, I think this lawsuit was similar.

984
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
They were doing it against mobile games as well,

985
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
like some mobile knockoffs saying that,

986
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
oh, yeah, they use a frying pan.

987
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
They use the phrase, you know, winner, winner, chicken dinner

988
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
or some other bullshit like that,

989
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and basically the whole concept of the battle royale gameplay.

990
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Well, now they have strangely enough decided

991
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
that they're going to sue Epic Games over Fortnite.

992
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Just to put some things in perspective,

993
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm looking at Twitch right now, the rankings live on Twitch.

994
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
So, Fortnite is currently the number two ranked game on Twitch

995
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
with 224,149 viewers.

996
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
IRL is number one right now.

997
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I don't know what's going on IRL, but yeah.

998
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Fortnite is number two, and then Player Unknown Battlegrounds,

999
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
which used to be, like I would see it number one all the time, number 15.

1000
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
That is on my phone right now looking at the Twitch app.

1001
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So, I mean, their main complaint is that, you know, one,

1002
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
that it's unfair because they were licensing the, you know,

1003
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Epic's game engine to basically build their game,

1004
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
and because they were using the Unreal Engine,

1005
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
they felt that, oh, because they were familiar with our game,

1006
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
so they just straight up copied it,

1007
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
and now they're profiting off of this thing that we came up with.

1008
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I don't know. To me, it seems kind of ridiculous,

1009
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
but let them try, I guess.

1010
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
They are suing them, though, in Korea,

1011
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
which is kind of interesting that they're not doing that in the US.

1012
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I'm wondering maybe if their laws are a little bit different there,

1013
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
or what's going to count as, you know, copyright or whatever.

1014
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But, yeah, so that's something that they're doing,

1015
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and what's kind of weird, though, about that is, like, okay,

1016
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
you're suing the company that you're using their game engine.

1017
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I mean, you don't think that there's going to be any sort of negative consequence

1018
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
to doing something like that.

1019
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I mean, that doesn't seem like a very smart thing to do,

1020
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
but they're going to try, and I think they're going to fail,

1021
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
but they're going to try, and we'll see what happens,

1022
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
but ultimately they're probably going to fail.

1023
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah, I don't really see it. Well, this lawsuit is not in America.

1024
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's not. It's in Korea.

1025
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And it's just such a stretch. Like, I get it, the gameplay is similar,

1026
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
but then that's kind of going back way, way back, like,

1027
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Street Fighter clones, Doom clones.

1028
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
First off, you didn't invent the battle royale genre, one.

1029
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I mean, there were games that were out way before PUBG

1030
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
that were basically the same type of game.

1031
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And the Romans existed.

1032
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yes. Right.

1033
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
You know, like, H1Z1, King of the Kill, very similar gameplay.

1034
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And honestly, I think that would be the defense's angle right there,

1035
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
is that you didn't invent it either. Done.

1036
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Using a frying pan as a weapon in the game, not iconic to your game.

1037
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Yang did that in Final Fantasy IV, thank you, thanks to his wife.

1038
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Princess Peach did it in Super Mario RPG.

1039
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And it's been used in books.

1040
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
There you go.

1041
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I'm sorry, am I the only one that read Dragonlance?

1042
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And it's been used in the kitchen.

1043
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Exactly.

1044
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And on top of that, a lot of the assets that are used in PUBG

1045
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
are straight out of the Unreal store.

1046
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Like, there's not really a cohesive style to the game,

1047
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
whereas Fortnite has this unique art style, unique gameplay,

1048
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
there's the whole building portion of that.

1049
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It's very different.

1050
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It seems like such a stretch to try to...

1051
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
The goal of seeing that their game copied yours

1052
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
just because their game is doing better than yours right now.

1053
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Thank you, Ninja.

1054
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
You know what? Karma's gonna come up.

1055
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
It's gonna catch up to you.

1056
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And it's gonna bite you in the ass, especially when it's the company

1057
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
that you're licensing their fucking game.

1058
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I know, I was gonna say, I am really surprised

1059
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
that we have not seen Epic make a move where it's like,

1060
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
you know what, due to ongoing litigation,

1061
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
we have to suspend your license because of this litigation.

1062
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm really surprised Epic hasn't made a move like that yet.

1063
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Maybe it's coming.

1064
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Maybe that's something they could subtly do during E3

1065
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
and it might get lost with all the other news going on,

1066
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
but we'll see.

1067
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But, I mean...

1068
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I mean, the PUBG fans would certainly notice

1069
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
and make a fuss about it.

1070
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
We'll see.

1071
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm just curious to see what will happen,

1072
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
but I just think that you gotta...

1073
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
It's not a direct clone.

1074
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's not like we're seeing like,

1075
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
oh, look at this, this is a mobile game

1076
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
that looks like it's PUBG.

1077
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It's just something different.

1078
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
They're calling it something different

1079
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and copying the unique style of the game,

1080
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
but this game is very general and kind of bland looking

1081
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
and that's to its detriment, unfortunately.

1082
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yeah.

1083
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So, we'll see.

1084
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Speaking of Fortnite,

1085
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
there's rumors that it's coming to the Switch,

1086
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
and this is from a couple different sources,

1087
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
one being that there is this document posted on 4chan,

1088
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
so take that as you will,

1089
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
but allegedly it's like a leaked...

1090
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I'm bringing in the truck full of salt.

1091
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
A leaked...

1092
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,000
It's allegedly a leaked piece of material from E3

1093
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
and advertising materials, something like that,

1094
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
talking about games coming out to the Switch.

1095
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
However, there is also a second source, though,

1096
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
which is the Korean ratings board

1097
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
that mentions it on the Switch,

1098
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
so maybe that's a little bit more legit,

1099
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
but we'll see.

1100
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It wouldn't be a big jump to say that it's coming to the Switch.

1101
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I would imagine that that would do well there.

1102
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So, we'll have to wait and see what happens.

1103
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Only a couple weeks.

1104
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
All right.

1105
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Yeah, I'm pretty...

1106
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Do you think it's...

1107
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I think it's absolutely happening.

1108
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I think it's legit.

1109
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Yeah.

1110
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I don't see why not.

1111
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
All right.

1112
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Yeah, Dark Tetsuya says,

1113
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
normally I wouldn't put a lot of stock in that rumor,

1114
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
but the Korean rating board thing is interesting.

1115
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Well, also, if you think about Nintendo,

1116
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
it's a good way to sell that,

1117
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
hey, multiplayer pass.

1118
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Oh, good point.

1119
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Good point.

1120
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Nintendo is trying to load up

1121
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
on all the stuff that's multiplayer online.

1122
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Although, games go on PC and play it for free,

1123
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
but, you know...

1124
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And you can't stream Fortnite as easily from the Switch.

1125
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I mean, well, I mean, if you have a card like I do,

1126
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
it's super easy, but, you know,

1127
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
not as built in.

1128
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Anyway.

1129
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
All right, well, over on the Microsoft side of things,

1130
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Microsoft taking a little heat this week

1131
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
because they have laid off Xbox support staff,

1132
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and the new plan for folks that need Xbox support

1133
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
used volunteers from the Xbox Ambassadors program.

1134
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Now, well, before you go too crazy with this,

1135
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
it's not like they closed their whole call center

1136
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
or anything like this.

1137
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Here's what actually happened.

1138
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Microsoft let go of 12 people from the Xbox support teams.

1139
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It's not like the entire existence of their support staff.

1140
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But, I mean, it's still worth noting,

1141
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
like, they let paid people go

1142
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
to basically have volunteers do what they were doing.

1143
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It sounds like a lot of these folks

1144
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
were inquiries that went to Twitter.

1145
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It's like, you know how Xbox has a pretty active Twitter account

1146
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
that will help people that are complaining about different things?

1147
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It sounds like a lot of the staff came from this area.

1148
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
So Xbox Ambassadors now will be the ones

1149
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
that will be able to help.

1150
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
They will earn points and get entered into competitions

1151
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
for a chance to win prizes.

1152
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So, apparently, too, just to put salt in the wound, I guess,

1153
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Microsoft asked the staff,

1154
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
the staff that they ended up letting go,

1155
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
to train Xbox Ambassadors and increase their input,

1156
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
which is always a little bit of a red flag.

1157
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I mean, sometimes, you know, cross training is inevitable

1158
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
no matter what industry you do.

1159
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But sometimes if it's like, wow,

1160
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I'm showing every function of my job to somebody else,

1161
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
that may not always be the best sign.

1162
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Every case is different, I suppose,

1163
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
but certainly that was probably the first sign

1164
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
that something's up there.

1165
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Anyway, Microsoft, of course, is not specifically responding

1166
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
on anything about the layoffs specifically,

1167
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
but in an interview that they did with the big gaming website,

1168
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
they said that we continue to have a number

1169
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
of highly trained customer support agents

1170
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
plus community ambassadors available to help customers

1171
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
with their needs.

1172
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's never good to skimp on your communication anywhere,

1173
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
but I feel like Twitter, being such a first line,

1174
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
is an especially bad place to get rid of

1175
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
full-time, compensated, you know, talented individuals

1176
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
and open it up to any aspect of community management.

1177
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Maybe. I don't know.

1178
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
That particular role strikes me as a little...

1179
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
That particular medium for the role strikes me

1180
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
as a little strange.

1181
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Bobby and Chad confirming they had an active Twitter account,

1182
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
they've stopped responding pretty much altogether,

1183
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
so it sounds like pretty much anybody who was using that Twitter

1184
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
was probably part of this.

1185
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So, you know, that's unfortunate for those guys.

1186
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
What? Who messes with tweets to one account doesn't scale?

1187
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm surprised.

1188
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
But...

1189
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Well, I mean, I kind of thought Microsoft

1190
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
would have learned this lesson before

1191
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
about what happens when you dial back on community engagement.

1192
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
You get something like the Xbox One unveiling.

1193
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Now, granted, I realize this is a different scenario

1194
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
because we're talking a little more like support and help,

1195
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
but still, like, I'm a little surprised to hear

1196
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
that Microsoft wants to cut corners

1197
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
because I feel like that has not benefited them in the past.

1198
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But no one plays games anymore.

1199
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Everyone's watching TV and sports and sports

1200
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
and TV and TV TV.

1201
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Well, I mean, but if they can't...

1202
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Here's the thing, though.

1203
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
If people can't figure out how to fix their Xboxes

1204
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and they're complaining about it on Twitter

1205
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and nobody is, like, actively helping them,

1206
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
then they're going to continue to complain to their friends

1207
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
and the other people they follow on Twitter.

1208
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I mean, I just always felt like

1209
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
when Microsoft is, like, actively seeking out

1210
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
the people having problems with Xbox stuff

1211
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
and they're replying to them,

1212
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
they're trying to cut these issues off

1213
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
before they grow and they escalate

1214
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
and they turn into,

1215
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
now I'm going to tell all my friends about

1216
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
how shitty, you know, Microsoft is, you know?

1217
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I don't know.

1218
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
At the end of the day,

1219
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
will this have a gigantic impact on things?

1220
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I don't know, but, hmm.

1221
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So, anyhow, Bobby is also kind of saying, like,

1222
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
they had several Twitter accounts,

1223
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
like Xbox Support One and Two,

1224
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
but basically they replaced those accounts

1225
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
with ambassadors' personal accounts

1226
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
that use the hashtag, hashtag XboxAmbassadors.

1227
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Wow.

1228
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Rageinator says, I'll help you right now.

1229
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Did you try turning your system off

1230
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
and then not back on again?

1231
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Oh, that should just be,

1232
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
there should be a Twitter robot.

1233
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
How many flashing lights do you see?

1234
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Oh, my God, this would be a genius Twitter robot.

1235
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
You ready?

1236
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Whenever somebody writes a complaint to Xbox Support,

1237
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
it just automatically replies,

1238
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
have you tried turning it off and then on again?

1239
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Hashtag XboxAmbassadors.

1240
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Hashtag XboxIp.

1241
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I think that's funny.

1242
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I think that's hilarious.

1243
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Hashtag the XboxCrowd, the XCrowd.

1244
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Let's see.

1245
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
SS2100Matt says, they were pretty hush-hush

1246
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
about that hacking problem you had back in the day, Rob.

1247
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
That was before,

1248
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
the hacking problem was before their Twitter.

1249
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
The 990 gig thing that came up,

1250
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I think they did try to reach out to me on Twitter,

1251
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
but they, like, couldn't help me.

1252
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
They couldn't figure it out.

1253
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
They, like, couldn't help me.

1254
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
They couldn't figure out what the hell the problem was.

1255
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So it was weird.

1256
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Yeah, they didn't really want to, like, admit anything.

1257
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
So it was kind of weird there.

1258
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Anyway.

1259
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
So that's something that's happening.

1260
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So, you know, if you have strong feelings about that,

1261
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I suppose you could tweet Microsoft,

1262
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
but I'm not sure it's going to change anything.

1263
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So just hopefully this doesn't lead to a series of more bad decisions.

1264
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
If you tweet at a support account and nobody's there to read it,

1265
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
did you really say anything at all?

1266
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Maybe I'll send that tweet right now to Xbox support.

1267
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I'm surprised that we're not having Cortana field these tech questions.

1268
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Make sure to hashtag your question.

1269
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
That could be the robot.

1270
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
That could be the robot.

1271
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
But instead of, like, Cortana, it's like,

1272
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
God, what is that web series with Donard Duck and,

1273
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
you know what I'm talking about, Darcy.

1274
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
The Rupaz drag rez.

1275
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Like, all the, like, gooby is based off, like, a Disney thing with gooby

1276
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
and Donard Duck and stuff.

1277
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Oh, yeah.

1278
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Right, okay.

1279
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Somebody knows what I'm talking about.

1280
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Or Miss Effect.

1281
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Yeah, yes.

1282
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Like, that whole thing, yes.

1283
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
There should be, like, a core Cortana or something.

1284
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Core Ann.

1285
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Core Ann.

1286
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Perfect.

1287
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Core Ann is the boss.

1288
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Is the boss that just replies to everybody going,

1289
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
have you tried turning it off and then on again?

1290
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Yeah.

1291
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Core Ann.

1292
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And the Avatar is just a picture of Courtney Cox from Friends,

1293
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
but, like, dyed blue.

1294
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
We live in the modern age of the internet where that is something

1295
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
that could be possible.

1296
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
That's it.

1297
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Gooby Dolan.

1298
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Dolan, Dolan, that was it.

1299
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Thank you, Act F.

1300
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You win.

1301
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
You know what I'm talking about.

1302
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
All right.

1303
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Sorry, I'm in love with this idea.

1304
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Like, does anyone know how to program a Twitter bot?

1305
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Like, Bobby, I know there's so much work to be done at Vodka Network,

1306
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
but do you know how to make a Twitter bot?

1307
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Jason, do you know how to make a Twitter bot?

1308
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I could look something up.

1309
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
This is Gaming Adjacent, so.

1310
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
We need Core Ann to happen.

1311
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Gaming Adjacent.

1312
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
All right.

1313
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Meanwhile, let's get into some other stories.

1314
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Dark Saga.

1315
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Oh, this one made me angry and then made my heart warm.

1316
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So, there is a streamer who goes by Ann Munition.

1317
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:28,000
She plays some of the war games like, was it Rainbow Six

1318
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
and a few of the other ones like that, PUBG, God of War, Overwatch.

1319
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
She was playing Rainbow Six offline with a bunch of guys,

1320
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
and then they didn't know who she was, and she was a pretty big streamer.

1321
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
So, when they asked if she was a woman, she said yes.

1322
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And the moment she confirmed it,

1323
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
they laid into her with some really hateful shit,

1324
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
like calling her, you know, you try to use gamer girl like it's an insult,

1325
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
and then called her, and this is a quote

1326
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
because I would never use this term, a tranny bitch.

1327
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And then said, we're not treating you like this,

1328
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
we're not being like this because we don't like women,

1329
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
we're being like this because you're shit.

1330
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And the same person telling her, I hope you die.

1331
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And all she did the whole stream was just play the game,

1332
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
play square, called the shots when they need it,

1333
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
when she would do well, they said she was kill stealing,

1334
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
and then when she died, they would just fuss at her for it.

1335
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
So she saved the whole thing and uploaded it.

1336
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Uploaded, made it public, called them all the fuck out.

1337
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And one of the players went back and said,

1338
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I'm extremely sorry for the way you feel.

1339
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Which is number one, the bullshit, I'm sorry you feel that way.

1340
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
No, it should have been, I'm sorry for being human garbage.

1341
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And he said, you know the words I use,

1342
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
we're meaningless and have no substance.

1343
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And her response was, I appreciate that you wanted to apologize,

1344
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
but man, you went hard just because you heard a woman's voice.

1345
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
You called me a fucking tranny bitch and told me to kill myself over nothing.

1346
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
All I did was exist.

1347
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And she's like, and I'm going to read this quote here,

1348
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I don't necessarily want to crucify people.

1349
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
When I feel there's a potential for them to walk away from the subject thinking,

1350
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
wow, I messed up.

1351
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I did something really awful and it came back to bite me, I won't do it again.

1352
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,000
But, and she's basically like, yeah, there's consequences for this.

1353
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Which actually, I am super inspired by this,

1354
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
to the point that I want to go out and play these games,

1355
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
and catch people in the act, and go public with their names.

1356
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I just, this kind of begs the question, like why, I don't know what platform she's,

1357
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I mean if she's playing these on PC, then unfortunately the downside of PC

1358
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
is a little bit more of a no man's land.

1359
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
There's no moderation is my point.

1360
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I'm not saying it makes it right, I'm absolutely not saying that,

1361
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm just saying it's harder to moderate.

1362
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
But if she's playing these games on Xbox Live, or PlayStation Network,

1363
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
or Nintendo, you know, which these games aren't.

1364
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Rainbow Six on Nintendo, please.

1365
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
They can't do that.

1366
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
No, she's playing on PC it looks like.

1367
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
But my point is, Nintendo would have the same responsibility no matter what.

1368
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Okay, then sadly, you know, because my question...

1369
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
But those games themselves, their rooms should be moderated.

1370
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
That's true, the game makers should be doing something,

1371
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
because somebody is kind of hosting those servers.

1372
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
My, I guess my question at the end of the day is like,

1373
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
why aren't these fuckers getting banned, or dealt with, you know,

1374
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
because like, look, I've had my share of completely unpleasant matches in Overwatch,

1375
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
and I just play Quick Play for fuck's sake.

1376
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And I've seen people be really fucking mean in Overwatch.

1377
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And it's like, and it is PC, so Blizzard thankfully has, you know,

1378
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
they've committed to trying to do some better stuff.

1379
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
But they're saying it's taking away from the development of future stuff,

1380
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
like they're having to deviate, I know that's kind of where my head is at.

1381
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Hire more people.

1382
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Yeah, right.

1383
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Be less shitty.

1384
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Don't outsource to Xbox ambassadors.

1385
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Oh no, we'll get less, we'll get less, you know, Overwatch skins.

1386
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
The whole thing, to go back to the point, is,

1387
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
and she also goes on record saying,

1388
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I'm sick of sweeping this behavior under the rug and pretending it's all fine and dandy.

1389
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It's easy to sweep things under the rug, it's harder to ask people to be better.

1390
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Especially when so many people are just resigned to accept the fact that

1391
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
online gaming and toxicity goes hand in hand.

1392
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
To go back to what you were saying about playing on PC.

1393
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It shouldn't go hand in hand.

1394
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And honestly enough, I want to hold these people accountable.

1395
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I want to fucking hold them responsible.

1396
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I want people to know that these people are garbage.

1397
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And if you see these tags, ostracize them.

1398
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Let me ask this tough question though,

1399
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,000
as much like I get that from an immediate, I feel like some justice has been done in this scenario,

1400
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
but at the end of the day, what does that really change for those people?

1401
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
These people need to lose their privilege of being able to play the game online.

1402
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And unfortunately, you can't do that.

1403
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
At the very least, just like we had that one person go back and say,

1404
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I'm sorry that I was that way.

1405
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Well, he clearly got some shit over it.

1406
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Or he probably wouldn't have apologized.

1407
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
People like that don't apologize until they're fucking caught.

1408
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And when they're caught, like all these, you know, asshole men who are being accused of harassment,

1409
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
and they're like, oh, I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah.

1410
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah, you got caught, bitch.

1411
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
More of them need to get caught and made a public example of.

1412
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I just don't understand why, like I get it.

1413
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
You don't understand because it doesn't happen to you.

1414
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Okay, let's not do this.

1415
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Let's not.

1416
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
You didn't let him finish his thought, to be fair.

1417
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Yeah, well, I get interrupted all the time.

1418
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
All right, finish your thought, Logie.

1419
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
No, what I understand is like, I get it, there's dicks out there online.

1420
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I mean, but there's also functions to mute them as well.

1421
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And I get it, yeah, maybe one gender gets it more than the other,

1422
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
but you can also just mute them and block them and then that's the end of that.

1423
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
You shouldn't have to, especially when you are playing a cooperative game

1424
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
and you need to fucking hear what the other people are doing,

1425
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
or else it's not a very cooperative game.

1426
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Yeah, I got to agree with that.

1427
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
In a co-op sense, like when you're muting somebody, it's harming the game

1428
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
because maybe the other team isn't having garbage.

1429
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Here's my thing.

1430
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Here's what I honestly think needs to happen is what the decent individuals,

1431
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and I think, you know, the men in this room would consider themselves decent individuals.

1432
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Yes, they're all decent.

1433
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I think many of the men listening are very decent individuals and so forth.

1434
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So here's my thing is that the other thing that kind of blows my mind in this scenario

1435
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
that happened with this gal that was playing online is that when these comments were made,

1436
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
nobody said anything there and then.

1437
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And I'm not saying she has to always be the one to do it.

1438
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Why didn't any of the other bros say, dude, not cool, it's 2018, grow the fuck up.

1439
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Because they are equally garbage.

1440
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Or chicken shit, you know.

1441
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And that's my thing is that I think it's up to the other people.

1442
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It's just like, you know, when we talk about some of these greater complications in society,

1443
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:05,000
you know, so forth, usually it takes that person in the position of privilege, so to speak, to call out.

1444
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Because the unfortunate thing is it doesn't always happen when the oppressed is calling out.

1445
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
It takes the person from the position of privilege to say, hey, wait a minute, this shit needs to stop.

1446
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,000
In order for change to like for people to kind of, you know, the oppressor to stop and think about what they're doing.

1447
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Does that make sense?

1448
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,000
But anyone who is so weak willed as to go along with it is part of the problem.

1449
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:35,000
They are equally, they are complicit in this behavior, even if they sat there and quietly said nothing.

1450
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Now, she was taking the high road because she was the one being targeted.

1451
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
She kept, and I think it was because, you know, she was recording this too publicly out them.

1452
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
She had to be the one to play it straight.

1453
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And kudos to her for calling it out, for making it public.

1454
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Because we need more people to stand up and make it public and hold these people accountable.

1455
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I have to admit, though, you know, I'm looking at Bobby in our chat room.

1456
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I'm quoting him a lot tonight, but he's saying some good stuff.

1457
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And honestly, I have to be honest, I'm in a similar place to where Bobby's at because something that Bobby says,

1458
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
that's why I never play online.

1459
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I have better things to do in my time rather than be in a place with people being assholes.

1460
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
My time is more valuable than that.

1461
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I have to kind of agree.

1462
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
That's why I don't play a lot of these games online.

1463
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:27,000
But also taking yourself out of that situation doesn't help alleviate it either.

1464
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
It contributes again to the problem because they're pushing out the people who are talking against them

1465
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
who aren't willing to take a stand.

1466
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah, but I sort of feel like I don't want to jump in this garbage pool in the first place.

1467
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
This is part of the reason why I don't like to go on Xbox Live with non-friends.

1468
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I kind of feel like, you know, Microsoft kind of needs to moderate this.

1469
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
The people that are interested, maybe if that gets better, maybe I'll consider going in in the future.

1470
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
But otherwise, it's a waste of my time.

1471
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Look at it in terms of history.

1472
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Let's say that it's in the 60s during the protests against Vietnam.

1473
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
A lot of people said, I don't want to be involved in this.

1474
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Okay, hold up though. Hold up though.

1475
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I know where you're going with this thought.

1476
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So I'm just going to say, does this mean you're going to start playing Rainbow Six online?

1477
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I might.

1478
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I will be very interested to see if you stick with that.

1479
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I have to put my money where my mouth is.

1480
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I mean, I have to practice a little bit and actually be good enough to play online.

1481
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
But I mean, if that's what it comes to, I would do it.

1482
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
You know, that's why I'm an activist and other things that are important to me.

1483
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
You can't just...

1484
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It's...

1485
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Real heart, what is it?

1486
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
The true evil is when good men do nothing.

1487
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.

1488
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
That's the quote.

1489
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So if you do nothing, it's going to persist.

1490
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
If you want things to change, if you don't like how something is,

1491
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
you have to get in the middle of it and you have to fucking make it change.

1492
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Nothing changes until you make it change.

1493
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Even if you die without seeing the change,

1494
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
you got in there and made the fight, and that means that the next generation to pick it up

1495
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
is going to take up where you left off.

1496
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
That's why, I mean, if we want to look...

1497
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I know it's just a game, you know, playing games online,

1498
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
but look at it in the higher context.

1499
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
You know, if you're willing to take a step out for this,

1500
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
you know, an easy thing,

1501
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
what's to say that there won't be a bigger, you know,

1502
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
that when it comes time for a bigger stand,

1503
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
that the same behavior might not happen

1504
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
because it's easier to just take yourself out of the equation.

1505
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
We have some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1506
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Shehulk says, I've met a lot of cool people online playing games,

1507
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
but every once in a while a person cheats or is a loser.

1508
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I block them forever.

1509
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
ActDeft in chat says, and people complain.

1510
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Splatoon 2 not having proper voice chat.

1511
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
To be fair, ActDeft, like, I think when that topic has come up,

1512
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I think there is certainly some complaining in that regard,

1513
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
but then there's also that whole, like,

1514
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
well, if it was there, would I use it anyway?

1515
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I don't know.

1516
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
And then Bonds006 says, I want to play Dark Sakura.

1517
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Team OLR on RB6.

1518
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So, hey, you might have some good dudes.

1519
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
That means I have to actually buy the game.

1520
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Or it doesn't necessarily have to be that game.

1521
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Believe me, there's lots of toxic games out there.

1522
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
There's other games that I can play that I'd be good at.

1523
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Don't you already own Overwatch?

1524
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
It makes me motion sick.

1525
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Fortnite. It's third person.

1526
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I could do Fortnite.

1527
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
That might be a great place to start.

1528
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
But Fortnite's a good candidate too.

1529
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I'll do Fortnite. No problem.

1530
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I bet there's a lot of people that would love to play Fortnite with you.

1531
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I just, you know...

1532
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
It's...

1533
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Oh, God. I'm just...

1534
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It's something that's very... Activism itself...

1535
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I get it, girl. Let it out.

1536
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
...is very near and dear to my heart. Sure.

1537
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And when I see people not willing to fix something,

1538
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
but they're willing to complain about it,

1539
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
you can't complain about shit

1540
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
if you're not going to fucking do something about it.

1541
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's like voting.

1542
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
If you don't vote, you have no right to complain.

1543
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I just, I think in this particular case,

1544
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
it's more complicated than that, because from my perspective,

1545
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Jamie, you're saying you need to play this game

1546
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
that you have no interest in playing.

1547
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
It's not the no interest in playing thing.

1548
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
It's people play the games,

1549
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
but they don't put themselves in that environment.

1550
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And I can understand keeping yourself out of something

1551
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
if you just don't enjoy it.

1552
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
But the fact of the matter is that

1553
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
when you know that there's a group out there

1554
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
who wants to enjoy the game online in that capacity,

1555
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and you could be in a position to help them enjoy that game,

1556
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
why aren't you helping?

1557
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I would say, though, in some cases,

1558
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
especially MMOs are the thing that's near and dear to me,

1559
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and I have been the type to, you know,

1560
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I kind of give it back to them in MMOs,

1561
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
because my character's a sassy little lala

1562
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
that when somebody mouths off, I mouth her off back to them.

1563
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I do it in WoW.

1564
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
When I'm playing WoW and I have a piece of shit

1565
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
in one of my parties, I vote kick them.

1566
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So there are places.

1567
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And I post screenshots.

1568
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
But I think just when it comes to stuff like this Rainbow Six

1569
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
and all this stuff, it's like, that's just a pool

1570
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I am not interested in jumping in.

1571
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And I would just hope that maybe some of the dudes in there,

1572
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
because there probably are a lot of decent dudes

1573
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
that are playing Rainbow Six,

1574
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
can kind of be the ones to start that change.

1575
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Because there are so many games out there,

1576
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
and the industry is so huge,

1577
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
that change is going to have to come from multiple angles anyway.

1578
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I totally am planning on going ahead

1579
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
and hopping in on games that I like.

1580
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And I'm going to stream them,

1581
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
and I'm not going to tell them I'm streaming them.

1582
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Because why do they have to know if I'm streaming it?

1583
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I'll wait until the game's done, and they'll say,

1584
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
watch the stream of your behavior at this.

1585
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Because I'm ready to start calling these fuckers out.

1586
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Bonds006 says,

1587
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
we need to have an official OLR online game squad team group, etc.

1588
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Let's make it happen.

1589
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Or at least at the level of VOG, too.

1590
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
We've been talking about that for a while.

1591
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
We need the OLR me, or the VOG thing.

1592
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
But the other thing, too, is that

1593
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
it's something I've already been doing on social media,

1594
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
like Facebook.

1595
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
If I've gotten a message from someone being scum,

1596
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
and thankfully I haven't gotten any yet,

1597
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
because some of these people have learned,

1598
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I've posted it, I've gone and found their parents

1599
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
and sent them links to how their children are behaving,

1600
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I got apologies real quick.

1601
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Because I don't care if you're going to be shit.

1602
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I'm going to call you on being shit. Sorry.

1603
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I am not going to sit here quietly and let people...

1604
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
And some people on Facebook do need a spanking.

1605
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
But I'm not going to sit here quietly

1606
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and let myself be an oppressed party.

1607
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Fuck you. I'm going to stand up for myself.

1608
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Bonn 2006 in chat says we can each do our bit,

1609
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
as Jamie is saying.

1610
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Yes.

1611
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Alright. Anyway. Let's move on.

1612
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
We've got lots more gaming news.

1613
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
We're an hour and a half into part A.

1614
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Let's try to get the rest of this gaming news.

1615
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
But it's good stuff tonight. Loki, what do you have for us?

1616
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
So this is kind of cool. I watched this video,

1617
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and it's basically this guy who...

1618
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
He actually hacked...

1619
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Most people, when they emulate stuff,

1620
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
you're thinking like you're emulating the hardware

1621
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
and running the ROMs like NES emulator.

1622
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
We're taking emulating hardware,

1623
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
we dump the ROMs and we run it

1624
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
so that it runs on fake hardware, basically.

1625
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Well, this guy, programmed by the name of Tom Murphy,

1626
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
otherwise he's known online as Tom7,

1627
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
he worked on a slightly different route.

1628
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Instead of emulating the NES, he emulated the cartridges.

1629
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
So basically what he did is he threw in a Raspberry Pi 3 Mini

1630
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
inside of a cartridge,

1631
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
and he got it to interact with the cartridge slot

1632
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
in a way that he was able to output to the NES.

1633
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
And so he outputted this presentation that he made,

1634
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
and he even outputted Super Mario World

1635
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
in an SNES emulator running on an NES.

1636
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Which is pretty awesome.

1637
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So, really neat, but...

1638
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I think he has the code online to actually try that as well.

1639
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
But, really cool.

1640
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Alright, so how can I do that at my house?

1641
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I guess you have to have a Raspberry Pi 3 and be very smart.

1642
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Because you have to completely wire a cartridge or something like that, right?

1643
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Yeah, basically he wired the output from the Raspberry Pi 3

1644
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
to the cartridge slots to work...

1645
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It went very in-depth in the video, so definitely check it out online.

1646
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
His YouTube account...

1647
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Let's see here...

1648
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Looks like it's like Ampersand or it's...

1649
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Yeah, Tom7 is what he's...

1650
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Oh, Suckerpinch is his name on YouTube.

1651
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
So he's looking for Suckerpinch.

1652
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I think it is kind of a neat concept, though.

1653
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
So, DarkTusuya says, I watched the whole video. It was amazing.

1654
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah, so he has a making of the reverse NES emulation process.

1655
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
And it was interesting because he basically talked about how the cartridges worked and everything.

1656
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And how he had to make his own security chip and everything.

1657
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It was just really interesting.

1658
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And just being that you can use a Raspberry Pi to do that.

1659
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Pretty awesome.

1660
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Alright, well, let's get into talk about some E3 leaks

1661
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
and some things that are getting announced a little bit in advance of E3.

1662
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
So, Assassin's Creed Odyssey has apparently been confirmed thanks to a keyring.

1663
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
That's right, there was a keyring that showed up.

1664
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I don't know if it was on a shelf or what the deal was.

1665
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
But apparently the merchandise was posted by a French site.

1666
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
A little collectible that showed Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

1667
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,000
The little logo and a little Greek Spartan helmet on a keychain.

1668
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So, this led the official Assassin's Creed account to then tweet a couple days ago.

1669
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
See you at E3 with an official little quick teaser there.

1670
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
So, certainly this was kind of a spoiled announcement, I think.

1671
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
But at the same time, is it a shock that there's a new Assassin's Creed game coming?

1672
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
No, they said that they were doing one this year, I think.

1673
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
So, that's not a shock.

1674
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Maybe the Greek thing is a little bit of a surprise.

1675
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,000
But, hey, since God of War went to the Nordic gods this time, if I'm not mistaken.

1676
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Well, they've been mixing it up.

1677
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I mean, they did the whole pirate thing for a while.

1678
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
They did Ancient Egypt last time, so now Greece.

1679
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Sure, they're just mixing it up.

1680
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I was still waiting for Feudal Japan.

1681
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I know they had the spin-off Assassin's Creed that was like that, but that was more of a 2D game.

1682
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I'd be more interested in the actual Feudal Japan one.

1683
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Having not played the Assassin's Creed series, it makes me feel very strange.

1684
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
The sheer number of Assassin's Creed games I have in my library on my Xbox One.

1685
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Because, what, three of them have been games with gold?

1686
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Yeah, I think one of them is right now.

1687
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Yeah, it was. Second half of May.

1688
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It was a game series I could just never get into.

1689
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Like, I purchased the first Assassin's Creed and I just like...

1690
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I haven't never been into Assassin's Creed.

1691
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I played two hours of the first one and it just didn't grab me.

1692
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And then two, three, four, Black Flag, China.

1693
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
But some people love them. It's just different.

1694
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It might be just so many, so fast.

1695
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And it could be just that style of gameplay, because Dishonored is the same thing for me.

1696
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I can't get into Dishonored either, and I tried with that.

1697
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
It's a similar type of gameplay, that stealth action type stuff.

1698
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
That's me in Monster Hunter. I feel like Monster Hunter is a game I should really be into and love.

1699
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
And I have so many friends that are super into it, but I've tried it and I'm not feeling this the same way.

1700
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I don't know what it is. I'm just not feeling it.

1701
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
But that's different.

1702
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Different games for different people.

1703
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Different jokes for different folks.

1704
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I suppose, if you want to put it that way.

1705
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Anyway, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us in the news?

1706
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Oh, I have some stuff.

1707
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
You know, last week we talked about that game, Active Shooter,

1708
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:48,000
where you play as either the police responding to an active shooter or the shooter itself, going into a school.

1709
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Well, the online petition has been successful.

1710
01:32:52,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And Valve has taken the game off of the Steam store.

1711
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Also because the developer has a history of bad behavior.

1712
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:18,000
But it also, of course, gained some pretty big attention after two of the families that had students killed in the February attack in Parkland

1713
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:24,000
said it was despicable and horrific and really called them out for it.

1714
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Steam got some really bad PR over this by folks who had been involved in either school superintendents or people involved in the education system or local law enforcement.

1715
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Really started calling them out, so Steam jumped in and said, nope, it's gone.

1716
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:52,000
So they emailed the media and said that it was taken down ahead of the June 6th release.

1717
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And the developer, who is calling himself Ata Berdyev, has a history of being a troll, abusing customers and publishing copyrighted material and doing user review manipulation.

1718
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So they're not going to do business with people who act that way toward their customers.

1719
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:21,000
He's an asset flipper, so he's been known to do a lot of really shitty games that have been on Steam.

1720
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:30,000
The one that got him in trouble last time was he put up a Pickled Rick game, which of course rips off Rick and Morty.

1721
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:37,000
But he's done several other asset flip games on there and then basically manipulated systems to try to get him.

1722
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
He kept coming back on there.

1723
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
It wasn't him this time publishing it, but it was him and his friend, I guess, publishing it.

1724
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And they just found out because he used the same bank account as his other companies that he has the same dude.

1725
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Well, someone who said his name was Arthur Belkin says that Ata was his friend and that the games were his.

1726
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:03,000
So he's waiting for Steam to reply, but basically it needs to be taken down anyway.

1727
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Nah, he's not coming back.

1728
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Well, never say never.

1729
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Next time he'll come back wearing glasses and a suit and he'll just look different.

1730
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
But also this guy said that everything was bad sarcasm.

1731
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Sorry, but English is my third language. No.

1732
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Yeah, that's not really an excuse for the game though.

1733
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
No, you're... bye bitch.

1734
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Yeah, some of those things say it all in every language.

1735
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Hold the garbage accountable.

1736
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

1737
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Yes, so there was another announcement that was teased with a very long Twitch stream of a screen and a bobblehead.

1738
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
But finally Fallout 76 was announced.

1739
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And it's not clear exactly what the game's going to be about aside from Vault 76.

1740
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:57,000
But that there's been some artwork that they're painting down in LA.

1741
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Because traditionally when E3 rolls around they tend to paint artwork on that one...

1742
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I don't know if it's like a hotel building or something like that that's right there.

1743
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Oh, it's everything in that area. Like, you know, the banners go up on the convention center itself.

1744
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
The nearby hotels, parking lots, all the buses.

1745
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
The picture that they have for it though has multiple Vault boys on there.

1746
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So the thought is that it's a co-op or online type of game but they haven't really said what it was yet.

1747
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Doesn't mean that they're stopping from taking pre-orders of course.

1748
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Before we even know what the hell the game's about.

1749
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Yeah, it's coming.

1750
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
And then of course the game is under development by Bethesda Game Studios.

1751
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And then also a company, Battlecry Studios, is working on it as well.

1752
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,000
So it'll be interesting to see. And I guess we're going to find out about it in June 10th.

1753
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
For sure.

1754
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
We can hardly wait.

1755
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Yeah, I'm excited for E3 too.

1756
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Especially because it seems like there's all these big games.

1757
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And obviously Fallout is another one of those things.

1758
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I personally don't super get into Fallout because I own Fallout 3.

1759
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And I just never really like super...

1760
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
You have Fallout 4.

1761
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Oh, no idea. I have Fallout 4. I get them all confused.

1762
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I have Fallout 3 and I have Fallout 4.

1763
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And I think I have another Fallout 2.

1764
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:19,000
But anyway, I can't get into them the same way I get into Elder Scrolls.

1765
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
You should. It's really good.

1766
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I know. I know. It's so weird.

1767
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Anyway, I'll be curious about this new one.

1768
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
But I mean, just between this and Borderlands.

1769
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I'm going to be more into Borderlands than Fallout.

1770
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
But it's been a long time.

1771
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I've been getting that itch to play Borderlands again.

1772
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Well, I think a lot of people are getting there too.

1773
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So, alright.

1774
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Well, maybe you've got the itch for a classic video game.

1775
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,000
And get this, apparently Intellivision is going to be making a comeback.

1776
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Now, I know Intellivision...

1777
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
They've done the Intellivision Lives and they have an Intellivision Flashback.

1778
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I actually own the Intellivision Flashback.

1779
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Like they have Atari Flashback and so forth.

1780
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
But Intellivision is kind of going through another sort of shift, if you will.

1781
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
And it's thanks to Tommy Tallarico.

1782
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Who we actually had on this show years ago in Video Games Live.

1783
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I'm Facebook buddies with him and he's been posting these cryptic hints.

1784
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And then finally he's like, here's the news.

1785
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Really? He didn't accept my friend request and I tried to add him.

1786
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Or he had hit his limit.

1787
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I think it is the time my friend requested him.

1788
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
So, anyway. I'm not his friend. But you guys are. That's alright.

1789
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
So, here's the deal.

1790
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Is that Tommy has apparently acquired the rights to Intellivision.

1791
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,000
So, Intellivision Entertainment is going to be now the name of the company.

1792
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
And Tallarico did a little interview about this.

1793
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Of course, he's not just the musician who did Video Games Live.

1794
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
But he has done video game development as well before.

1795
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And of course he's done, you know, TV and some commentary due to that.

1796
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Of course, Intellivision Productions came from Keith Robinson.

1797
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Who unfortunately passed away in 2017.

1798
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Which, you know, I remember meeting Keith Robinson years ago at an E3.

1799
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Around the time, I think, Intellivision Lives was coming out on like the Xbox or something.

1800
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Or the Xbox 360.

1801
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
The Xbox.

1802
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
It was like the original Xbox, yeah.

1803
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I think.

1804
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
So, yeah.

1805
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Well, no, no, no. That would have been like...

1806
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
It may have been both.

1807
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Because the Xbox 360 was out because we were playing...

1808
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Yeah, I feel like it came out on 360 and like PS3.

1809
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I feel like it came out on...

1810
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
So like there was that whole little collection there.

1811
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I think I...

1812
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Did they bring my 360?

1813
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I know I was playing...

1814
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Because that was the year that they did demos for like the E3 stuff.

1815
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
So they had...

1816
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Lost Planet, I think, was one of the demos that you could play.

1817
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Before, you know, it was the same one that was on the show floor.

1818
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
MXC says it was PS2 and Xbox that that came out on.

1819
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
So I guess it was kind of a little bit of an older game.

1820
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
But I feel like they were doing...

1821
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
They were trying to do more stuff with later games.

1822
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
But anyway.

1823
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
So Intellivision Entertainment is out.

1824
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And so they are looking at doing a new Intellivision console.

1825
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
But Tommy Tallarico kind of wants to take a different approach.

1826
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Doesn't want to necessarily do the same thing that like the Atari relaunch is doing,

1827
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
which we'll talk about in the second half of the show tonight.

1828
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
But Tommy said in an interview,

1829
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I see a huge gaping hole in the market now with families in the home.

1830
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
We will be focused.

1831
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
We will not try to compete with Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.

1832
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
That would be insane.

1833
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
And we would need one billion.

1834
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So they're going to come out with more details on October 1st.

1835
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
There's also a new website you can get into as well.

1836
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
So it sounds like...

1837
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And he says we are in the middle.

1838
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
We won't run Netflix.

1839
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
We're not trying to do 3D.

1840
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I was going to say I hate to be the one to say the terrible O word,

1841
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
but it sounds a lot like the Ouya.

1842
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Well, you know what?

1843
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I think there was a lot in concept that maybe could have been better about the Ouya.

1844
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,000
And so maybe a second go at it is what this needs or what have you.

1845
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And it'll have the classic Intellivision library to back it up.

1846
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
But it sounds like from what Tommy is saying,

1847
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
maybe they're going to try to put out a console that's like 50 bucks,

1848
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
something that's a lot cheaper, maybe $99.

1849
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I don't know where they'll go with it.

1850
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
They'll try to put something out that's really cheap

1851
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,000
that just plays simple kid-friendly type of games,

1852
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
which maybe isn't for you and me, but that's okay.

1853
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Maybe the goal is the parents can play the games they remember from Intellivision.

1854
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Well, I mean, if you think about it, imagine a homebrew version of the SNES classic.

1855
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:15,000
You're running SNES type games on that type of hardware for that price point.

1856
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
That doesn't sound terrible.

1857
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I mean, think about if Nintendo had the forethought to put networking in their SNES classic

1858
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
and have a storefront where you can purchase more games.

1859
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
It would have been cool if they had called it Satellaview.

1860
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Or that, yeah.

1861
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And harking back to that.

1862
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
So anyway, I'm very curious to see what Tommy comes up with with this.

1863
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And hopefully we'll get...

1864
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
It sounds like he's taking the right approach,

1865
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
where he's like, look, we're not trying to compete with Nintendo in this stuff.

1866
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
We're looking at a different market.

1867
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And so maybe this is a kid's bedroom console.

1868
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I don't know. We'll see.

1869
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
So good luck.

1870
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
SG100Matt in chat says, I think he'll do a good job with this console.

1871
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
He's a smart businessman, and we'll get the right people to work on this.

1872
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Tigerclaw says, so expect those Intellivision consoles at your local dollar stores.

1873
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Well, I don't know.

1874
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I don't want to be that pessimistic about it,

1875
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
but maybe some of the games will show up at dollar stores.

1876
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
But honestly, is that such a bad thing?

1877
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I mean, if there's a way to make some of these games for pennies on the dollar,

1878
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:24,000
then maybe dollar store sales is not actually the end of the world.

1879
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So anyway, we'll see.

1880
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
We'll see.

1881
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Dartatia also says, video games live wouldn't suffer because of this new system.

1882
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
He'll still be doing that, too, from the sound of it.

1883
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Well, you know, you can run multiple businesses.

1884
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Again, it's just like Gwyneth was pointed out in an earlier comment.

1885
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
If you have the right people that are doing it,

1886
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
you can still kind of do whatever you need to do.

1887
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Anyway, let's take a trip down memory lane and take a look at a classic.

1888
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault

1889
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you should be checking this game out.

1890
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
And maybe it's not as old as the Intellivision this week,

1891
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
but it's still a classic.

1892
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I mean, when gaming's been around for years and years and years,

1893
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
you've got a lot of shit to choose from.

1894
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
But the rule around here is generally ten years old.

1895
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
We blur the line a little bit, but ten years older or more.

1896
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
So Dark Soccer, I know this is probably more like 20 years old.

1897
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,000
What is the classic game of the week this week?

1898
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Marvel Super Heroes.

1899
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
A fighting game developed by Capcom that was released in the arcade in 1995

1900
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
and was a CPS2 arcade system game.

1901
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
It got ported to...

1902
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Stupid ads.

1903
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I thought this thing had ad block.

1904
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
You need the ad block for YouTube specifically.

1905
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I guess so.

1906
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Okay, here's the actual music.

1907
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Plus I picked one of my favorite characters to play in this, Shuma Gorath.

1908
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Or as Dan and I just kept calling him Shumachan.

1909
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But anyway, this is a cute little god of destruction and chaos.

1910
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Cute is an interesting word to describe it.

1911
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I love the poses though for Shuma Gorath in this game.

1912
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:59,000
It also has one of my favorite ever attacks, chaos dimension.

1913
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
But I'll get to that anyway.

1914
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:06,000
So later on it was ported to the Sega Saturn and Playstation in 1997.

1915
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
The Saturn version being the good one.

1916
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And then it also was included in the Marvel vs. Capcom Origins collection.

1917
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Where, of course, Marvel vs. Capcom was also released as well.

1918
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It came out digitally for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012.

1919
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
It is loosely based on the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.

1920
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And it is the second Capcom fighting game.

1921
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
The first one being X-Men Children of the Atom.

1922
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And then succeeded by the Marvel vs. Capcom series.

1923
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,000
And one thing about this is that it was dedicated to Jack Kirby.

1924
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Because they based all the characters in the game off of Jack Kirby's original design.

1925
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
The ones that he had the hand in.

1926
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I read his autobiography too.

1927
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
And if you haven't read Jack Kirby's autobiography you really should.

1928
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
But going further.

1929
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
It is a fighting game.

1930
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Did I say fighting and lightning for some reason?

1931
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It's a fighting game.

1932
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
It has superheroes and villains from the Marvel universe fighting against each other.

1933
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
But they use attacks to knock down the opponent.

1934
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
And of course possess more life than them at the end of it.

1935
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
And they also have this different mechanic in it.

1936
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
They have the infinity gems.

1937
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
So the power, time, space, reality, soul and mind.

1938
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And you can knock them out of opponents during arcade mode.

1939
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Or fill certain criteria in versus mode.

1940
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Like just getting the first hit.

1941
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Or doing different things.

1942
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But when you use the gems in battle you get enhanced effects.

1943
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
So for example if you use the time gem you get super speed.

1944
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Power of course.

1945
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Power.

1946
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Different ones can be life.

1947
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Things like that.

1948
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
And also certain fighters will get extra benefits from using certain gems.

1949
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Like Spiderman using the power gem will let him create a doppelganger to do extra damage during his attacks.

1950
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:09,000
And so basically the main antagonist of the game being an infinity gauntlet storyline would be Thanos.

1951
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:15,000
And see I thought that with Infinity War having recently come out I thought that this game would be appropriate.

1952
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:26,000
So the characters in the game are, and by the way some of them are only available in the Japanese version.

1953
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
They were hidden characters in the Japanese version and they were unlockable in Origins.

1954
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
And then of course there is boss characters.

1955
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So Thanos is the unlockable boss character.

1956
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
And for a hidden character you actually have Anita.

1957
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
As in Donovan's little wanderer.

1958
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
You know the little girl who hangs out with him from Darkstalkers.

1959
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And Doctor Doom was also an unlockable boss.

1960
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Other than that you had Blackheart.

1961
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I don't know I really wasn't too into some of those characters in the 90's.

1962
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:07,000
But I remember Blackheart was in, it was like Punisher, Wolverine, and somebody else doing a crossover for that.

1963
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:15,000
But also Captain America is in it, Hulk is in it, Iron Man, Juggernaut, Magneto, Psylocke, Shuma Garak, Spiderman, and Wolverine.

1964
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Which I don't understand that if all of these characters are in it why the fuck was Doctor Strange not in it.

1965
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
But go ahead and ask Marvel that.

1966
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
So it did include four of the characters that were in X-Men Children of the Atom.

1967
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Who were considered to be the most popular so it was Wolverine, Juggernaut, Magneto, and Psylocke.

1968
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
So yay Psylocke was one of my regulars in this game.

1969
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:49,000
And then of course the home conversions were revealed at E3 1996 with Stan Lee there at the time.

1970
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,000
It is one of the best fighting games I think I have ever played.

1971
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Great graphics, wonderful music, and then of course the Saturn version is of course practical perfection.

1972
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Because it does use the 4 meg RAM cartridge so that you get near arcade quality performance from it.

1973
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:17,000
You're missing some frames of animation, but it really is about as great as the arcade version as you could get the day it came out.

1974
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Playstation 1 of course was lacking because it didn't have the memory to accommodate so many characters.

1975
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
And of course the Sega Saturn much better for anything 2D.

1976
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:35,000
And of course Saturn Magazine gave it a 95% for being a wonderful conversion.

1977
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:45,000
And it was considered the 16th best Marvel video game by Geek Magazine in 2013 for quote it's chaotic yet insanely fun gameplay.

1978
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
And it's considered one of the top 25 best 2D fighting games of all time.

1979
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Because the gem collecting mechanic still keeps the game fresh.

1980
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Now a little story about this game.

1981
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:10,000
When I was a student at the University of South Alabama we had at this little, I mean the place has long gone since then.

1982
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,000
But it was a deli that had been around since like the 70's called Solomon's.

1983
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And now it's like some barbecue joint.

1984
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
But Solomon's had this bar but they also had an arcade next door to the bar.

1985
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:33,000
And to the side also of the deli that had import arcade cabinets as well as ROM hacks.

1986
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Just you know bootlegs and what have you.

1987
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
So I got to play this game pretty much the week after it came out.

1988
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,000
And I remember saying you know I only need 3 hours of sleep.

1989
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And going to Solomon's at 4 in the fucking morning to play this.

1990
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And one of the still beta editions of Mortal Kombat 2.

1991
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And that was like my jam. Lots of pinball too.

1992
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,000
But I have very fond memories of this game.

1993
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,000
And of course my first character on this game was Psylocke.

1994
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
My second was Shumacrath.

1995
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,000
So memories. It's a great game. Did you guys play it too?

1996
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,000
No I didn't really get into the Marvel side of the fighting games until Marvel vs Capcom.

1997
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
When Storm was in it and you know I would always play Storm or Chun-Li usually like that.

1998
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,000
So I think I kind of missed this one. I don't remember this being in any arcades near me. That was the problem.

1999
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
And they had a missed opportunity with this game.

2000
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Because if they really wanted it to be more true to you know the Infinity Gauntlet stories.

2001
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:40,000
You should have had Gamora. You should have had Nebula. You should have had you know Doctor Strange involved in it.

2002
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,000
You know Dormammu maybe. You know.

2003
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:49,000
We actually need a remake to this.

2004
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Well and I understand they tried to do that with the Marvel vs Capcom.

2005
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
But that's bullshit. It means it's just a flat Marvel game.

2006
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:03,000
The 2D fighting game that has the actual characters involved in the Infinity Gauntlet original storyline.

2007
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Because the Infinity Gauntlet storyline is fucked up because it had Nebula getting the gauntlet.

2008
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
And if they do that in the movies I'm just going to laugh.

2009
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Well.

2010
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I haven't seen it yet.

2011
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I do the next movie.

2012
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Alright who knows. Anyway.

2013
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Yes Nebula had the gauntlet and made Thanos her bitch.

2014
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
But.

2015
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
She also had hair.

2016
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
But that you are simply talking about the comics.

2017
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
About the comics.

2018
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
We don't know what they'll do in the movies.

2019
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
About the comics.

2020
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I haven't even seen the movie because I'll be perfectly honest Infinity Gauntlet was really not one of my favorite storylines.

2021
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Uh huh.

2022
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
You know Secret War was another one I didn't like.

2023
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
It was from that same general era.

2024
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
The stuff that I liked was like Extinction Agenda and Inferno.

2025
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
All the X-Men separate storylines.

2026
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Alright.

2027
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Well there it is.

2028
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Classic game of the week.

2029
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Marvel Super Heroes.

2030
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
The arcade game but also ported faithfully down to Sega Saturn.

2031
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
And the Playstation.

2032
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
More people had a Playstation.

2033
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
It was where we just patted the Playstation people in the head and said oh you poor dear.

2034
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
You get it too.

2035
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
But remember Saturn sold very well in Japan.

2036
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
That's true.

2037
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:13,000
And if we had gotten in the US if they had marketed as well as they did in Japan and got us those 4 meg RAM carts.

2038
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
They could have charged 100 bucks a game and people would have said here take all of my money.

2039
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Yeah well considering that Neo Geo was giving you arcade perfect stuff it was way more money.

2040
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Yeah you could have gotten close to perfection with the Saturn for a fraction of the cost.

2041
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Alright.

2042
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Well we're going to take a quick break but when we come back we have lots more news.

2043
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
We have your emails.

2044
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:39,000
We also have some stories on free games coming out if you are subscribers to Xbox Gold or Playstation Plus.

2045
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
We'll talk about some backwards compatibility.

2046
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
We'll talk about Atari's retro stuff and maybe some more Street Fighter stuff as well.

2047
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
So we're going to take a quick break.

2048
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Don't go anywhere.

2049
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
We've got more of Orange Lounge ready to come right after this.

2050
01:52:51,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.

2051
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Episode number 733 of our show already in progress.

2052
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:10,000
For this June 3rd of 2018 kind of the eve of E3 and as we talked about in the first half of the show.

2053
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Quite a few things already kind of slipping through the cracks thanks to various leaks.

2054
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Be they intentional or not.

2055
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
We talked about Pokemon Let's Go.

2056
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
We talked about Fallout 76, Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

2057
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,000
And we have more to talk about in this part of the show as well as your calls in a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2058
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
All one word on Skype.

2059
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
But before we get there we have some rapid fire news to get into.

2060
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Of course Jason also joining us in the studio.

2061
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I need to give him a shout out as well.

2062
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Hello. Hello.

2063
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Good to have you as always.

2064
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Hope you have a good time so far.

2065
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Alright.

2066
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Let's get into rapid fire news and we'll do Loki.

2067
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Yeah.

2068
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Let's talk a little bit about Mayman 11.

2069
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
The game that I forgot was coming out but it is and it looks awesome.

2070
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Oh yeah.

2071
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
I didn't forget it was coming.

2072
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
It's just one of those.

2073
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm going to believe it when I see it.

2074
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
And so this week they kind of showed it a little more.

2075
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Yeah.

2076
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
They showed it a bit more of the game.

2077
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,000
It looks very similar as far as gameplay wise to the original Mega Man.

2078
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And of course much nicer looking.

2079
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:13,000
They showed off some of the new boss characters in there including Block Man and was it Fuse Man I think it was called?

2080
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Or Spark Man or something like that.

2081
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
That's right.

2082
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Fuse Man.

2083
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
It's Fuse Man.

2084
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Yeah.

2085
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,000
But it looked pretty cool and they have like a time slow ability that you have now too as well.

2086
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:31,000
But the game is going to be coming out October 2nd on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.

2087
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
So you can check it out then.

2088
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,000
If you're getting it on the Switch they even have a version that has an amiibo because everything has an amiibo.

2089
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Because of course it does.

2090
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
But it's not the existing Mega Man amiibo.

2091
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
It's a new amiibo.

2092
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
It's a new Mega Man amiibo.

2093
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
It's the amiibo edition.

2094
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:58,000
So it's got the game, the new amiibo, a Dr. Wily logo adhesive patch and a set of stickers and the stage select microfiber cloth.

2095
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
You can wipe your dirty Switch off.

2096
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Because your Switch has been very very dirty.

2097
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Very dirty.

2098
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
It needs to be rubbed down by Dr. Wily.

2099
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:15,000
And of course as everybody's favorite retailer it is a GameStop exclusive.

2100
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Because of course it is.

2101
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
That makes me so angry.

2102
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Whatever.

2103
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Yeah.

2104
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Alright.

2105
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And then of course it's that time again.

2106
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
It's that time to see what new games are going to be coming out for the month of June.

2107
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
As part of the mandatory multiplayer passes that you have to pay for.

2108
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
But you can forget stuff.

2109
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:44,000
So for Xbox we've got starting June 1st, Assassin's Creed Chronicles Russia.

2110
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And that's for the whole month of June.

2111
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And then of course starting June 16th through July 15th you're going to have SMITE the gold bundle.

2112
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:55,000
And then the Xbox 360 compatible games that are going to be released around that time.

2113
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for the 1st through the 15th and through the 16th and the 30th.

2114
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Lego Indiana Jones 2 the adventure continues.

2115
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Isn't SMITE free to play?

2116
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
It might be like a gold pack that you're getting.

2117
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Yeah I figured they're probably like what?

2118
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Like XP boosters?

2119
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Some like that.

2120
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Characters.

2121
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,000
They've done this before because they gave away killer instinct in games with gold which is also free to play.

2122
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
But what the games with gold stuff was like you got all the season 1 characters.

2123
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I think at one point they even gave you all the season 2 characters.

2124
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
So you got some of the stuff that most people would pay money for.

2125
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I'm also fucking garbage at Xbox One Killer Instinct.

2126
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Yeah Xbox One Killer Instinct is like a totally different game.

2127
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I like it a lot but it's very different from the old school ones.

2128
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
And then on the Playstation side of things for Playstation Plus.

2129
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
On Playstation 4 we're getting XCOM 2 and Trials Fusion.

2130
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I do like me some Trials so that's worth it.

2131
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Except I already bought it.

2132
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Playstation 3 is getting Zombie Driver HD and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier.

2133
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I thought they stopped doing Playstation 3 games.

2134
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Or maybe I'm thinking Playstation 3.

2135
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,000
They will be stopping that I think but they gave like a year notice on that.

2136
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
So it's like stopping in April 2019.

2137
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
It's a ways out.

2138
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Okay.

2139
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Don't quote me on that date but it's a ways out.

2140
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And then on the Vita, Atomic Ninjas, and Squares.

2141
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I don't know if any of these are like multi-platform games because usually there's a few of those on Playstation 3 and stuff.

2142
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
That end up being like multi-platform.

2143
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Yeah.

2144
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
But check those out.

2145
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Kaishudo confirming the date is March 2019.

2146
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I was really close so April would be the first month without it.

2147
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Anyway.

2148
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Let's see.

2149
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Also Needlecrash is in chat talking about Mega Man 11 saying yay Mega Man 11.

2150
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:52,000
And mentioning that the Japan versions or the Japanese versions have better editions.

2151
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,000
So if you want the Amiibo you could import it if you don't want to do Gamestop.

2152
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Of course that's going to be way more money but you'd be getting a Japanese edition.

2153
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
They're a little different in their configuration so maybe that's an alternative.

2154
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
So I like that.

2155
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Yeah.

2156
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Some outside the box thinking.

2157
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I like that.

2158
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Good deal.

2159
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Alright.

2160
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Kaishudo says I love the Gamestop.

2161
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
This makes me smile.

2162
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I'm glad someone's smiling.

2163
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Alright.

2164
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Moving on.

2165
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Also in Microsoft news, what about backwards compatibility?

2166
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
That's still a thing that is growing and continuing.

2167
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
So this is pretty cool because it's a lot of Rockstar stuff so I think Loki you're going

2168
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
to be really into this.

2169
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Because it's all the same engine.

2170
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Yeah.

2171
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Right.

2172
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
So apparently starting June 7th you will be able to play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,

2173
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Midnight Club LA, and ooh this is one that I bought because it was an early 360 release.

2174
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Rockstar Games Table Tennis.

2175
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
That's right.

2176
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:49,000
All of them will be available to play now on the Xbox One thanks to backwards compatibility.

2177
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be the enhanced version released on Xbox 360 with the increased

2178
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:58,000
resolution and draw distance even if you use the original Xbox disc.

2179
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,000
So that's pretty cool that the original disc will actually trigger the enhanced version.

2180
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
The original disc with the downloaded patch.

2181
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Well yeah because all the disc does is unlock the download.

2182
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Yep.

2183
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
That's all it's doing.

2184
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,000
And then the Midnight Club LA will be the complete edition.

2185
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Oh I'm sorry the initial release and the complete edition will be available.

2186
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
So neat.

2187
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,000
They say there was a native 4K update for Red Dead Redemption when they did that but

2188
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
no similar improvements to these at least not yet.

2189
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Who can't wait for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie?

2190
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Well it's happening.

2191
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I'll probably see it at some point.

2192
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Whether you like it or not Sonic the Hedgehog is becoming a movie and they were trying to

2193
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:47,000
get Paul Rudd to be in it but it sounds like they have actually cast James Marsden from

2194
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Westworld and I believe he was Cyclops in X-Men if I'm not mistaken or like the early

2195
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
X-Men movies right?

2196
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Yes.

2197
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
That was him.

2198
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
That was him.

2199
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
So he's a little older now.

2200
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Dick Cyclops.

2201
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,000
And his now his movie career consists of running around with blue hedgehogs.

2202
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,000
But is he going to be Sonic or is he just going to be like one of Sonic's wonderful

2203
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
friends?

2204
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
He is the star.

2205
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
He is possibly a buddy cop type of role it sounds like.

2206
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Sonic's human friend.

2207
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Yes.

2208
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Sonic shitty human friends.

2209
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,000
This honestly it's sounding more and more like a cross between Detective Pikachu and

2210
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,000
what is that R rated movie about the puppets that's coming out?

2211
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
No it's not like that.

2212
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:33,000
No I would say if anything because it's blue it reminds me a lot of the Smurfs as in it

2213
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,000
would be shitty but I still kind of want to see it because Neil Patrick Harris is in it

2214
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
but that's really the only reason I'd ever want to see that movie.

2215
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,000
And since I do say Detective Pikachu it shouldn't be forgotten that that movie is still happening.

2216
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
There is a Detective Pikachu movie coming out too.

2217
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:54,000
So it's Ryan Reynolds though it's not it's not Danny DeVito but I hope that Ryan Reynolds

2218
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,000
will be as dirty as Danny DeVito and I believe that he could do that.

2219
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I'm sure I'm sure.

2220
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Good times.

2221
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I believe in Ryan Reynolds.

2222
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
He's my current lord and savior.

2223
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I'm still a little apprehensive about the fact that they're doing a clue movie with

2224
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Ryan Reynolds because you all know clue is near and dear to my heart but it's going to

2225
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
be R rated.

2226
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Yeah.

2227
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
They could go places.

2228
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I need everybody to stop saying remake.

2229
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Literal flames.

2230
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Literal flames on the side of my face.

2231
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Every clue that comes out is a new clue because it's different every which way.

2232
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
It's true.

2233
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
This is a re-imaging.

2234
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Re-imagining of the board game in a movie form.

2235
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Right.

2236
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Yes.

2237
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Just like how there was the VCR game that was different.

2238
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
But if we have nods to Madeline Kahn.

2239
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
I would be fine if they do like a nod and have somebody in the movie doing the whole

2240
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
flames on the side of my face.

2241
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Like I think they're almost required to do a nod.

2242
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Or if they do an opposite like I went cold.

2243
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Cold like the depths of hell.

2244
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
If you read Dante.

2245
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I'm just thinking.

2246
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Maybe.

2247
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I don't know.

2248
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Yeah.

2249
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Something a little more in your face.

2250
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Or like a character named Yvette or Wadsworth.

2251
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Like they can call the butler Wadsworth.

2252
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I don't care.

2253
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Anyway.

2254
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Let's move on.

2255
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Sorry.

2256
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Away from clue.

2257
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Yeah.

2258
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Well we did bring this up before.

2259
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:11,000
But it's of course gotten larger attention so I did want to bring it up.

2260
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Ted Dabney who is one of the co-founders of Atari died at the age of 81.

2261
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Which is not a bad run.

2262
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Started the whole thing with you know wanting to do.

2263
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,000
You know of course the Nolan Bushnell who created Pizza Time Theater.

2264
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Had the idea for the Pizza Time Theater way way back when.

2265
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
But it's one of those ideas that came about and led to.

2266
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
You know they couldn't start the pizza place.

2267
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
But they began the partnership that led to Atari.

2268
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Right.

2269
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
So.

2270
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So even though we had addressed this last week.

2271
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,000
It's worth noting that like you're seeing this now on places like the BBC.

2272
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
And like these very large websites.

2273
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I'm reading it off of NPR.

2274
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Yeah.

2275
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Or NPR.

2276
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Like these very big places are kind of picking this up.

2277
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Like I even noticed it on Twitter.

2278
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Like one of my friends that does a lot of like media stuff.

2279
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Posted a tweet about it like Tuesday or Wednesday.

2280
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
And I kind of wanted to reply and be like this.

2281
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
He actually passed away like a few days ago.

2282
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
But I didn't want to be that bitch.

2283
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
You know I was like OK if people are.

2284
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
It's taking its time for people to kind of recognize it's happening.

2285
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
And so.

2286
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And the thing that's kind of what you saw happen.

2287
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
About the NPR article is it does go a little bit into more of who he was as a person.

2288
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
It was cancer that got him.

2289
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:29,000
But what I didn't know about him is that I mean apart from just being an electrical engineer and co-founding Atari.

2290
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
He was a Marine.

2291
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So I actually got call outs from a few buddies of mine who had been retired Marines.

2292
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:41,000
So that was kind of actually how I found the NPR article.

2293
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
OK.

2294
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
So.

2295
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Interesting.

2296
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
But yeah.

2297
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I.

2298
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I think it's you know.

2299
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
He's he's one of our co-founders and actually this NPR article is totally worth reading.

2300
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I'm not going to go like super more in depth on it.

2301
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:02,000
But it's a reason why since you know they set up their first pong in the Andy Capps Tavern in Sunnyvale.

2302
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,000
We would do Atari party every so often in Sunnyvale instead of Davis.

2303
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
So I'll link the article in the chat room.

2304
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
It's totally worth reading.

2305
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
It's definitely going to be a lot more.

2306
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Actually I'll be linking this on my Jamie Summers Facebook.

2307
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,000
So definitely worth reading the whole article.

2308
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
All right.

2309
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,000
And also one of my favorite characters who I keep going didn't he die in the first Soul Calibur.

2310
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Maxie is back.

2311
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I won't be happy though with Maxie is not voiced by Hayashi Nobutoshi who was his original voice actor who was also Knuckles in Sonic Adventure and Toski in Fushigi Yugi and Basara in Macross 7.

2312
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Just one of those voices you know really good voice really good singer.

2313
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
But yeah he's back in it and he better be voiced by the same guy or else I will be upset.

2314
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
That's it.

2315
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
All right.

2316
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:01,000
We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates some games you might be playing a little sooner than Soul Calibur 6 here on the Eve of E3 coming up.

2317
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Yeah there's actually some stuff coming out.

2318
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:09,000
So we've got Blaze Blue cross tag battle that's on PC the Switch and PlayStation 4.

2319
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
A game called Happy Birthdays that's on the Switch.

2320
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Nobunaga's Ambition looks like Taishi and that's on PC and PlayStation 4.

2321
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Onrush which is on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2322
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:30,000

2323
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:38,000

2324
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:43,000

2325
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:52,000

2327
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
The Banner Saga 2 on the Switch.

2328
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
And then as we talked about last week.

2329
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Muv Luv on the Vita and Muv Luv Alternative on the Vita.

2330
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:13,000
And then finally and last but not least for this week Sushi Striker the weight of the Sushido on the Switch and 3DS.

2331
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
That's it.

2332
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I feel like Nintendo's trying to push that game way harder than it deserves.

2333
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
But I guess I can't hate till I try it so.

2334
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Hate which one?

2335
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
The Sushido game.

2336
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Oh.

2337
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Yeah anyway.

2338
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Alright moving on to Japan and let's check out some of the releases there.

2339
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Hey on the PlayStation 4 Life is Strange Before the Storm gets its Japanese release this week from Square Enix.

2340
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
June the 7th is when that will be out.

2341
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Fate Xtella Link is out from Marvelous in a regular and a limited edition in Japan this week.

2342
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,000
As well as a game called Little Nightmares in a deluxe edition is also out this week.

2343
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
But that is about it at least for the PlayStation 4 releases in Japan.

2344
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I should point out though there is.

2345
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Excuse me.

2346
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:58,000
There is some sort of special PlayStation 4 like a new bundle that's coming out on the 8th.

2347
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
It is a new.

2348
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
It's a very pretty like blue.

2349
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
It's called the Days of Play edition.

2350
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I don't know if we're getting one like that here but it's a really pretty blue like.

2351
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,000
If Shane saw this I think he would import it from Japan because you know he loves the color blue.

2352
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:17,000
And it's a really like pretty blue with the gold like PlayStation logo in it with all the little other X's nose.

2353
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
And the controllers are really pretty too.

2354
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,000
I might have to like send him that link and see what he thinks about that.

2355
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Anyway.

2356
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Also on other systems I'm not sure if the Vita.

2357
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,000
The Vita also has that Fate Xtella Link and that's the only real release on the Vita this week in Japan.

2358
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
But hey they're still getting something in Japan.

2359
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:37,000
And then on the Nintendo Switch this week that Little Nightmares game is on the Switch.

2360
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Otherwise that is really it.

2361
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
It's a little slower for releases than it is here.

2362
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Dark Sakura.

2363
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
What about Europe?

2364
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,000
In Europe we have on the 5th Elder Scrolls Online Summer Set.

2365
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Actually a game exclusive.

2366
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
The retailer.

2367
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Onrush on the 5th.

2368
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Also Vampyr.

2369
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Vampire.

2370
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
It's the Y R spelling.

2371
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
For PlayStation and Xbox.

2372
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Warhammer 40K Inquisitor Martyr also for those same consoles on the 5th.

2373
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:10,000
On the 7th we have MotoGP 18 for pretty much everything.

2374
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Flashback 25th Anniversary Edition for Switch on June 8th.

2375
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Also on June 8th is Sushi Striker The Way of Sushido.

2376
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
That name.

2377
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Okay first of all Sushido would mean the way of sushi.

2378
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Don't call it the way of the way of sushi.

2379
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Stupid.

2380
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
It's like saying chai tea.

2381
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
ATM machine.

2382
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
USB bus.

2383
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Chai tea.

2384
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Chai means tea.

2385
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
But I love chai tea.

2386
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Bitch don't make me.

2387
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Hey next time I drink a cup of chai tea you should walk up to me and go hey nice tea tea.

2388
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Girl.

2389
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I'm way too easily amused.

2390
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Alright.

2391
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Or like when I see yakitori chicken.

2392
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Uh huh.

2393
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Yakitori means chicken.

2394
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
On a skewer.

2395
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Specifically chicken on a skewer.

2396
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Alright.

2397
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Chicken on a skewer chicken.

2398
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:06,000
If that's it for the UK releases then I'm gonna direct Dark Soccer to the mail bag.

2399
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
The bag of mail.

2400
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Which I had to prune.

2401
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Yes Dark Soccer went in there and uh.

2402
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
This is working.

2403
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Yes it actually I just a quick off the record since Jason was here I was like Jason.

2404
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Jason.

2405
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Jason.

2406
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Jason.

2407
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Jason.

2408
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
I was like Jason our website's been doing all this stuff and he went oh click click click click click.

2409
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Done.

2410
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Done.

2411
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
So hopefully that won't bother us again.

2412
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Okay so this one is actually a code for a game for someone who has Xbox Live.

2413
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I saw that.

2414
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
So I don't have it so.

2415
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Um.

2416
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Whichever one of you guys.

2417
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
It was Street Fighter something right?

2418
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Street Fighter 4 arcade code.

2419
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
I don't think I have that on Xbox One if I don't have it I'll take it.

2420
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Then it's yours I'll leave it in the inbox.

2421
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Who sent that to us?

2422
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Rababa.

2423
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Thank you Rababa.

2424
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Rababa.

2425
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Rababa.

2426
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Rababa.

2427
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I've been listening to Rababa since he came back from Japan and gave me my Anpanman plushie.

2428
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Rababa needs a theme song.

2429
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Okay.

2430
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Rababa.

2431
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Rababa.

2432
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Rababa.

2433
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Rababa.

2434
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Rababa.

2435
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Rababa.

2436
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Rababa.

2437
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Rababa.

2438
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Rababa.

2439
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Rababa.

2440
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Rababa.

2441
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Rababa.

2442
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Rababa.

2443
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Rababa.

2444
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Rababa.

2445
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Rababa.

2446
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Rababa.

2447
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Rababa.

2448
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Rababa would like to take back this email.

2449
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
That's right.

2450
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
That's the actual email that's content for us.

2451
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Hey, OLR.

2452
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
It's been a long time since I wrote you guys an email.

2453
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I just wanted to get your thoughts on Mega Man 11.

2454
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Two new bosses were officially revealed this week.

2455
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Block Man and Fuse Man.

2456
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
They look pretty innovative and I like their designs as well.

2457
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I already have my premium edition on pre-order from Play Asia since Japan gets the good shit

2458
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
and we don't.

2459
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I also noticed that you can't get the Mega Man amiibo on pre-order anymore from overseas

2460
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
since it's sold out everywhere unless you buy the Switch bundle that comes with it.

2461
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Okay, I'll stop there.

2462
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
So what do we think about Mega Man 11?

2463
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,000
I think, yay, it's a fun Mega Man game and I'll probably have it.

2464
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Same.

2465
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I appreciate that with Mega Man 9 and 10 they went back to that old school Mega Man look

2466
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
and they really made it look like.

2467
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,000
But I think people have been waiting for a game like this where it's that old school

2468
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,000
2D but definitely with the tricks that you can do in a new school environment.

2469
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Who am I kidding?

2470
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
I'm gonna fucking buy it.

2471
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Even though I'm sure the game is gonna be fucking hard as a lot of Mega Man games are,

2472
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I'll buy it.

2473
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
You know?

2474
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Whatever.

2475
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,000
9 and 10 wrecked me.

2476
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
9 and 10 were a disaster.

2477
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I'm not saying they were bad games, they were actually great games, but when I played them

2478
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
it was sad.

2479
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Hey, remember how you couldn't dash or charge special weapons and all of these things from

2480
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
the X series that you don't get anymore?

2481
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Go back to the 90s.

2482
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I want a new X.

2483
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
That's what all this makes me do.

2484
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
It makes me want a new Mega Man X.

2485
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
We'll get there eventually.

2486
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
What was the last X game?

2487
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
X8?

2488
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
X8?

2489
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Sounds right.

2490
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Yeah.

2491
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
But...

2492
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
They just have to get through re-releasing everything.

2493
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:06,000
They have to get through extending the classic series and then they'll start extending the

2494
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
X series.

2495
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
My eyes are gonna hurt from all the rolling that they're doing.

2496
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,000
And then the XE and the battle network and then they'll make another sequel to ZX.

2497
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Oh, DarkTight2U in chat points out over at live.vognetwork.com, I did hear Mega Man 11

2498
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
will have a casual mode.

2499
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Yay for Bobby Black Wolf mode.

2500
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Yay.

2501
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Because I love those modes.

2502
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Although, with what I heard about Curse of the Moon, it might not mean a lot.

2503
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Look, the thing about Curse of the Moon, it gives you unlimited lives.

2504
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Yes, I wiped on that boss, but it let me start all over again on the screen before the boss.

2505
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
That's typical Castlevania, too.

2506
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
But I mean, I died.

2507
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I lost everybody and it still let me start there.

2508
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
So, yeah.

2509
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
I'm a big fan of casual mode.

2510
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
So, to continue this email.

2511
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
E3 starts in a few days and I'm wondering what your predictions are.

2512
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
For me, I'm hoping of the following.

2513
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Onimusha Collection is announced.

2514
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
PS4 to be backwards compatible.

2515
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

2516
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Final Fantasy 7 remake footage.

2517
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Nintendo Switch online plans.

2518
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Bayonetta 3 info.

2519
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Mega Man X9.

2520
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
A man can only dream.

2521
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I truly hope you are all doing well.

2522
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I haven't had the time to hear you guys lately due to life.

2523
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
But that's how it goes.

2524
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Be well, keep up the good work, and happy Pride Week.

2525
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
And that comes from Needle Crash.

2526
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Well, welcome back. Happy Pride to you as well.

2527
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
And let's see, E3 predictions.

2528
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Week? We get a month.

2529
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I guess that would be the time.

2530
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I know, that's right.

2531
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
We do get a month.

2532
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Well, actually, here in SAC, it's this coming weekend.

2533
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
But then I'm going to Chicago Pride.

2534
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I'm such a selfish bitch, I'm doing it twice.

2535
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I'm going to San Francisco Pride.

2536
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
When you're in Chicago for Pride.

2537
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
You're doing charitable work, though.

2538
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Well, but I would have been there anyway.

2539
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
So anyway, as far as the E3 predictions go,

2540
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
I think Bayonetta 3 info is a really good, safe bet.

2541
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:56,000
As well as some of those other things that were named.

2542
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
There's one other one that he named that I was like,

2543
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
oh yeah, that's probably for sure going to happen.

2544
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,000
I thought that Tekken vs. Street Fighter was a very interesting prediction

2545
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
because that has seemed to kind of disappear altogether.

2546
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
So I would like to see that make a resurgence as well.

2547
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Maybe they're hoping we'll forget about it before they re-announce it.

2548
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
And maybe now that Street Fighter V is a little bit like,

2549
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
and Tekken 7, both are kind of like, you know, doing their thing.

2550
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Maybe now's a good time for that to happen.

2551
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
So that's a really good call.

2552
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
As far as other stuff I'd like to see,

2553
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
from the Nintendo camp, I mean, I would like to see

2554
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,000
what great big holiday hit they have in store.

2555
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I think there's a lot of people really hoping for a new Animal Crossing.

2556
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
I would love for you guys to be pleased.

2557
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
But I really would put that expectation on the lowest possible setting.

2558
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I really want it though.

2559
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I know, but wanting it, like, I've wanted F-Zero for how many years?

2560
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Or as my husband likes to say, how does it feel to wand?

2561
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Yeah, here's the thing with Animal Crossing.

2562
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
That mobile game is still too fresh.

2563
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,000
So I would say, you know, keep bugging the shit out of Nintendo

2564
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
and tweeting at them and stuff. Let them know the demand is there.

2565
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
But don't be surprised if that's a next year thing.

2566
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,000
But as far as Metroid Prime 4 goes,

2567
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
now that I would like to hear some more things about.

2568
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Otherwise with E3, gosh,

2569
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I still am going to go by my old standby

2570
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,000
that I think one of these years Microsoft is going to be the first one to say

2571
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
you no longer have to pay to play online anymore.

2572
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,000
That's my old standby prediction I'm convinced they're going to do.

2573
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Which seems weird, especially in the face of Nintendo

2574
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
holding up that mantle now.

2575
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I know, but Microsoft has to make a big fucking move.

2576
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
They have to be bold.

2577
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
They're going to have to make a big fucking move to get people to talk about them again.

2578
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
And I think that would be one of the things that would do it.

2579
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Another thing, though, about making a free-to-play model for online gaming

2580
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
is the fact that there will be less...

2581
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,000
If they have to shut down a server or something,

2582
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
that will already lessen, I guess, some of the blow on that one

2583
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
because no one's paying for it.

2584
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I was going to ask how...

2585
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I know the Games for Windows program ended a long time ago,

2586
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:09,000
but for games that exist both on PC and Xbox One,

2587
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,000
gold isn't a thing in the PC universe.

2588
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Correct. And you see where my thought process is going with this.

2589
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Yeah, I was leading down the same path with the big unification,

2590
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,000
the big one ecosystem for multiple systems thing.

2591
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I don't want to repeat myself too bad, but Microsoft has these other perks.

2592
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,000
They could still have a gold program that gives you the free games.

2593
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Microsoft has that very rich Netflix-style thing that they're offering,

2594
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
the game password, whatever it is, separately.

2595
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
They could start to move some of that into the gold and what have you.

2596
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I'm just saying, as far as paying to play online,

2597
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Microsoft being a company to take that off the table would be a huge fucking move.

2598
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,000
And I don't want the Xbox and Microsoft fans to get mad at me

2599
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
that I'm saying, oh, Microsoft's got to make a move.

2600
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,000
But you guys know the reality is they are getting lost

2601
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,000
amongst competing with PlayStation 4,

2602
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,000
competing against themselves on PC.

2603
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
And then obviously, Microsoft doesn't really compete with Nintendo,

2604
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
but Nintendo's just got so much of that gaming buzz right now.

2605
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
And hey, the phrase goes, you snooze, you lose.

2606
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Yeah, but if Microsoft made a big fucking move.

2607
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
So I think that's another thing for E3.

2608
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:23,000
I think that Microsoft is going to do something to make our jaws drop.

2609
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:28,000
And even if it's not necessarily that, there's going to be like another,

2610
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
here's another classic standby prediction that you all think is fucking stupid,

2611
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:34,000
but I'm going to say it again, Minecraft 2.

2612
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I think it's going to be, well, Halo 6 is probably what they're going to bring.

2613
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I just think that is not jaw-dropping.

2614
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Halo 6 is just, oh, okay, yeah.

2615
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Halo 6, Royale, Battle Royale.

2616
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Yeah, okay, sure.

2617
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
We got Minecraft 2.

2618
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
What's that?

2619
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:52,000
We got Minecraft 2 times 2 plus K.

2620
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Oh, Minecraft 4K.

2621
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Did that finally come out?

2622
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
No.

2623
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
No, I think the patch is like any day now, though.

2624
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
I think it's supposed to be around E3.

2625
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
So that's finally coming.

2626
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Microsoft 2 squared, 2 squared K.

2627
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Maybe they will announce that that comes out, but you know.

2628
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
What would a Minecraft 2 be?

2629
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Kaishudo says Microsoft can make a huge move and just cancel the Xbox One.

2630
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
For some reason, as you were starting your buildup,

2631
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I thought that's actually what you were going to say,

2632
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
and it made no sense to me.

2633
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Microsoft's not going to cancel Xbox One.

2634
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Yeah, no, absolutely not.

2635
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
No, they're not ready to get out of living room business yet.

2636
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I think this is a better prediction, what TigerClaw says in chat.

2637
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
How about if Microsoft announces a new Battletoads?

2638
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:39,000
You know, they have been teasing that genitalia for, I don't know,

2639
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
how many years on the concept of a new Battletoads game,

2640
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
and we know, like, what was the thing where, like,

2641
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Aaron Greenberg fucking went out there in a fucking Battletoads jacket,

2642
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
or one of those Xbox executives went out there in a fucking Battletoads jacket

2643
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
and was like, announce it already, you fuck!

2644
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Like, he just won't do it.

2645
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
So, maybe this will be the year.

2646
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,000
He's like, you know, hey, we'll put it in Ready Player One.

2647
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
We'll go ahead and put it as a playable character.

2648
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
It wasn't an inoculancing.

2649
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Just fucking announce it, bitch.

2650
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Like, just stop it.

2651
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Stop teasing me.

2652
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
They have the collection that has it in there.

2653
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Maybe this is the year.

2654
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
This is the year for Battletoads, maybe.

2655
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
We're bringing you Battletoads.

2656
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Backwards compatibility.

2657
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
I can't fit this.

2658
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I can't fit this cartridge into the CD drive.

2659
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Why isn't this working?

2660
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Alright.

2661
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Microsoft's big thing now is the 4K gaming.

2662
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
That's where they're gonna go all in.

2663
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:35,000
The 4K on the Xbox One X is superior to the 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro,

2664
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
so I hope they just own it.

2665
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
And so maybe that'll be their thing,

2666
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
is they're just gonna say,

2667
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,000
we've got this in 4K, we've got this in 4K.

2668
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
You know, developers, developers, developers in 4K.

2669
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Can I please have my Crackdown 3 already?

2670
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Can I please have that or is this...

2671
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Why 4K? Why not do 5K?

2672
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
That'll be, and then they'll have the PlayStation 5K.

2673
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
It'll only be on 27-inch max.

2674
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Alright, anyway.

2675
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Alright.

2676
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
As Sharon under Matt says,

2677
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,000
game retailers are pressuring them to make the game

2678
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
because they're tired of fielding calls about

2679
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
if they have Battletoads.

2680
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:13,000
That the choice of retailers is funny there,

2681
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
considering they kind of are the only retailer,

2682
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
at least brick and mortar-wise, that exists anymore.

2683
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,000
They started a whole online campaign for you.

2684
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Tell your, you know how they have like,

2685
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:25,000
tell your cable provider that you want blah blah blah blah blah.

2686
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Tell your retailer that you want Battletoads.

2687
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
It's not, it's not gonna do shit, but anyway.

2688
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Now we live in a Tweety Facebook-y era.

2689
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
That's what we're talking about.

2690
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
We live in a Tweety Facebook-y era.

2691
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
That's the stuff that gets noticed, but anyway.

2692
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Alright, well there's some E3 predictions for you.

2693
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I mean, honestly, you know, I'm always,

2694
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
it's one of those things where

2695
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I just don't realize it until you see it.

2696
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
I was actually, I thought of it a little bit late,

2697
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
but more proof that the only one

2698
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
gets paid attention to are Twits.

2699
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Tweets, Twits.

2700
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Oh, Tweet, Twits.

2701
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Yeah, I get it.

2702
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Twitter.

2703
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Nice Twitties.

2704
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Alright, anyway.

2705
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
That's it for email?

2706
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
I thought I'd thought direct messages.

2707
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I got nothing.

2708
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,000
You got nothing.

2709
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Actually, if you ever want a good laugh,

2710
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,000
just Google image search like Tweety Bird graphics

2711
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,000
because there are all these things that like

2712
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,000
wine box drinking moms will leave like images

2713
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
of Thug Tweety Bird on each other's pages.

2714
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Hold my mochi.

2715
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I'm going in.

2716
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Yep.

2717
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000
No, Google image search it.

2718
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Google image search like Thug Tweety Bird

2719
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
or something like that and you get all these

2720
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
like crazy results where you're like,

2721
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
like the Tweety Bird on Blingy and all this other stuff.

2722
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
It came up in one of our chats the other day,

2723
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
which I thought was hilarious.

2724
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Anyway, going back to video gaming topic,

2725
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
that's it for email.

2726
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,000
So participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2727
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
if you would like to send us an email in the future.

2728
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Maybe you'd like to send us your favorite Tweety Bird meme.

2729
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Let's get into some more news though

2730
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
before we get to phone calls.

2731
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Loki.

2732
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Alright, so let's talk about the current

2733
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
and brand new game consoles.

2734
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
In this case, we're talking about the Atari.

2735
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:05,000
So the Atari retro console has launched

2736
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
their pre-order campaign and apparently

2737
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:11,000
that's gone well for them because it crashed Indiegogo.

2738
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
It looks neat.

2739
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I'm not exactly sure what this is,

2740
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
but I like the interface.

2741
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
It looks neat with all their Atari games.

2742
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,000
But we got more details on what it is.

2743
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
So it's basically, it runs Linux

2744
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,000
and it's on a Radeon R7 processor,

2745
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
a 32 gigabyte hard drive,

2746
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
four gigs of DDR4 RAM and expandable storage.

2747
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Plus it connects to the internet,

2748
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
supports streaming video and online multiplayer games.

2749
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
And they even have voice control.

2750
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
So that's pretty neat.

2751
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
They haven't said too much about

2752
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
what games are going to be on there,

2753
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
but apparently the wood paneled model

2754
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
is going to go for $339.

2755
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:59,000
And they look like the controllers are similar

2756
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
to like a PlayStation controller.

2757
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
They said they have a cheaper option,

2758
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I guess, that's the Onyx model with no controllers.

2759
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
That's $199.

2760
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I'm hoping that this supports some sort of Bluetooth controllers

2761
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
because otherwise that's kind of lame.

2762
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
How am I going to get some controllers for this thing?

2763
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Yeah, that's what it said

2764
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
at the end of the previous section.

2765
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
So, cool.

2766
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Are you surprised this is doing so well?

2767
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I am, especially after the whole

2768
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Coleco chameleon thing.

2769
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I thought people would be kind of hesitant,

2770
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
especially with Atari.

2771
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
How they were trying to kickstart was at

2772
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Theme Park,

2773
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Roller Coaster Tycoon or something like that,

2774
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
but it's like the shitty one from mobile.

2775
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I do feel like the audience

2776
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
that would be getting a retro Atari

2777
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
is very different from those that were

2778
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
keeping an eye on Coleco chameleon.

2779
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I just think it's very different types of audiences,

2780
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
if you know what I mean.

2781
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
By the way, before you finish,

2782
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I have a very important follow-up.

2783
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
So I sent Shane that

2784
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
blue PlayStation 4 thing,

2785
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
and he said, I would own it

2786
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
if it was a pro system.

2787
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I didn't realize it's not a pro,

2788
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
and he said, it was announced earlier this week

2789
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
and I'm mad it's not a pro system because

2790
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
it's beautiful. So I was right that he would be

2791
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
into that blue system, but it's not a pro.

2792
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
By the way, tell Shane I have

2793
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
coconut pocky for him.

2794
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
What is it, like dbrand

2795
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
or other skinning sites that

2796
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
you can get a blue skin for your pro?

2797
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
That's true. I'm sure he has

2798
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
some type of blue PlayStation 4 already

2799
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
anyway, but just not that.

2800
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
I do need to get a pro. I've been thinking about getting a

2801
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
pro and

2802
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
a 4K TV at some point.

2803
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I just don't know how much better that's going to

2804
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
really make VR games and stuff.

2805
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I don't think it's marginally better.

2806
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Marginally.

2807
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
The whole thing that Bobby is saying about the 4K

2808
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
now that he has this whole state of the art

2809
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
theater thing he set up,

2810
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
he notices very much that

2811
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Microsoft Xbox One X

2812
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
does the 4K.

2813
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
I don't have an Xbox One yet.

2814
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
But we knew that.

2815
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
We kind of knew that. Even though the

2816
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
PlayStation has 4K support,

2817
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
it still doesn't have the technology

2818
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
and the chips in it to really

2819
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
do beefy 4K games.

2820
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
That would be why I'd want

2821
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Xbox One X.

2822
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
However,

2823
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
with that being said,

2824
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I don't really need

2825
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
an Xbox One X because I have a PC

2826
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
that can run Microsoft games.

2827
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
That's the problem that they run into.

2828
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
They make all their games on PC

2829
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
and it's like, why the hell am I going to buy a system

2830
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
for cross-platform games

2831
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
that I have a system that can play them on already?

2832
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Because it's getting hard to get a graphics

2833
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
card that does 4K because of

2834
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
fucking Bitcoin.

2835
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Well, I don't have a 4K monitor so I don't give a shit

2836
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
but I don't have a 4K TV either.

2837
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
I have a 4K monitor and do you know how hard it is to get a

2838
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
VO card right now because of fucking Bitcoin?

2839
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I feel like the only way I'm going to be able

2840
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
to get a graphics card is to pay for it with Bitcoin.

2841
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Anyway.

2842
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Moving on.

2843
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
One thing I could

2844
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
play if I wanted to. Actually, I thought about picking

2845
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
it up was the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary

2846
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
collection because it does look like a pretty

2847
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
sweet collection of games

2848
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
and of course that's available on the Switch

2849
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
and I think it's on other systems too.

2850
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
I would obviously get something like that

2851
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
on the Switch. Yes, it is on Playstation 4 and

2852
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Xbox One as well as PC.

2853
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
So the collection

2854
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
the collection

2855
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
it came out here in the States

2856
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
it's been delayed in Japan.

2857
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
They have delayed it in Japan to fall of 2018

2858
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
but this might actually

2859
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
be a good thing because you may

2860
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
or may not recall

2861
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
the folks in Japan weren't super happy

2862
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
about this collection because

2863
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
it's all English titles

2864
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
voicing and text. Meaning the Japanese

2865
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
versions were just kind of

2866
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
thrown away. Well in a message posted

2867
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
on the official website the producer

2868
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
of Street Fighter Tomoaki

2869
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Aino shared

2870
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
that they are going to do a fall 2018 release

2871
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
for the Street Fighter 30th

2872
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Anniversary collection international

2873
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
and said we apologize for the trouble

2874
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
this may have caused to those of you who were looking forward to it

2875
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
but please wait a little longer

2876
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
for additional new information

2877
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
besides the release period.

2878
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
So it sounds like they are going to be making

2879
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
some changes

2880
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
to potentially maybe let them at least

2881
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
flip over to Japanese voice acting

2882
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
and all that stuff and where

2883
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
you know Vega will be

2884
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
M. Bison

2885
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
and Sagat will be

2886
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
all those different changes that they made in the game.

2887
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Correcting that triangle

2888
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
all that stuff

2889
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I mean that would be kind of messed up

2890
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
There would be some people

2891
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I bet that would actually be really into

2892
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
being able to get some of the Japanese

2893
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
versions here in the states

2894
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
you know so I kind of hope

2895
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
that if they do fix it they still have some type

2896
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
of DLC or patch or something

2897
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
where our versions can get the Japanese

2898
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
stuff. I think that would be cool but

2899
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I'm not going to hold my breath but

2900
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
I just think it would be cool. Anyway

2901
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
needlecrash in chat at live.vognetwork.com

2902
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
says collection isn't bad

2903
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
it's pretty good but the

2904
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
online is iffy at times.

2905
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Japan needs to get their versions of

2906
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Street Fighter Zero.

2907
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Alright let's move on

2908
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
DarkSakura what do you have for us coming up next?

2909
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Well

2910
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
people have been

2911
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
stupid about Battlefield 5

2912
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
because it involves

2913
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
women in a World War 2 setting

2914
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
and basically

2915
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
DICE basically said

2916
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
and I'm going to quote here

2917
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
first of all let me be clear about one thing

2918
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
player choice in female playable characters

2919
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
are here to stay.

2920
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And then he went on to

2921
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
explain that it is important to be able to play as a character

2922
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
you identify with for

2923
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
immersion and to customize the way

2924
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
that you want to and I like

2925
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
this quote too. We want Battlefield 5 to represent

2926
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
all of those who are part of the greatest drama in human

2927
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
history and give players a choice to

2928
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
choose and customize

2929
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
the characters they play with.

2930
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
And now here's a history lesson

2931
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
little boys

2932
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
who didn't pay attention in fucking school

2933
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
did you know that there

2934
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
was an entire battalion of female snipers

2935
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
out of Russia?

2936
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Did you know

2937
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
that one of the

2938
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
highest kill counts for female

2939
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
snipers was a Czech sniper?

2940
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Did you also know that there were a number

2941
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
of women working for the resistance

2942
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
in Germany and occupied areas

2943
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
that were releasing propaganda

2944
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
hiding children, helping to get

2945
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
people out who were

2946
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
non-combatant civilians

2947
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
and there were plenty of fucking

2948
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
people enlisted in

2949
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
the armed services

2950
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
who were women

2951
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
who performed medic functions

2952
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
who drove tanks, who drove

2953
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
delivery and who

2954
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
whether or not it was documented

2955
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
did participate in combat.

2956
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
So get off of your sexist little

2957
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I don't know shit about history

2958
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
you know ass hattery fucking

2959
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
read a book and shut up.

2960
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Also it's a fucking

2961
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
video game and like a lot of the

2962
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
stuff you're doing in the video game

2963
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
didn't really fucking happen in history so you

2964
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
know what if we want to you know

2965
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
maybe bend some things a little bit to be more

2966
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
inclusive so women can play women in the game

2967
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
does it really like

2968
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
change anything about

2969
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
battlefield? But they all should know their fucking history.

2970
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
And that is true too I'm not denying anything

2971
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
that you're saying there. Well you're saying battlefield

2972
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
is not realistic I mean I can't jump out of a

2973
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
plane, snipe somebody with a rocket launcher

2974
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
and then land back in that plane again

2975
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
and take off. But women!

2976
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
That's where I draw

2977
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
the line. Goes to show

2978
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
you're still

2979
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
have a long way to go. Wow Raginator

2980
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
is actually like making great points

2981
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
tonight I don't know what the fuck they put in the water

2982
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
over there but Raginator says

2983
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
wah I want realism in

2984
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
my games Gondi sets off

2985
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
nukes which is a popular

2986
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
civilization joke if you

2987
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
play civilization it's like Gondi's the most

2988
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
aggressive leader in the game because of a bug

2989
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
in the original civilization. Dungeon buster

2990
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
historically accurate fixes tank in seconds.

2991
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
So

2992
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
anyway

2993
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
I just

2994
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
I just think

2995
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
that cause the big point that these assholes

2996
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
are trying to make is

2997
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
from a historical standpoint

2998
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
when history disproves them

2999
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
already. Sorry

3000
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I make it a point to study history

3001
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
because you know they say those who

3002
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
who don't know their history are

3003
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
doomed to repeat it we're fucking reliving it

3004
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
right now but

3005
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
you pay attention

3006
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
to it you learn from it

3007
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
and if you knew anything about fucking

3008
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
history first of all you probably wouldn't be playing

3009
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
battlefield but

3010
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
but second of all

3011
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
you would you would know how fucking weak your

3012
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
argument is I mean if

3013
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
you're this poorly

3014
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
prepared for a battle of wits

3015
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
just don't participate

3016
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
here's you know what

3017
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
I Jamie I'm a big fan

3018
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
of giving people a taste of their own medicine

3019
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
so here's what I think you should do let's

3020
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
say let's say I'm a dude and I'm gonna tell you

3021
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
hey Jamie

3022
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
women don't belong in battlefield

3023
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
this is what I think your response should be you ready

3024
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
shut up and go make me a

3025
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
sandwich all right so Jamie

3026
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
a women shouldn't be in battlefield

3027
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
shut up and go get me a pizza

3028
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I have standards

3029
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I think

3030
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
you know what

3031
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I think you just you just give it

3032
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
right back to them the same way

3033
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
it's been you know

3034
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
no I would literally be shut

3035
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
up and go back to fucking school

3036
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
and while you're there get a pizza

3037
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
and while you're there bring me a bread tangle

3038
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
of pizza

3039
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
okay do we remember our strong bad

3040
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
email teen girl squad

3041
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
all right speaking of teen

3042
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
girl squad Loki what's next in

3043
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
the news Loki

3044
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
is so and so this isn't

3045
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
team girl squad but it's

3046
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
team Sonic racing

3047
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
so this was yet another game that was leaked by

3048
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Walmart and now confirmed by

3049
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Sega and they had a

3050
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
teaser trailer that showed nothing except for

3051
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Sonic and

3052
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
his

3053
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
friends racing

3054
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
so I guess we'll

3055
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
look forward to that coming out makes

3056
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
sense that they have Sonic and all-stars racing

3057
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
transformed as your Xbox game of the month

3058
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
so it does make sense

3059
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
and actually that was a good racing game remember

3060
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
that was the one with Danica Patrick as

3061
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
one of the characters yes Sonic

3062
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
and all his shitty friends and Danica

3063
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Patrick it's like and

3064
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
and they also had was at the Sega

3065
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Outrun cabinet they

3066
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
had like ooh la la they had a bunch of like

3067
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Sega characters that were really you know

3068
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
infamous in there this is only Sonic team racing

3069
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
because Sonic he has enough

3070
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
shitty friends to make a whole racing team

3071
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
yeah I really hope that even if it's like

3072
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
team Sonic racing sure maybe

3073
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
it starts with Sonic and his you know Knuckles

3074
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
and all his shitty buddies can we have

3075
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
can we make cannon like

3076
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
you know how they have Sonic and

3077
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
you know all that stuff

3078
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
you know they don't have the Wario version

3079
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
of Sonic can we have Sanic as

3080
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
the Wario version of Sonic

3081
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Sanic and Danky King yeah

3082
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Sanic no why not why not

3083
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
when

3084
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Court

3085
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Ann takes over

3086
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
I mean Sonic is it's pretty

3087
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
you know they're pretty meme-y

3088
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
on their

3089
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
their Twitter so I forgot about that

3090
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Bobby Blackwell says I recently replayed Sonic

3091
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
and All-Stars Racing Transformed Wreck-It Ralph

3092
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
was in there too I totally forgot

3093
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
about that that is totally

3094
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
true was yeah Wreck-It Ralph was like

3095
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
one of the things you unlocked huh yeah

3096
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
I remember that now so anyway

3097
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
everybody super

3098
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Sanic Racing

3099
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I would totally love it

3100
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
said super Sanic hey I still

3101
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
fucking love Sonic R so whatever

3102
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
yeah all right well lastly

3103
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
but not leastly there is a

3104
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
PlayStation E3 experience

3105
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
coming to theaters near you

3106
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
all over again on Monday June

3107
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
11th so yeah you can

3108
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
go to a nearby theater near you

3109
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
tickets will be up this Tuesday

3110
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
at 11am pacific you have

3111
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
to be committed to show up 30 minutes

3112
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
before show time if you're not there

3113
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
30 minutes before show time they're gonna give your fucking seat away

3114
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
so you better look out for that

3115
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
so anyway if you wanna

3116
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
if you live in Northern California

3117
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
near us and you wanna go to one of these

3118
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
events too fucking bad

3119
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
there aren't any here not even

3120
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
in the Bay Area this year the only

3121
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
events in California there are

3122
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
two of them in Los Angeles

3123
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
one at Century City and one at

3124
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
LA Live here's what

3125
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
cracks me the fuck up about that

3126
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
do you know where LA Live is?

3127
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
it's next door to E3 it's next door

3128
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
to the fucking convention center

3129
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
so like I mean I realize

3130
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
the press conference is in a different theater

3131
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
in a different part of LA but it's not that far

3132
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
away I'm sorry but your press conference is in a different

3133
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
theater good lord

3134
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
so they have one literally next door

3135
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
to E3 but they don't have one up here

3136
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
in Northern California

3137
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I don't understand why it's so

3138
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
limited maybe they're paying for the space

3139
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
I don't know what it is well they have to pay for

3140
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
the theaters I guess they're

3141
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
renting all these theaters I thought they just did it through

3142
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Fathom Events or one of those things that kind of already

3143
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
I don't know I mean what do you

3144
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
really get from this stuff like a free like

3145
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Avatar or some bullshit

3146
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
what are we really getting I mean

3147
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
I don't know just watch it on

3148
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
TV there's several people in chat suggesting

3149
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
that they put it in VR Kajuda

3150
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
saying they need to put the Sony press conference in

3151
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
VR cheap asses and as

3152
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Matt says they should actually do it in VR

3153
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Bobby Blackwolf talking about his

3154
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
new basement home theater says

3155
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
curiously there's no listing for my home theater

3156
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
for this experience well Bobby do you really

3157
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
want to have like 30 strangers showing

3158
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
up at your house so maybe it's best that

3159
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
you have a private viewing for

3160
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
you and the misses and maybe any buddies

3161
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
that you invite over to watch it

3162
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
in your 4K of vision

3163
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
which can you watch the press conference I know you

3164
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
can watch Microsoft's thing in 4K because

3165
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Mixer does 4K but does

3166
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Twitch I

3167
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
think actually there's a Sony event

3168
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
viewer they have that I would

3169
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
assume that works and I don't know if that does

3170
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
4K well I don't

3171
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
know yeah

3172
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
they're losers oh Bobby says I only have

3173
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
six seats in the theater well you

3174
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
could that's you the misses and

3175
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
and two other couples grab some floor

3176
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
yeah yeah get some some

3177
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
pillows or something like that lawn chairs

3178
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
anyway

3179
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I'll be watching it on

3180
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
my couch that's how I'll be watching

3181
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
actually I like to do ironic things

3182
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
and what I mean by that is that I will watch

3183
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
the Sony press conference on my

3184
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Xbox and then I'll watch

3185
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
the Microsoft press conference on my PlayStation

3186
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
4 and there's usually ways to do this

3187
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
so actually

3188
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
no I kind of lied because the Microsoft one I'll

3189
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
probably watch on my computer

3190
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
because on my 4K monitor I could actually

3191
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
watch it in 4K so that with

3192
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Mixer so that would be kind of nice so

3193
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
we'll see Bobby Blackwell

3194
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
says Twitch can do 4K most

3195
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
just don't which makes sense because like

3196
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
I don't have the bandwidth to stream

3197
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
4K but Sony probably has

3198
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
the bandwidth to stream 4K so they

3199
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
might do it we'll see you may have the bandwidth

3200
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
but you don't have the bandwidth cap for that

3201
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
uh the Skype line is open if you'd like

3202
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight

3203
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
or maybe something else you can give us a call at

3204
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on

3205
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Skype while we uh continue to

3206
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
debate uh Twitch and 4K and all that stuff

3207
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
I was gonna say you know that Twitch app

3208
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
that's on the PlayStation 4 it would be really nice

3209
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
if that would fucking come out for Xbox One already

3210
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
cause that Twitch app is so

3211
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
dated on Xbox One now

3212
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
like and also like

3213
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
when did they stop doing communities

3214
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
highlights on Twitch

3215
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
that's my favorite part of

3216
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
using Twitch on my desktop

3217
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
is that you can actually look at communities

3218
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
so I can look at say the small

3219
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
streamer community or the LGBT community

3220
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
or Twitch unity which is a big thing

3221
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
they were pushing why can't I get that

3222
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
on the phone app or the

3223
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Xbox One app and I forgot to look and see if it's in

3224
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
the PlayStation 4 app cause the PlayStation 4

3225
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
is currently in my studio

3226
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
so I can hopefully uh do um

3227
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
more streaming from it at some point

3228
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
yeah SJ100Matt says

3229
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
oh god that Twitch app on Xbox One sucks

3230
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
it used to be the best one

3231
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
like when it was first out because it was the only

3232
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
one that would let you force the

3233
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
source formatting and

3234
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
it's how you would ensure that you get a high definition

3235
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
feed coming to your TV

3236
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
so anyway Orange Lounge Radio all

3237
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
one word on Skype yeah

3238
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Hulk I think you're onto something

3239
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Xbox only likes Mixer now they hate Twitch

3240
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
no updates for Twitch on Xbox One

3241
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
I think that might be partially true

3242
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
I mean obviously Microsoft is going to prefer Mixer

3243
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
but I think they would be dumb

3244
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
to just ignore that

3245
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Twitch is a thing

3246
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
it's not Microsoft that's doing those updates

3247
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
so it's Twitch that's making the updates

3248
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
alright well we're gonna take a call

3249
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

3250
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
hey uh it's Ragingator

3251
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
hey Ragingator what's on your mind tonight

3252
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
um

3253
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
actually

3254
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
when Dark Soccer did

3255
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
the Classic Game of the Week

3256
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
that gave me an idea

3257
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
for my

3258
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
call tonight

3259
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
well as she's saying

3260
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
indirectly she

3261
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
mentioned college and all that

3262
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
and that got me thinking back

3263
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
to my college

3264
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
days

3265
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
not to get into too much detail

3266
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
cause you wouldn't make a whole lot of sense

3267
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
unless you're local but

3268
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
I went to Erie Community College

3269
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
North Campus

3270
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
and

3271
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
it's one of those multi-building

3272
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
campuses and in the

3273
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
student center they had

3274
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
what they called the Coffee House

3275
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I think

3276
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
to give you a little bit of an

3277
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
analogy think

3278
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
if you ever saw 90210 back in the day

3279
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
think the Peach Pit

3280
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
yeah

3281
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
it's kind of like that stuff

3282
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
or the Max

3283
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
from Saved by the Bell

3284
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
yeah that too

3285
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
but

3286
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
they served food there

3287
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
and they also

3288
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
had like

3289
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
one of those

3290
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
low

3291
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
I forget what it's called

3292
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
the hockey games with the handles on it

3293
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
you slide the players around

3294
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
hockey

3295
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
yeah so a lot of us had these types of things in our town

3296
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
so what do you want to know about it

3297
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
yeah well I was going to say

3298
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
those of you

3299
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
in the

3300
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
studio

3301
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
and anyone in chat

3302
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
those of you that went to

3303
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
college did your

3304
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
campuses have arcade machines

3305
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
on

3306
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
campus and did you play

3307
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
them and which games

3308
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
did you play in particular

3309
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
and enjoy there did you call us

3310
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
campus have arcades

3311
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
of some sort and what did you play there

3312
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Dar Sacra well I talked about the

3313
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
one at Solomon's that was right across from the campus

3314
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
so University of South Alabama

3315
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
at the time didn't have it but

3316
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
across I mean they had

3317
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Mortal Kombat 2 they had

3318
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
another Mortal Kombat 2 that was one of the early betas

3319
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
they had NBA Jam

3320
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
they had a couple of pins like

3321
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
some of those mid 90's ones

3322
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
not Adams Family

3323
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
they had

3324
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Beta Theater of Magic they had a few

3325
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
of the other ones

3326
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
they had

3327
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
just a bunch of fighting games really

3328
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
and then of course I worked at an arcade

3329
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
but yeah my college campus didn't really

3330
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
have anything like that and then out here

3331
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
when I was going to school

3332
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
there was a DDR machine at Sac State

3333
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
not at Sac State but at

3334
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
American

3335
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
American River College oh right

3336
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
yeah and that

3337
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
got gotten rid of really quick

3338
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
I've been to other colleges

3339
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
oh no South Alabama the other

3340
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
thing we had we had the little arcade in my game room

3341
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
where I worked so we had the World Cup

3342
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Soccer Pinball we had

3343
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Killer Instinct I don't know

3344
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
why I didn't think about it because I fucking worked there

3345
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
maybe I was trying to put it out of my head we had a

3346
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Cyber Slide we had

3347
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
Dark Salkers

3348
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
we had King of Fighters 94

3349
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
they switched out for 95 we

3350
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
had

3351
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Street Fighter Alpha

3352
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
we had

3353
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Fatal Fury Special

3354
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
all kinds of stuff

3355
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
you know sadly I went to school

3356
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
a couple hours north of here in a town called

3357
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Chico which is a little bit north of the Sacramento

3358
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
area and I went to college there

3359
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
and I don't really remember

3360
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
there being I don't there wasn't an arcade on

3361
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
campus I would have known about that there was a student union

3362
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
but I don't remember there being any like video games

3363
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
there like that and to be

3364
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
honest I don't even remember like maybe

3365
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
some of the bars would have an incidental pinball

3366
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
machine here and there but not a lot of arcade games

3367
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
so I was kind of robbed of all that I

3368
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
remember there was a place called

3369
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Ray's that was a video

3370
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
store so to kind of date it a little

3371
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
bit and they had an arcade that was the place

3372
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
you would go to like play arcade games

3373
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
and pinball stuff but it was on like the other side of town

3374
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
so we rarely got to go over

3375
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
there and there was also Chuck E. Cheese which we

3376
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
would you know that was before the kids really

3377
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
took it over and you could still find

3378
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
like regular arcade games there

3379
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
so we would go there sometimes

3380
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
but that was really you know I wasn't as big

3381
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
of a gamer in my college years

3382
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
because there was a lot of other stuff I was going through

3383
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
but I also remember that

3384
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
like in the dorms

3385
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
the fact that I had a Super Nintendo

3386
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
and Mario Kart was a huge deal

3387
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
like the dudes were coming over to play Mario Kart

3388
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
like all the time and so that was like

3389
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
a big deal and then the guys upstairs

3390
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
got a Nintendo 64

3391
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
and you can imagine how that went then they got

3392
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Mario Kart and it was just like non-stop

3393
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
you know and then myself

3394
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
and my best friend in the dorms who lived

3395
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
next door to me he was in the room next door

3396
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
we would do dial-up

3397
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Duke and Nukem 3D matches

3398
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
and the other guys would get into it like they would

3399
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
they would walk over and see where I'm at

3400
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
and then they'd go run over to his room and say okay

3401
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Rob's over in this part waiting for you or whatever

3402
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
and they would do the same thing like they would like try to

3403
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
try to ruin it all the time but we had a good time

3404
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
doing that so that was that was fun

3405
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
so that was what I remember with gaming in college

3406
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
but I do remember also

3407
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
before I went off to Chico

3408
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I did a few things at the community college

3409
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
like one summer I think I did like a summer program

3410
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
during my junior year or something like that

3411
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
and I do remember that the

3412
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
cafeteria there had a very small arcade

3413
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
and the one that I would always play

3414
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Altered Beast

3415
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
was the game that I loved to play

3416
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Rise from the Oak Wave

3417
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
it totally looked like garbage

3418
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
on the Genesis compared to the arcade version

3419
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
but luckily you can play that arcade version now

3420
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
on that Playstation 3 collection they did

3421
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
yeah anyway

3422
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Loki I don't know

3423
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
did you do any like

3424
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
arcade gaming in college around your community

3425
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
no

3426
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
no not really I mean

3427
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
no

3428
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
I did a lot of arcade gaming when I was younger

3429
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
yeah

3430
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
we'd go to different arcades to play different games

3431
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
cause we'd get to have like the

3432
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
7-11 would have the Street Fighter

3433
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Street Fighter 2

3434
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
and then there was a diner that had

3435
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Captain Commando and then there was a

3436
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Rico's Pizza that had a bunch of other games

3437
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
oh yeah Rico's had

3438
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
and there was a local movie theater that had

3439
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
some more games so we just like kind of

3440
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
ride between those and stuff and play different games

3441
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
we spent a lot of money playing Captain Commando

3442
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
a lot

3443
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
but not so much when I was in college

3444
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
cause college is, that was like

3445
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Golf Land

3446
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
time oh that was right when we

3447
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
we all kind of first met

3448
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
that's true

3449
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
there was many arcades

3450
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
I just

3451
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
got a quick question

3452
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
now since I'm not

3453
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
from California

3454
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
is it safe to say that Golf Land is

3455
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
basically your areas equivalent

3456
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
to like Putt Putt Golf

3457
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
or am I way off

3458
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I don't know Putt Putt Golf but I assume

3459
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
you do yeah it's the same thing

3460
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I grew up in Alabama

3461
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
so we had Putt Putt

3462
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
with the big arcade in there you know we also had

3463
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
a place called Mount Asia

3464
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
that was actually like a multi level

3465
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Putt Putt

3466
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
plus arcade

3467
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
I mean that was where I played, what was that?

3468
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Trog

3469
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
oh fuck yeah I do remember Trog

3470
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
and then of course

3471
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
here Dan would tell me about

3472
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
the mine shaft all the time

3473
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
I fucking love the mine shaft that place is the bomb

3474
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
we drove by there on the way out today

3475
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
it's like an abandoned RV place

3476
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
but all the little buildings

3477
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
and stuff and the underground is still there

3478
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
all the structure is still there if somebody wanted to

3479
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
buy it and turn it into a mini golf place again

3480
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
I always refer to the movie

3481
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
The Karate Kid I don't know if you've seen it

3482
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
but there's a scene in the movie when they go on a date

3483
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
and they go to like this big mini

3484
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
golf place and there's arcade machines and stuff

3485
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
and like I remember they're playing the

3486
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
skeet shooting game and he jumps out like don't shoot

3487
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
and she shoots him you know and all that stuff

3488
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
so I figure like every

3489
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
big city has a place like that

3490
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
and so that's golf land for us

3491
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
and what I'm assuming is putt putt golf for you guys

3492
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
and all that stuff so

3493
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
alright

3494
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
well Rachael I'm gonna let you go see if we get any more calls

3495
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
but thanks for the call buddy

3496
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
bye bye you too

3497
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype

3498
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
I'll keep it open just a couple more minutes but not too much

3499
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
longer since we are past nine o'clock

3500
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
and I do want to get to a live

3501
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
stream here in a little bit without keeping

3502
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Bobby up too late he's a night owl

3503
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
anyway but still do you have any

3504
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
last minute stories you want to get to yes I do have

3505
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
one well we see if any calls come in yeah so

3506
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
guitar hero live the GHT

3507
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
service is closing down in

3508
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
December wow

3509
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
okay that is December 1st

3510
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
it'll be shutting down did this just come in

3511
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
well uh yeah it was pretty

3512
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
pretty decent so yeah

3513
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
so the ability to purchase more hero coins

3514
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
um ended a few days

3515
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
I guess on June 1st

3516
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
and it says the

3517
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
iOS version of live

3518
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
uh which is gone from the app store now

3519
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
and they you know players will no

3520
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
longer be able to use their banked hero cash

3521
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
and extra items until or they'll be able to use

3522
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
those until the service shuts down

3523
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
so that's one thing you have to remember with all these

3524
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
games that pushed them you know as being

3525
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
live services like Call of Duty

3526
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Black Ops 3 or

3527
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
4 you know

3528
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
they eventually shut these live services

3529
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
down when they become not popular anymore

3530
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
that's true I kind of forgot

3531
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
that that was a thing to be honest until you

3532
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
said it shutting down I was like I've seen these

3533
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
like they have guitar hero live

3534
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
like you can get them for like 10

3535
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
15 dollars now like the

3536
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
stores but the ones I've seen have been like for

3537
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and I'm like

3538
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
I don't really want to buy and that's the version

3539
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
with the guitar too by the way

3540
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
yeah all right

3541
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
well I don't see any other calls

3542
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
coming in so I think we are going to go ahead and

3543
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
wrap up for the night so I

3544
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
am going to start to go around and get everybody's

3545
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
final thoughts and

3546
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
thank everybody for being here tonight

3547
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
as I always say at the end of every show

3548
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio

3549
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
be sure to tell a friend or two about

3550
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
the show help us spread the word because

3551
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
we are the show where every gamer has a voice

3552
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
but if the voices aren't here

3553
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
to air then we can't

3554
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
air them so again

3555
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
a nice 5 star review on a site like iTunes

3556
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
also goes an awful long way so if you just let us know

3557
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
like where you heard this podcast from or whatever

3558
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
then you know

3559
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
help us out

3560
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
leave a nice review

3561
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
so I would thank Jason

3562
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
for being here tonight but

3563
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
he fell asleep and I tried

3564
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
to tap him to wake him up he's not responding

3565
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
so he's breathing so don't worry he's fine

3566
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
I hear tiny little snoring

3567
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
so I know he's okay but

3568
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
got a feather? well keep in mind here's

3569
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
the thing he was on the road

3570
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
and he told me he's like I think

3571
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
in the past 48 hours I've slept for like 5

3572
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
so I'm not going to give him too

3573
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
hard of a time or make fun of

3574
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
the fact that our show is that boring

3575
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
yeah I think he's just

3576
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I don't want his computer to fall either so if he stays

3577
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
asleep I'll close that for him

3578
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
but I will go ahead and thank

3579
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
him for being here anyway even though he

3580
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
fell asleep I tried to

3581
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
wake him up

3582
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
so I'll go around and give everybody else a final thought

3583
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
DarkSocras do you have the mic? do you have a final thought tonight?

3584
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
people need to not voice

3585
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
their opinions when no one has

3586
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
asked them for it like the guy

3587
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
who looked completely homeless

3588
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
living in his truck who said

3589
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
that he thought that my fiat was garbage

3590
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
I told him

3591
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
well at least it serves a purpose unlike you

3592
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
alright ouch

3593
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
my final thought is

3594
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
I

3595
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
I'm going to miss my short

3596
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
work week this week

3597
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
with my 4 day work week was awesome

3598
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
but it's back to 5 days I have a very busy work week

3599
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
next week but

3600
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Pride will be next weekend it looks like I'll probably

3601
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
end up going to that and then Chicago is just 3 weeks away

3602
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
I'm excited for June

3603
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
it'll be fun last but not least Loki your

3604
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
final thought tonight my final

3605
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
thought is I would like to work

3606
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
on games some more

3607
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
like actually working against

3608
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
I'm trying to get an office

3609
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
like a desk because it's hard to

3610
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
work on a laptop just one screen

3611
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
I need like 3 screens or 4 screens

3612
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
probably 3 screens

3613
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
trying to get a desk set up with 2 24 inch monitors

3614
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
on there as well so

3615
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
it'll help with coding and everything

3616
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000

3617
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
