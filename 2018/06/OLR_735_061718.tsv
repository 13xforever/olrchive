0	16960	This week, spice your morning bread up with the Sonic the Hedgehog imprint for the low
16960	21800	cost of 35 rings, and yes dear listeners, that is an accurate statement, $35 coin rings.
21800	25520	This is just one consumerism-tastic story, happy 16th anniversary to the show where every
25520	32520	gamer has a voice.
32520	36160	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
36160	38220	where every gamer has a voice.
38220	44800	It's Orange Lounge Radio with this, episode number 735 for this June the 17th of 2018.
44800	48960	I'm laughing because I usually listen to Jason's intro, but I didn't listen to the whole thing,
48960	51760	so I didn't catch that Gotta Toast Fast till just now.
51760	56720	Anyway, we're full of surprises tonight, on our 16th anniversary show, my name Rob Roberts
56720	61120	here in studio with you, based out of lovely Sacramento, California, and by my side, as
61120	67680	she has been for the last 16 years, we kind of made a child together in a non-awkward
67680	68680	way.
68680	69680	It's DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
69680	72120	I feel very awkward actually.
72120	73120	How are you?
73120	75600	A little tired because of the food-stravaganza today.
75600	80560	Well, I was going to say, something that's less awkward than having a baby together is
80560	85480	the fact that we had brunch together, and the fact that I literally had cake for breakfast
85480	86480	at this place.
86480	87480	You did.
87480	88480	It was pretty amazing.
88480	92960	We went to this trendy place downtown, this new place called Punch Bowl Social, which
92960	94400	I have no idea where that name comes from.
94400	98120	Well, I keep wanting to say Punch Drunk Social because of that movie, but it's Punch Bowl
98120	101280	Social, and I guess they have these in other towns, but Sacramento has one now, and it's
101280	103200	kind of like Dave & Buster's.
103200	104200	But not as cool.
104200	105200	But not yet.
105200	106200	Well, because the arcade isn't nearly as big.
106200	107920	The bowling alley in the middle of the thing is way too loud.
107920	108920	Yeah.
108920	112000	The bowling alley, they have all these other weird shuffleboard, like, ew, come on down
112000	113000	to play shuffleboard.
113000	114000	Like, who plays shuffleboard?
114000	115000	Who knows?
115000	116000	But anyway, so we went there.
116000	117000	It's from another time, Rob.
117000	120120	But I had this, it was called Monkey Bread French Toast.
120120	121560	It looked like a big slice of cake.
121560	123760	It was a big slice of cake, and I was like, it was amazing, though.
123760	124760	Don't get me wrong.
124760	125760	It was pretty good.
125760	129520	On the outside, it was kind of crunchy-ish, and then the inside was bread pudding, really
129520	135800	nice soft bread pudding, which Rob was kind enough to let me sample both parts, the outside
135800	141080	and a little bite on the end, but I just had an impossible burger that I ate a third
141080	142080	of.
142080	145120	It wouldn't be an episode of OLR if we didn't deviate to talk about food, right?
145120	146120	Because food is amazing.
146120	150960	And then we went to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Company, but we were like, oh, oh, oh, chocolate.
150960	153760	That's the best time to go shopping for candy, is when you're already full.
153760	155720	Although I did buy candy somewhere else.
155720	157360	I know, I know.
157360	158360	Candy is irresistible.
158360	160360	What can we do?
160360	164920	Anyway, let's move on and talk over to Techmaster Loki.
165040	166040	Hi, Loki.
166040	167040	How are you?
167040	168040	Doing good.
168040	169040	Good.
169040	170040	What's on your mind?
170040	171040	Not much.
171040	172040	My mouth's on fire.
172040	173040	Yeah, because you're also eating all this food talk.
173040	174040	Salsa.
174040	175040	Yes.
175040	176040	Yes.
176040	177040	Happy 16th.
177040	178040	You also, I mean, I don't know how you parent with three parents.
178040	179720	Well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't say that.
179720	184000	That's totally, in 2018, you have all sorts of different households, and some households
184000	188000	have three parents, but this is a three-parent household with OLR.
188000	193260	So I mean, this show existed long before your kids were born, your actual kids.
193260	194260	So kind of crazy.
194260	195260	It's true.
195260	196260	Yeah.
196260	197260	But OLR is your favorite child, right?
197260	198260	Yes.
198260	199260	Yes.
199260	200260	Okay.
200260	201260	Just getting that clear.
201260	202260	Just getting that clear.
202260	203980	And of course, we wouldn't be able to do it without you guys in our chat room over at
203980	210220	live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network, as seen on Variety
210220	211220	this week.
211220	214260	I don't know if y'all heard about the Bobby Black Wolf doing the Billy Mitchell panel
214260	216980	thing, but that was covered by Variety this week.
216980	217980	So check that out.
217980	221700	So hello to anybody who may have heard of VOG thanks to Variety and the involvement
221700	222700	with that.
222700	223700	All zero of you.
224180	225180	You never know.
225180	226180	You never know.
226180	229340	Anyway, we do tape live, of course, at the Voice of Geeks Network every Sunday night
229340	233820	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after world famous moderator, Bobby
233820	236500	Black Wolf and his show, The Bobby Black Wolf Show.
236500	242160	As we, I mean, God, we, Bobby and our show have gone together, not all 16 years, but
242160	244940	at least, at least 10.
244940	247200	Probably I don't remember the actual date.
247200	250100	Bobby probably remembers it better than I do, but let's see.
250100	252340	Live 365 as a network was about three years.
252380	257500	And then I think maybe four years we were on all games, but we were syndicated on all
257500	259140	games before our show moved there.
259140	260140	He said 2006.
260140	261140	It was 2006.
261140	262140	So it was 12 years.
262140	263140	All right.
263140	264140	It was when we joined.
264140	265140	So it was 12 years.
265140	266140	I knew he'd know.
266140	268380	For me, you get to a certain point where everything just kind of blends together.
268380	269380	That's for sure.
269380	273440	Well, also joining us in studio tonight, we have a special guest and somebody who's been
273440	278980	here since really the very beginning and was with us those nights at Roseville Golf Land
278980	279980	playing DDR.
279980	282020	And here he is 16 years later.
282020	284740	Say hello, everybody, to Bradley or Arcadian42.
284740	285740	Hello.
285740	286740	Happy anniversary.
286740	287740	Thank you.
287740	292120	I know I broke tradition a little bit by not playing that Para Para song at the beginning,
292120	294700	but I couldn't because, you know, anniversary from Para Para.
294700	296280	Usually we have to open up the show with that.
296280	297700	There's only so many years you can do that.
297700	299700	There's only so many years I can tolerate that song.
299700	303380	No, maybe I'll do it on break, but I wanted to mix it up a little bit for those that are
303380	305380	on the podcast feed.
305380	311020	I did Shut Up and Drive by Rihanna, which we usually don't play like, you know, major
311020	312740	label music before the show.
312740	313740	But it's our birthday.
313740	315380	We're gonna do something different.
315380	319100	And as Jamie pointed out, that song was the big Wreck-It Ralph song.
319100	320980	Remember, they had the was it Wreck-It Ralph 2?
320980	321980	No, it was the first one.
321980	322980	Yeah.
322980	323980	We're going on the track.
323980	326060	I was throwing up the peace sign.
326060	328260	Oh, I thought you were saying Wreck-It Ralph 2.
328260	331380	When you said my name, I was like, yo, V.
331380	334500	I thought you were saying Wreck-It Ralph 2.
334500	338100	And I was like, no, it was the first one, silly.
338100	339600	Anyway, it's not about you.
339600	340600	It's about Arcadian42.
340680	342920	But he's used to these tangents by now.
342920	343920	How have you been, my friend?
343920	344920	I've been OK.
344920	345920	Yeah?
345920	346920	Do you still play music games anymore?
346920	347920	Sometimes.
347920	348920	Yeah?
348920	350920	What kind of music games do you still kind of get?
350920	351920	I rez sometimes.
351920	352920	It's been a while.
352920	353920	I rez like that.
353920	354920	Yeah.
354920	355920	Last one.
355920	359960	And it's been a while, like four years since I played like any rock band.
359960	365880	Like probably the last thing, the actual music game would have been like retrograde, which
365880	367360	you can use a guitar with.
367360	370080	Oh, right, right.
370080	377280	And I was going to say, with the whole rock band, I feel like with four, you know, they
377280	381200	kind of recovered when they did the behind the music parody thing a year later.
381200	383440	But it feels like a lot less people were really into that.
383440	387600	And sadly, I really think those plastic guitar games are kind of dead now.
387600	391040	I feel like music games now are showing up in VR.
391040	397360	You know, when we were at this restaurant, I was mentioning earlier, they do VR, too.
397360	400260	You can like rent a VR station for 30 minutes or an hour.
400260	404920	So we were walking by and somebody was playing Audio Shield, which I was like, oh, I've played
404920	405920	that.
405920	406920	Bobby Block will show me that.
406920	407920	I know that game.
407920	410600	Like, I don't remember a lot, but I remember that game.
410600	412880	And then so that game is really popular on VR, I think.
412880	413880	And then Beat Saber.
413880	414880	I don't know if you've seen that one.
414880	416160	That one's incredible.
416160	417320	And that's all today.
417320	421320	But yeah, I haven't done it in the last actually the last game I played that was a music game
421320	422320	was Dumper.
422320	423320	Oh, yeah.
423320	424320	Like six months ago, though.
424320	425880	That's a really good time.
425880	426880	It's really hard, though.
426880	427880	It is.
427880	430520	I have a hard time getting past like the second world.
430520	434920	It's really the turns, because those timing on the turns are really hard.
434920	438240	And some of the other stuff is kind of weird, too.
438240	440200	You don't have a lot of reaction time in those games.
440200	441480	That's for sure.
441480	444780	And another newer music game that we've been talking about here on the show, you might
444780	446280	be into this, the Just Shapes and Beats.
446280	447280	I don't know if you've seen that.
447280	450580	It's kind of like Bullet Hell meets music game.
450580	451580	It's pretty cool.
451580	454360	Check that out if you get a chance at some point.
454360	457540	I don't know if you've been watching the E3 stuff, but since you liked Rez, did you
457540	459360	see the Tetris Effect?
459360	463080	I saw the trailer.
463080	466000	I have not watched zero E3 stuff.
466000	467080	I watched the Game Boy for it.
467080	469080	They said that's the first song in the game in the trailer.
469080	470080	Oh, the one that's in the trailer?
470080	471080	Yeah.
471080	475000	Well, it's probably the big signature song, just like, you know, the original Luminous
475000	478780	game, which that is another music game that's coming back because the remaster comes out
478780	480920	like in two weeks comes out on my birthday.
480920	485440	So but like, you know, Shinin was the big song from Luminous.
485440	492720	I think everybody knows that first stage in Rez, you know, what's the name of the Mexican
492720	493720	Flyer?
493720	494720	Is that the name of it?
494720	495720	From Space Channel 5?
495720	497760	Yeah, but it was older than Space Channel 5, of course.
497760	498760	I know, but that...
498760	499760	Mexican Flyer, yeah.
499760	500760	Right.
500760	503500	But that's, you can't think of Space Channel 5 and not think of that song.
503500	506720	So I think this is like, I think this is kind of like a trade of Mizuguchi's.
506720	511120	He tends to kind of put these big songs as the first stage in a lot of his stuff.
511120	515160	And so we're going to have that song that was in the trailer, the little trance vocal
515160	517860	thing, will be the first song in Tetris Effect.
517860	519960	So yeah, but the trailer was really cool.
519960	520960	Yeah.
520960	525320	I remember like one person I saw on the forums saying it was like the most pretentious trailer
525320	526320	that they've ever seen.
526320	527320	Really?
527320	528320	I don't know about that.
528320	532480	It was just, when I watched it, I made it maybe laugh a bunch.
532480	535560	Then I must be pretentious because I ate that trailer up.
535560	536920	That's just a matter of fact, for sure.
536920	537920	It's pretty cool though.
537920	538920	All right.
538920	539920	Anyway, let's see.
539920	542420	Rama's pointing out that more music games are coming to mobile phones.
542420	543420	That's true.
543420	544420	You had a decent selection of mobile phones.
544420	547860	I like Neon FM and the whole like the synergy between the arcade and the mobile version
547860	548860	of that.
548860	549860	It's pretty fun.
549860	551360	What was I going to ask?
551360	555260	Oh, you said, Bradley, you're not really watching a whole lot of the E3 stuff.
555260	558920	I assume that's because you tend to play more like classic games, pinball.
558920	560880	Do you get excited about any of the new stuff anymore?
560880	563000	It's just, I don't have any of the new consoles.
563640	566520	Last console was Xbox 360.
566520	569680	I haven't gotten the PS4 or the Switch or the X-Tone.
569680	571120	Have you thought about investing in one of them?
571120	572120	I might get a Switch.
572120	577600	It's just, I might want to play the Zelda, but there's like a bunch of Zeldas I haven't
577600	578600	played.
578600	579600	Gotcha.
579600	583280	I haven't played like a, whatever, I can't remember the name.
583280	585920	Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess and the Wii ones.
585920	586920	I haven't played those.
586920	592240	I haven't even played the Moon one, whatever that one is, the 3A one.
592280	593280	Oh God, Majora's Mask?
593280	594280	Going that far back?
594280	595280	Yeah.
595280	596280	That's okay.
596280	597280	You know what?
597280	598280	I barely touched Majora's Mask either.
598280	601000	You don't need to know the old Zelda games because they're all in different timelines
601000	602000	anyway.
602000	603000	Pretty much.
603000	604000	Just jump into the new one.
604000	606760	The new one's kind of, the new one doesn't really play like the old ones either.
606760	608280	That's another important thing about it.
608280	611720	The new one was very much influenced by open world things like Skyrim.
611720	617560	No, it doesn't play like Skyrim, but I think they kind of took that like hint of just instead
617560	621240	of like in the old school Zeldas, it was like, you have to go to level one and level two
621240	622240	and level three.
622240	625680	But then they kind of saw that like in speed running and so forth, people really like to
625680	627240	break that pattern.
627240	629660	People like to run through the game without a sword.
629660	631120	People like to do all these crazy things to it.
631120	634520	So I think Nintendo sort of, and the developers of that game sort of thought, what if the
634520	636840	game was just about do what you want?
636840	640300	You know, like maybe you don't have to get handheld to all these different things.
640300	641300	It's very open.
641300	644400	And in a way it's kind of jarring at first because you're like, where's my hand holding?
644400	646880	And the game kind of doesn't really give you much.
647720	651680	And not to be too spoilery, but it's been out for a year now.
651680	656260	The game starts you off in this little like area and I say little, but it feels really
656260	657260	big.
657260	659960	And so you go through like the tutorial in this area and you go to these different dungeons
659960	662280	and you're like, wow, this is a really like big area and so forth.
662280	668440	And then you find out you're on one tiny little like island in like this gigantic fucking
668440	669440	world map.
669440	675120	And it's like the world opens up and you're like, oh, this world is like really big.
675120	676560	So it's kind of neat the way they do it.
676560	677560	I really liked it.
677560	678560	Yeah.
678560	679560	Of course.
679560	680560	The big thing is just backlog.
680560	681560	I have so many games.
681560	682560	I never played like everything.
682560	684680	Everyone else, millions of steam games and yeah.
684680	689920	And she said like half of the games that are on my 3ds I haven't played yet.
689920	692380	So Bobby Blackwell is asking, what does he play today?
692380	695120	But I think, I think there's a lot of gamers like you out there.
695120	699440	Not everybody necessarily has that financial luxury or whatever the reason is to just jump
699440	703520	into the new generation until you know, a long time after the consoles have been out
703520	704800	and they come down to like $200.
704800	707000	I think there's a lot of gamers in your position.
707000	709040	So what, what do you play right now?
709040	710040	Okay.
710040	715360	Right now I play mostly stuff on steam and 3ds generally.
715360	719920	The games I'm playing now are, so you're the reason they won't kill off the 3ds.
719920	725120	Maybe when I'm playing 3ds is I play like the Pokemon shuffle.
725120	727920	I play that game all the time for no good reason.
727920	729720	It's a time killer.
729720	730720	Yeah.
730800	734600	The big one I've been playing the last two, by about two months is a game called Slay
734600	737920	the Spire, which is on the, it's on steam.
737920	740880	It's, it's still in early access, but it's pretty much complete.
740880	745760	They're just kind of tweaking various aspects of the actual, like maybe the card cause it's
745760	754040	a rogue-like deck builder game and you basically, you fight a group of enemies on each level
754040	758080	and at the end of the level you get like an, you can get another card or you might get
758080	763040	some, some other benefit and then you pick and choose kind of which way you go and you
763040	769120	kind of try to build towards beating the bosses because there's like three sort of like statements,
769120	773840	three, three areas and there's a boss at the end of it and you kind of, kind of got to
773840	778560	build your deck so that you can actually win and not, and not, and not die of course.
778560	781600	And there's, you have to kind of make different risks and rewards too.
781600	785440	So it's like one of those like PvE, like, like I've played, I played a tabletop game
785440	786800	like that was Sentinels of the Multiverse.
786800	787800	Is that the name of it?
788120	791720	But there's like, there's a, there's a card game where you actually like, you play with
791720	794200	other people and you're actually, you're not fighting each other.
794200	798440	You're fighting like a different card boss in the middle that you're all kind of ganging
798440	798840	up on.
798840	800440	And it's like a deck building type of game.
800440	800600	Yeah.
800600	802360	Well, this is just a single player, but okay.
803000	803560	But I get it.
803560	804280	I get it.
804280	805160	All right, cool.
805160	805480	Yeah.
805480	805800	All right.
805800	806440	It's pretty fun.
806440	809480	As far as other stuff, we'll wait till our gaming weeks to get into other stuff, but
809480	814360	I do want to talk about other E3 going on because, you know, not only is it our 16th birthday
814360	818120	tonight, which by the way, I do need to, you know, even though we kind of stopped doing
818120	822760	big things for anniversary shows a long time ago, I do just want to say, you know, a big
822760	825400	thank you to everybody who's stuck with us.
825400	830040	You know, whether it be for 16 years, Bradley, or whether it be for 16 minutes, you know,
830040	833000	just a big thanks for the support that you guys give to OLR.
833000	837080	I know we're not the biggest gaming podcast out there by far by a lot.
837080	837960	We're not the biggest.
837960	838760	We're the best.
838760	839320	We're just the best.
839320	844520	No, we're best in the way that we can be best.
844520	847240	Just like other shows are the best in the way that they can be best.
847240	848120	We're 16.
848120	852200	We are teenagers with emotional issues and overconfidence.
852200	853560	Nothing can defeat us.
853560	855240	So you're being a stupid spoiled brat.
857080	858440	We're Wolverine.
858440	859720	We're the best we are at what we do.
861400	867480	Well, I try to still be humble whether I'm in my crazy 16 teenage years or not.
868280	872120	But, you know, we obviously wouldn't be here if you guys didn't give us the motivation
872120	875480	to be here by showing up, you know, and the fact that we weren't bored.
875480	879080	Whether you're not whether you're showing up in chat live on Sunday night or you're
879080	884760	showing up on the podcast feed and tweeting at us or I actually made a Facebook post today.
884760	888360	I'm trying because the last time I made a Facebook post, I did a Facebook post with
888360	892680	a bonus episode and somebody was like, oh, you're back on Facebook.
892680	894040	You remembered Facebook.
894040	895880	And I like, all right, guilt me.
895880	896760	Why don't you?
896760	899160	So I was like, all right, I need to remember that Facebook is the thing.
899160	901400	I think Google Plus, I can let that go.
901400	904120	But Facebook, I got to I got to try and interact with that more.
904120	907160	So I made a Facebook post today and you guys left some really sweet comments.
907160	910360	And they were like names I don't see in the email bag or in chat and stuff.
910360	913880	So I was like, oh, shit, there's more people out there than I realize sometimes.
913880	915000	So thank you so much.
915720	920520	I actually forgot to put the thing on my on my personal quote fan page.
921240	926120	But I while I may make the joke, yeah, we do this because we're bored.
926600	930520	But in a nutshell, I wouldn't know what to do with my Sunday.
930520	934520	I rearrange my work schedule when I can for you guys.
934520	936440	I miss out on sleep for you guys.
937480	939640	I mean, not that it's a major thing.
939640	940280	I would do it.
940280	946600	But I was posting that there's two things, two activities that I do that give me life.
946600	951400	And I'm meaning this in the not in the give me life kind of way, but in the squad,
951400	956360	but in the way that makes me feel like parts of my life are great.
956360	958200	And that's what I should be doing.
958200	959880	And number one is the show.
959880	963800	Number two is being a novice sister of perpetual indulgence.
964680	966840	So those are two big things.
966840	969960	One of them is the what we do for you guys on the show.
969960	974920	And the other one is what I do for the LGBTQ, et cetera, community.
974920	976520	So those are two big things to me.
976520	979560	And if I wasn't doing this, I would feel like part of my heart was missing.
980200	982040	So now you made me all sappy.
982840	983960	I almost want to hug you.
983960	984460	Almost.
986280	987160	I will after the show.
988360	991720	No, I when you say like, what else would I do with Sunday night?
991720	992520	Like, that's totally how I feel.
992520	995560	Like, we're not going to be here next week because I'm going to be on vacation.
995560	999720	OK, that's the best present we can give ourselves for being on the air a year is to take a week off.
1000440	1001960	That and I make Rob bring me stuff.
1001960	1005160	But I'm going to Chicago to hang with some friends I have out there.
1005160	1008840	And as you all I've said on the show before, I'm turning 40 this month.
1008840	1012360	So it's kind of like and my husband is turning 40 like two weeks after I do.
1012360	1014520	So this is kind of like our big birthday trip, too.
1014520	1017240	So I'm heading Rob on the head from a distance.
1017240	1020760	This is one of those things where it's like, well, I know I'm fine with turning 40.
1020760	1021320	I really am.
1021320	1024840	Like, I know there's so many people out there that like, wow, 40 is like old.
1024840	1027640	But like, honestly, my 30s were better than my 20s.
1027640	1029480	Why won't my 40s be even better than my 30s?
1029480	1030040	That's my outlook.
1030040	1032680	Well, this is the thing, too, is that people say, oh, you don't look 40.
1032680	1034360	What is 40 fucking look like?
1034920	1037640	Am I supposed to be like middle aged man from Saturday Night Live?
1038280	1042280	No, you're not going to have a bad comb over and wear, you know,
1042840	1045320	polo shirts with your pants pulled up to your boot.
1045320	1047080	I might, though, you know.
1048360	1053400	But I'm saying, you know, 40, especially since people are living longer and taking
1053400	1056680	better care of themselves, 40 isn't middle age anymore.
1056680	1060200	I know so many people that are like having kids at 40.
1060200	1061560	You know, that ain't going to be me.
1061560	1063560	If that's what they choose to do, everybody does.
1063560	1066040	But, you know, like I remember when like people would have.
1066040	1070520	Well, I would because the generation I was born out of, people were having kids at 21,
1070520	1072280	22, and people still do that.
1072280	1073240	People still do it.
1073240	1076520	But I was there's a lot more that are like my mom was 17.
1076520	1077320	It was the 70s.
1077320	1078040	They had drugs.
1078040	1082120	And it's it's and it's well documented on MTV shows that that still happens.
1082120	1084120	But I'm just saying more and more people are like waiting.
1084120	1084680	You know what I mean?
1084680	1089080	Anyway, not to get Dungeon Buster says level 40 unlocks new perks and skill trees.
1089080	1089800	That is true.
1089800	1090680	It really is.
1090680	1092760	So anyway, what was I going to say?
1092760	1094120	I was saying something about going to Chicago.
1095080	1100280	So no, but Sunday night I'm going to be sitting there and the clock's going to hit six o'clock
1100280	1103160	and I'm going to be like, I should be doing well right now.
1103160	1108120	And I do I do I do this when I'm at fucking Dragon Con where I'm like out there promoting
1108120	1111480	Vogue and like kind of doing something very adjacent to this here.
1111480	1112280	I'll sit there and go.
1113000	1115800	And if Bobby happens to be in the same room, I'll be like, Bobby, I should be listening
1115800	1116680	to your show right now.
1116680	1118040	You should be calling me right now.
1118040	1118680	We should be doing it.
1118680	1123000	And, you know, I think one year we even did a pretend live call in the same room.
1123000	1125000	But, you know, that's a podcast.
1125000	1132200	I was sitting in a Jewish deli in West Hollywood looking at my kugel going, I'm supposed to
1132200	1133240	be doing all right now.
1133240	1133640	Oh, shit.
1133640	1134280	My phone's dead.
1134280	1135560	Looks like I'm going to the Apple store.
1136520	1136840	All right.
1136840	1140760	Anyway, Loki, I don't know if you have any any words you want to say about it before
1140760	1142280	we get into E3.
1142280	1142840	Nope.
1142840	1143480	OK.
1143480	1144760	He's a man of many words.
1144760	1147000	Well, Loki, he's a man of a single taco.
1147000	1149320	You know, you you know this.
1149320	1153480	Originally, the plan was Jamie and I were going to start a show and you kind of showed
1153480	1155400	up and you you stayed there.
1155400	1158760	You showed up every single week for many, many, many weeks.
1158760	1162280	And it really got to a point and it is at a point where it's like, I could never imagine
1163080	1165720	not having this show without you on it.
1165720	1166440	You know what I mean?
1166440	1170600	And like your rants, which people don't always agree with.
1170600	1174920	But I think people you know, it's it's you provide a different perspective here on the
1174920	1175560	show.
1175560	1177880	I think it's really brought something to the table.
1177880	1181400	So, you know, I can't imagine or without you on it is basically what I'm saying.
1181400	1183080	I can't imagine it without me either.
1185320	1187800	I don't know if we would have made it this long without you.
1187800	1189000	So who knows?
1189000	1191000	Just like we would have made it this long without her.
1191000	1197320	So anyway, let's get into and if I may say so, you guys have been with me through some
1197320	1204680	pretty big shit in my life through, you know, losing both of my grandmother's, my mom losing
1204680	1211880	her husband, my my wedding, you know, lots of like really crazy life.
1211880	1218840	It's kind of like how people use, you know, the Bible, I guess the B.C. or B.C.E. and
1218840	1220520	then C.E. or whatever.
1220520	1221240	Sure.
1221240	1226920	And for me, I kind of think of things in terms of aspects of my life.
1226920	1231560	Like I have my pre California, my post California, but I have my pre O.L.R., my post O.L.R.
1231560	1234280	because O.L.R. has been the majority of my life here in California.
1234840	1239080	And I think every major important thing that's happened to me in my life has been while doing
1239080	1244840	this show, I'm not like on the show, of course, you know, but major important things.
1244840	1249080	And even doing the show when I was probably at my lowest has always been a high point
1249080	1249560	for me.
1249560	1254360	So I hear that a thousand percent, because honestly, like last year and you guys know
1254360	1257240	this, especially last year, like you guys have been through some shit like when I was
1257240	1259800	really sick, when I was twenty nine, I was like really sick.
1259800	1262360	You know, the show was there and you guys were sending your well wishes.
1262360	1264120	But like honestly, and this is not a secret.
1264120	1267240	You all know this last year was like the worst year for me.
1267240	1272680	And I was not in a really good place with my mental health for several months.
1272680	1275400	And I'm hoping that didn't really come through on the show.
1275400	1278840	I mean, I'm sure you guys could probably figure it out with, you know, how many shows we were
1278840	1281000	kind of missing just everything that was going on and stuff.
1281000	1285160	But like, I have not had a worst year personally than last year.
1285160	1288920	And this show kind of like gave me a reason to get out of bed.
1289560	1295080	Like it's that big, you know, is just that whole like feeling of, but I got to do this
1295080	1299080	thing because I always do this thing and I'm not going to end it over this.
1299080	1303640	You know, it's why, like, even when I'm, you know, dirt sick and physically can't make
1303640	1308600	it to the show, I get on that Skype call to do my classic game or do what I can, you know,
1308600	1310440	unless I'm just completely out of town, you know.
1310440	1310940	Right.
1311320	1315880	But I mean, the show has seen both of us through health scares.
1316440	1316920	Absolutely.
1317640	1321640	And I know Loki had a lot of personal issues, too, with the show during the show.
1321640	1322840	So it's not just us.
1323480	1325080	Yeah, well, I meant all of us.
1325080	1326760	We've all that's life.
1326760	1327960	Let's throw shit at you.
1327960	1331240	All you can do is throw shit back like you're a orangutan.
1331240	1332520	And take it out on some video games.
1332520	1336200	I do have to give a shout out because I just noticed in chat this doesn't happen very often.
1336200	1340360	But the one and only DJ Morpheus joined chat, who you might know as Travis Donovan.
1340360	1344920	And I'm hoping he's here because he bought us a car for our 16th.
1344920	1346760	Did Pod Daddy get us a car?
1347000	1348920	He got us a Hot Wheel.
1348920	1350520	For the podcasters that don't know.
1350520	1352040	No, not a Hot Wheel.
1352040	1356440	For the podcast listeners that don't know, Travis Donovan did Understation Live,
1356440	1357800	which Jamie and I were both.
1357800	1358440	I was a host.
1358440	1362040	You were like the most frequent guest before we had OLR.
1362040	1364760	So, you know, I can say Travis-
1364760	1366040	I've even been a temporary host.
1366040	1369080	I've even said this on DragonCon panels, whether Travis-
1369080	1370120	He just flipped you off, by the way.
1370120	1371720	Whether Travis realizes it or not.
1372360	1375560	Travis Donovan showed me that any idiot can do this.
1377640	1382200	But he didn't get us a Hot Wheel.
1382200	1387880	He got us one of those overstocked fake diecast knockoffs from 99 Cent Store.
1387880	1389880	But it takes a special idiot to do it well.
1390920	1392200	That comes off so shady.
1392200	1393320	It's not supposed to be shady.
1393320	1394120	Travis knows.
1394120	1396040	Travis knows I love him and that's what-
1396040	1399000	As God as my witness, I am that fool.
1401640	1402520	All right.
1402520	1403800	Anyway, let's get into-
1403800	1405480	We got a lot of E3 news to get into.
1406120	1409160	It feels like E3 was like six weeks ago at this point.
1409160	1411000	Like a week moves fast.
1411000	1413400	But so we did our show last week.
1413400	1414680	We were talking about Microsoft.
1414680	1416120	Bethesda happened during the show.
1416120	1417320	We got to wrap that up.
1417320	1421160	But then we got to Monday, which brought us Sony, Ubisoft.
1421160	1424920	So, Loki, if you would kind of recap some of the highlights of these press conferences
1424920	1426040	and we'll talk about each one.
1427080	1427720	Okay.
1427720	1431800	So honestly, in my opinion, there wasn't a whole lot that happened.
1431800	1433960	I mean, it was kind of a disappointment a little bit,
1433960	1435160	but we'll get into that a little bit.
1436120	1439640	So let's talk about the first one that was of the day, Square Enix.
1440440	1447640	Which, they basically showed the same shit that was in the other Xbox conference and whatnot.
1447640	1451960	So they had trailers for Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy XIV.
1451960	1454440	They talked about the new expansion.
1455080	1457560	And there's going to be this Monster Hunter Worlds
1457560	1460920	Final Fantasy XIV crossover thing happening this summer.
1460920	1465480	They showed off the trailer again for Awesome Adventures of the Captain's Spirit.
1467160	1474280	Dragon Quest XI, Babylon's Fall, Nier Automata, Become as Gods,
1474280	1477000	which is the Xbox One definitive edition.
1477960	1482040	Octopath Traveler, they showed off another trailer for Just Cause 4.
1483240	1486520	A game called The Quiet Man, and of course, Kingdom Hearts III,
1486840	1492600	which they also reiterated again that the release date is going to be January 29th, 2019.
1492600	1495160	To bring back to your point, as you mentioned earlier before the show,
1495160	1497320	that's probably not supposed to come out before the show.
1498440	1502840	Yeah, I feel like Square Enix's show didn't really show us a whole lot.
1502840	1506440	And maybe that Kingdom Hearts release date was supposed to be the big announcement.
1506440	1510280	But then I think it was announced at a symphony in Japan or something, right?
1510280	1511800	That's where they first announced it.
1511800	1515640	And I think somebody didn't really figure out that once you say something
1515640	1518760	at a show like that, it will be all over the internet instantly.
1518760	1522280	So I'm not so sure that they were supposed to announce it a couple days early.
1522280	1523880	I don't think it's a big deal at the end of the day,
1523880	1526680	but I do feel like that was supposed to be the big thing.
1527560	1531160	And yes, some of you are like, but wait, they showed that trailer at Microsoft saying
1531160	1532360	they could have cut it short.
1532360	1533800	You know, they could have just cut off the end.
1533800	1536440	It would have been just as impactful.
1536440	1540600	But anyway, like Square Enix really just kind of showed us like a lot of, yes, we know.
1540600	1543160	I think it's more interesting with Square Enix didn't show.
1543240	1547160	Fam has seven remake still, still not around, not there, but okay.
1547160	1552200	They, you know, we probably kind of figured that we would get Kingdom Hearts three
1552200	1554840	or the seven remake, but not both.
1554840	1558520	So they're focusing on the Kingdom Hearts remake seven or Jesus Christ,
1558520	1562120	the Kingdom Hearts three, the seven remake will be next year probably.
1562120	1564600	And no Avengers, no Project Avengers.
1564600	1566200	That was very surprising.
1566200	1572360	No Final Fantasy anything except like a patch in 14, which, you know, I'm a 14 player.
1572360	1574040	I'm all about patches, but let's be real.
1574040	1575720	That's not really big Final Fantasy news.
1576680	1581080	Nothing about continuing adventures in 15, which I'm actually more than okay with.
1581080	1582200	Nothing on 16.
1582200	1586360	I thought this would be the year to say, yes, we're going to make Final Fantasy 16 and leave
1586360	1586600	it at that.
1586600	1587480	I think it's too early for that.
1587480	1588520	They're working on too much stuff.
1588520	1589480	All right, maybe next year.
1589480	1589880	I don't know.
1590840	1594680	Bobby does say the Final Fantasy 14 cross monster hunter thing.
1594680	1595880	Okay, cool.
1595880	1600920	But it's like, it's an event and not really like a whole, it's not even really DLC.
1600920	1602120	It's probably going to be in 14.
1602120	1605240	If you remember 14, Bobby, it's probably just going to be a bunch of fates.
1605240	1605800	And that's it.
1606840	1611160	I'm going to skip the limited run games press conference because these are basically all
1611160	1613720	games that have been out that are just getting physical releases.
1614840	1616520	So there's not a whole lot of news there.
1616520	1618920	I mean, unless you're a collector and that sort of thing.
1619960	1624760	Ubisoft, they showed off, of course, predictably, Just Dance 2019.
1625640	1630760	They showed off a new trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2, which looks interesting.
1630760	1631800	They showed Jade.
1633800	1638600	And then there's this new thing that this kind of pissed off a lot of people.
1638600	1644760	This whole space monkey program, where basically they're teaming up with Hit Record,
1646120	1653000	Joseph Gordon Levitch company to crowdsource assets for the game.
1654760	1658360	So whether that be artwork modeling, you know, like 3D models,
1659240	1666040	music, level design, whatever you're supposed to be contributing to or you can contribute to that,
1666040	1669400	which is weird because that makes it seem like that game is really far off then.
1669400	1675800	And the concern was, well, people are getting they they want free artists basically.
1675800	1678920	They're paying them apparently, but I don't know how well they're paying them.
1680200	1681640	They claim they're paying them.
1681640	1683640	So that was kind of controversial.
1684280	1686920	Rainbow Six Siege, they talked a little bit about that.
1689320	1692280	They showed off a new trials game, Trials Rising,
1692280	1698120	which is going to be coming out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC and Switch in February.
1698840	1701960	The Division 2, they showed off a little bit of that.
1703880	1706520	They talked about the Mario and Rabbids Kingdom Battle DLC,
1706520	1707800	which is coming out later this month.
1708680	1710680	Skull and Bones, they showed a new trailer for that.
1710680	1712760	It's coming out sometime in 2019.
1713720	1718760	A game called Transference, which is a game by Elijah Wood.
1720280	1723240	I mean, it's nice to know what Elijah Wood's doing these days.
1723240	1723800	Yeah, yeah.
1725400	1729240	There's a game that they showed off called Starlink Battle for Atlas,
1729240	1731400	which is kind of like a space shooter.
1731400	1736440	Think of like a twice to life version of Star Fox, No Man's Sky.
1736440	1736840	Yes.
1736840	1740360	And they also are including Star Fox in the game as well.
1740360	1743400	So you can like swap out parts of your ship in real time.
1743400	1749880	And I don't know, I'm just, I'm a little done with the Toys of Life stuff, honestly.
1749880	1753160	Yeah, I kind of thought we were past that too, but apparently, yeah.
1753160	1756440	Ubisoft doesn't like to take really strange risks.
1756440	1763000	I mean, remember they had that one year with laser tag vests and their, you know, health.
1763000	1764120	Oh God, I remember that year.
1764120	1764760	Yeah, yeah.
1764760	1767880	Now I was like, whoa, laser tag, I'm all down with that.
1768440	1772120	Uh, SGA 100 Matt in our chat at live.vognetware.com says,
1772120	1775480	I think Starlink is the closest thing we'll get to a Star Fox game for a while.
1776040	1777480	Um, possible.
1777480	1779160	It definitely was not at Nintendo's.
1779160	1780280	Well, Nintendo mentioned Starlink.
1780280	1782360	We just got a Star Fox game, what, last year?
1783560	1785720	I guess, but, or the Wii U one?
1785720	1785880	Yeah.
1785880	1787320	That was like two years ago, I think.
1787320	1788600	Because Switch was last year.
1788600	1790200	Well, they quit your whining.
1790200	1791400	Where's our F-Zero game?
1791400	1795800	Where's our racing game that, you know, is Toys Life stuff, you know?
1795800	1796300	The fuck?
1796860	1797820	You guys are complaining.
1797820	1799180	Oh, where's my Star Fox game?
1799180	1799580	I have it.
1799580	1801500	It's been two whole years.
1801500	1802620	Oh, wine.
1803260	1809100	Um, anyways, so for Honor, um, they showed off some new stuff that they have for that.
1809100	1815100	They have a new, um, I guess expansion for marching fires that has four new, new fighters.
1815580	1817740	Um, they also have this new castle siege mode.
1817740	1821500	Plus they gave out the game for free on Uplay.
1821500	1822940	I think that offers over though.
1823500	1828620	Um, the crew too, they showed that in the open betas starting this week.
1829260	1832860	And then Assassin's Creed Odyssey is of course, they finished with that and that's coming
1832860	1834220	out in October.
1834220	1837740	Which looked really interesting for an Assassin's Creed game, which I don't usually get into
1837740	1838140	those games.
1838140	1839580	Like I'm not trying to shade Assassin's Creed.
1839580	1842620	It's just, I don't have time to play everything, but I like the fact that they're giving all
1842620	1844620	these like branching story choices and stuff.
1844620	1846380	It looked like Mass Effect in a way.
1846380	1849820	I was like, oh, there's my new Mass Effect game, sorta, sorta.
1849820	1855100	And obviously, you know, the team took their lashes a few years ago with the whole, it's
1855100	1858300	too hard to render a woman and the things that they paid for with that.
1858300	1861500	Uh, so now right off the bat, they're like, you want to play as him or you want to play
1861500	1862000	as her.
1862540	1866460	And then as part of the story, it's like, you can just, it's, it's grease people.
1866460	1867900	You can romance anyone.
1867900	1871900	So kind of, kind of neat to see that direction that Ubisoft's going.
1871900	1874140	I'm, I'm curious about some of the like narrative stuff.
1874140	1875580	I'm not just fixated on the romance.
1875580	1879500	I like the fact that the story is kind of taking on that branching stuff.
1880380	1884460	I, I will be looking more into this and I don't usually get into Assassin's Creed games.
1885180	1888300	Um, no, then we'll get to the Sony conference.
1888300	1891660	So Sony didn't show off a whole lot of stuff.
1891660	1893980	They showed off some extended looks at different games.
1893980	1897820	So they started off with The Last of Us 2 after wasting a bunch of fucking time playing
1897820	1898700	music.
1898700	1905660	And then, um, you know, after that they talked about, they're supposed to be a new, um, like
1905660	1907100	I got a word, new game plus.
1907740	1911420	I just want to say real quick, that musician, as I understand it, is a really respected
1911420	1913180	musician for that instrument that he plays.
1913180	1918780	But that kind of, the unfortunate is that kind of stuff is I think really just lost
1918780	1920220	on an E3 audience.
1920220	1925660	It just is like, like I get what they're trying to do, but like you've got a finite amount
1925660	1930700	of time here to show off stuff and you're wasting how much of it of not only that, like
1930700	1935100	it's the exact same criticism we gave to Bethesda last week with their music.
1935180	1937100	And don't get me wrong, that's fine.
1937100	1940380	But then on top of it, they're like, oh, and we're moving venues.
1940380	1941820	Let's take 10 minutes to do that.
1941820	1945580	It's like, why, why were you doing that?
1945580	1949100	Yeah, I heard at the show there, it was, it was pretty messy.
1949740	1953740	Like people were like, why are we just standing in the back of this barn?
1953740	1955820	Like, are we going to have to stand here for two hours?
1955820	1957340	Like, heck no type of thing.
1957340	1960460	And then like, it was just, it sounded like it was really weird, but anyway, I'll let
1960460	1961100	you finish it.
1961100	1964300	I've got, I got some opinions on what Sony did, but I'll let you finish.
1964540	1966700	Then they show Call of Duty Black Ops 4.
1967420	1968940	All they do is talk about map packs.
1968940	1970060	So they've got this like thing.
1970060	1973260	If you preorder, you get some older maps and stuff.
1973260	1977580	Black Ops 3, though, is available for PlayStation Plus users.
1977580	1978220	So that's cool.
1978220	1981260	So I got in on that because I didn't have it yet.
1983020	1988460	And then they showed off or they talked while they were transitioning stages or whatever.
1988460	1990700	They are showing off some of the announcements that they did.
1990700	1996380	So they showed off the Tetris Effect, Days Gone, Twin Mirror, Ghost Giant and Beat Saber.
1997660	2002140	They should not have announced them on Twitter earlier in the week if they were going to
2002140	2003820	announce them during the show.
2003820	2006460	All they were doing is like, yeah, they took the wind out of their own sails.
2006460	2007180	So that move.
2007180	2007500	Yeah.
2007500	2012300	In my opinion, they showed off Destiny 2 Forsaken.
2012300	2014060	That's coming out September 4th.
2014060	2018140	The next big thing that they showed was Ghosts of Shusima.
2018140	2021500	And of course, with that, they also had a musical intro with that.
2022460	2024700	Gameplay looks fucking gorgeous, though.
2024700	2025740	So that's pretty awesome.
2026780	2028460	A game called Control.
2028460	2030780	That's going to be like it looks like Quantum Break.
2030780	2032460	That's coming out in 2019.
2032460	2036780	Resident Evil 2 is getting a full remake and that's coming out January 25th.
2037900	2043180	Trover saves the universe, which is the new Justin Roland game.
2043900	2045580	The greatest of Rick and Morty.
2046540	2049580	So that's going to be coming out soon, hopefully.
2050300	2052300	They showed off more Kingdom Hearts 3.
2054300	2057020	They talked about like the Pirates of the Caribbean thing.
2057020	2059020	And plus, there's a limited edition PS4 Pro
2059020	2061420	that's coming out with all of the Kingdom Hearts games.
2062780	2065020	Then they showed gameplay of Death Stranding.
2065020	2068220	And I still have no fucking clue what that game is about yet.
2069660	2072700	I mean, but it's neat, I guess.
2073260	2074460	No Man Stranding.
2074460	2078220	I have no idea what it's about, but it's a game.
2079260	2083420	Neo 2, they showed off more Spider-Man.
2083420	2088060	And then a game called The Scene, which is from From Software.
2089100	2090780	And it's a PlayStation VR game.
2090780	2091980	I don't even remember that.
2093740	2095740	But I think they showed that at the end.
2095740	2101020	That was like after that, because it was really ambiguous when their thing ended.
2101020	2103100	Because it was very clear they were trying to get people to stay
2103100	2108620	to watch more of their little like blended kind of like pre-show post-show thing
2108620	2112620	that they also kind of had in the middle of that while they were changing venues and so forth.
2112620	2115660	So it was really kind of weird when it ended.
2115660	2118060	But OK, here's the thing with Sony.
2118060	2122460	Like, I think Sony took a big risk with the way that they did their thing this year.
2122460	2125100	They warned us it was going to be different.
2125100	2126060	So I'm going to give them that.
2126060	2126700	They warned us.
2126700	2129100	They said, don't expect bombshell announcements this year.
2129100	2130940	We're going to focus on these four games.
2130940	2132300	They told us what games.
2132620	2137100	They set us up and they took a risk with this whole venue thing and the moving and all that
2137100	2137500	stuff.
2137500	2139900	So I applaud Sony for taking the risk.
2139900	2142300	That said, it was a miss for me.
2142300	2143020	Totally.
2143020	2144220	Like it didn't work.
2144220	2145500	It was a risk that failed.
2145500	2151500	I hope Sony learns that and kind of goes back to honestly, the type of press conference
2151500	2155260	that Microsoft kind of excelled in this year.
2155260	2156140	I don't like to grade.
2156140	2158060	I don't like to say one E3.
2158060	2160860	I like to look for positives and constructive criticism to everybody.
2160860	2166140	But the reality is the criticism I have for Sony this year is that Microsoft kind of was
2166140	2167420	more effective at your game.
2167420	2168620	Here's my issue, though.
2168620	2171100	Like, let's let's just talk about the games that they showed, though.
2171100	2172460	The first party games.
2172460	2173980	What's coming out this year?
2173980	2175900	None of their games are coming out this year.
2176540	2177260	The Spider-Man.
2177260	2178140	Spider-Man was okay.
2178140	2178460	Fine.
2178460	2179820	Spider-Man is coming out this year.
2179820	2180460	Yep.
2180460	2181180	But that's it.
2181180	2182140	I mean, that's September.
2182140	2183980	I mean, like, I don't disagree with you.
2183980	2191340	It's like Sony was kind of especially when we get into some of the things later in the
2191340	2191580	show.
2191580	2193820	And if you all been watching gaming news, you know what's coming.
2194540	2198940	Sony is sitting up on this throne right now, and they kind of feel like being up on this
2198940	2199740	throne.
2199740	2201260	They can do some stuff.
2201260	2202140	But you know what?
2202700	2205580	Microsoft making a lot of improvements.
2205580	2208940	I think things are going to really turn around for them when we get to at least to the next
2208940	2209740	realm of consoles.
2210700	2216460	The Switch, both Sony and Microsoft have kind of dismissed Nintendo as true competition
2216460	2219980	for a long time because they are kind of everybody's second place console.
2219980	2226780	But I think what Sony is allowing to happen by not really highlighting a lot of what's
2226780	2227740	happening this year.
2227740	2231420	And Microsoft gets some of this criticism, too, is that when it comes to the holiday
2231420	2234620	and systems that people are going to buy, I think the Switch is going to start to look
2234620	2235740	more and more attractive.
2235740	2240620	You just heard our guest Bradley say that he was thinking about getting a Switch if
2240620	2242780	he's going to jump into this new generation of consoles.
2243260	2247100	And I think that might be where a lot of people's minds are at.
2247100	2250700	So that was another reason I think Sony's conference was a miss for me.
2250700	2254940	And honestly, I'm going to be very real, and this is not going to be a popular opinion.
2254940	2255420	I'm sorry.
2255420	2258860	You're just going to have to deal with this particular gamer's opinion because it's the
2258860	2260300	show where every gamer has a voice.
2260300	2264780	I understand a lot of you are very excited about Last of Us 2 and the Samurai game.
2264780	2269500	And you'll notice I don't even remember the name of the Samurai game and these other games.
2270540	2272860	I don't really like...
2272860	2275180	I was like, that Samurai game is gorgeous.
2275180	2276300	It's pretty.
2276300	2278620	And then while I was watching, I was like, it's really not for me.
2279180	2284940	The Last of Us 2, I give Sony huge props, huge praise.
2284940	2292060	The fact that here we are in the year 2018 and a major game company, major game publisher
2292700	2299420	opens their press conference, essentially, with a well-executed, not a stunt, but a well-executed
2299420	2300860	same-sex kiss.
2300860	2303180	Like, Sony gets massive props from me from that.
2303180	2304060	I will give them that.
2304060	2308140	Sony fucking rocked that with the representation and everything.
2308140	2312300	But I have to say, honestly, as much as I really want to support that game, then it
2312300	2314060	got into what the game actually is.
2314060	2316380	And it was that whole scene with the disemboweling and all that stuff.
2316380	2317340	I was like, this is nasty.
2317340	2320140	I don't want to play an uber violent game like that.
2320140	2323260	That's just not the type of stuff I'm into really so much.
2323260	2326460	You know, when it's cartoony, it's fine.
2326460	2327740	I don't like Mortal Kombat.
2327740	2330060	The old Mortal Kombat games was cartoon shit like that.
2330060	2331100	It's fine.
2331100	2335340	But when it's like, when it's that, like, I was like, that's a little too real for me.
2335340	2337180	And y'all know I hate those Saw movies and stuff.
2337180	2340780	And so, like, I was watching all that going, this is like, am I turning into my mom?
2340780	2343660	I'm saying this is, this is gross.
2343660	2348780	I never played the first, I mean, I never played the first Last of Us.
2348780	2352700	And I'm just, it doesn't look interesting to me.
2352700	2356700	I'm not really into a huge amount of this, like, stealth action games.
2357740	2359180	I mean, it looks like a gorgeous game.
2359180	2360140	I'm sure it's great.
2360140	2361740	Not a game I want to pick up, though.
2361740	2362060	Yeah.
2362060	2366540	And same with, like, Spider-Man looks all right, but I never really pick up Spider-Man
2366540	2366780	games.
2366780	2367660	Me neither.
2367660	2369260	And so, like, I'm right there with you.
2369260	2371900	I'm like, wow, if I played these games, I'd play that.
2371900	2373020	But I just don't have enough time.
2373020	2373660	Exactly.
2373660	2376860	Or like, even like the Ghost of Shazima, I'm like, that looks fucking hard.
2376860	2379900	Well, not a game I probably can pick up.
2379900	2381900	Here's the, I think, you know what this is leading to?
2381900	2386860	I think in some ways, Sony showed very strong diversity with what I just mentioned.
2387420	2392220	But ironically, they didn't show good diversity with the games they were showing at the show.
2392220	2394540	And I think that was their biggest weakness.
2395260	2398700	That's the whole problem with most of the entertainment industry anyway, is tokenism.
2399500	2403900	Well, I'm not even talking about the LGBT representation, all that stuff.
2403900	2407660	I'm talking about just the games were all cut from a similar cloth to me.
2407660	2408620	That's what I'm talking about.
2408620	2412380	They throw in the things that they think everyone wants as a token.
2412380	2412940	Right.
2412940	2418780	You know, yeah, we want to see more, you know, quilt bag characters.
2418780	2421180	Yeah, we want to see people of other ethnicities.
2421180	2427900	Yeah, we want more strong female leads, but they do the same kind of game over and fucking over.
2427900	2429180	Okay, I get what you're saying.
2429180	2435820	I still think, though, I cannot, I don't want to criticize Sony's big move for making L.
2436380	2440220	Ellie in a game of that caliber for spotlighting that.
2440220	2442620	Like, I really don't want to criticize that because it did,
2443260	2446700	you know, watching the intro, watching the scene was it really didn't feel token to me.
2446700	2453420	Like, it wasn't like, God, what's like, sometimes you play those Japanese anime titty games,
2453420	2458060	and there might be like, like, I don't even want to say Bayonetta because I think Bayonetta is
2458060	2461100	parody, but, you know, some of those games are sexy lesbians.
2461100	2461900	Yeah, like Galgun.
2461900	2462940	That's tokenism.
2462940	2463440	Okay.
2464060	2467900	But I didn't I didn't I wasn't I was more thinking like it's the throw a bone.
2468460	2470460	I just didn't really get that.
2470460	2475500	I mean, I'm not a lesbian, so maybe I or bi because technically it just shouldn't matter.
2475500	2476940	It should just be a natural part of the game.
2476940	2483420	I want ace characters, but I haven't had one yet except for one ever in Borderlands.
2483980	2489500	So but the diversity of the games themselves, I think, was was Sony's weakness.
2489500	2493660	And the fact that these other games like the Tetris effect and the other stuff was kind of
2493660	2497180	like, oh, and by the way, we announced this earlier this week, too, was kind of like,
2497180	2500540	well, give you should probably show that a little bit, too.
2500540	2503820	And then, OK, they gave a lot of time to Kingdom Hearts three, which is great.
2503820	2505820	That is the kind of game I'm signed up for.
2505820	2509180	Too bad I already saw it twice before Sony's thing.
2509180	2510860	So it felt really redundant at that point.
2510860	2511660	You know what I mean?
2511660	2512160	Yeah.
2512160	2517680	So and it was really weird to me how there was all this stuff missing from E3 completely.
2517680	2520960	Where was Soul Calibur six at anybody's show?
2520960	2523120	Where was Red Dead Redemption two?
2523120	2525760	I would have thought for sure that would have been a Sony thing.
2525760	2531120	Well, you have to also remember there's Gamescom in a few months, too.
2531120	2531760	Yes.
2531760	2533680	So it struck me as weird.
2533680	2534320	It was weird.
2534320	2535120	Where was dreams?
2535120	2536720	They had the transitions with dreams.
2536720	2538080	They didn't talk about that at all.
2538080	2540720	No, it was just it was weird.
2540720	2542560	Sony was just weird this year.
2542560	2543520	They took a risk.
2543520	2544400	I didn't like it.
2544400	2545920	I hope they don't do it again.
2545920	2548160	The only other thing I'm going to say Death Stranding.
2548800	2549280	All right.
2549280	2554000	It looks pretty, but I've officially had it with the teases for Death Stranding.
2554000	2556720	We're getting into No Man's Sky territory here.
2556720	2561680	Yes, I realize some of what they showed there was the gameplay, but I'm sorry.
2562320	2564720	They didn't really explain, like, what is the game?
2564720	2567440	And I know some of you might all be, but that's the art.
2567440	2568480	That's the mystery.
2568480	2572880	Look, I fucking stand David Lynch's Twin Peaks hard.
2572880	2576160	And if you want to know about something that doesn't make any fucking sense, let's talk
2576160	2577920	about David Lynch's Twin Peaks.
2577920	2582560	But my point is with this Death Stranding thing, like, they've shown it over and over
2582560	2584560	and over and over again.
2584560	2586160	And it's just like, okay, you know what?
2586160	2587040	Put up or shut up.
2588800	2590640	Like, it just kind of, like, feels like the thing.
2591440	2592960	It's just it's the new No Man's Sky.
2592960	2595600	And I worry in some ways it might end up disappointing.
2595600	2596320	Maybe it won't.
2596320	2596880	And you know what?
2596880	2597760	Maybe I'll decide.
2597760	2601120	I play the game and I'll be like, oh my God, I was so fucking wrong.
2601120	2602480	This game is incredible.
2602480	2608560	But I just think if there is such a thing as too much promotion, too much teasing, we're
2608560	2610560	getting to that line with Death Stranding.
2610560	2613600	That was what they did with No Man's Sky.
2613600	2616320	Yeah, it became good eventually.
2616320	2619360	Anyway, go to our chat at live.vog.network.com.
2620320	2623840	At Def does want to clarify the Last of Us girl is bi.
2623840	2625920	It was explained in the DLC for the first game.
2625920	2629040	Well, I'm glad I did say it could have been either or.
2629040	2629840	I was not aware.
2630640	2633600	Certainly would not want to erase any sexualities here on the show.
2634160	2637200	Sia Tabiri in chat says Twin Peaks makes more sense.
2637200	2639200	Inland Empire is the one that did make sense.
2639200	2641680	I saw Lost Highway in the theater, okay?
2641680	2642640	You want to talk about a movie?
2642640	2644000	It doesn't make any fucking sense.
2644560	2646640	Go watch a movie called Lost Highway from the 90s.
2647680	2650640	Tigerclaw in chat says you have to take into account that this is Kojima.
2650640	2652800	His games tend to have really weird shit going on.
2652800	2653920	It's Kojima's trait.
2653920	2655760	Okay, Tigerclaw, I do get that.
2656000	2659200	But it's been weird shit for four years now.
2659200	2662160	Like, where's the fucking game?
2662160	2663520	God, can you imagine?
2663520	2665520	Is the game walking from place to place?
2665520	2668800	If it's a walking sim or that whole thing, then okay, cool.
2668800	2670240	I don't think that's what it is.
2670800	2673680	Can you imagine if he actually did Silent Hills, man?
2674480	2676880	I feel like a lot of probably what was going to be in that game
2676880	2678800	is probably going to be in this, but we'll see.
2678800	2681840	Anyway, SG-100 Matt does say I'm in the same boat,
2681840	2683840	three years of this nonsense of Death Stranding.
2684640	2687520	Dungeon Buster says I feel that Kojima's Metal Gear Solid teases
2687520	2690560	had a lot more information going on with him than Death Stranding does right now.
2690560	2691440	Yes, agree.
2692240	2694320	Anyway, sorry, I will stop ranting on that
2694320	2695920	because I don't want to be overly negative,
2695920	2699520	but I'm just like, please stop showing that game
2699520	2702160	until you're ready to show us the game and the release date.
2702160	2703600	I do not want to see that game again.
2705600	2707040	All right, is that it for Sony?
2707040	2708000	That's it for Sony.
2708000	2709360	Let's talk about the Nintendo Direct.
2710000	2712080	So Nintendo Direct started off with a game called
2712080	2720080	Daemon X Machine, and it's basically a spiritual successor to Armored Core,
2720080	2721200	at least that's what it looks like.
2721200	2723760	So awesome metal soundtrack coming in 2019.
2723760	2727280	It's a pretty cool name, like a play on Deus Ex Machina.
2727840	2732320	So then they showed off Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is getting,
2732320	2734240	I guess, some DLC that's coming out in September.
2735200	2739200	They showed off more Let's Go or Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee
2739840	2743600	and talked about the transfer as well as the Pokeball Plus
2743600	2745200	is going to come with Mew in every single one.
2745760	2747840	And that's going to be coming out November 16th.
2748560	2752480	Super Mario Party, and they even have a way
2752480	2754480	that you're going to be able to use multiple switches
2754480	2758400	to play across two screens, which is kind of interesting.
2760560	2762960	They have Fire Emblem Three Houses,
2762960	2764240	which is coming out in the spring.
2764880	2766400	Fortnite was out that day.
2767200	2769600	They talked about some of the indie games,
2769600	2775440	so they highlighted Overcooked 2, Killer Queen Black, and Hollow Knight.
2777040	2780080	And then they talked a little bit about Octopath Traveler,
2780080	2782400	which had a demo that came out as well.
2782400	2784320	I actually know a little bit, I haven't played it yet.
2785600	2790000	Dragon Ball FighterZ coming out October 2018.
2790640	2794000	And then they talked about, of course, the big announcement,
2794000	2796160	Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
2796160	2799920	And it's got every character in every Smash game so far,
2800880	2805040	and even bringing back Snake, and yes.
2805040	2807760	And of course, along with that, they announced new characters.
2807760	2812960	Daisy, they added, she's now what's called an Echo Fighter,
2812960	2815440	so basically like a clone of another character.
2816000	2817760	Does she still have an eyeball in the back of her head?
2818720	2820160	I don't believe so.
2820160	2821600	It would be cool if she did, though.
2821600	2823920	Maybe one of the reskins or something, who knows?
2824480	2828640	And then Ridley is also playable, and they've got amiibos coming for them as well.
2828640	2832160	And that's coming out this year, December 7th, so pretty awesome.
2833600	2836560	I sensed that there was a lot of people that didn't really care for Nintendo's presentation,
2836560	2838880	because they focused on Smash Brothers too much.
2838880	2841120	Because yes, it was all Smash Brothers.
2841120	2842480	It's 30 minutes of Smash Brothers.
2842480	2844640	Don't get me wrong, I love Smash Brothers.
2844640	2847840	I just wish, it's like, where's Metroid Prime 4?
2848720	2851520	Where's the Yoshi game that you guys talked about?
2851520	2853600	Where's Animal Crossing?
2853680	2855760	Where's anything else?
2855760	2857520	It's like, where is all this stuff?
2857520	2859360	I agree and I disagree.
2859360	2861760	Like, certainly, I would be lying.
2861760	2863440	I would be straight up lying if I didn't say.
2863440	2864720	There wasn't that part of me that was like,
2864720	2867680	oh, I wish they teased us a little more on Metroid Prime 4.
2867680	2870640	Or I wish we kind of got some other stuff as well.
2870640	2873840	I mean, we did get some new announcements in there with the Super Mario Party
2873840	2876960	and the mech game and, you know, some of those things they were showing.
2876960	2878560	There were at least some new things in there.
2878560	2882320	But I'd be lying if I wasn't saying I wouldn't have appreciated some of these other teases.
2882320	2884880	However, what I will give Nintendo credit for,
2884880	2887200	that I think a lot of people are overlooking,
2887200	2891040	is that the things they showed are coming a lot sooner
2891600	2896000	than collaboratively what Sony, especially Sony, or Microsoft showed.
2896000	2901440	Is that most of what you saw, like 90% of what Nintendo showed, was this year.
2901440	2904560	And they still do these directs every month or so.
2904560	2905060	Right.
2905600	2906100	Exactly.
2906640	2908400	You could think that they'd have other things.
2908400	2909600	I just wish they would say,
2909600	2912080	tease some stuff and like, oh, we'll have directs to talk about.
2912080	2913360	For like, I didn't need...
2913360	2914480	Which they did last year.
2914480	2915040	Yeah, exactly.
2915040	2919840	I didn't need Super Smash Brothers Ultimate to tell me what the differences were in the characters.
2920480	2923600	All of the characters, like, here's all of the differences.
2923600	2926480	I didn't need that 30 minute long explanation.
2926480	2930720	That was a bit deep dive that maybe wasn't needed for the whole audience.
2930720	2933200	Like that could be in like your Smash Direct that you do.
2933200	2935600	We did not need to waste 30 minutes doing this.
2935600	2939360	How about give 10 of those minutes to talking about Nintendo Online?
2940160	2940720	Exactly.
2940720	2942640	What the fuck is Nintendo Online?
2942640	2944320	Because we haven't talked about it.
2944320	2945440	We have a web page.
2945440	2946800	This was that opportunity.
2946800	2949920	So I was very surprised that was not there at all.
2949920	2953920	And y'all know, I've been wondering, like, what is Nintendo's fucking retro plan already?
2953920	2957120	And I feel like we're going to hear about it the day before at this point.
2957120	2961440	The day before it's live is when we'll finally find out what their fucking retro plan is.
2961440	2963920	Because I guess they don't want people analyzing it to death or something.
2963920	2964800	I don't know.
2964800	2966240	But it's, uh, yeah.
2966240	2969280	I mean, I didn't, I didn't hate what Nintendo did.
2969280	2972640	No, but it was, you know, again, and I kind of looked through it at the lens of,
2972640	2974240	okay, well, at least they're just showing, like,
2974240	2978160	here's the stuff to hold you over till our next direct type of thing.
2978160	2979760	And I was like, all right, I'm okay with it.
2979760	2982960	And honestly, you know, again, I don't like to do grades.
2982960	2987920	I don't like to do the whole who won E3, but I am going to say the press conference
2987920	2992000	that kind of surprised me this year of like, wow, I kind of feel like they put on
2992000	2993760	the strongest thing was Microsoft.
2994320	2995120	Yeah.
2995120	2999680	And I think it's because everybody let Microsoft do the third party unveils.
3000320	3004640	And Microsoft really had a whopper of an announcement with the fact that
3004640	3009040	we're positioning ourselves to really kick some butt with our next console
3009040	3012160	by acquiring four studios and building a fifth.
3012160	3017120	You know, that if I was a Microsoft Stan, which I'm a fan of everybody,
3017120	3019200	but if I was like one of those Microsoft fan boys,
3019200	3022240	like certain other podcasts I've heard before, I would have been really excited.
3022400	3024320	Plus, they had a lot of announcements.
3024320	3028240	Granted, a lot of them are like far out, but like they announced a new Halo game.
3028240	3029920	They announced three new Gears of War games.
3029920	3031360	They announced a new Forza game.
3032000	3034560	I mean, they got a lot of stuff coming.
3036560	3039120	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, stop showing me Death Stranding.
3039120	3040800	I'm tired of seeing it three minutes later.
3040800	3043360	Why didn't they show us more about Metroid Prime 4?
3043360	3045440	Okay, I'm going to show you the difference here.
3046240	3051040	One, Sony is not only showing Death Stranding shit at E3.
3051040	3052960	They're showing it at PSX.
3052960	3054720	I think they did one at Gamescom, didn't they?
3054720	3056720	Didn't the Guillermo del Toro thing come out of Gamescom?
3056720	3058320	Yeah, or Tokyo Game Show or something like that.
3058320	3060240	They've also been joining the Game Awards.
3060240	3060720	That's it.
3060720	3062960	The Game Awards is the other thing that I'm not thinking of.
3062960	3065600	So they're showing Death Stranding like multiple times a year,
3065600	3067440	just like they were doing in No Man's Sky.
3067440	3069920	Metroid Prime, we haven't seen in like a year.
3069920	3073280	And I'm not saying, we don't need to have a 20-minute deep dive
3073280	3075840	on Metroid Prime 4 if it's not coming out to 2019,
3075840	3078320	but it just might be cool to see a screenshot,
3078960	3081120	uh, something that kind of gives us, is it 2D?
3081120	3082080	Is it through, oh, it's Prime.
3082080	3083040	It's probably 3D.
3083040	3085040	But just tease us a little bit with the HD graphics.
3085040	3086160	Are they doing multiplayer?
3086160	3087440	Just drop that little tidbit in there.
3087440	3088560	That's all I need.
3088560	3090800	Just a little tickle, okay?
3090800	3094400	That's all I really need from Metroid Prime 4 or anything.
3094400	3095760	I kind of feel like there's a difference.
3095760	3098160	Or like what Retro Studios is working on, you know?
3098160	3099520	Or just whatever.
3099520	3100400	I don't know.
3100400	3100900	Yeah.
3101680	3102080	Anyway.
3102080	3105760	Or DLC for fucking Mario Odyssey.
3105760	3107280	I'm surprised that's not a thing.
3107360	3112160	I feel like a lot of the comments in the chat room are a very
3112160	3115680	agreeance that Microsoft was the one that people really walked away
3115680	3116880	feeling the best from.
3116880	3119520	SG100Matt says MS did what people wanted.
3119520	3120240	Showed games.
3120240	3122320	Whether those games are for you is a different story.
3122320	3125520	Dungeon Buster says Microsoft and Phil Spencer put on a solid presser.
3125520	3129280	I don't have an Xbox One, but for us it looks like a game I would at least like to try out.
3129280	3130400	Well, you could on PC.
3131200	3133760	And Bobby Black Wolf pointing out with Metroid Prime.
3133760	3134480	Fun fact.
3134480	3137920	Metroid Prime came out five months after OLR started.
3142640	3144400	Thanks for that friendly reminder.
3144400	3145120	I appreciate that.
3145120	3146400	Sometimes sequels take time.
3146400	3148400	Look at The Incredibles 2 14 years later.
3148400	3148880	That's true.
3148880	3149600	That's true.
3149600	3150320	I yeah.
3150320	3156240	I'm all for Metroid Prime 4 can take its time to be done when it's done.
3156240	3157840	And here's the thing.
3157840	3160640	It didn't specifically have to be Metroid Prime 4.
3160640	3163120	But being at a 3 or like anything.
3163360	3164160	Show us enough.
3164160	3166000	Hey, here's an update on these games.
3166000	3167120	They can even preface it.
3167120	3170480	These games are coming out, you know, much a little bit later, like, you know.
3170480	3173600	But we want to show you here where here's some of the progress that we've made.
3174480	3178880	You know, kind of like how movies will say here's here's a still from the production set.
3178880	3182640	Here's a new actor that we've got in the game, which to be fair, I guess Death Stranding did do.
3182640	3184880	But, you know, here's a new character in these games.
3184880	3186240	Nintendo loves to show new characters.
3186240	3190640	I did want to back up, though, real quick to talk one more about Ubisoft.
3191200	3195120	Um, I think it was Ubisoft or maybe I'm thinking Bethesda.
3195120	3195600	One of them.
3195600	3196640	I can't remember which one.
3196640	3200800	The highlighted all the developers that were making their games.
3200800	3202400	And maybe that was Bethesda I'm thinking of.
3202400	3204480	Well, they do that big intro reel with Bethesda.
3204480	3206880	But I think now Ubisoft are the annoying marching band.
3206880	3209040	OK, now I'm getting it cleared now.
3209040	3209520	Sorry.
3209520	3210560	No, that's all right.
3210560	3211760	It's nice.
3211760	3214000	It's nice to see the faces behind this.
3214000	3218000	And I think a lot of times, you know, when gamers on Twitter can be really fucking mean
3218000	3219840	sometimes and social media in general, Facebook, too.
3219840	3221680	I always make fun of Twitter.
3221680	3225360	But the reality is Facebook comments are even worse.
3225360	3228880	Like if you go read Facebook comments on a lot of like public posts the companies make,
3228880	3231280	there's so much fucking garbage that people write on Facebook.
3231280	3235280	It's a good thing that their algorithm is such shit that it's really hard to find anything.
3235280	3235840	Lord.
3235840	3241040	Anyway, but my point with all that is like people really will razz games and be you know,
3241040	3244240	we forget that there are so many hard working people that make games.
3244240	3249680	And like, you know, I anytime that I feel like I personally have taken issues with what
3249680	3253920	game companies do or things, it's very high level executive decision type of things that
3253920	3255520	really tend to piss me off.
3255520	3258720	Like the whole EA thing like disclosure.
3258720	3260640	I know people that work at EA, OK?
3260640	3263840	Like, you know, you do a show for 16 years, you're going to meet some people, OK?
3263840	3268640	So I know people that work with EA and and obviously the problems that I have with what
3268640	3273200	has happened with Mass Effect, what is happening with loot boxes, what is happening with Anthem.
3273200	3276240	I would place none of that blame on those hard working people that are just being told,
3276240	3279520	you know, being doing what they are supposed to do and doing it well.
3279520	3283600	These are obviously when it comes to the money, the loot boxes, the how Mass Effect
3283600	3284640	was handled and all that stuff.
3284640	3286400	That's boardroom fucking decisions.
3286400	3290400	And that is where oftentimes, unfortunately, people are brought into those boardrooms that
3290400	3291840	aren't gamers.
3291840	3293440	And I will tie this together.
3293440	3299360	I think part of why Microsoft is in a much better place now with the Xbox One than it
3299360	3302000	was when it was unveiled is you had Don Mattrick.
3303040	3306640	Who is a little more that thing I was talking about that isn't such a great thing to have
3306640	3311440	in boardrooms versus Phil Spencer, who clearly is a gamer himself.
3312320	3315840	You have a very different person at the front of the wheel.
3315840	3319920	That's also, I think, why Nintendo is mostly successful with Iwata at the helm.
3319920	3320880	Oh, for sure.
3320880	3323760	And even Reggie, you know, Reggie came from fucking Panda Express.
3323760	3324800	People forget that.
3324800	3329600	But Reggie, you still feel whether whether it's genuine or not, honestly, you he still
3329600	3331280	shows enthusiasm for games.
3331280	3334880	He's willing to get in there, make fun of it all.
3334880	3336320	Play the games.
3336320	3336800	Take it on.
3336800	3341120	So you get the sense that he loves video games, whether it's legit or not.
3341120	3342960	That's what he's able to show off.
3342960	3343460	You know what I mean?
3344080	3345040	So anyway.
3345040	3348880	And also, honestly, Panda Express, pretty good, fast, casual food.
3348880	3350400	And I'm not being made to say that.
3351760	3353840	So Reggie's had a pretty successful past.
3353840	3358720	Anyway, Dartetsuya in chat says, I definitely admire Reggie's dedication.
3358720	3361360	Dungeon Buster says, got tired of the toxicity.
3362080	3362800	Yeah, for sure.
3362800	3363440	For sure.
3363440	3366320	Bobby Blackwell points out, Bethesda always starts with their people.
3366320	3367360	Yes, it's very important.
3368080	3372480	And Sia Tabiri says, npr.org completely disabled their comment section last year or two years
3372480	3373120	ago.
3373120	3375360	All comment sections get bad sometimes.
3375360	3377600	The VoG network comments aren't too bad.
3377600	3378880	Not that that's a challenge.
3378880	3380720	Please do not come up to that challenge.
3380720	3382720	But I think it's because no one's using them.
3382720	3384080	Very few people are.
3384080	3385760	Leave some comments on episodes.
3385760	3386960	I see one once in a while.
3386960	3392000	I see you guys, especially overseas people that are leaving the comments on the episodes.
3392000	3393040	We could use a few more.
3393040	3396000	Show the internet how to behave, VoG network folks.
3396000	3396320	All right.
3396320	3402080	Anyway, if that's it for Nintendo and the E3 conferences, let's move on to our gaming
3402080	3402400	weeks.
3402400	3405600	Let's quickly, because we are an hour in and I know we only have Jamie till nine o'clock
3405600	3406080	tonight.
3406080	3407360	Let's talk about our gaming weeks.
3407360	3408720	So Dark Sakura, we'll start with you.
3408720	3409360	Some Kirby.
3411040	3415680	Also, mostly a lot of pinball because we had pinball league at my house on Thursday.
3416800	3418640	I'm still playing idle pouring.
3418640	3419760	I'm still playing Pokemon Go.
3419760	3421120	We played some Pokemon Go today.
3423440	3428160	Mostly I've just been reading a lot because books have kind of been my refuge while last
3428160	3429120	week was kind of crap.
3429120	3430560	So yeah.
3432240	3432880	All right.
3432880	3433840	Lots of pinball though.
3433840	3437600	I'm sorry to hear about the crap, but I'm glad video games were there to help you in
3437600	3438240	my garage.
3438240	3441920	We have a guardians of the galaxy and it's fucking fun.
3441920	3443120	It's a very colorful table.
3443120	3443680	Very loud.
3444320	3448480	I told Dan I'd be willing to sell Star Trek to get a guardians of the galaxy.
3448480	3450800	So there may be some changes in my house.
3450800	3452000	Ooh, friendly reminder too.
3452880	3455920	I know this isn't you, Dark Sakura, but for the pinball fans out there that don't mind
3455920	3461120	playing on PC, don't forget those license tables are going away at the end of June.
3461120	3462640	So this like last chance.
3462640	3467520	So a reminder, if you didn't drop your 200 bucks on buying all those old tables yet or
3467520	3469120	however much it was, I don't remember the cost.
3470000	3471040	Loki, let's do your gaming week.
3471040	3472080	We'll go to Bradley.
3472080	3473760	I didn't play much this week.
3473760	3475920	I did play a little bit of Super Mario Odyssey.
3475920	3479520	Still trying to just get all the power moons.
3479520	3483120	So I finished the Luncheon Kingdom.
3483120	3484560	I think I've gotten all of them there.
3484560	3486160	So I moved on to other things.
3486160	3491280	And then so that's two out of however many kingdoms are that I've gotten everything in.
3491840	3496960	And then I did download the Octopath Traveler demo, but I still haven't played it yet.
3496960	3503760	A little bit more Pokemon conquest and or Pokemon quest conquest would be even better.
3504720	3507680	But Pokemon quest, I played that and Pokemon go.
3507680	3513600	And I keep forgetting to mention every week, but still playing dance dance revolution extreme.
3513600	3514640	So doing that.
3516400	3517360	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
3518800	3519680	No, not a ton.
3520320	3521440	OK, let's go over to Bradley.
3521440	3522560	How was your gaming week?
3522560	3522880	All right.
3522880	3528400	So aside from the other the aforementioned Slay the Spire also been playing.
3528960	3533440	I play pretty much play Fire Emblem Heroes every day.
3534160	3536880	At least like a little bit of it just for whatever.
3538240	3541680	Also playing SteamWorld Heist.
3542720	3544240	Oh, yeah, I know those games.
3544240	3544960	Yeah.
3544960	3545200	Yeah.
3545760	3548960	Basically, it's a sort of a strategy platform sort of thing.
3550320	3552960	Try to get into position and shoot the enemies and all that.
3552960	3553840	So that's pretty fun.
3554560	3557840	And I also played the Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.
3559760	3561200	Pretty much wrapping up that game.
3562160	3565760	There was like two other achievements that I got to do it the correct way.
3567200	3568560	What are you playing that on PC?
3568560	3568800	Yeah.
3568800	3568960	Yeah.
3568960	3571360	So I figured because you mentioned you didn't have the newer consoles.
3571360	3574560	The not Castlevania wink pretty much.
3574560	3577360	Doesn't it feel like it's just it's just Castlevania pretty much pretty much.
3578320	3578800	But it's great.
3578800	3579120	It's great.
3579120	3580320	It's nice to have a new game like that.
3581600	3581840	Yeah.
3581840	3583760	And I'm not too much else I've met.
3585040	3585520	All right.
3585520	3586240	My gaming week.
3586240	3588080	So I'm pretty much old favorites for me.
3588080	3592160	Diablo three season 14 start of season 14 of Diablo 14.
3592160	3593760	That's really started this past week.
3593760	3594800	So I was like, oh, what the hell?
3594800	3598640	So how often do they do is like every quarter reset them about every three months.
3598640	3601760	So they were playing with the time at some point.
3601760	3602480	It was four months.
3602480	3603440	Somebody was two months.
3603440	3605520	I think they're settled on like a three month average.
3605520	3609120	So I started a witch doctor for season 14 and I haven't been power leveled.
3609120	3612880	So I've grind my own levels up to I think I'm about 48 right now.
3612880	3616880	So I'll be by the time the next episode of our airs in two weeks,
3616880	3618640	I'll be like Paragon 500.
3618640	3620080	It's just the way these things go.
3620080	3624000	Although then again, I can't play when I'm in Chicago, so maybe not.
3624000	3625040	But I've been playing that.
3625040	3627520	I got sucked into heroes of the storm again.
3627520	3629600	So it's like I'm back on my blizzard.
3630240	3630800	Bullshit.
3630800	3635360	Basically, I'm playing with the casual blizzard games and doing that.
3635360	3636880	So I've been playing heroes of the storm.
3636880	3640880	I've been watching heroes of the storm on Twitch because they do like some of the drops.
3640880	3645200	I guess right now you can get loot boxes for like watching people play heroes of the storm on Twitch.
3645200	3646720	It's actually a really cool little promotion.
3646720	3647840	I don't think it made our show roll,
3647840	3651840	but I thought it was very clever that like the game makers are rewarding people
3651840	3654480	with items in that game for watching that game.
3654480	3658080	And especially for something that's a free to play game like heroes of the storm.
3658080	3661040	It's very, you know, it gives people more people an excuse to check it out.
3661040	3664640	I'm only level 70, which I know people that are in hundreds of levels.
3664640	3666800	But guys, I only ever play AI.
3666800	3669600	I have done that completely like AI matches.
3669600	3672400	So if I had more friends that I played with on a regular basis,
3672400	3674400	I might do more like player versus player.
3674400	3677680	But for right now, like AI allows me to get quest done every day,
3677680	3679360	get the gold to buy new characters.
3679360	3680480	And that's just kind of what I do.
3680480	3683040	So I was doing a little bit of the event.
3683040	3685440	They did like a wrestling event.
3685440	3686640	It was kind of interesting.
3687280	3689360	They did an event a couple of weeks ago,
3689360	3691200	but now they're moving into an Alterac Valley event.
3691200	3692960	So I think there's a new map coming out on Tuesday.
3692960	3694080	So that'll be cool.
3694080	3697440	Anyway, other than that, Pokemon Go community day was Saturday.
3697440	3699120	So I played lots and lots of that.
3699120	3703360	Walked around Capitol Park again for three hours catching shinies.
3703360	3705920	I got two shinies pretty quick.
3706480	3707920	And then like that third shiny,
3707920	3711200	because you know I want a shiny for every evolution of Larvitar, right?
3711200	3714320	That third shiny would not fucking drop.
3714320	3717280	So like I had two shinies by 1130.
3717280	3720560	And then like 130 showed up and I still didn't have a third shiny.
3720560	3721840	And I was getting really pissed off.
3721840	3725040	But then by some miracle, I caught two more shinies.
3725040	3727760	Phew, so I had my four shinies by the time the event was done.
3727760	3730640	And I Pinat buried almost every single...
3730880	3733840	I went into the event with 90 Pinat berries.
3733840	3735520	I used them all.
3735520	3739040	So I walked out of that event with over a thousand Larvitar candy.
3739040	3743760	And now I have an army of Tyranitar's waiting to shred up raids and things that...
3743760	3746480	Obviously, Tyranitar's won't do everything, but they do a lot.
3746480	3748640	Especially, you know, because some have fire blasts,
3748640	3751600	some have the, you know, Stone Edge and, you know, the different moves.
3751600	3755840	Well, didn't you get all of them that you evolved during the event?
3755840	3758240	I evolved two to get Smackdown, yes.
3759120	3762240	So I caught a couple high level wonders at the park and I evolved those
3762240	3765040	to just have a high level Tyranitar with those moves out the gate.
3765040	3767600	It's a bummer because I had a level 100...
3767600	3774160	Or I'm sorry, a 100% IV Larvitar from back when scanners were available
3774160	3775760	and people would post to our raiding group.
3775760	3778800	They'd say, there's a 100% Larvitar over at the, you know, the...
3779520	3780240	Where was this at?
3780240	3781920	It was at an apartment complex somewhere.
3781920	3783680	So we drove over there because we happened to...
3783680	3786320	Me and one of my Ingress buddies were out playing Ingress
3786320	3790240	when that message came in and it was like, 100% Larvitar, turn Ingress off.
3790240	3791520	We're gonna go get this.
3791520	3792160	So we did.
3793040	3794240	So we went and grabbed it.
3794240	3796080	And so, but I had already evolved that to Tyranitar all the time.
3796080	3799040	So are those the ones that like come up as a wonder or how the...
3799040	3799760	They're a wonder.
3799760	3803760	It'll go, if you're on blue team, the language in red and yellow is different,
3803760	3806560	but for blue team, it says, this Pokemon is a wonder.
3806560	3811280	Its best stat is attack, matched by its defense, matched by its HP.
3811280	3813840	And then it goes, the stats are so impressive.
3813840	3814400	It's amazing.
3814400	3818560	I don't remember the exact verbiage, but basically it's a 15 basically in that stat.
3818560	3819520	So yeah.
3820480	3821760	So anyway, that was my gaming week.
3822320	3823440	Mostly those games.
3823440	3824000	So yeah.
3824720	3826560	Let's move on and get into some gaming news.
3826560	3830240	As a reminder, guys, for housekeeping, we will not be here next week.
3830240	3831600	I'm gonna be out of town in Chicago.
3831600	3833840	We're just gonna take a week off, but we'll be back in two weeks
3834720	3838960	for the next year of Orange Lounge Radio and what's to come in the next year.
3838960	3840000	I will say this though.
3840000	3840400	We are...
3841040	3842400	I don't want to be too much of a tease,
3842400	3846400	but there's going to be some big changes by the end of the year.
3847040	3848640	Not with hosts or anything like that.
3848640	3850720	Just there's going to be some big changes at the end of the year.
3850720	3852720	And I think you guys will like them and that's all.
3852720	3853760	I hope you guys like them.
3853760	3854480	That's why we're doing them.
3855120	3859040	So we'll, it's something you guys have been asking for for a long time.
3859040	3862640	So we'll give you more on that at a later date.
3862640	3866800	In the meantime, let's get into some gaming news for this week.
3866800	3867680	Loki.
3867680	3871760	So let's talk about, since we didn't talk about during the, you know, recap of E3,
3871760	3873760	the PC gaming show.
3873760	3874720	So there's a few things.
3875520	3879920	I personally hate watching the PC gaming show because it would be pretty dumb,
3880960	3884080	but there were a few things that get announced out there.
3884080	3886800	So one of my favorite studios, Coffee Stain Studios,
3886800	3889360	has a new game coming out called Satisfactory,
3889360	3890560	which is like a survival game.
3890560	3893760	You can build these different machines that do different automations and whatnot.
3894400	3895440	So that's pretty cool.
3895440	3897520	And they have a closed alpha coming pretty soon.
3897520	3900640	There's a game called Neo Cab, which is about a futuristic
3901280	3905040	or glass cab, human cab driver in a futuristic city.
3905040	3907840	And that's coming out in 2019, February 5th.
3908560	3910720	A game called Mavericks Proving Grounds,
3910720	3914480	which looks like a battle royale game with a thousand concurrent players.
3915440	3917040	So that sounds pretty neat.
3918080	3919200	No word on one that's out.
3919920	3922400	Game called The Forgotten City, which is like a...
3922400	3922960	I'm sorry.
3922960	3925520	One versus a hundred wasn't enough.
3925520	3927840	Wait until you try one versus a thousand
3928400	3932000	and realize you're going to place no higher than nine hundred and ninety eight.
3932000	3932560	Yeah.
3932560	3934160	After the two people that disconnected.
3935200	3936320	Let's see, they have a game.
3936320	3939520	They showed off Forgotten City, which is coming in 2019.
3939520	3941120	A game that's kind of interesting for me
3941120	3944160	because I used to play the old Star Control games, the Star Control Origins,
3945760	3949440	which showed off like they have it's an open universe action RPG.
3950800	3954160	They guess they're launching that on September 20th.
3954800	3958080	A game called The Hunt or Hunt Showdown,
3958080	3961280	which I think is a survival FPS game by Crytek.
3962240	3966240	A game called Archangel Hellfire.
3966240	3970080	It's a 2v2 PvP multiplayer mech shooter.
3971680	3972720	Let's see what else.
3972720	3975120	They showed off some stuff for Warframe.
3975120	3977440	Now it's more Sega PC titles coming.
3977440	3980800	So Shenmue 1 and 2, Yakuza Kiwami,
3980880	3983440	Valkria Chronicles 4 and Yakuza 0.
3984160	3987920	So and Shining Resonance are all going to be making their way to the PC now.
3988960	3990080	Killing Floor 2.
3992320	3992880	What else?
3993440	3995120	We had another.
3995120	3997840	They showed off some gameplay for Jurassic World Evolution,
3999040	4002320	a game called Stormland, which is an open world VR game.
4003600	4004960	That Jurassic World Evolution,
4004960	4006880	a lot of people have been playing that on Twitch lately.
4007600	4012320	People are I guess those people that are playing the the SimCity and the city.
4012960	4013360	Oh my God.
4013360	4015120	Why can't I remember that again?
4015120	4017440	Cities Evolved or Cities Skylines.
4017440	4017840	That's it.
4017840	4021280	Skylines seem to be into Jurassic World right now.
4021280	4021520	Yeah.
4021520	4023520	It's like a little memory like of a theme park game.
4023520	4023760	It is.
4023760	4026640	But it's where the obviously the dinosaurs can kill everyone.
4026640	4027440	So that's kind of fun.
4027440	4028000	That's always fun.
4028000	4028500	Yeah.
4029920	4030420	What else?
4031120	4032080	Stormland.
4033120	4033920	I think I talked about that.
4034160	4037040	Night Call, which is you play as a Paris taxi driver.
4037040	4039440	Tiger Claw says it's from the developers of Planet Coaster.
4039440	4041360	So there's a reason why it feels adjacent.
4041360	4041920	That's pretty awesome.
4041920	4042480	That is awesome.
4043360	4051200	They showed off some Star Citizen stuff and then they kind of got into a monitor.
4051200	4055280	Of course, this is a PC gaming show, a game called Genesis Alpha 1.
4055280	4058000	I think this show was like three hours long, so there's a ton of shit.
4058000	4059120	Don't Starve Hamlet.
4059680	4060800	I'm not really sure what that is.
4061440	4062880	More DLC for Don't Starve, I guess.
4062880	4063280	I guess.
4063280	4063780	Yeah.
4064080	4067200	They showed off Just Cause 4 on PC and talked about the, you know,
4067760	4069440	upgrades that PC version is going to get.
4070080	4075840	They had the Walking Dead FPS game from Overkill that's coming out on November 4th.
4075840	4078560	They also talked a little bit about the Walking Dead, the Telltale series.
4078560	4081600	They have the final season coming out August 14th.
4081600	4085680	And what's kind of unique about this season, though, is it's going to have unscripted combat
4086880	4088320	and some more free camera scenes.
4089280	4097280	A game called Noita, which is a pixelated side scroller cave adventure game.
4097280	4097520	All right.
4097520	4099120	Anything we're dying for over here, Loki?
4101360	4104560	There's a game called Realm Royale, Hitman 2.
4104560	4106720	Oh, I think that Realm Royale is showing up on Twitch too.
4106720	4110720	I think it's a real game.
4110720	4112880	And then a game that looked kind of neat.
4112880	4113600	Ooblets.
4113600	4116160	I've been seeing a lot of that on my Twitter feed.
4116240	4118720	It's kind of like a Pokemon Animal Crossing game.
4119840	4124080	Bobby points out that Realm Royale is the same studio high res that does Smite and Paladins.
4124080	4125280	I thought so by the logo.
4125280	4127920	The logo is like the same font as Paladins.
4128480	4128960	Yeah.
4128960	4129760	All right.
4129760	4134320	And yeah, they have like another battle royale, Rapture Rejects, which is another battle royale.
4134320	4136400	So all the battle royale games are the PC gaming show.
4136400	4138400	Like all the just about all of them are over there.
4138400	4139680	The Rapture Rejects one.
4139680	4142320	I like to mention this one is kind of cool because I did see this
4142960	4146880	on YouTube because it's Cyanide and Happiness co-created it.
4146880	4148400	So it's their art style.
4148400	4150160	And I fucking love Cyanide and Happiness.
4150160	4152480	So that looks awesome.
4152480	4156560	Well, something else that could have been a Nintendo's little event that was missing was
4157200	4158000	non-games.
4158000	4160800	I mean, yeah, I know we don't want to fixate too much on that.
4160800	4162720	Like, look at what happened at the Xbox One reveal.
4162720	4167760	But it might have been nice to hear, oh, hey, Netflix, YouTube going to come to Switch.
4167760	4170960	And apparently it looked like that was going to happen because Best Buy
4170960	4172960	had leaked something on their website.
4172960	4174320	I say leaked, but obviously it didn't happen.
4174320	4179920	But they said that it listed features on the Nintendo Switch as Netflix and YouTube right
4179920	4182480	alongside Hulu, which we know is already there.
4183600	4186800	Unfortunately, the direct happened and it wasn't there.
4186800	4189360	And Best Buy did say that, oh, it was an error.
4189360	4192720	You know, of course, they kind of cover their tracks a little bit there and say that was
4192720	4197920	an error because, of course, that picture with Netflix and YouTube made its way all
4197920	4198960	around the Internet.
4198960	4203920	So, of course, Reggie Fils-Aime kind of got asked about it in one of the many E3 interviews.
4203920	4208160	And he said in a quote in one of the interviews, when we launched the Switch, we were very
4208160	4210720	clear we wanted to position the device as a game playing device.
4210720	4211360	We've done that.
4211360	4214320	And so you've seen Hulu, for example, come onto the platform.
4214320	4217520	In terms of other services, the conversations are ongoing.
4217520	4221120	We've got nothing to announce right now, but certainly those opportunities will come
4221120	4222240	in due time.
4222240	4226320	So in many ways, it's the same line we've been getting ever since the launch of the
4226320	4226800	system.
4226800	4230800	Like, sure, we'll do it at some point, but we're just trying to focus on the games because
4230800	4234080	that's what you all want us to do anyway, which is kind of the underlying overtone.
4235280	4236960	But he didn't say never.
4236960	4238640	He said in due time.
4238640	4244560	So it certainly seems like we'll have Netflix and YouTube when they talk about the networks.
4244560	4245280	Yeah, maybe.
4245280	4245840	You know what?
4245840	4249760	It would be a good coupling with online stuff.
4249760	4251920	So maybe that'll be when they unveil it.
4251920	4255600	But at the same time, when it comes to setting expectations in Nintendo, I think it would
4255600	4257280	just be a bad idea to do that ever.
4258320	4263280	So we'll just we'll just sit here and be surprised by whatever it ends up being.
4263280	4264880	So all right.
4264880	4267360	Anyway, let's move on.
4267360	4268720	Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?
4269840	4273520	Something that people don't always expect to hear on the show, stocks.
4274720	4278480	Although I have said that the way to have some say in a company is to own some stock
4278480	4278960	in it.
4278960	4279460	Hello.
4280420	4286180	But anyway, there were some pretty big stock changes that came out of news from E3.
4287140	4295140	In fact, three of the biggest stock increases went for Take-Two, for EA and for Blizzard.
4295780	4300740	So those three had the biggest stock increase, which keep in mind, you know, again, the stocks
4300740	4307620	are an indicator of how not just how the company is performing, but also, you know, where their
4307620	4308340	strength is.
4308340	4312420	You know, a company that's making more money is going to be in a stronger position to do
4312420	4312980	more.
4312980	4317060	And of course, you know, again, money into the local economy.
4317060	4317560	Hello.
4318260	4324420	But companies that took a hit was Nintendo dropped ten point four percent.
4325220	4329860	Who knew that all those investors were also eagerly awaiting Animal Crossing on the switch?
4329860	4336180	No, it's because all those investors, they're like, wait, where's Waluigi?
4337140	4338180	Sell.
4338180	4340260	You know who's not investing is Tom Nook.
4342020	4344020	But they're investing in turnips.
4345460	4346980	Sony dropped one point seven percent.
4346980	4349460	Microsoft just barely dipped like point two percent.
4350660	4352980	Other ones that did get a hit were Logitech.
4354180	4360900	AMD took an increase and so did Nvidia, I guess, with, you know, seeing how.
4360900	4364340	So this this E3 kind of I don't want to say it was a flop,
4364340	4370580	but this E3 from a financial stock perspective, like nobody was excited out of E3.
4370580	4375460	And honestly, in talking to a lot of like fans and things and I feel like a lot of people
4375460	4377700	are walking out of this E3 going, it's OK.
4378580	4379220	It wasn't the best.
4379940	4386100	The thing is, is that the largest players, you know, in I would say generally at E3 were
4386100	4387380	the ones to take a hit.
4387380	4390420	Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft.
4391540	4398580	But all the smaller ones and maybe the medium developers seem to be doing pretty well coming
4398580	4399060	out of this.
4399060	4405700	So, you know, this I think it's really showing that people are more looking toward not toward
4405700	4409620	the very biggest of the names, but looking toward the software publishers as opposed
4409620	4410740	to the hardware providers.
4411700	4415700	And this is this is good information to look at, because ultimately, like your letter grade
4415700	4417540	on Twitter doesn't mean shit.
4417540	4420500	This is what this is where the money is.
4420500	4420900	Yeah.
4420900	4424900	Well, some of that could have come out of copy text as well, because their show was the
4424900	4427380	week before and they were showing off all the PC hardware stuff.
4428340	4433220	Maybe some maybe some of the AMD and things, but not not the big three.
4433220	4433380	Yeah.
4433380	4438980	The ones that are like and I mean like hardware, not like console hardware is the one that
4438980	4440100	are the ones taking the hit.
4440100	4442900	But I think the component providers are the ones that really.
4443460	4450260	Because, I mean, basically a lot more home gaming is being done, I think, on higher end
4450260	4450820	PCs.
4450820	4452580	It's really gotten an increase, I think.
4453540	4457620	Even I was reading another article that Turtle Beach has actually had an increase in revenue
4457620	4460500	thanks to Fortnite directly because of Fortnite.
4460500	4461060	Oh, sure.
4461060	4461620	Yeah, sure.
4462260	4462760	Good call.
4464020	4467380	Rama in chat says, fuck Waluigi, to which I respond.
4467780	4474260	When and Dungeon Buster in chat says investors were hoping for a stronger holiday showing
4474260	4476420	from Nintendo, from what I read.
4476420	4482260	But are we I mean, are we even if you have a pretty strong holiday, they've got a Mario
4482260	4488660	Party game, a Pokemon spin off, but like one of the more logical spin offs.
4488660	4491140	If you're going to spin anything off, spin off the mobile.
4491140	4492180	Yeah, yeah.
4492180	4493460	It's still like Pokemon.
4493460	4498180	And they got obviously Smash Brothers, which, you know, is a top 20 of all time.
4498180	4503620	And I watch and I didn't watch you casually some of the Nintendo Treehouse stuff.
4503620	4508260	And I got to say, as a person who doesn't play Pokemon, I want that Pokemon game.
4508260	4514100	I mean, my kids want that game like Loki is talking positive about Nintendo like a lot.
4514100	4516100	And it's because of that Pokemon game.
4516100	4520820	So like y'all, I'll be picking up all three of their games this new holiday.
4520820	4525540	Nintendo fans that always send the angry emails about Loki and his fits like like y'all
4525540	4526180	hearing this.
4526180	4527060	Y'all hearing it.
4527060	4530980	I only I I criticize because I love.
4530980	4531300	I know.
4531300	4531700	I know.
4531700	4532980	We've said that over and over again.
4533940	4535860	Bobby says two Pokemon games, not three.
4537220	4539380	It's still the same thing.
4539380	4540260	It is the same thing.
4541460	4543540	Oh, he could be talking about the mainline game.
4543540	4544820	They did kind of right.
4546180	4548660	They did a tickle to say mainline Pokemon isn't dead.
4548660	4550100	It's coming in 2019.
4550100	4551220	Then that's fine.
4551220	4555620	I'm talking about like, you know, and then your your dumb little Pokemon quest thing,
4555620	4557700	I guess, could be counted as a game in some ways.
4557700	4558580	That'll be on mobile.
4558580	4559140	It's still a game.
4559140	4560100	I mean, I still play it.
4560740	4562740	That's that's the one I don't get.
4562740	4565140	Even I look at that going, Loki, why do you like that?
4566100	4568020	Holy shit, by the way.
4568020	4569540	Well, all right.
4569540	4573380	Don't mean to derail, but there was actually a big earthquake in Osaka.
4573380	4573860	Oh, no.
4574420	4574900	Yeah.
4574900	4578260	What what what did Richter scale?
4578260	4580100	Uh, lower sixes.
4580900	4586100	OK, I mean, but at least it's not an eight, you know, derailed some trains and killed
4586100	4586580	two people.
4586580	4589860	So just saying, I didn't mean to interrupt for anything like that, but I mean, no, that's
4589860	4590100	OK.
4590100	4593300	I thought we have listeners in Japan and friends in the area.
4593300	4598740	So just stopping to acknowledge and give you all tsunamis are going to be the big concern
4598740	4601460	center center central of the country.
4601460	4603460	So I don't think oh, so then the water would go.
4603460	4603700	Yeah.
4603700	4604500	So it's not going to do that.
4604500	4605140	OK, that's great.
4605140	4605940	That's good.
4605940	4606580	Anyway.
4606820	4607060	OK.
4609060	4612900	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOG Network
4612900	4615380	dot com, use the passphrase window.
4616340	4617780	Let's move on, though, with some other news.
4617780	4618820	So, Loki.
4619620	4620100	All right.
4620100	4624980	So Valve is, I guess, doing something.
4624980	4628500	I mean, they decided now they're going to put some limitations.
4628500	4631860	They're trying to stop a lot of these like sketchy games are coming to steam.
4632740	4638740	One type of game that comes out there is these achievement games that basically spam, you
4638740	4640580	know, achievements.
4640580	4643380	You play the games like, oh, hey, you get 100 trophies all of a sudden.
4644100	4647220	So what they're doing is they're putting in some sort of limitations for that.
4647220	4654580	So with with this, they're basically going to limit games to having 100 achievements
4655140	4660020	and there's supposed to be some sort of like confidence metric.
4660020	4661220	They'll prevent features.
4661220	4662500	OK, I can't hold it in.
4662500	4667060	Why all of a sudden to steam feel like, oh, but we need to regulate this.
4667060	4668820	Oh, steam.
4668820	4673860	Oh, I thought there was supposed to be things in games that purposefully make you mad.
4673860	4678580	This has been like this has been an issue for like a long time.
4678580	4680180	Why now are they fixing this?
4680180	4684420	You know, and yeah, and to your point, you know, oh, offensive content.
4684420	4686260	Well, the whole platform is fucking broken.
4686260	4687540	I mean, it's what it is.
4688180	4689940	And steam fix your life.
4690580	4695220	If it wasn't so convenient to get stuff, you know, on that platform, then, yeah.
4695220	4701140	But here's the other problem, too, with steam, though, like, I don't know, like, I just feel
4701140	4705300	they like even their sales and stuff, it's just hard to get excited about anymore.
4705300	4709860	When I see people with garbage achievements, I go, oh, look, they got a garbage achievement
4709860	4711940	like it does.
4711940	4713620	I just feel like, OK, fine.
4713620	4715300	Is is this need fixing?
4715300	4716900	I guess if it's ton and ton and spam.
4717460	4719540	What is exactly the trophies do?
4719540	4721620	Is that like raise your level or something?
4721620	4724180	I don't I don't fucking know anymore, Loki.
4724180	4725380	I don't fucking know anymore.
4725380	4727780	And who gives a shit about what level you are on steam?
4727780	4730500	Does anybody go like I'm a level 20 on steam?
4730500	4735780	If if it still works the same way when it first came out, it affects the drop rate of
4735780	4742580	the cards every time I see now every 10 levels you go up on steam, you get a higher chance.
4743380	4749380	So what happens is they're power leveling the box, they're farming the cards so they
4749380	4753220	get more drops so they can make more money off the broken ass platform that steam has
4753220	4755540	let them get away with for such a long time.
4755540	4760740	I see it's all about the steam, steam, steam, steam.
4760740	4761380	Have a seat.
4761380	4761860	Steam.
4761860	4763620	We need to talk at your life.
4763620	4764660	Look at your choices.
4764660	4766020	Look at your life, look at your choices.
4766580	4768500	The call is coming from inside the house.
4769140	4770100	That's all I have to say.
4770100	4773860	Steam, the call is coming from inside the house.
4776260	4777220	Why don't you fix that?
4778580	4779620	Yeah, moving on.
4780900	4785860	Hey, let's talk about the switch and some big arcade announcements that were not a part
4785860	4790180	of the big press thing that they did.
4790740	4797380	But they came out later because they like to drop little things during the tree house
4797380	4798260	thing, right?
4798260	4798580	Right.
4798900	4799700	That was the one thing.
4799700	4805300	It's like, I can't watch all three days of this, but yeah, so I have to wait for people
4805300	4806740	to report on it for me.
4806740	4812420	But anyway, it did come out that Donkey Kong, the arcade Donkey Kong has come out to the
4812420	4813700	Nintendo switch.
4813700	4817860	Now this is kind of a big deal because Nintendo has released Donkey Kong time and time and
4817860	4818500	time again.
4818500	4823060	But what they tend to release is that original NES cartridge of Donkey Kong, which was not
4823060	4824660	an arcade perfect port.
4824660	4826980	It's missing the pie factory.
4827780	4831860	So which was, did y'all know there's a board in Donkey Kong?
4831860	4835460	It's actually a cement factory, but I call it the pie factory.
4835460	4838260	They look like pies, even though it's supposed to be the whole thing that was supposed to
4838260	4840100	be like a construction scene.
4840100	4840500	Yeah.
4840500	4845780	So cement mixer in pie, whatever, which goes with the other boards.
4845780	4847140	You know, I'll have a construction theme.
4847140	4847540	Absolutely.
4847540	4850180	It looks like a pie factory, but it's cement factory.
4850180	4852180	But regardless, that board is in this.
4852180	4856580	So that's a pretty big deal because it's a more authentic, if you will, port of Donkey
4856580	4856820	Kong.
4857460	4862980	So that is available and it's going to be on the switch for $7.99 through the arcade
4862980	4863780	archives.
4863780	4868740	This actually has the Japanese version to the Japanese original, the updated Japanese
4868740	4871220	original with bug fixes and the international version.
4871220	4875380	You can play a vertical layout by rotating 90 degrees.
4875380	4876100	That's rad.
4876100	4876820	That's awesome.
4876820	4880660	Is it going to be so convincing that certain professional Donkey Kong players aren't going
4880660	4882980	to be able to tell the difference between this and an arcade version?
4883860	4885940	I'm going to defer all those questions to Bobby Black.
4886660	4887220	All right.
4887220	4889380	Just confirming, you know, it can be confusing.
4889380	4891380	He's the variety spokesperson now.
4891380	4895380	Dartage Studio says, to be fair, they did have an edited NES version that re-added the
4895380	4898660	cement factory level, but this is the first time the honest to goodness arcade version
4898660	4899220	has been released.
4899220	4899700	Yes.
4899700	4903060	And for the record, I still believe that the ColecoVision version was superior to the
4903060	4904420	Nintendo version, but.
4904420	4909220	And I prefer the Commodore 64 version, but that's also my fandom from when I was a kid.
4909220	4911780	Now, something else to keep in mind.
4911780	4914340	This was not the only arcade game that they released.
4914340	4916180	This is kind of a big deal.
4916260	4919460	Sky Skipper also is getting a release.
4919460	4922500	Sky Skipper never got formally released in arcades.
4922500	4925060	They did some location testing in 1981.
4925060	4926020	That was it.
4926020	4930020	Also, I think, didn't this cabinet show up at like Southern Fried Game Room Expo or something
4930020	4930340	like that?
4930340	4934660	Like, I feel like this cabinet is like one of those things that shows up rarely, but
4934660	4936260	anyway, or maybe they rebuilt it or something.
4936260	4936740	I don't know.
4936740	4942020	But apparently Nintendo had to extract the ROM from the only arcade cabinet still in
4942020	4943860	existence to make this happen.
4943860	4945620	So this is like a rare Nintendo.
4945620	4946500	You are sitting on a joke.
4946500	4947300	What do you want to say?
4947300	4951620	I'm just saying, just based off their previous experience with Virtual Console, they extracted
4951620	4954100	off of the arcade board that they downloaded off the Internet.
4954100	4956660	You know, how did that come about?
4958500	4958820	All right.
4958820	4964020	Anyway, Darticcia does confirm it was a Sky Skipper cabinet that was restored at last
4964020	4965380	year's Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
4965380	4966420	So, yeah, very cool.
4966420	4968180	So anyway, that is also available now.
4968180	4973380	So if you want to take something from the archives of Nintendo that was never released,
4973380	4977220	well, it wasn't Mother 3, but you got this.
4977220	4977940	It's something.
4978980	4981940	Anyway, at least Mother 3 was released somewhere.
4981940	4983620	Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you got?
4984660	4990820	Well, how about one of our favorite things that has taken over Netflix?
4990820	4991700	Stranger Things.
4992260	4992740	Queer Eye.
4993780	4994660	Season 2.
4994660	4995380	Stranger Things.
4996180	5001860	Anyway, it looks like Telltale has got the rights to do a Stranger Things game.
5002740	5005140	So and, of course, we know what Telltale is best at.
5005140	5008820	It's interactive adventures and point and click goodies.
5009540	5016260	So they are actually doing a Stranger Things game.
5016260	5018180	It's actually still in the project state.
5018180	5025060	It hasn't been determined on, you know, what exactly the story is going to be or when it's
5025060	5025700	going to be out.
5026980	5030580	But they say that it's not going to be on Netflix at all, so there won't be any kind
5030580	5031300	of story to it.
5031300	5033300	They're just it's all going to be pure game.
5034660	5036660	So there you go.
5037540	5040340	This is one of the things that when I heard the news, I was like, oh, yeah, I guess I
5040340	5044340	guess it would make sense for Stranger Things to have a game like this.
5044340	5046500	I mean, I know there's that crappy little cell phone.
5046500	5050500	I shouldn't call it crappy, but it was a cell phone game and very much just a cell phone
5050500	5051940	game of Stranger Things that came out.
5051940	5055300	So it makes sense that, you know, they're getting something a little more substantial.
5055300	5056420	Yeah, substantial.
5056420	5057220	That's a good word for it.
5057220	5059380	Substantial and not upside down.
5059380	5060340	Yes, correct.
5060340	5060740	All right.
5060740	5063620	Anyhow, let's move on.
5063620	5066180	Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
5066180	5069460	And you've got another big story from this week, Loki.
5069460	5070660	Yes, I do.
5070660	5077700	So right after, you know, they announced during the Nintendo Direct that, hey, Fortnite is
5077700	5079540	on the Switch and you can play it now.
5081060	5086740	Well, unfortunately, some people couldn't just play it right now because they found
5086740	5094020	out when they tried to log in that they couldn't if they happen to have played on a PlayStation
5094020	5095460	4, because that's right.
5096020	5103380	While the system or the game is cross platform or cross play, it can only cross play with
5103380	5106580	Fortnite on PC, mobile and Xbox One.
5106580	5109860	You can't play it if you've accessed it on the PlayStation 4.
5111060	5115380	The only way you can get to play that is if you create a new account.
5115380	5120180	In fact, you can even unlink it from the PlayStation 4 and it'll still say, nope, sorry,
5120180	5120740	can't do it.
5121460	5122740	That is such bullshit.
5122740	5124260	But that's even unlink it.
5124260	5125300	That's OK, though.
5125300	5131860	So Sony did make a response regarding this, and their response was very, very to the point.
5131860	5136260	We're always open to hearing what the PlayStation community is interested in to enhance their
5136260	5137140	gaming experience.
5137700	5138100	Done.
5138100	5140340	And the lie detector test is determined.
5140340	5147140	That was a lie because people have been harping on Sony about this cross play thing for a
5147140	5147380	while.
5147380	5148740	It happened with Rocket League.
5148740	5152980	It's happening with Minecraft, although that one with Microsoft owning Minecraft is a little
5152980	5153780	more dicey there.
5153780	5156100	But we've had these cross play discussions before.
5156100	5160180	Shit, we've had these discussions before when it was Microsoft that was sitting at the top
5160180	5163780	of the heap with the Xbox 360 when the PlayStation 3 was floundering.
5163780	5171620	And this whole thing about cross play and Microsoft not allowing it fucking gave a Sony
5171620	5174100	Street Fighter 5 essentially at the end of the day.
5174100	5178980	And Final Fantasy 14 is not on a Microsoft platform because they made those mistakes when
5178980	5180260	Don Mattrick was in charge.
5180260	5181940	And now the tables are turned.
5182500	5184500	So no, you're not listening to what the gamers want.
5185780	5190900	Like, look, I think most people generally accept because there is competition that there
5190900	5192820	are things you're going to be able to play on PlayStation.
5192820	5197220	You can't play with your friends on Microsoft and vice versa and the whole thing.
5197220	5199380	It would be nice to see those walls come down.
5199380	5203460	And as we've illustrated many times on this show, it has come down in the past when the
5203460	5204740	companies really want it.
5204740	5211940	IE Final Fantasy 11 is like the only thing I can think of that was like PC, Sony, Microsoft,
5211940	5212420	all of that.
5212420	5215460	Like back in the day, Final Fantasy 11 worked on all those things.
5215460	5216820	Cross play is not hard.
5216820	5220500	Okay, but now we've got this whole other complication as well.
5220500	5222660	It's not just the cross play thing that's annoying.
5222820	5225700	I mean, it's a little bit annoying.
5225700	5229540	It's definitely not hard because I think at one point it was accidentally turned on on
5229540	5231620	the PlayStation for you to play with.
5231620	5237700	Yeah, but what's really annoying last month, Twitch for Twitch Prime people gave away Fortnite
5237700	5241220	stuff and you had to basically, you know, give it get it on your account.
5241220	5244900	And it's like if you have all that on your account and you've ever played it on PlayStation
5244900	5249060	for even if it was just like once out of curiosity and you'd had to be too bad, you're fucked
5249060	5250580	because you can't unlink.
5250580	5252420	That's the worst part of all of this.
5252900	5257140	In my opinion, like if Sony wants to be dicks and if they want to be like, oh, but the 80
5257140	5258340	million gamers are over here.
5259460	5262340	Bitch, you should know this by now.
5262340	5265860	You can have those gamers and you can lose them just as easily.
5265860	5268420	I got three words for you.
5268420	5270420	Giant enemy crab.
5272500	5276980	So y'all better watch yourselves on that throne because you had those 80 million gamers.
5276980	5280580	You should learn by now the gamers can fucking turn on you like that, bitch.
5281380	5286900	So my suggestion is you stop this business speak and you listen to what people are telling
5286900	5292900	you, and that is that, you know what, when I buy shit, I want to be able to use it when
5292900	5297380	that precedent is there that it's on, you know, it carries over my PC account to PlayStation.
5297380	5302340	If I want to move it over to the switch because I want to play, you know, on the go at friends
5302340	5305780	houses and stuff with Wi-Fi and I want to play on my portable console stuff and I don't
5305780	5309540	want to be fucking locked in because I checked it out for five minutes on your console.
5310500	5313700	Like a long time ago, then you need to like, let those people go.
5314820	5317620	And there's a part of me as well that kind of wonders like,
5318820	5323140	is Epic necessarily blame free in this scenario?
5323140	5326340	I have this weird feeling. Call me crazy.
5326340	5327220	Wouldn't be the first time.
5328260	5332420	Epic may have set it up this way to push this issue with Sony.
5333300	5338020	This whole thing might've been done to get gamers to needle Sony on this issue.
5338020	5340500	And boy, are they needling Sony on this issue.
5340500	5343940	Go look at any reply to a PlayStation tweet right now.
5345780	5347540	They're getting needled on this issue.
5347540	5352100	And I have to wonder, is some of that maybe Epic's doing?
5352100	5355380	I'm sure a little bit of it is because I'm sure that they could work it in a way that,
5355380	5359860	you know, Oh, any PlayStation exclusive items that you get on your play or whatever,
5359860	5362820	are just only on that platform and not necessarily,
5363620	5366580	you know, something you would see on another platform.
5366580	5367080	Yeah.
5367540	5372020	S2100 Matt in chat says their response was such a slap in the face to their consumers
5372020	5374980	to have an address that seems like it was written by our president.
5374980	5376020	Made no sense.
5376020	5379780	Sure. Microsoft has messed up in the past, but had no problems making things right
5379780	5381940	and communicating with their base very quickly.
5381940	5383860	Sony could use a major Nelson.
5383860	5386740	I'm telling you right now, like even with like this stuff,
5386740	5391060	this is just between this, the way they had an old model mod support.
5391780	5395860	And just how even like how 4k is seems to be even better on Xbox one.
5395860	5400180	Like I'm telling you that when the next round of consoles comes out, I'm going Microsoft.
5400180	5400680	Yeah.
5400740	5403940	Sony, you better watch yourself.
5403940	5406180	Like seriously, this is my, this is my loving advice.
5406180	5410260	Again, you know, I know people I'm very close with that are at Sony and I'm sure
5410260	5411300	this is not their problems.
5411300	5413300	This is the problems of executive decisions.
5413300	5416500	So Sony executives, listen the fuck up.
5417460	5421700	Microsoft just let you know this week, they are bringing in the troops.
5422420	5426340	They want to snatch the crown in this next generation of gaming.
5426340	5433140	Sony, if you keep doing dumb shit decisions like this and not, and compounding those dumb
5433140	5437940	shit statements or dumb shit decisions with really dumb shit statements, like your response
5437940	5441940	to this whole thing, gamers will turn on you like that.
5441940	5443460	Listen to what Loki just said.
5444100	5446580	So Sony, you still got a window here.
5447620	5448120	Fix it.
5449780	5451380	And yes, I am being extra sassy.
5452020	5453140	It's the sweet 16.
5453140	5457940	I wish that they, they would like support like the backwards compatibility and all that
5457940	5461860	stuff because it would be nice to be able to play all these PlayStation three games
5461860	5464100	that I have in my library that I can't play.
5465940	5467620	But you know, Microsoft is doing that.
5467620	5468580	They're supporting that.
5468580	5473380	So, and their mod supports way better, even though both are pretty limited.
5473380	5475700	I guess PC would be the winner there.
5475700	5481540	And I mean, technically I don't need to get an Xbox one because I have a PC and I can
5481540	5483060	play all her games through that.
5483060	5487460	But I just like a lot of the games I play are multi-platform and it just seems like,
5487460	5490500	you know, like when it comes to like Skyrim and stuff like that, like the mod supports
5490500	5491000	is better.
5491540	5493700	Bob coffee and chat will end on this and we'll move on.
5493700	5495300	Cause our show's running very long.
5495300	5500100	Bob coffee and chat says it's pretty ironic when Nintendo is more open to cross play than
5500100	5501060	Sony LOL.
5501700	5502420	Isn't it though?
5503780	5504580	Isn't it though?
5504580	5509300	Dude, do you know the other thing we haven't even brought up Loki with Nintendo and Fortnite
5509300	5513780	did do we all just like there's voice chat in Fortnite on the switch.
5514740	5515380	Yeah.
5515380	5521540	You just plug in any old headset and you got voice chat enabled in Fortnite on the switch.
5521540	5521780	Yeah.
5521780	5525380	It's like, it's so weird that the console can handle that.
5525380	5527460	Why the fuck do I have to have a phone app?
5527460	5528260	Hold up.
5528260	5530340	Because that brings up a whole other thing.
5530340	5531700	So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
5532340	5537780	So all this bullshit fuckery with the Nintendo app, this, this was all a ploy to get us to
5537780	5538900	download your shitty app.
5538900	5542660	Nintendo that only works with one game right now.
5542660	5545380	And it's the most convoluted, stupid thing ever.
5546420	5551300	Like that was, that was, that was the gag I was not prepared for with Fortnite on the
5551300	5554340	switch was this secret unlocking of, Oh yeah.
5554340	5555700	Voice chat's been there the whole time.
5555700	5556580	Works just fine.
5556580	5558740	What?
5561300	5561620	Yeah.
5561620	5563220	That I don't get like, seriously.
5563780	5564500	No wonder more.
5564500	5568500	Is there a network that fucking borked that they can't fucking, Oh, I'm sorry.
5568500	5570980	This, we just can't do voice chat.
5570980	5573140	Like, do they not know how?
5573140	5577060	I mean, no, I think the reality is the answer you don't want to hear.
5577060	5583460	Loki Nintendo is afraid of, um, pedophiles getting tied to the switch on how they met
5583460	5584500	their victims.
5584500	5588340	That in a nutshell, that is what Nintendo remember.
5588900	5593380	Remember when, um, I don't even remember the name of that fucking app, the drawing application
5593380	5594100	on 3DS.
5594100	5597860	Remember when not picture chat picked out, whatever that thing was, the other one that
5597860	5598820	you sent the little thing.
5598820	5600820	Remember when that got on the chat?
5601380	5604980	Remember when that got on the news in a negative light and it was pulled from all the 3DS is
5604980	5605860	everywhere.
5605860	5607460	That is the root problem.
5607460	5608820	Loki, whether you want to hear it or not.
5609380	5610740	I know, I know you don't want to hear it.
5610740	5613940	Loki, I know you don't want to hear it, but that, I'm just keeping it real.
5613940	5616340	That is why voice chat is a fucking problem.
5616340	5619460	And that's such a backwards way to think nowadays.
5619460	5619940	Swap note.
5619940	5620180	Thank you.
5620180	5620660	Swap note.
5620660	5624900	That's such a backwards way to think chat from like to chat with the DS thing.
5624900	5626820	What year do they think they're in?
5626820	5631300	I mean, seriously, how many kids nowadays have access to the internet?
5632100	5634100	Which is tablets and mobile devices.
5634100	5636980	You're asking someone to have a fucking mobile device to chat.
5636980	5639780	So they fucking have a access to the internet.
5640500	5645700	Why is it that you just make it so stupidly hard to just function?
5645700	5647380	Just go for the children.
5647380	5648900	It's fucking dumb.
5648900	5649400	I don't.
5650660	5653300	It would be so easy to chat with friends only.
5654980	5655480	Done.
5656500	5657300	Exactly.
5657300	5658900	And not fucking hard.
5658900	5661620	The parental controls would allow your parents to see who's your friend.
5661620	5664340	You have parental controls built into the fucking system.
5664340	5666180	I don't understand what the problem is.
5666180	5668740	D'Artezio says, I should have known that would set Loki up.
5668740	5671860	I had to offset that positivity on Pokemon with something y'all.
5671860	5673220	It's an anniversary show.
5673220	5673780	Stupid.
5673780	5675380	It's fucking dumb.
5675380	5675620	Right.
5675620	5675940	Shut up.
5675940	5678020	Cause like they're like, though, I understand it.
5678020	5683620	The argument was, well, the system is powerful to run these games, but it just can't do both
5683620	5685460	this and voice chat at the same time.
5685460	5690580	Even the Nintendo fans, even the most hardcore Nintendo fans on this issue, even they're
5690580	5693060	going to be like, I really can't be mad at Loki.
5693060	5696260	Like this is an issue Nintendo needs to evolve on.
5696260	5697700	So anyway, let's move on.
5697700	5698660	I got one more switch thing.
5698660	5702180	And then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week, which of course, for an anniversary
5702180	5706660	show, you know, dark soccer, dark soccer has picked a fun one, but, uh, the switch porting
5706660	5710420	studio that did doom rocket league Wolfenstein.
5710420	5713700	This studio is called panic button and they're doing a pretty good job.
5713700	5716020	All these ports were really well done.
5716020	5718580	Uh, they are working on something else.
5718580	5722180	They won't say what it is, but it's another AAA switch port.
5722180	5725940	Uh, and it's another major port that they will announce in July.
5726900	5733140	So I wonder if there's going to be another Nintendo direct in July to possibly fill in
5733140	5735380	some of these gaps we're feeling after E3.
5735380	5738980	I don't know, but anyway, there's something else that's going to get ported to the switch.
5739780	5743620	Lots of people thinking grand theft auto five.
5747300	5749620	They could do the three 60 version of the game.
5749620	5750180	Yeah.
5750180	5752180	Um, cause that's how Skyrim is there.
5752180	5756260	And that's why we don't have fallout four because follow four was the next gen game.
5756260	5759060	So I could see grand theft auto five.
5759620	5762500	That's again, that is just, I would have to pick up.
5762500	5765060	I would have to pick up grand theft auto five again.
5765060	5769620	And that would be, you know, I'd be curious to see how the online mode works in grand
5769620	5770100	theft auto.
5770100	5771220	Well, that's the problem though.
5771220	5775780	See, it wouldn't because the grand theft auto online, they've stopped supporting the Xbox
5775780	5780260	three 16 PlayStation three because it just, they're not supporting any more updates for
5780260	5780340	it.
5780340	5782180	So it'd be weird to see how that would work.
5782740	5783700	You know what I want to see?
5784500	5789060	And I would, it would go a long way in making a lot of hurt feelings, feel a lot better
5789060	5790740	when Nintendo have boobies on their plan.
5791380	5795940	They might, uh, mass effect trilogy on the Nintendo switch.
5795940	5800180	That would, that would go a long way in healing some hurt that I feel in my heart.
5801380	5802900	Or how about the mass effect quad trilogy?
5802900	5804660	Why not destroy Andromeda in it?
5804660	5804980	All right.
5804980	5808100	Anyway, I know I'm reaching, I'm reaching.
5808820	5809540	All right.
5809540	5811700	Let's, let's take a trip back to a simpler time.
5813220	5816900	A time when, uh, you didn't have remasters and all this stuff.
5816900	5820500	You know, you know what you got if, if, if it was on the Nintendo and then it came out
5820500	5823620	on the super Nintendo, it was pretty much the same damn thing.
5823620	5825300	That's what happened in the Ninja game trilogy.
5825300	5829860	Anyway, uh, it's the classic game of the week, dark Sakura, seven, the vault find a game
5829860	5832180	that you think, Hey, we should be playing this week.
5832180	5833780	I wish I had one of these in the vault.
5833780	5834180	Right.
5834180	5836420	And it's a very special 16th anniversary selection.
5836420	5839540	It is, but it only lived for two years as a series.
5839540	5840180	Did you know that?
5840980	5843860	Uh, I knew it was, it kind of came and went.
5843860	5844820	Yes, I knew that.
5844820	5846740	It was beat mania three.
5847700	5852740	Cause I've done beat mania and I've done excuse me.
5852740	5855060	I ate something funny and now I have the burps.
5855060	5863300	Um, beat mania three is, um, the followup to the beat mania series, um, by Konami.
5863300	5870660	Um, it came out in two, actually, um, the first one came out in March of 2000.
5871460	5877060	Um, the last one, which was beat mania three, the final came out in 2002 and had five releases
5877060	5878500	though in that two year period.
5879540	5885540	So, um, the awesome thing about beat mania three, it actually, and I really liked this.
5885540	5888340	It had like 10 speakers in the cabinet.
5888340	5892020	You had four mid range that were stacked vertically on either side of the screen, two
5892020	5896660	subwoofers and every time, and no matter where you went to play it, it was always turned
5896660	5897700	to the fuck down.
5898900	5900340	This is a game that needs volume.
5900340	5900740	Hello.
5901540	5903780	Um, although you could also play with headphone jacks.
5903780	5907940	Um, and it actually, two players could bring their own headphones to use their own jacks.
5908660	5911700	Um, however it doesn't, uh, disable the external speakers.
5912820	5920580	Um, it had, um, something, and this is actually something that made it into 2DX later on,
5921220	5925140	was the, um, uh, major effector panel.
5925140	5928420	Instead of just having the one effector button like the first beat mania did.
5929140	5935300	So you had, um, echo, low pass, high pass, uh, phaser, volume based.
5935300	5941380	I've always mispronounced this, flanger, flanger, lo-fi, a few others like that.
5941380	5949300	Um, and it could be, uh, applied to the background or just the sounds or both.
5949300	5952260	Um, and of course you could increase the intensity of it.
5952260	5955620	So, um, and sometimes it's the only thing that made some of these things audible.
5956980	5959220	It also introduced the foot pedal.
5960020	5961780	So each player got a foot pedal.
5961780	5967860	Um, you can, um, use it to turn on or off of the, um, effectors in normal play.
5968580	5974660	Some songs do have a, uh, a foot version that adds another column with a green note
5974660	5976180	that you play with the foot pedal.
5976740	5981620	Um, you can also set the foot pedal so that it can function as any one of the five keys.
5982980	5987700	I would be really happy if it would have functioned as the spin for really crazy spins
5987700	5989620	because it's kind of hard sometimes.
5990260	5991540	It also had a floppy drive in it.
5991540	5993140	It had a three and a half inch floppy drive.
5993860	6000820	And now it does have to be formatted for NTFS, um, but it would record your scores on it
6000820	6002420	and save your status.
6002420	6007860	Um, and then you could use it in the game again, you know, if you wanted to keep track
6007860	6010900	of the scores or you could look at your scores on your own computer.
6010900	6015620	Um, the disc is also required to unlock secret songs or game modes on some of the versions
6015620	6016180	of the games.
6016820	6024020	So the various versions that came out is we had Beatmania 3, Beatmania 3 append core remix,
6024020	6030500	Beatmania 3 append 6 mix, Beatmania 3 append 7th mix and Beatmania the final.
6031540	6035860	Which to be perfectly honest, I'd say Beatmania the final is probably the best of them.
6035860	6038420	It's the one I've certainly seen the most of and played the most of.
6039380	6046980	So, um, of course we've never had, uh, I mean some of the songs have been in home releases,
6046980	6051220	but we've never actually had a Beatmania 3 dedicated home release.
6051220	6054980	So if you want to get your Beatmania 3 on, good luck.
6054980	6059700	Find an arcade or go to California Extreme like they have every July.
6059700	6061220	Or domain like everyone else is doing.
6062340	6066340	Not that we endorse that, but the reality is if Konami is going to make it hard to find,
6066340	6070580	then I'd like to find a way to, cause you know, I still have two, five key controllers.
6071380	6075380	So if I could find like a little converter deal, so I can use my five key controllers.
6076420	6079940	Then again, I'd probably just go back to playing BM 98, like back in the day.
6080500	6082820	I have a few of those PlayStation controllers.
6083860	6084340	Nice.
6084340	6085540	It'll be worth a try with it.
6086420	6086660	All right.
6087380	6089300	My five key controllers are all old PlayStation.
6090180	6090580	There it is.
6090580	6093380	Your classic gift of the week, Beatmania 3.
6093380	6097780	Not to be confused with third mix, just Beatmania 3 that came and then went.
6098580	6100180	But 2DX still around.
6100180	6104020	Beatmania 2 deluxe is still around all these years later on there.
6104020	6104660	What, what are they on?
6104660	6106180	Like their 26th?
6106180	6108260	I don't even, I lost fucking count at some point anyway.
6108260	6109460	Cause they started naming them all.
6110020	6113700	Uh, I only remember Linkle cause it's also the name of a character in Hyrule Warriors.
6113700	6114980	It's pretty bad ass.
6114980	6115460	All right.
6115460	6118340	We're going to take a break, but when we come back, we got plenty more orange later.
6119300	6124500	Orange lounge radio to come, including, uh, your calls at orange lounge radio on Skype.
6124500	6128820	Uh, we're going to do a release dates, uh, the mailbag, and we'll talk about nudity.
6128820	6133140	I promise when we come back with more of orange launch radio, right after this.
6139780	6145700	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number 735 of our
6145700	6151860	show for this June 17th of 2018, celebrating 16 years of orange lounge radio.
6151860	6157220	Also taking a look back at E3, but also, you know, we, we have rudely been almost two hours
6157220	6162020	into the show and have yet to say a happy father's day to all the fathers out there,
6162020	6163380	especially our own Loki.
6163380	6163940	Thank you.
6163940	6166260	And of course all the father figures, et cetera, et cetera.
6166260	6167700	You know, we don't want to leave anybody out.
6167700	6171780	Uh, cause I can, I consider myself a daddy, uh, to Mr.
6171780	6172580	Smush.
6172580	6173700	Get your mind out of the gutter.
6173700	6178260	I know a few daddies, but a happy father's day to all the daddies out there as well.
6178260	6178900	Wink.
6178900	6183220	So, you know, anyway, but no, in all seriousness, I hope everybody's having a good day.
6183220	6186980	Uh, that was the joke.
6186980	6191620	Uh, my, uh, my own dad, uh, he went to universal studios for the first time today.
6191620	6196740	I took him to the airport to go to long beach, uh, which he, he never really would fly a
6196740	6200580	lot before, but he went, he flew to long beach to visit my sister, which is where she lives.
6200580	6206340	And she took them and like long beach to, to north of LA where universal is, is not
6206340	6207220	exactly close.
6207220	6207700	So Mr.
6207700	6210820	Driven an hour up there, but they went to universal studios and I'm kind of impressed.
6210820	6216900	Now, my dad, my dad is, you know, he's, he was, when I was born, he was pushing 40.
6216900	6220100	So he's, he's like 78, 79 at this point.
6220100	6223140	So, um, he wasn't exactly going to ride all this right.
6223140	6225620	So he didn't ride the Harry Potter ride, but he did do the studio tour.
6225620	6229220	I was pretty, I was pretty happy to hear that they did all that kind of cheesy stuff.
6229220	6231060	So, uh, really cool.
6231060	6235860	So anyway, uh, looking at our chat room, uh, Rama says, since today is father's day and
6235860	6239860	OLR and OLR 16th birthday, who is OLR's dad?
6239860	6243300	Uh, it was established, uh, you might've missed it, but during the, uh, Bobby call and then
6243300	6246820	thereafter, uh, Travis Donovan would be our, our daddy.
6248020	6249860	And when you say it, you can't say he's the dad.
6249860	6255220	If I, you have to say daddy, Loki shaking his head over there.
6255780	6256260	All right.
6256260	6263540	Anyway, moving on, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and, uh, some other video
6263540	6266740	games that you and your daddy can look forward to soon.
6267540	6268820	Loki, start us off, please.
6269700	6274980	It's disturbing, but, or as Dungeon Buster says, big daddy Donovan.
6277220	6277780	All right.
6277780	6283380	So apparently some modders of the game Bloodborne have discovered that there is a cut boss rush
6283380	6284660	mode in the game.
6284660	6289380	And these actually appeared in some test, uh, arena maps that were actually labeled
6289380	6292740	as boss rusher in Japanese.
6292740	6298580	Um, they were apparently some holy, uh, optional dungeons.
6299220	6304100	And they talked about like some of the different things that were in there that showed that
6304100	6306500	it was kind of before the game's release.
6306500	6309460	And actually some of this stuff actually had come out in one of the, I don't know if it
6309460	6314980	was an update or DLC that they had found, but they got it working a little bit to where
6314980	6318180	some of the actual bosses spawn, but it's just not finished.
6318180	6321940	Kind of neat to see, you know, that was something that was in development, but too bad it never
6321940	6322740	made the final game.
6324340	6328100	And then, um, call of duty black house four.
6328100	6328660	Oh yeah.
6329860	6334420	You may remember call of duty black house four decided that, you know, it was not going
6334420	6338420	to have a single player campaign and said, they're going the route of it's going to have
6338420	6342900	multiplayer, it's going to have a battle royale and that's that.
6342900	6347060	Well, it's also going to have a season pass because they want all of the money.
6347060	6351380	And, uh, what's going to be kind of different about this season pass, which they're calling
6351380	6358340	the black ops pass, um, is that the maps, instead of being released, it's 12 multiplayer
6358340	6358660	maps.
6359220	6364420	So in four zombie maps, instead of releasing them in map packs, like they have in previous,
6364980	6369860	you know, releases so that, because basically in order to be able to play one of these,
6370420	6373780	you have to be able to have the same maps as the person you're playing it.
6373780	6378340	So say, you know, I bought the season pass and my friend did not buy the season pass.
6378340	6382020	He would not be able to play with me unless he bought the same maps that we were going
6382020	6382660	to be playing on.
6383620	6387540	So instead of releasing these maps in map packs, which would be like four maps each
6387540	6392980	and charging a flat fee for that, they are releasing them individually.
6393540	6401700	So you have to buy, um, these individual map packs, I guess for 14 99 each, which I'm wondering,
6401700	6407860	you know, how many is going to come in these map packs in, uh, the season pass itself is
6407860	6411780	49 99 and it's apparently not going to be available.
6412660	6414100	Okay, now I'm getting confused here.
6414100	6417860	So, oh, they're talking about in the past.
6417860	6425060	Okay. So, um, the season pass or black ops pass right now, how much is that?
6425780	6430020	I'm not sure, but it's additional money on top of the game itself, but they're selling
6430020	6431220	the maps individually.
6431220	6435940	So if you want to play, instead of buying the map pass for like 14 99 for four maps,
6435940	6439460	you're going to have to buy each one individually, which is going to split the player base that
6439460	6445220	much more because, you know, I may have maps one, two, and three, and, you know, the other
6445220	6450020	person has two, three, and four, and now I can't play, you know, half of the maps with
6450020	6450980	the other person.
6450980	6452420	So that kind of sucks.
6452420	6459140	Um, and apparently the issue also is this black ops pass.
6459140	6460740	It's not going to be available after launch.
6462420	6464500	It's only a pre-order thing, apparently.
6464500	6465220	So that's a dungeon.
6465220	6468580	Buster's kind of saying in chat is that the black ops pass is literally all or nothing
6468580	6470900	and it isn't initially available at launch.
6470900	6474020	You need to spring for one of the more expensive versions to get in on it for now.
6474660	6475160	Yeah.
6475780	6476820	So that's lame.
6476820	6480180	And it, they're coming out, you know, slowly as it progresses.
6481060	6481700	I don't know.
6481700	6487220	I am really not interested in black ops four just because of this and the lack of a single
6487220	6487940	player campaign.
6488580	6493380	So I'll just wait for the best of, you know, they I'll wait for the gone sale.
6493380	6495860	The, the, the year of definitive edition.
6495860	6497300	I don't even do that anymore.
6497300	6501060	Like the, the definitive editions that they released or the previously released, it's
6501060	6504820	like, Oh, we have the first map pack in there for you.
6504820	6507620	Oh, but you got to buy the rest if you want to play all the maps.
6508180	6511460	Fuck Activision is what the moral of the story is here.
6512580	6516340	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I actually played some of black ops three single player
6516340	6519780	campaign when it was on PlayStation plus I didn't realize it was 70 gigs.
6520500	6523540	I spent almost one 10th of my bandwidth cap on fucking call of duty.
6523540	6524260	Oh shit.
6524260	6524660	Yeah.
6524660	6526180	Good thing I haven't downloaded that yet.
6526180	6526900	All right.
6526900	6528820	Anyway, let's talk a little bit about kingdom hearts.
6528820	6531780	We already mentioned, I was going to mention here the official release date in January
6531780	6535620	2019, but we kind of covered that earlier, but maybe some of you were wondering why did
6535620	6536820	they bump it to 2019?
6537460	6541940	Well, in an interview with Tetsuya Nomura, uh, he was talking about with IGN, uh, why
6541940	6543060	this delay happened.
6543060	6546900	The timing of the release that we actually are looking at, we were told by many people,
6546900	6551780	including hardware manufacturers, marketing teams, sales teams, that it just wasn't good
6551780	6552660	timing in the year.
6553460	6557220	He also mentioned that there are differences in holiday links and store behavior in different
6557220	6557780	regions.
6557780	6561300	And I suppose that's something to consider, uh, for kingdom hearts three, the square enix
6561300	6566100	Western offices had requested to release the game as simultaneously as much as possible
6566100	6567860	between Japan and America.
6567860	6572980	So we were no longer able to just think about Japanese issues and retail situations.
6573780	6574820	Kind of an interesting point.
6574820	6577220	Kingdom hearts three is also a big deal in Japan.
6577860	6581220	Christmas is not the same thing in Japan as it is here.
6581220	6586260	I mean, you might have a lovely cake, but it's not quite that same holiday season like
6586260	6586980	we have here.
6586980	6590980	So a January, 2019 release in Japan, not as big of a deal.
6590980	6591700	You know what I mean?
6591700	6592020	Yeah.
6592020	6595780	So that from that element, I'm like, okay, that actually makes a lot of sense.
6595780	6600660	Even though I was already in the camp of just get it right, bitches, just, you know, just
6600660	6603620	don't have to do all these patches post release.
6603620	6608020	Um, there were other considerations that went into January, 2019 as well.
6608020	6612020	We of course considered maybe speeding up development to release earlier than that would
6612020	6615780	when we were told that wasn't good, but the development team said, nope, we just couldn't
6615780	6616100	do that.
6616100	6618500	We could delay it, but we couldn't make it any sooner.
6618500	6620020	So they're not going to delay it obviously.
6620020	6621140	So there it is.
6621140	6624500	Uh, and they've also said on big hero six, a little tidbit.
6624500	6627220	We pretty much have finished creating all the gameplay within that world.
6627220	6629380	We're just not finished with the cut scenes yet.
6629380	6633140	They're not finished with the cut scenes and it's fucking like July or getting to get to
6633140	6633780	almost July.
6633780	6638260	By the time we have another episode, like, wow, I guess so.
6638260	6638980	I guess so.
6638980	6643380	I guess if they have the engine six, seven months, I mean, I guess that's true.
6643380	6643780	It's true.
6644180	6647940	I'm just a little surprised to hear we're not really in like, kind of like fix it all
6647940	6648260	up mode.
6648260	6649700	What are they supposed to do in seven months?
6649700	6650340	Yeah.
6650340	6650660	All right.
6650660	6654660	Anyway, uh, also one thing to keep in mind if you are looking forward to blood stained
6654660	6658420	ritual of the night, which, uh, Bradley brought up the eight spit eight bit spinoff earlier,
6658420	6662820	but obviously this is all kind of a prelude to the more symphony of the night type of
6662820	6663940	a blood stain game.
6663940	6669860	Uh, it will be releasing on Vita, but it's only going to be digital only, uh, is what
6669860	6670580	it sounds like.
6671060	6674820	And by the way, this is a little bit of a muddy issue right now because the original
6674820	6679780	report on this was actually updated after it came out saying it said on a slide that
6679780	6682180	it was Vita is digital only.
6682180	6687860	Uh, but apparently, uh, and a PR representative, uh, confirmed it, but then representatives
6687860	6693140	from bloodstain to said they're trying to make Vita copies for backers working, uh,
6693140	6696900	even though Sony is apparently ending physical media production for the platform in the West.
6696900	6700660	So it sounds like the issue is a little bit more complicated, but it sounds like it's
6700660	6704420	going to be a lot easier to get digitally than it will anywhere else.
6704420	6705460	Um, so there you go.
6705460	6707300	But blood stain, I'm looking forward to it.
6707300	6710340	I don't know if the Vita would have been my platform of choice, but I know a lot of
6710340	6714820	people, uh, really love the Vita, but, uh, I think a lot of people have moved on to Vita's
6714820	6716740	successor, uh, the Nintendo switch.
6717460	6719460	Anyway, dark Sakura.
6719460	6722020	Uh, what do you have for us in a rapid fire toast?
6722740	6723460	Yay.
6723460	6724740	And not avocado.
6725060	6729380	Even though it was on the menu at that place, I almost ordered avocado toast because even
6729380	6731540	though I'm turning 40, some days I want to be a millennial.
6732660	6733160	Xenial.
6733940	6736580	I'm never going to use that term, but you just did.
6736580	6736820	All right.
6736820	6738820	Anyway, I was using it ironically.
6738820	6740100	That was so hipster of me.
6740100	6740660	I know.
6740660	6741140	Fine.
6741140	6749300	Um, anyway, um, there is a Sonic the Hedgehog toaster that is on the, um, Sega store, Sega
6749300	6750340	shop, sorry.
6750340	6751780	Um, it's $35.
6751780	6754340	And if a thousand people don't order one, no one's getting one.
6754820	6760740	So if you want your toaster to burn Sonic's face onto your Wonder bread, then.
6761780	6762820	I kind of do.
6762820	6764420	Got a toast fast.
6764420	6769220	Although I do have a Hello Kitty toaster that I've used maybe twice in my life.
6769780	6771300	I have a nice toaster.
6771300	6776820	It's by like a normal company and it's red and matches my fucking kitchen.
6777380	6780100	We have a toaster oven that we use for pretty much everything.
6780100	6781300	As I'm sure a lot of people do.
6781860	6785860	I linked the link to the toaster in the chat room.
6786580	6787220	It's okay.
6787220	6793220	So according to this, that if everyone does that, they've sold 561 out of a thousand.
6794100	6797620	And if they sell them, they're going to ship by October 1st.
6798660	6804100	But only if they make the a thousand, if they don't do a thousand, nobody gets any good.
6804100	6804740	No Sonic.
6804740	6805380	Wow.
6805380	6808500	Talk about a book or a page out of Konami's book.
6808500	6809700	Wheel of bullshit.
6809700	6814500	You'll just have to wait for somebody to come out with the unofficial Sanic toaster.
6814500	6815540	You know what I'll do?
6815540	6821700	I will slice up some avocado and put it into a pastry bag and draw a fucking Sonic myself.
6822660	6823940	And it will look a bajillion.
6823940	6827460	It'll look like Sonic adventure, Sonic, and not just like the Sonic team logo.
6827460	6829380	Then my toast will have avocado on it.
6829380	6829940	I'm not sure.
6829940	6831380	Who said that's your fucking toast?
6831380	6832580	That's my toast, bitch.
6833140	6839780	My toast is going to have delicious avocado with Sonic's face.
6839780	6841380	You make your own goddamn sandwich.
6841380	6841940	That's right.
6843300	6845220	You can make yours out of mustard.
6845220	6849940	That's I feel like it will make you some whipped butter and you can have a yellow Sonic.
6849940	6851860	Not that I ever want to have Biggs the cat.
6851860	6854820	Not that I ever want to talk about Jamie's obituary, but you know,
6854820	6859300	like years and years and years from now, I feel like the obituary should say, you know,
6859300	6862980	Jamie, last name, such and such day, such and such date, and then put,
6862980	6864580	you can make your own goddamn sandwich.
6866660	6867160	That's it.
6867700	6877300	I want that to be if, if I don't do my, my tree pod burial in a protected land.
6877300	6881620	Cause you know that if you, if your body is buried on a reserve,
6881620	6885380	then that becomes a federally protected land that cannot be overridden.
6885380	6885880	True story.
6886500	6888900	So that's, what's going to happen to me, but you can make like
6888900	6892660	my temporary grave marker say, fuck your toast.
6893220	6893940	Your Memorial.
6893940	6898100	Or as Act Deft and Jack says, uh, Oh, bitch you airy.
6898100	6899060	Obituary.
6900500	6902820	That just reminds me of a really bad joke I learned in the eighties.
6903700	6904900	Now, you know, I'm going to ask.
6905460	6905940	Okay.
6905940	6910500	So the bear walks into a bar and he's like, I want some vodka.
6910500	6915460	And the, uh, bartender, the bartender says, we don't serve bears.
6915460	6917220	And the bear's like, well, if you don't give me some vodka,
6917300	6918820	I'm going to eat this woman over here.
6919940	6921860	Bartender's like, we still don't serve bears.
6921860	6927140	So the bear ate the lady and the bartender's like, and so the bear's like,
6927140	6929700	okay, give me some fucking vodka now.
6929700	6932820	And he's like, I can't, we don't serve, uh, drug users.
6933540	6935780	What the bear says that was a bar bitch.
6935780	6946980	You ate, I hate it.
6946980	6950340	I heard that in elementary school.
6950340	6951300	Oh God.
6952180	6954660	Oh, Hey, sorry.
6954660	6955060	Everybody.
6955060	6956660	Oh, LR is canceled.
6956660	6958420	I hope we had a great run.
6958420	6961860	Really great with that is where I draw as father as his father's day.
6961860	6964260	That was the ultimate of dirty dad jokes.
6964260	6964740	There you go.
6965540	6966100	All right.
6966100	6967220	Oh, LR is canceled.
6967220	6968100	Good night.
6968100	6970900	You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
6970900	6971700	Bite my butt.
6973220	6975140	I can tell you the one about the foo poo bird.
6975140	6976660	No, no more jokes.
6977220	6979060	Don't you have a story on soul caliber?
6979060	6986180	Well, you know why the clock is considered a bad person to have at a buffet?
6986740	6987940	He goes back four seconds.
6990660	6992100	What do you do with a chemist when he dies?
6992100	6992600	Stop it.
6993480	6993980	Bury him.
6995320	6996120	Okay.
6996120	7000200	So the other piece of news I'll just do it quick is so caliber six has a release date.
7000200	7002600	It's what happens when you started working with drew.
7002600	7003160	I know it.
7003160	7003720	I know it.
7003720	7005640	No, no, he did this to you.
7005640	7006840	He did this to you.
7006840	7009240	That joke predates his birth.
7011640	7012120	Oh my God.
7012120	7013320	He's learned how to time travel.
7015480	7020120	Some of the jokes I learned from my uncle and my uncle for not having any kids is definitely
7020120	7021240	the master of dad jokes.
7022760	7023720	Soul caliber six.
7023720	7025800	You need to look at chat at some point.
7025800	7029000	I am sad to announce the cancellation of orange lounge radio.
7029000	7030840	16 years was a great run.
7030840	7033400	After 16 years, we've reached peak status.
7033400	7034920	Oh, Bobby did one of my favorites.
7034920	7037800	Bobby black will show will be four hours every Sunday night.
7037800	7040120	Bobby said, do you want to hear a joke about sodium?
7040120	7042680	Nah, please.
7042680	7043880	For the love of God.
7043880	7047880	Do I was trying to, and then you were harassing me.
7047880	7049240	Mr. Smoosh, come tell you.
7049240	7050760	I was harassing you.
7050760	7056840	Come tell your daddy to STF years have been physically assaulted with a deadly pepper.
7059560	7064600	Anyway, so caliber six has a release date of October 19th, 2018.
7064600	7067960	They put out a story mode trailer, which I haven't watched because I've been interested
7067960	7069080	in soul caliber since two.
7069800	7072760	Um, and, uh, yeah.
7072760	7077720	Soul caliber on PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC.
7077720	7080360	So caliber four was pretty good and I can't wait for six.
7080840	7082760	I feel like the even numbered ones are good.
7082760	7087720	Soul caliber, by the way, introduced a very crazy in joke in my house.
7087720	7088360	Not a pun.
7088920	7093160	We just used to give everyone weird names, but the only one of them that is stuck is
7093160	7094040	Bob Astor off.
7095480	7096200	I'm Bob.
7096200	7097320	Bob Astor off.
7097320	7099560	You may know me from such games as soul Cal.
7101080	7104840	We would do like these whole intros as Bob Astor off in my house.
7104840	7106200	It was just me and Dan.
7106200	7108120	So Bob Astor off.
7108120	7108440	All right.
7108440	7109080	I'll remember that.
7109080	7110120	It's better than the other jokes.
7110520	7111160	Nightmare.
7111160	7111660	All right.
7112760	7117640	I, we would do like, like Julia Sofia would just come up with like crazy names.
7117640	7118440	So anyway, that's all.
7118440	7122200	But then I think a Tekken when you bring up Julia, Julia Chang was great.
7122200	7123000	Anyway.
7123000	7123240	All right.
7123240	7125720	And then she decided to be a wrestler.
7126600	7128280	She'd had her costume.
7128280	7129960	Let's travel around the world and check out some games.
7129960	7132040	We'll be playing a little sooner than soul caliber six.
7132680	7133480	All right.
7133480	7136200	And we should go to the end of the month for this since we're not going to be here.
7136760	7139240	Uh, yeah, we can do that if you want to go over a couple of weeks.
7139240	7139560	All right.
7139560	7141880	It's not gonna be much more, but let's do it.
7141880	7147080	Uh, the lost child is coming out in the switch PlayStation four in the Vita.
7147640	7149560	A game called Musenix.
7150280	7151160	Musenix.
7151160	7153800	I thought that's what I take when I have a cold.
7153800	7155960	It's like Muse musics.
7157080	7158440	They spelled it really wrong.
7158440	7159640	It's a rhythm game.
7159640	7160840	It's coming out on the switch.
7161880	7165640	Mustnix Vegas party on the switch.
7165640	7166440	It's a card game.
7167160	7175880	And then we've got Mario tennis aces on the switch and new Gundam breaker on PlayStation four.
7177160	7184600	And then we've got, um, the following week, the blob remastered on the switch hunting
7184600	7187560	simulator on the switch.
7187560	7189880	Do we really have to label everything as a simulator?
7189880	7194120	Because obviously if you're playing a hunting game on a console, it's probably not hunting
7194120	7194760	real animals.
7195560	7202520	Um, and then of course, luminous remastered that's coming out on PC, Xbox one, the only
7202520	7206200	thing I need near automata on Xbox one.
7206200	7210920	The other thing I need, which is an Android simulator, uh, the awesome adventures of captain
7210920	7213800	spirit on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
7213800	7218680	That's free and ease eight, uh, like Ramosa Donna on the switch.
7219800	7223960	And then if we're going to finish up the month, then let's just go ahead and do MotoGP 18.
7225000	7232280	Crash bandicoot insane trilogy on PC switch and Xbox one, the crew two on PC, PlayStation
7232280	7239240	four and Xbox one, the Vita, which is going to be getting, um, psychedelic, uh, of the
7239240	7240040	ashen Hawk.
7241080	7243640	And that's a visual novel surprise.
7243640	7247000	And then finally on the switch Wolfenstein two, the new Colossus.
7248040	7248440	Okay.
7248440	7251880	And if they can do Wolfenstein two, the new Colossus, which is an excellent game that
7251880	7253160	maybe they can do fallout for.
7253720	7255240	Did you mention on tempest?
7255240	7258680	4,000 is coming out on PlayStation four on June 26.
7258680	7262520	I didn't realize that it was also coming out on my birthday on the list.
7262520	7266440	It's on my other list is my Japanese list has some other stuff from other countries.
7266440	7268760	Did you know they're making a tempest 4,000 Jamie?
7268760	7271960	I remember it's one of those things like now that I see it, I'm like, Oh yeah, that was
7271960	7273000	the thing that's happening.
7273000	7274520	So I want to check that out.
7274520	7275720	I love me some tempest.
7275720	7276200	Yeah.
7276200	7276520	All right.
7276520	7279480	Anyway, uh, let's look at Japan and some of the releases for this month.
7279480	7283800	So in Japan, we have new Gundam breaker, uh, in a regular and several different types of
7283800	7286200	limited editions because they love their limited editions over there.
7286200	7287960	That is out on June the 21st.
7288680	7294920	And then closing out the month on the 28th, we have Tonari ni Kanoujo no Uru Shiwaze
7294920	7298120	Winter Guest in a regular and limited edition out in Japan.
7298680	7301400	Tonari means like neighbor something.
7301400	7301900	Yeah.
7302520	7307640	And then Island, a game called Island is also out in Japan and that is also on the 28th.
7307640	7312200	Although oddly, um, I guess it's a worldwide release because, uh, the crew too gets a Japanese
7312200	7314360	release on June the 29th.
7314360	7316680	So that is all on the PlayStation 4.
7316680	7320600	Um, taking a look quickly at the Nintendo switch and seeing what's out there.
7320600	7325000	Uh, we have, um, uh, a mahjong game that's coming out.
7325000	7329480	I'm sure you're all excited for that on the 21st, but also a Minecraft switch release,
7329480	7331560	uh, in Japan on June the 21st.
7331560	7334920	And then we have Mario Tennis Ace on June the 22nd.
7334920	7338520	So you Waluigi fans can at least, uh, have something, uh, to hold you over.
7338520	7343400	So that is out on, uh, the same day that it comes out in the rest of the world, the 22nd of June.
7343400	7349160	And then also in Japan, a game called Sheen, uh, on June 28th, as well as Ys VIII,
7349160	7353400	Lacrimosa of Dana on, uh, the 28th as well.
7353400	7354520	How about Europe, Dark Sakura?
7355160	7359320	Mario Tennis Aces coming out on June 22nd.
7359320	7364440	Also on the 22nd is Harvest Moon, Light of Hope for Switch and PlayStation.
7365000	7369960	Um, on the 29th, moving forward, we have The Crew 2 for PlayStation and Xbox.
7370600	7376360	We have Wolfenstein 2, The New Colossus for Switch on the 29th.
7376360	7377720	Actually, the rest of these are on the 29th.
7377720	7380440	We have Song of Memories for Switch and PlayStation,
7380440	7384520	Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy for Xbox, Switch, and PC.
7385480	7387880	Um, then that's it.
7387880	7389560	I almost went a little bit further, so that's all.
7392040	7392760	All right.
7392760	7394280	Let's, uh, let's go to the mailbag.
7394280	7397400	Every week you guys email us and, uh, sometimes we read them.
7397400	7402760	No, we always read them, uh, most of the time, as long as it isn't spam or something that
7402760	7404360	you say, don't read this on air.
7404360	7405240	We'll read it on air.
7405240	7409560	So, um, or like we have had some weeks where we get like eight emails all at once and sometimes
7409560	7412360	we have to edit a little bit, but this week I think we just have one or two.
7412360	7414600	So Dark Sakura is going to dive into the mailbag right now.
7414600	7418760	And if you want to send us an email, participate at orange.trader.com, especially since you
7418760	7422760	have two weeks, I would love to hear your stories about how long you've been listening
7422760	7428200	to OLR and like, if you have a favorite moment, um, from the past 16 years, or is the tweet
7428200	7430920	that we just got said, uh, what was this?
7430920	7435800	Uh, dark Tetsuya is saying, just have to say the whole joke tangent from earlier is why
7435800	7437800	I still do the show this many years later.
7439480	7440600	I got a joke for you.
7440600	7441000	There you go.
7443000	7444440	Moving on, uh, emails.
7444440	7445080	All right.
7445080	7447480	This comes from, um, Ron Chan.
7447480	7451240	Um, good afternoon, Rob, Jamie and Matt.
7451240	7453240	How are you all also happy pride.
7453240	7453960	Thank you.
7453960	7454360	Super.
7454360	7455160	Thanks for asking.
7455720	7458360	The last three or so weeks, my life has been hectic.
7458360	7460200	So I'm very thankful for podcasts.
7460200	7465800	Instead of calling in and discussing topics, we best to send an email one valve and visual
7465800	7466360	novels.
7466360	7468760	A part of me feels like valve shouldn't carry these titles.
7468760	7472440	Visual novels are more like an interactive book, like a choose your own adventure style
7472440	7472920	book.
7472920	7474680	The visual novels are akin to dating.
7474920	7479800	So I can see why they're on steam, but a lot do contain content in there.
7479800	7484360	Maybe this would just be a perfect time for, for valve to spin off a site just for that.
7485160	7488600	But valve, just like Twitch, they have a neutral slash gray area side.
7488600	7493080	When it comes to adult content, one voice actress said, censorship of sex and lobbying
7493080	7496920	against sexual material is a big reason people struggle with sex positivity.
7496920	7498760	You can find more in detail on this link.
7498760	7500040	I will put it in the chat.
7500840	7502120	Unless Ron Sean already does.
7502120	7507000	On the plus side, we do have Faku's gaming site that will handle these mature titles
7507000	7507480	as well.
7509400	7511080	Two, retro gaming.
7511080	7515720	I always said that I wanted to see Sega come back with a Linux-powered Dreamcast 2 system
7515720	7520440	with USB ports for controllers and a DVD drive that plays DVDs and GD disks.
7521320	7521820	Excuse me.
7522520	7527800	The closest that we have is the Atari VCS and the new Intellivision retro consoles.
7527880	7530280	Truth be told, I like the Atari VCS.
7530280	7532520	It's the first gaming system I ever played on.
7532520	7533560	I do kind of want one.
7533560	7537960	With the rise of retro games, I feel there's plenty of room in the ecosystem for more consoles.
7537960	7539880	They aren't competing with the big three.
7539880	7542760	I'm very skeptical of the price, but it's a wait and see for me.
7542760	7547080	It does sound like the Atari VCS will achieve what Gabe Newell tried with steam machines.
7548360	7551160	Three, PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5.
7551160	7555480	Given that the PS4 is only five years old, I really don't believe Sony's saying that
7555480	7557960	the console is winding down to the end of reproduction cycle.
7558600	7560920	Sorry, production cycle, not reproduction.
7560920	7564840	As for the rumors of the next system going rise in, I'm not really believing that.
7564840	7567800	When the PS4 came out, it was $399.
7567800	7571480	If they go rise in, expect the price to jump to $599.
7571480	7572520	Four, JD Roth.
7573080	7576280	I remember that y'all talked about him and some of his endeavors in reality shows,
7576280	7578680	but here's a couple of things you might not have known.
7578680	7580680	He was a host of the game show fun.
7580680	7581640	We knew that.
7581640	7584600	He was a host of the game show fun house, which was similar to Double Dare.
7585240	7586920	Here's a couple of clips below.
7586920	7590440	The show spun off another series called Fox's Fun House.
7590440	7592120	I didn't grow up in the 90s.
7592120	7594920	My friend wanted me to go on that show with him and I said no.
7594920	7598280	College Madhouse and Fun House UK, which ran for 10 years.
7599960	7601400	I'll copy and paste stuff in a bit.
7601400	7602840	Nothing to confuse with TV Fun House.
7602840	7606280	Unless Rob, you would care to go into the mailbag and copy and paste all those links for me.
7606280	7607720	Uh, I can try.
7607720	7613960	I just, for the live folks, Winamp straight up crashed at the end of that song and killed the
7613960	7614520	stream.
7614520	7615240	So weird.
7615240	7615640	Great.
7615640	7618760	So we've, we've been down while you were reading most of that email, but sorry.
7618760	7620120	Well, the podcast folks hear it.
7620120	7620620	Okay.
7621160	7622840	Um, five, Microsoft.
7622840	7624680	I admit they dropped the ball on exclusive titles.
7625240	7627400	Um, they really need to play catch up on that.
7627400	7632280	As for reducing the cost of Xbox live, I doubt that since Microsoft builds and maintains the
7632280	7637000	servers for all online games on their consoles, except for MMOs, a price reduction maybe,
7637000	7638040	but nothing more than that.
7638600	7639800	Six, Battlefield.
7639800	7641160	Jamie, you nailed that.
7641160	7642520	Yeah, of course I did.
7642520	7643960	Even I learned a few new things.
7643960	7647480	The problem is that history is so selective on what's taught in public schools that some
7647480	7651720	people refuse to learn on what actually, what really happened.
7651720	7653080	No shocker there.
7653080	7658200	And by the way, I'd like to just take this moment for people to go up and just research
7658200	7659000	the night witches.
7659640	7664040	I might've brought it up on the show the other week I was here, but these were women who
7664040	7668760	would cut the power to their planes, coast in on idle and bomb the fuck out of Germany.
7669480	7674200	The official Reddit for the battlefield thing foot, put their foot down this week and said,
7674200	7676600	no more posts about historical inaccuracy.
7676600	7677320	Shut up.
7677320	7678680	Basic in a nutshell.
7678680	7679560	This is battlefield.
7679560	7683560	We're talking about a game where it's very known that people eject out of their plane,
7683560	7687080	shoot someone with a rocket launcher and land back in their plane and fly away.
7687080	7687720	Come on.
7687720	7688600	I did that yesterday.
7690200	7691160	I think that's it.
7691160	7691560	Oh yeah.
7691560	7692200	One more thing.
7692200	7693400	Rob Loki was right.
7693400	7694440	I'm disappointed in you.
7695080	7700520	I think you should look up gravitation, uh, Yurikama Arashi and Dramatical Murder.
7700520	7705240	Oh, if you want to know more about some grade A yaoi titles, just ask Mako-chan.
7705240	7707800	Uh, I'll just stick to like X-tube.
7709320	7715960	For the record, for the record, I do have like episodes of like D gray man and, you
7715960	7718520	know, uh, sensitive pornography.
7718520	7721000	I just didn't know there were video games out.
7721000	7724360	I didn't know it went all the way to clearly I'm aware there's a whole convention.
7724920	7726200	I'm aware there's manga.
7726200	7729560	I'm aware that if you think of it, it exists.
7729560	7731640	However, I was not aware there was a video game.
7731640	7731880	That's all.
7731880	7732280	That's all.
7732280	7733640	That was the, that was the news to me.
7734200	7735320	I'm glad it's there.
7736520	7738920	Do you want to watch little boys touching each other?
7738920	7739160	No.
7740680	7740920	Good.
7740920	7741720	That's the right answer.
7742520	7743240	Yeah, that's it.
7743240	7748200	I do not like the was, they call it shota creepy.
7748760	7749640	Um, yeah, that's it.
7749640	7752840	My apologies on bad spelling punctuations and grammar.
7752840	7756440	Actually, dude, your article, your email is pretty nice.
7757000	7759800	I knew that there was more I wanted to talk about, but it's been,
7760920	7765000	but it's been three weeks and I have spent three or days.
7765000	7767080	I guess that should be three or more flops.
7767080	7769800	The grammar right at the end, working on this email at work.
7769800	7771400	Cause y'all are worth it.
7771400	7773480	See you all on the flip side.
7773480	7774120	Rama.
7774120	7775800	He has an exclamation point.
7775800	7776200	Run.
7778600	7779480	I don't know what else.
7779480	7782280	There was a lot to cover in this email here.
7782280	7788120	Um, I, I still think there's going to be changes with Xbox live, but I don't know.
7788120	7791640	Maybe, maybe Microsoft's going to try to position this a different way,
7791640	7793960	especially the studio acquisitions really change a lot.
7793960	7794760	So we'll see.
7794760	7799240	I still think if they really want to have an impact, they would merge that.
7799240	7803000	And their past that Xbox game pass, I think would really say a lot.
7803000	7804600	Uh, that's, that's all.
7804600	7807240	Um, but then, uh, what else?
7807240	7810760	The, uh, PlayStation four to PlayStation five and that whole thing.
7810760	7813160	I think it's all 2020 at this point.
7813160	7816520	I don't think next year, next year you might get some teases,
7816520	7819000	but I think 2020 is going to be the year it all goes down.
7819720	7823640	But not Nintendo, although Nintendo, I would anticipate is going to do a switch
7823640	7828520	deluxe or like some type of, you know, how they do the new 3DS.
7829640	7832120	There'll be something with the switch in a couple of years.
7832840	7836120	But anyway, last email.
7836120	7837720	Cause we got one in the interim.
7837720	7837960	Okay.
7838520	7840120	Uh, good evening you guys.
7840120	7841960	Well, E3 is done for another year.
7841960	7843400	Some surprises, some shockers.
7843400	7845400	I know quite a few games have gotten my interest.
7846440	7847480	Excuse me.
7847480	7853320	Nioh 2, Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Control, Resident Evil 2 remake.
7853320	7854840	I'm actually kind of looking forward to that.
7854840	7859080	Rage 2, Forza Horizon 4, Cuphead, The Last Course DLC,
7859880	7865080	Ghost of Tsushima, Metal Wolf Chaos, and Battlefield 5 for starters.
7865080	7867880	I thought the press conferences weren't as good in previous years.
7867880	7870280	Maybe it's because the overall delivery wasn't great.
7870280	7874280	Change of venue that set the tone or something, who knows.
7874280	7878520	The Sony presentation of The Last of Us 2 got people mad quiet when it ended.
7878520	7882760	I was surprised that, I was surprised that barely applauded.
7882760	7886360	Xbox is still hurting for exclusives and Nintendo did a great job.
7886920	7888440	Anyways, that's just my thoughts on it.
7888440	7890040	Take care of yourselves, needle crash.
7890680	7892920	There was a lot for the press conferences that were missing.
7892920	7895240	I think, I think is maybe where some of your thoughts are.
7895320	7898760	That's where I'm kind of at is I'm like, no Soul Calibur, no Red Dead.
7898760	7899960	You know, I said this earlier in the show.
7899960	7903720	It seems like there was a lot that weren't at the press conferences.
7903720	7904920	So that was kind of surprising.
7904920	7908040	But otherwise, I think we kind of, we kind of well went over our thoughts earlier,
7908040	7909320	but I appreciate you sharing yours.
7909880	7913960	And to clarify with The Last of Us, everything outside of the game looked great.
7915240	7918040	Like those scenes in the barn were really well done.
7918040	7923160	Like I'm almost, I wish it just weren't so gory and realistic.
7923160	7924680	Like I'm just not here for that.
7924680	7925080	Sorry.
7925080	7926040	Am I, am I old?
7926040	7926540	Maybe.
7928600	7929320	All right.
7929320	7929800	Rob.
7929800	7930300	What?
7930760	7932760	You have a week before you're old.
7932760	7933320	A couple weeks.
7934280	7935160	No, you're not.
7935160	7935800	No, I'm not.
7935800	7936120	I'm not.
7936120	7936840	I know I'm not.
7936840	7940040	It's just one of those, you know, it's just not for me.
7940040	7941080	Age is a number.
7941080	7941880	Yeah.
7941880	7943320	Experience is the real teacher.
7943320	7946040	I'm okay with like a little bit of violence in games.
7946040	7950040	Like I'm looking, I'm looking right at my copy of Rise of the Tomb Raider on Xbox One,
7950040	7950760	sitting right here.
7950760	7952840	Tomb Raider games can sometimes be a little intense.
7952840	7954680	They can get a little, you know, a little bloody and stuff.
7954680	7957160	Lara Croft and the terrible, no good, very bad day.
7957160	7959400	There's no fucking disembowelment in those games.
7959400	7959880	You know what I mean?
7959880	7961000	That's like in your face like that.
7961000	7962760	It's just that there's always the sequel.
7962760	7963320	I know.
7963320	7964440	Well, there is a sequel coming.
7964440	7965000	Who knows?
7965000	7965800	Well, they'll do in that.
7965800	7967320	So anyway.
7967320	7967560	All right.
7967560	7968600	Thank you for the emails.
7968600	7969320	Send us more.
7969320	7971960	Participate at orange lounge radio.com.
7971960	7975400	Until then, we have more stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line at orange
7975400	7976120	lounge radio.
7976120	7976920	Loki.
7976920	7978840	Let's talk about nudity.
7978840	7979960	Let's all right.
7980040	7984360	So Cyberpunk 2077 is going to have the nudity.
7984360	7984860	Woohoo!
7985960	7989240	And because CD Projekt Red said,
7989240	7992280	Nudity is important for us because of one reason.
7992280	7993160	It's important for me too.
7993800	7995000	This is Cyberpunk.
7995000	7996680	So people augment their body.
7996680	7999960	So the body is no longer sacred.
7999960	8000920	It's profane.
8001800	8007160	And because people modify everything, they're losing their connection to their body to the
8007160	8007960	meat.
8007960	8010760	And that's why we need to use nudity in many situations.
8011400	8014120	Whatever you have to do to justify it.
8014120	8014840	Sure.
8014840	8015480	Sure, guys.
8015480	8019880	So yes, there'll be nudity in the game and looks interesting.
8019880	8023160	And we're talking, we're talking lady nudity and boy nudity.
8023160	8023400	Yeah.
8023400	8024440	All nudity.
8024440	8025800	Equal opportunity nudity.
8026760	8028520	When the kind of augments are we talking about?
8030120	8032440	That's buy the game and find out.
8032440	8033880	No, it looks really good.
8033880	8036840	Is there going to be a booby slider and a dick slider?
8037080	8038440	I don't think it works that way.
8038440	8039640	I don't think it does either.
8039640	8043480	No, it's very much like the Cyberpunk tabletop game or like the RPG.
8044120	8046200	So you have different stats and stuff.
8046200	8046600	Sure.
8046600	8049400	But I really am looking forward to this game.
8049400	8050440	It looks really good.
8050440	8051160	Yeah.
8051160	8053960	Apparently a lot of people that went and saw the presentation because they did like a theater
8053960	8056040	presentation, apparently a lot of people were really impressed.
8056040	8060200	And I remember going to see the Witcher 3 presentation at one of the last E3s I went to.
8060200	8061880	And I was impressed then.
8061880	8064600	I remember walking out of that going, that was like a goddamn movie.
8064600	8065800	And we just saw the Witcher.
8065800	8068680	And that was like, like that was a game that was not on my radar at that point.
8068680	8074920	And then after that, I was like that I remember that I don't usually go the art direction
8074920	8076920	and that was really fucking good.
8076920	8079800	But I walked out of the Witcher 3 going the art direction.
8079800	8081560	And that was really fucking good.
8081560	8081800	Yeah.
8081800	8084360	I haven't played the Witcher 3 or any of the other Witcher games.
8084360	8085080	I may have to try that.
8085080	8086040	You should try Witcher 3.
8086040	8086680	It's pretty.
8086680	8087880	And I say that to myself too.
8087880	8089480	I played a little bit, but not nearly enough.
8089480	8094680	I really need to like, instead of going back and playing more Diablo or playing Final Fantasy
8094680	8097720	12 again or so, I need to go back and fucking force myself to play the Witcher 3.
8097720	8101640	Cause it is, it is very, um, or Fallout store and Grand Theft Auto.
8101640	8102760	Yes, or Fallout 4.
8104120	8104440	All right.
8105240	8111480	Anyhow, um, or maybe I could play this game cause this might be something that's coming.
8111480	8117800	Now take this with a big grain of salt because it's coming from user forums.
8118600	8121160	Oh no, not user forums.
8121160	8122040	I know, I know.
8122040	8127800	But there's a lot of buzz around the fact that Konami was showing something at E3 behind
8127800	8129960	closed doors that was under an NDA.
8130600	8136680	There's a lot of, there's a lot of buzz and it's going to be revealed soon.
8136680	8137320	A lot of buzz.
8137320	8142680	It's another Castlevania game, um, that it is something that actually Konami could be
8142680	8147800	doing to counteract bloodstain, which seems like a real Dick move in many ways.
8147800	8148360	You know what I mean?
8148360	8150680	Cause like they're pretty Dick company nowadays.
8150680	8153800	I guess so, but, um, which I don't know how you counter it.
8153800	8156120	The only way you counter it is to get the jump on it.
8156120	8159240	So if they're about to announce a Castlevania game, then they're going to say like, this
8159240	8161480	thing is almost done and coming out like now.
8162040	8165640	But the other thing that they say goes with this, and I guess this comes from the same
8165640	8170440	leaker that had said Ridley and Ice Climbers are back in Super Smash Brothers.
8170440	8175960	Um, this same leaker is saying Simon Belmont is an unannounced character in Super Smash
8175960	8180760	Brothers Ultimate, which I, I I'd fucking love that honestly.
8180760	8185800	And you know, even though you probably go, well Castlevania, Nintendo, go way back to
8185800	8193160	the NES days and Castlevania three was on the classic NES class, uh, super, super Castlevania
8193160	8194600	four on the super NES.
8194600	8199080	So it's not like Nintendo Konami's like Castlevania's relationship, like went anywhere.
8199080	8200520	So yes, I'm in Belmont.
8200520	8200680	Fuck.
8200680	8200920	Yeah.
8200920	8202360	That's something I associate with.
8202360	8203320	It's back.
8203320	8203880	So why not?
8203880	8204360	Why not?
8204360	8205240	Exactly.
8205240	8207800	So from that standpoint, it makes a lot of sense.
8207800	8210520	I, it does feel a little bit fanfic to me.
8210520	8212680	Um, but I'm saying I'm not going to expect it.
8212680	8214520	I'm going to take it with a huge grain of salt.
8214520	8218120	I would love to see Konami bring back Castlevania, I guess.
8218120	8219400	I mean, they got to do it right.
8219400	8223800	And it's going to be weird with Igarashi not there, but I'll give them the benefit of the
8223800	8224300	doubt.
8225160	8229240	Apparently also the Castlevania thing could be being held back a little bit because of
8229240	8229960	the anime.
8230520	8232040	That also makes a lot of sense.
8232040	8234840	Netflix's Castlevania anime is doing pretty well.
8234840	8235640	Why not revisit?
8235640	8237480	I just was browsing Netflix the other day.
8237480	8239160	I'm like, Oh yeah, that's on there.
8239160	8239320	Yeah.
8239320	8240520	Totally forgot about that.
8240520	8245640	So well, and Bob, Bob coffee and chat says, Konami making a new game lulz.
8246360	8251000	You forget though, that bomber man game that they did for the switch release did pretty
8251000	8251320	well.
8251320	8252680	It exceeded expectations.
8252680	8257000	Now, I think the reason for that is there wasn't a lot of games that released besides
8257000	8259480	Zelda, the PlayStation four and Xbox one versions.
8259480	8260920	Do you know that it's on those systems?
8260920	8261560	Yes.
8261640	8265720	But I mean, that game did very well, I think because it came out at a really good time,
8265720	8269160	but whatever the reason, bomber man kind of exceeded expectations.
8269160	8272920	So I think this is making Konami kind of take a second look at the retro library, which
8272920	8275080	we've been fucking saying for 10 years, but whatever.
8275080	8277560	Finally, what is it with game companies getting the memo?
8277560	8281000	Like three years to one game in the retro library that could use another release.
8281800	8283080	Does it start with dance?
8283080	8284280	It does start with dance.
8284280	8285160	Does it start with beat?
8286920	8287420	All right.
8288760	8289560	Both at the same time.
8289560	8292840	You better not say it starts with beat because then they might confuse that as, Oh, new beat
8292840	8293340	and groovy.
8294680	8294920	Yeah.
8294920	8295320	Good point.
8295320	8295820	Good point.
8296520	8296840	All right.
8296840	8302120	Oh, as Joe and her Matt two points out, uh, bomber man is an assist trophy and smell that
8302120	8304120	what they did go out of their way to show that.
8304120	8309240	So, you know, Konami and, and, uh, Nintendo are still friends.
8310040	8311000	So we'll see.
8311000	8315800	Uh, Bob coffee says the next season of Castlevania anime is supposed to drop in July.
8315800	8320760	Maybe news will drop at anime expo or later in July at San Diego comic con.
8320760	8324520	I think games come, they're announcing, Oh, and by the way, the new, the new playable
8324520	8331640	character master chief in his fucking cross play with the X bar and the ceiling opens
8331640	8333080	up and Mike's fall from the ceiling.
8333080	8334280	No, I don't think that will happen.
8334280	8338440	And then all of a sudden Gabe tumbles from the ceiling goes, sorry about steam, but half
8338440	8344440	life three, that won't happen because that will involve apologizing for steam.
8345160	8345720	All right.
8345720	8348200	A few more stories for you guys before the Skypline dark soccer.
8348200	8349000	What do you have for us?
8349000	8350280	Speaking of animes, right?
8350280	8355320	Yeah, well, um, trigger in Arc system and we know Arc system works has done, um, guilty
8355320	8360520	year blaze blue and recently dragon ball fighter Z they're doing a kill a kill game.
8360520	8363160	I am down for this because I fucking love kill a kill.
8363880	8367400	Remember fashion, fashion kills fashion is murder.
8368280	8371720	Um, so yeah, I don't know if it's going to be a fighting game.
8371720	8374360	It just says that it's kill a kill the game.
8375160	8380680	Um, they say that it should be published in 2019, so we'll see what happens when it happens,
8380680	8382200	but I'm still happy.
8382200	8387960	As long as we have like little Omake scenes with Mako in it, I'd be, be pretty, pretty
8387960	8388460	entertained.
8389400	8393240	Um, but it's, it's described as kill a kill battle action.
8393960	8398040	This doesn't say if it's going to be a fighting game or what type of, you know, I would assume
8398040	8403560	it's a fighting game since it's Arc system, but still whatever it is.
8403640	8407000	I guess Arc system works are saying in chat is publishing it, but the people behind little
8407000	8408360	witch academia are making it.
8408920	8409320	Okay.
8409320	8409820	Yeah.
8410360	8411160	Well, we'll see.
8411160	8414840	I'm looking at their English website right now and huh, this is awesome.
8415800	8417080	I fucking love kill a kill.
8417720	8420040	I freaking cried at the end of kill a kill.
8420040	8420920	So it was great.
8422040	8422840	All right.
8422840	8427800	Uh, Loki, I know you, I know you didn't put this on your show row request thread, but
8427800	8429640	I was like, I know he's going to want to talk about it.
8429640	8431400	Of course I want to talk about it.
8431400	8436760	So you may remember we talked about the Bethesda conference and one of the jokes that was in
8436760	8442440	there was the Skyrim, very special edition, which was, you know, playing Skyrim on Alexa.
8442440	8442920	Right.
8442920	8443800	And that's hilarious.
8444920	8445240	Yeah.
8445240	8448360	It's hilarious because you know, it was a funny video and stuff.
8449720	8454120	But we just couldn't leave it at that, but you were disappointed.
8454120	8455720	You were like, I want this to be real.
8455720	8459480	But at that point it was not just leave the joke at that.
8459480	8461960	They had to go 100% with the joke.
8462760	8464920	And yes, it is a real thing.
8464920	8466280	I appreciate that commitment.
8466920	8469960	You can download it to run on Alexa.
8469960	8473240	That is, that is now my favorite announcement out of Bethesda's conference.
8473240	8478840	Or if you don't happen to own an Alexa device, you can also get it through, you know, if
8478840	8484360	you get, um, through the Amazon store app on iOS or Amazon Alexa app through Android,
8484360	8488120	you can also click on Alexa and have her get that as well.
8488120	8488760	So nice.
8490040	8490360	Yes.
8490360	8491000	That's awesome.
8492040	8493960	Hooray for silly jokes.
8493960	8494760	It is free.
8494760	8495320	Yay.
8495320	8496120	Free 99.
8496120	8496920	My favorite price.
8497720	8499000	So go check it out.
8499000	8499560	All right.
8499560	8502520	Just try not to knock all your furniture over like that dude did in the trailer.
8502520	8507560	And then the wife or whoever that was supposed to be comes in and goes, will that thing clean
8507560	8508120	that shit up?
8509000	8511000	That was my favorite.
8511000	8511320	All right.
8511320	8514520	Anyway, um, one more news story for you guys.
8514520	8518200	And, uh, you know, we aren't going to be here next week, so I don't want you guys to forget.
8518200	8520520	But games done quick is going to get started.
8520520	8521480	So you know what?
8521480	8524840	I am totally fine with the fact that we're going to take a week off.
8524840	8526840	So the games done quick can do their thing.
8526840	8529720	We're going to step aside, um, summer games done quick.
8529720	8531800	It gets underway on June 24th.
8531800	8533480	It's happening in Minnesota.
8533480	8535320	It's running through July 1st.
8535320	8539640	If you want to attend in person, uh, you can go to the double tree Hilton in Bloomington,
8539640	8541560	Minnesota, and that's where it's going to be.
8541560	8545800	And it's cost $65 if you registered early, but they do have an attendance cap.
8545880	8549800	Uh, but I'm sure most of you are going to be watching on Twitch.
8549800	8554360	So check that out, uh, next week, although Bobby would like to, uh, you all to remember
8554360	8555560	he still will be live.
8555560	8557720	So you should still listen to him.
8557720	8558360	Yes, you should.
8558360	8562600	But you could, I think Bobby, it would be permissible if at least they listen to the
8562600	8565960	podcast at some point in the week, Bobby's been really good about getting his podcast
8565960	8567080	up within a couple of days.
8567080	8569960	So at least listen to Bobby at some point during the week, if you're not going to be
8569960	8575720	here live on Sunday night, just like we would hope you would listen to a OLR on the podcast.
8575800	8578120	If you could not be here live.
8578120	8581160	Uh, and I'm sure Bobby will tell you about what's going on in Summer Games Done Quick.
8581160	8584280	And hopefully whatever game they're doing, maybe he'll luck out.
8584280	8586360	They'll be doing a transition during that time or something.
8586360	8587400	Setting up for something big.
8587400	8587880	I don't know.
8587880	8589400	Anyway, but there you go.
8589400	8593400	Summer Games Done Quick is coming up and, uh, I didn't, oh, I didn't catch the charity.
8593400	8595720	Uh, what charity are they raising money for this time?
8595720	8596520	You guys know, where is it?
8596520	8597560	Doctors Without Borders.
8597560	8598920	It's always Doctors Without Borders.
8598920	8603320	Uh, it is, well, they say that in their history, but I want to know, oh yeah, no, it is.
8603400	8607160	Charity is Doctor Without Borders, but they have done Prevent Cancer Foundation.
8607160	8608280	I think that's their winner one.
8608280	8609640	I know they do one in the summer, one in the winter.
8609640	8612040	So Doctors Without Borders is the charity.
8612040	8615800	That's important to get out there too, because technically you could donate to that charity
8615800	8618920	without this event, but I'm pretty sure it will be a big incentive.
8619560	8621240	All right, let's open up the Skype line.
8621240	8623560	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8623560	8627160	If you want to get in and call, um, I may be limiting the length of some of the calls
8627160	8629080	tonight just so we can get through.
8629080	8633960	So please don't take it as a personal offense if I limit your call a little bit, just to
8633960	8637320	make sure we get through everybody that wants to call, assuming people do want to call.
8637320	8641480	It is the 16th anniversary, not to guilt you, but, um, we're not going to be here next week.
8643160	8645160	Anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8645160	8647400	Do we have any last minute stories we want to squeeze in while we wait?
8647960	8654200	Um, yeah, I was going to talk about Netflix is going to be getting, um, more gaming on
8654200	8654840	the platform.
8654840	8656280	Not really Netflix.
8656280	8660440	Yeah, not really necessarily gaming per se, but you remember that they've done some of
8660440	8662920	these like interactive storybook type things.
8662920	8668680	So they have a Minecraft story mode, um, is licensed to do five interactive narrative
8668680	8670600	series that are going to be coming out this fall.
8671640	8673400	So they have that.
8673400	8673960	I like that.
8674680	8675480	Let's get to the calls.
8675480	8676520	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8676520	8676920	Who's this?
8677640	8679320	Hey, this is Reginator.
8679320	8680840	Hey buddy, what's your question for us tonight?
8681480	8687160	Uh, well, no, before I get to my camera, I just want to call tonight.
8687160	8690680	So I do want to encourage you to, to try to get to it as fast as you can.
8690680	8696680	Uh, well, I was just going to say, you know, congratulations on 16 years of, uh, you know,
8696680	8697720	of doing the show.
8697720	8698040	Thank you.
8698040	8706120	Uh, it now for my question now is, you know, uh, considering the main focus of tonight's
8706120	8715800	show has been, uh, E3, um, was there anything, uh, that you were kind of sort of hoping
8715800	8723000	that would be, uh, talked about in any, any of the press conferences that wasn't, uh,
8723000	8729560	or maybe something that you were, you know, kind of sort of knew something about, but
8729560	8733720	they make appearance or maybe some kind of surprise that, um,
8734120	8736840	for me, it would be final fantasy 16.
8736840	8741080	I was really convinced this was going to be the year they would give us a peek at it.
8741080	8745960	Um, I thought maybe we'd get a more traditional final fantasy, uh, like, like final fantasy
8745960	8750120	nine style or, or, you know, four style maybe in the engine of 15, but I guess that's kind
8750120	8751560	of what the remake is supposed to be.
8751560	8757160	So, and maybe I think in many ways, final fantasy seven remake is final fantasy 16.
8757160	8759640	Not that I think they're going to rebrand it as that, but I feel like we're not going
8759640	8764280	to progress in the final fantasy series until this seven remake happens, which is starting
8764280	8766280	to make me resent this remake a little bit.
8766280	8769240	So I really hope they figure it out and get this out.
8770040	8774280	I mean, obviously I want it to be good, but I want them to also move on with the main
8774280	8775000	games.
8775000	8776920	So, um, there is that.
8776920	8783240	Um, but, uh, let's see, otherwise I guess I would join the echoes of people on the switch
8783240	8785320	and I'm sure Jamie's in this camp too.
8785320	8788600	I was really hoping to hear about animal crossings future and thought that this might be the
8788600	8789480	year for that.
8789480	8793560	And, uh, to come up short on that and maybe, maybe that that peak at Metroid prime four
8793560	8794440	would have been nice.
8794440	8796040	Uh, Jamie, Loki, anything you want to add?
8796040	8799080	Think thing you, you wish you would have heard of at E3 that you didn't.
8799080	8800360	Borderlands three.
8800360	8800920	Yeah.
8800920	8801800	That's a good call.
8801800	8802760	Where the hell was that?
8802760	8804760	Very good call animal crossing.
8804760	8805320	That's it.
8805320	8805800	Yeah.
8805800	8806840	That's all I care about.
8806840	8807400	Uh, quickly.
8807400	8810120	Reginator anything in your camp that you, you were hoping for?
8810840	8814040	Um, two answers, a serious answer.
8814600	8820520	Maybe, you know, some of the third party companies would resurrect some of their somewhat forgotten
8820520	8826600	a series like Namco Bandai bringing back, uh, no, uh, what's my call it?
8826600	8834920	Uh, they're, uh, they're one racing series, uh, Ridge racer and not, not like, uh, the
8834920	8840760	Ridge racer and bothered crap, you know, style game, but more true to form PlayStation one
8840760	8847720	games, games like, uh, our four or, uh, or, you know, the earlier titles check out horizon
8847720	8848200	four though.
8848200	8852280	I'm I'm gonna, they don't pay me to push that series, but I love me some fours of horizon.
8852280	8855960	So if you like your arcade racers, uh, put your eyes over there.
8856920	8857320	Yeah.
8857320	8857640	Yeah.
8857640	8864920	In fact, I got that recently on the original 360, um, and the game was pretty good.
8865480	8867800	Um, no, it was for a joke cancer.
8867800	8869320	I would have loved to have seen a game.
8869320	8876040	You'll come out on stage, drop pants with, uh, you know, a half-life tattooed on his
8876040	8882120	nether regions and him giving everyone the fingers and sucking, you know, motherfuckers
8882120	8882680	or whatever.
8884200	8884440	I know.
8884440	8887000	I'd rather not see that either, but yeah, I understand.
8888280	8890600	If something like that is going to happen, it has to be extra.
8890600	8893400	So, uh, I appreciate the calls, uh, rage Nader.
8893400	8894440	Thank you so much and take care.
8894440	8894680	Okay.
8895240	8895560	Yep.
8895560	8896200	Have a good one.
8896200	8897000	You too.
8897000	8898120	Uh, orange launch radio.
8898120	8898920	All one word on Skype.
8898920	8902440	If you want to get through, uh, act F says no Kirby game.
8902440	8903080	E3 ruined.
8903080	8904680	Did you just get a fucking Kirby game?
8905400	8906280	Yeah, there was a Kirby game.
8906280	8909400	They just, will you let us F zero fans have a moment?
8909400	8913080	Just like the people complaining about wasn't fucking had a Kirby game.
8913080	8914520	I'm getting a star Fox game.
8915480	8916520	Oh my God.
8916520	8917240	What do you think this is?
8917240	8919160	Call of duty where you get a new game every year.
8919800	8921320	Act F put a frown face.
8921320	8921560	Fine.
8921560	8922200	I'll get, you know what?
8922200	8924280	Act F I'll meet you halfway.
8924280	8927000	I would have enjoyed a new Kirby golf game.
8927000	8927640	How about that?
8927640	8928120	All right.
8928120	8929240	We got another call coming in.
8929240	8930280	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
8930280	8930680	Who's this?
8931480	8932600	Hey, what's going on?
8932600	8933320	It's Ranya.
8933320	8934120	Hey Rama.
8934120	8936920	You're now I can see that you're not calling from a Dixie cup.
8936920	8940040	I think that microphone, your gain is like really high up on that.
8940040	8940840	It's really busted.
8940840	8941480	I think that's what's up.
8943480	8948760	Well, I've had trouble with it lately, so I think it's with my setup, but my systems
8948760	8950200	is low over here for an update.
8950200	8955960	So that's not here nor there, but I only turn on the webcam for two reasons.
8956520	8958200	I already saw what you got in your hand.
8958200	8958920	I know it's coming.
8958920	8959560	I can't wait.
8959560	8960840	My favorite, my favorite.
8960840	8963160	This is a bottle of, is that vodka?
8963880	8966120	No, this is Puerto Rican rum, my friend.
8966120	8968200	Oh, even guys, Puerto Rican rum.
8969400	8971880	So as you can see, he's opening it up.
8973160	8976360	This is the type I don't need to do heroes of the storm commentating.
8976360	8978360	I want to do people drinking, commentating.
8978360	8983080	So, uh, this lovely man on our cam right now is pouring a shot of that rum into a little
8983080	8983800	shot glass.
8983800	8985080	It's a, it's a plain shot glass.
8985080	8986840	I don't see a logo or anything on it.
8986840	8989800	Oh, there's a real flavor similar to Final Fantasy on there.
8989800	8992040	So I don't know if you see it that well.
8992040	8992520	I see it.
8992520	8994200	It's one of those frosted glass things.
8994200	8994680	Okay.
8994680	8998280	It's a, it's a plain shot glass, you know, to remind you that we don't have anything
8998280	8999320	branded that we sell.
8999320	8999560	All right.
8999560	9000520	Let the man make a toast.
9001160	9004680	Well, I will say that I have no problem doing shots while doing a live stream.
9004760	9012120	You know, I got nothing else better to do, but to have a great 16th from the younger
9012120	9014040	brother at anime jam session.
9014040	9016760	So thank you so much.
9018040	9022680	Which means that since Travis is getting all the car, you have to drive us around.
9022680	9024760	Uh, Rama, I'm going to need you to do another shot.
9024760	9032920	I already gave you shit over, over your alley.
9032920	9034600	Don't, don't get me started tonight.
9034600	9035720	Rama, it's my birthday.
9035720	9037320	It's my 16th birthday.
9037320	9038680	It's my party.
9038680	9043880	So I'm going to need him to do another shot because I was waiting for the here's to you
9043880	9045240	and here's to me.
9045240	9046440	That's all right.
9046440	9047320	He knows where I'm going.
9048440	9048920	All right, here we go.
9049880	9051400	I got the man to take another shot.
9051400	9052200	I love it.
9052200	9053640	He's pouring himself a second shot.
9055400	9059160	And I, all I see is his lips going motherfucker.
9061480	9062440	This is why I love you.
9064200	9065160	Here's to you.
9065160	9066040	Here's to me.
9066040	9067800	The best of friends we'll ever be.
9067800	9070920	If we should ever happen to disagree, well, then thank you.
9070920	9071800	And here's to me.
9071800	9073000	Thank you, sir.
9073000	9075320	That was, that was the toast I was waiting for my friend.
9077720	9079960	I held up on the toast cause you were cutting it for time.
9079960	9083640	I didn't want to take up any more time, but I guess this is an exception to the rule.
9083720	9085880	Actually, Rob, I'm going to need you to do one more shot.
9085880	9090280	No, I'm kidding.
9090280	9095000	We would do at the end of D and D that actually was in mass effect.
9096200	9097800	Um, here's to us.
9098360	9099160	Who's like us.
9099800	9100840	Damn few.
9100840	9101560	And they're all dead.
9103560	9104120	All right.
9104120	9106360	Rama drink responsibly.
9106360	9107000	I know you do.
9107000	9107640	Thank you so much.
9107640	9108280	You know what?
9108280	9112600	I, you have been listening to this show for a very, very, very long time and I appreciate
9112600	9113320	you so much.
9113320	9117640	And, uh, I, the show that you guys do makes me proud y'all.
9118280	9119480	And we appreciate it.
9119480	9123160	And like you said at the top of the show, we're all like family.
9123160	9124680	We've been here for each other.
9124680	9126040	Y'all have been there for the past year.
9126040	9129960	My mother, you have been there when my ex dumped me and other cool things.
9129960	9132760	So I, you know how much I really appreciate having this show.
9132760	9136120	So, Hey, why we appreciate having you as part of the fam.
9136120	9136920	All right.
9136920	9138520	Hey, that's all that matters.
9138520	9140440	So I'm going to be on my nose a little way now.
9140440	9140680	All right.
9140680	9141320	One more shot.
9141320	9141960	It'll help you sleep.
9141960	9142600	Take care, buddy.
9144680	9145320	Bye my friend.
9148520	9148760	All right.
9148760	9150040	We'll try to squeeze in one more call.
9150040	9153320	If you can get in here, orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
9153320	9154440	If you want to give us a call.
9154440	9158920	By the way, I just got a text message from our buddy, uh, Brad at pod culture who said
9158920	9160120	no fireball in the house.
9160120	9163480	Cause that's his go-to drink, but cracking a cold one for OLR.
9163480	9164360	And this sounds good.
9164360	9165240	Uh, dark soccer.
9165240	9166200	I think you'd be into this too.
9166200	9167480	It's like a pineapple.
9167480	9169640	It's an apple pineapple, hard cider.
9170280	9172120	That's very similar to the mimosa you had earlier.
9172120	9173320	You know what I'm making though right now?
9173320	9177000	I'm infusing vodka with, um, fresh plums and cherries.
9177960	9178600	A little bit of it.
9178600	9182200	Cause I can't have much, but I, of course I also have grapefruit soju at home.
9182200	9182760	Right.
9182760	9186200	Well, you could always invite me over to drink and Guinness and then sleep on the couch and
9186200	9188440	some belching beaver peanut butter milk stout.
9188440	9189000	All right.
9189000	9190120	Last call for calls.
9190120	9192360	Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
9192360	9192840	Let me check in.
9192840	9194840	If there's any other last minute stories we want to get to.
9194840	9195160	Nope.
9195160	9195880	Don't have anything.
9195880	9196760	No, nothing.
9197320	9197720	All right.
9198360	9202520	Uh, looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
9202520	9205080	Um, let's see.
9205080	9208360	Um, dark to see you saying Rob over here trying to get Rama drunk.
9208360	9209400	That's what I do.
9209400	9213080	Uh, Brad from pod culture also in chat says, uh, it's fucking tasty.
9213080	9216600	Sia Tabiri says apple pen, pineapple pen cider.
9218440	9220200	Way to go meme from a year ago.
9220200	9223640	Rob, I'm gonna have to take you to up cider in San Francisco.
9223640	9224760	It's nothing but cider.
9225320	9227320	Nothing but yummy from all over the world.
9227320	9231080	Many of them on tap, but they had a black bear, uh, a blackberry cider
9231080	9233880	from Spain that was to die for.
9233880	9234200	Nice.
9234200	9235400	I will have to take you there.
9235400	9238200	Um, unfortunately, you know, my July is booked solid.
9238200	9239640	Who says I have to take you there now?
9239640	9239960	I know.
9239960	9244040	I know me, but, uh, my July is booked pretty solid at least Saturdays.
9244040	9245480	Cause there's rehearsals coming up.
9245480	9248760	I should plug this for anybody who is local in Northern California.
9248760	9250840	We are going to be doing clue the movie.
9250840	9251240	That's right.
9251240	9254440	The old school movie from 1985 with Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn,
9254440	9257880	clue the movie live on stage and on screen.
9257880	9260600	So it's like a Rocky horse style shadow cast.
9260600	9261720	And you ready for this?
9261720	9263400	I don't even know if I should be saying this on the show.
9263400	9263900	You ready?
9264440	9267880	I am unretired because I stopped performing in these shows a few years ago.
9267880	9268600	I still host them.
9268600	9270840	I host them all the time, but I stopped performing in them.
9270840	9272840	I unretired to do this role.
9273640	9274520	I'm going to be playing.
9275080	9277560	Mrs. Peacock in clue.
9277560	9281480	So if you're local, I really, we bought makeup today.
9281480	9281880	Yes, we did.
9281880	9282920	We went out and bought makeup.
9282920	9286520	I bought, I brought one of my best gal pals out to go make up shopping with me.
9286520	9287960	So check that out.
9287960	9288600	All right.
9288600	9291240	Anyway, uh, the Skype line is not lighting up anymore.
9291240	9295400	So I hope you guys will at least tweet us at OLR or maybe, uh, leave us, uh, an email
9295400	9298120	participate at orange lounge radio.com.
9298120	9301160	But again, you know, we've already gotten a little heavy tonight, but I really want
9301160	9303960	to thank all you guys for your support over the past 16 years.
9303960	9307240	Thank you so much for helping orange launch radio be the show that it is today.
9307240	9310520	If you liked what you heard here at OLR, give us all your money.
9310520	9311640	No, I'm, I'm, I'm kidding.
9311640	9315960	We don't usually end the show with that, but, uh, I will say in, in lieu of, uh, you
9315960	9320120	know, uh, whatever money giving source I would give you here, I would say, help us
9320120	9320760	spread the word.
9320760	9322680	Um, tell a friend or two about the show.
9322680	9325480	Help us spread the word because orange launch radio is just show where every gamer
9325480	9326040	has a voice.
9326040	9328440	But if the voices aren't here, we can't hear them.
9328440	9332600	Uh, a nice five star, we're just hearing voices, a nice five star review on a place
9332600	9336680	like iTunes or Google play podcasts or wherever it is you heard this show.
9336680	9338120	Those go an awful long way.
9338120	9341160	You guys, you really can't underestimate the power of those good reviews.
9341240	9344680	So please, please take a moment to leave us those reviews would really appreciate it.
9344680	9346440	Um, let's go around and wrap it up.
9346440	9346840	Bradley.
9346840	9349720	I know I didn't get to talk to you a lot past the introduction, but I saw you, I saw
9349720	9351640	you playing on your 3DS over there.
9351640	9353800	I hope, uh, I hope you had a good time.
9353800	9354360	How was it?
9354360	9355000	It was good.
9355000	9358360	It's good to have you here just for support, especially since I know you were one of the
9358360	9361960	faces that was here early on in OLR history.
9361960	9362440	What do you think?
9362440	9363080	Let me ask you this.
9363080	9363720	We'll leave on this.
9364280	9368200	What, what, what do you think's changed the most in 16 years here on this show from
9368200	9369800	what you've observed in the past to now?
9371560	9375240	It's hard thing to think about, uh, the format of course.
9375240	9381000	And, and of course the game industry and how, how much indies have grown up and all
9381000	9381960	that kind of stuff.
9381960	9382520	That's true.
9382520	9387240	Indies self publishing has, was not a thing that was around when this show started.
9387240	9390680	Well, PC was one thing, but you didn't even have as critical as I've been esteem.
9390680	9393400	That wasn't even around, you know, all those years ago.
9393400	9393880	You know what I mean?
9393880	9394440	So yeah.
9394440	9395160	Yeah, it's true.
9395160	9396760	Indies have come a long, long way.
9396760	9398440	It's a good, uh, good, good headline.
9398440	9401160	Anyway, any final thoughts or any final things you want to get out here, Bradley?
9401800	9402520	Not really.
9402520	9402840	All right.
9402840	9403400	Fair enough.
9403400	9406040	I would, I would, thank you.
9406040	9406760	Thank you for being here.
9406760	9408120	Thank you for sharing in the fun.
9408120	9410120	Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9410120	9411560	Um, Loki, I'll start with you.
9412280	9416920	Um, my final thought is that, I don't know.
9416920	9420280	I wish I have energy to work on my game this week.
9420280	9425000	Cause I sure as hell haven't had time or energy to do it cause I'm working out.
9425000	9427080	Well, I have incorporated weight training now.
9427080	9431240	So now my workouts go from 30 minutes of just, Oh, you lift weights, bro.
9431240	9432920	So now I have to do that.
9433480	9433800	Yeah.
9433800	9437640	I lift weights, weights that are very light.
9437640	9438680	Bro, you even lift.
9439720	9442200	Apparently my ass is weaker than I thought.
9442200	9447720	Like I'm like, I used to live more weight in high school and that was like nothing.
9447720	9447880	Wait.
9447880	9449240	So you start deadlifting.
9449240	9452440	You should see one of the challenges I had to do for that survivor game.
9452440	9454840	I was playing on Facebook that I didn't get very far in.
9454840	9456360	I talked about this on a previous episode.
9456360	9460120	But I had to do a thing with five pound weights where like, for like 20 minutes,
9460120	9463880	I had to have like one hand on the ground and the five pound weight up in the air.
9463880	9464440	Oh my God.
9464440	9466120	I don't know how my old ass did it.
9466120	9466520	Huh?
9466520	9467160	Five pounds?
9467160	9467720	Yeah.
9467720	9469400	It's harder than you think.
9469400	9469560	Yeah.
9469560	9472520	I used to do that with, um, kettlebells for 20 minutes.
9472520	9477640	Well, not with, with for 20 minutes, but we'd have to do, um, a 15 kilogram kettlebell.
9478520	9481000	Um, a series of them for a Turkish get up.
9481000	9485000	I had to do it while this guy in Massachusetts,
9485000	9486680	who ended up being the first one to be voted out.
9486680	9489880	He, he was doing this whole thing where he had to like
9489880	9493240	move plastic cups and stack them with nothing but his mouth.
9493800	9499800	And if I dropped, if I dropped the weight at any point, he had to start over.
9499800	9504440	Oh, so it was one of those like, you have to rely on other people not to fuck up.
9504440	9505480	It was interesting.
9505480	9507960	But anyway, well, look, you were saying.
9508920	9511640	Oh, I was just saying it takes a long time to do all that crap.
9511640	9512920	Yes, it does.
9512920	9515320	Especially if you're watching your form, which you should always be watching your form.
9515320	9516520	I'm trying to watch my form.
9516520	9519640	I need to watch my, like, I was even doing like, I started like,
9519640	9520440	I even mixed it up.
9520440	9523080	I was going to do a different type of like ab workout and thing.
9523080	9524840	And they have me do like, it's like a rush.
9524840	9528200	I think they call them like Russian turns or Russian curls or something like that.
9528200	9529720	And like, and I tried doing it.
9529720	9533800	You're supposed to like sit on your ass, like sitting down, feet are up in the air a little
9533800	9536520	bit, and then you have to turn your torso left and right.
9536520	9537640	Holding your hands together.
9537640	9537800	Yeah.
9537800	9539400	My body doesn't want to fucking do that.
9539400	9541960	It's just like, it's like, no, you can't turn.
9542040	9543640	Stretch a lot and just ease into it.
9544360	9547480	But you should always warm up before you stretch.
9547480	9550040	Just saying, because then you will, you will pull something.
9551480	9551800	All right.
9551800	9555560	Uh, my final thought is this is the last OLR of my thirties.
9555560	9557800	By the next time you hear me, I'm going to be in my forties.
9557800	9561320	And, um, you know what I look for, I, I, I really can't believe.
9562040	9566040	I'm going to be 40 years old and still doing this show, but I don't mean that in a negative
9566040	9566360	way.
9566360	9569880	Like it's, it's one of those, like, no, I know, I know I'm talking to me personally.
9570680	9574440	But I'm like, you've already lived it.
9574440	9577880	Well then maybe, maybe did you have this thought that like, I'm 40 years old and I'm still
9577880	9578760	doing all our no.
9579400	9580840	Oh, well then I guess it's just me.
9581400	9583480	So it's, you're not going to be a year older.
9583480	9585080	You're going to be a week and a half older.
9585080	9585640	I know.
9585640	9585960	I know.
9585960	9586840	It's not a big deal.
9586840	9588440	It's just a, it's just a fucking number.
9588440	9590120	I'm still the same Rob Roberts.
9590120	9593800	I'm still the gore hating Rob Roberts that I would not Chris Gore though.
9593800	9598440	Cause he's cool, but I'm not the blood and gore hating Rob Roberts.
9598440	9600600	Uh, this has nothing to do with my age.
9600600	9601080	All right.
9601080	9602440	Anyway, that's it for my final thought.
9602440	9604440	I just want to thank everybody again for the love.
9604440	9607720	Uh, last but not least ladies last dark soccer, your final thought.
9607720	9613640	Um, I am six pounds away away from having lost a hundred pounds since last October.
9613640	9614280	Congratulations.
9614280	9614920	Congratulations.
9614920	9615160	Yeah.
9615160	9620840	And since I haven't told anybody publicly what I did and people have asked and I'm just
9620840	9622280	going to go ahead and be upfront with it.
9622280	9625960	You had, I'm sure I had gastric bypass in December.
9626600	9632040	And I've had some, uh, highs and lows, but before my decision to have, it was the fact
9632040	9637560	that I could not walk due to pain in my feet and I had to stop, um, going to the gym, lifting
9637560	9642840	weights like I was in the past because of, um, a very debilitating problem with my spine.
9642840	9645240	I had no other way to do this.
9645240	9648840	And so I just want to tell everybody out there, don't think it's a cop out.
9648840	9652920	Don't think that it's a easy fix because it fucking is not.
9652920	9655000	I still suffer.
9655000	9659160	Like I had to go, you know, I was sick during the break.
9659160	9659880	I'll leave it that way.
9660760	9664280	But for any, your body's still learning what my body's doing.
9664280	9664760	Yeah.
9664760	9668920	But if you know anyone who has ever been through it, do not give them shit for it.
9668920	9671000	Be proud of them for taking that step.
9671000	9673160	It is not an easy fix at all.
9673160	9675000	It doesn't work for everybody.
9675000	9680280	It's killed some people before I was to be, you know, I've, because I've said this to
9680280	9683160	you before, I was honestly surprised when you told me you were getting it.
9683160	9686280	Cause obviously I knew I was surprised when you told me you were getting it because I
9686280	9688040	was like Jamie.
9688040	9691640	I mean, I know people that have gas that are large individuals.
9691640	9697400	And I wasn't, you know, but you weren't, I never kind of put you in that large lady
9697400	9697880	bucket.
9697880	9698440	You know what I mean?
9698440	9699640	So I was really surprised.
9699640	9700120	Thank you.
9700120	9703000	But I was never, I was kind of surprised when you told me, but then when you told me all
9703000	9708280	this other stuff that was happening, it was like, Oh, because I had, cause I'm so I'm
9708280	9709240	only five three.
9709240	9711400	And by the way, I love large ladies too.
9711400	9713960	There is nothing wrong with big butts and you cannot lie.
9713960	9714520	That's right.
9714520	9716200	Cause round bottom girls move the world.
9716200	9722200	Love yourself large, small, because sometimes our society makes people that are too small
9722200	9723640	feel like crappy too.
9723640	9724520	And that's shitty too.
9724520	9728040	So you love yourself no matter what body you got.
9728040	9731480	I had no problem with myself visually.
9731480	9736360	You know, I, I believe in body positivity, but I do believe that there comes a point
9736360	9738520	where if you are in so much pain,
9738520	9739800	but if your feet and your back are,
9739800	9743800	well, I was in that cast for a month and you remember when we would go walking before I'd
9743800	9744760	lag way behind.
9744760	9745400	Yeah.
9745400	9747480	I was a few steps ahead of you today.
9747480	9748040	I walked around.
9748040	9749080	Okay, well let's not get carried away.
9749080	9749720	You know what I mean?
9749720	9753800	But I was, I was at drag con for three days on my feet and then to Disneyland the next
9753800	9755640	day and then went to see where it all the day after that.
9756280	9760840	And I'm just saying, I believe in positivity and health at any size, at any shape.
9761400	9767400	But when you come to the point where the size is becoming a medical factor, where it affects
9767400	9770040	your quality of life, you have to make a brave decision.
9770040	9772200	I'm not saying that I'm the bravest person in the world because I'm certainly not the
9772200	9773480	only person that's done it.
9773480	9777320	Sometimes you have to take a decision for the sake of your health because I don't think
9777320	9781400	I would have been able to do OLR in another two years.
9783000	9784600	And so I was thinking about it today.
9784600	9785960	I hurt to drive.
9786680	9787560	I hurt to do anything.
9787560	9789000	I hurt to sit at my desk too long.
9789000	9794200	My, my lungs hurt and now I am healthier than I've ever been.
9794760	9796120	I can get around and do things.
9796120	9802200	I have a lot more energy for stuff and I really had a lot of the listeners were really
9802200	9803800	supportive of me, the people that I told.
9803800	9807320	So I want to thank all of you for, you've given a lot of hints to that.
9807320	9809080	I bet a lot of sleuths might have figured it out.
9809080	9813240	I know I haven't like fully hidden it, but I'm not, I don't like to share everything
9813240	9814040	that's gone on in my life.
9814040	9816280	It's your fucking business, but it ain't video games.
9816280	9820280	Some people have asked, I will be upfront and also I've been able to play DDR again.
9821240	9824120	And that's what it's really all about here on the 16 years of OLR.
9824120	9824440	Yeah.
9825000	9826760	Lots of love in chat room, by the way.
9826760	9828040	So happy for dark soccer.
9828040	9829880	Really happy for you, Jamie, less than three.
9830920	9831640	So there you go.
9831640	9836120	I went from, now I only buy old Navy jeans, not to give them that, but they're comfy.
9836120	9837640	I went from a size 18 to a 10.
9838200	9841000	So if that gives anyone any indication I've lost.
9841800	9845080	I don't ever notice when people lose weight and that type of thing.
9845080	9845800	Like I just don't.
9845800	9849960	But like I do notice a different Jamie than I used to see.
9849960	9850520	Yeah.
9850520	9853480	The first place to be fair, you put it on your own Instagram.
9853480	9854600	Like here's me before.
9854600	9855160	Here's me now.
9855160	9855400	Yeah.
9855400	9859640	I was, I was being, you know, but it's people, I guess some people hadn't put it together.
9859640	9863400	And I've told, you know, a few people I'm closest to, but I just want to say for anyone
9863400	9867960	out there who is suffering with anything and they think that, and I'm not saying gastric bypass.
9867960	9872600	I'm saying that if you talk to your doctor, talk to your doctor, what's right for you.
9872600	9873080	Cause you know what?
9873080	9876760	I know people that are large and in charge and they go to the doctor and it's like,
9876760	9878360	the doctor's like, you're fine.
9878360	9879080	But it's fine.
9879080	9879640	Everything's fine.
9879640	9881960	You're just, you, you were just born large.
9881960	9883480	Your genes, that's what your genes do.
9883480	9884520	That's what my genes did.
9884520	9885320	Rock it.
9885320	9889960	But I'm saying, you know, if you feel that you're, you're having pressure in your lungs,
9889960	9895000	go to a pulmonary doctor.
9895880	9901160	Get, if you are afraid, if you have a pain that you don't recognize, fucking get it seen.
9901800	9907160	Cause I, I would have been looking at being unable to walk without a cane in two years.
9907960	9910920	And not to completely derail, but I think you would support this too.
9910920	9914840	Sometimes that pain, if it's not a visible pain and I'm talking about mental health,
9914840	9915400	see a doctor.
9915400	9915960	Get it seen.
9915960	9916920	Yeah, absolutely.
9917480	9922760	You know, if it's something that does not feel like it did, you know, even if it's just
9922760	9927240	getting older, you should still go get yourself seen if you have insurance for it.
9927240	9929640	If not, there are some free services out there that can help you.
9930600	9932840	Medicaid in your state, maybe something you can look into.
9932840	9933240	Yeah.
9933240	9935320	Or if you're in Canada, then bless you.
9936520	9939640	But, um, but I'm saying don't ignore any of the signs.
9939640	9942440	And if you have a chance to do something about it, fucking do it.
9943400	9947320	Don't wait, don't wait, you know, too much longer because you never know
9947320	9948760	how much worse it's going to get.
9948760	9951400	So well, a heavy but good note to end on.
9951400	9953160	And I wanted just to make sure to leave that with people.
9953160	9957880	Cause I love all of our listeners, even the assholes, cause I'm a bit of an asshole,
9958600	9961240	but you guys mean a lot to me.
9961240	9966200	And I just wanted to share that with you that if you, if it's a pain in your heart,
9966200	9968600	physically or otherwise, if it's a pain in your back,
9968680	9972200	if it's something that twinge is funny, don't hesitate.
9972200	9974440	And if they tell you, no, you're okay.
9974440	9975960	And it's still fucking hurting.
9975960	9980120	Get a second opinion, make them give you a referral.
9980120	9983320	Or at least like I have this, I'm not to, I, we really need to wrap up,
9983320	9985960	but like I have this bump thing on the back of my neck and I was like,
9985960	9987320	Oh my God, is this like a tumor?
9987320	9988120	What is this?
9988120	9990520	So I went to the doctor cause I was like, it doesn't hurt.
9990520	9991400	It was like a cyst.
9991400	9992040	What is it?
9992040	9995880	No, she, she did the whole thing and she's like, I think it's just a fat pocket.
9995880	9997000	And I was like, Oh,
9997000	9998760	well, no, this formed a lipoma.
9998760	9999080	Yeah.
9999080	9999240	Yeah.
10000360	10001720	I got a fat neck.
10001720	10002520	That's what it is.
10003080	10003480	All good.
10003480	10005240	But at least I know, at least I know.
10005240	10008120	In a nutshell, I want all of you to take good care of yourselves and each other.
10008120	10010280	And that's really the most important thing to me.
10010280	10012760	You know, sometimes it's scary.
10012760	10014840	Sometimes it requires a major lifestyle change,
10014840	10017160	but be willing to do what's best for yourself.
10017160	10017640	I love that.
10017640	10019320	We'll, we'll end it on a Jerry Springer note.
10019320	10022520	Since I hear his show is ending, take care of yourselves and each other.
10022520	10025240	And don't go punching people unless they're Nazis.
10025240	10025960	Punch Nazis.
10026600	10028600	Have a great two weeks, everybody.
10028600	10032520	We will see you back here in two weeks with an all new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
