Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week at the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 718 for this, February the 11th of 2018.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and sadly not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but she will be joining us by phone a little later in the show. Here in studio we have, as he usually is, Techmaster Loki.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hi Loki, how are you?

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm fine.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good to see you, good for you to be here.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's new with you? How's life?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nothing really new.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How's the DDR machine?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's still DDR-ing.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, are you actually still using it?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, for at least 30 minutes a day.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nice. Is it like, is it like weight? You didn't notice an effect on that? Like getting that extra exercise?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, I'm still working on the diet part of that. But I've been pretty good about like eating, what's that for?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well I was going to say, bringing 12 breadsticks to OLR.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I did not eat all 12 breadsticks. I didn't have like six of them.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You did very good. I was supposed to start a diet today and I still ate a breadstick.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And to be fair, I mean, yeah it's not the best way to do a diet, but like I'm still well within my calories even though I ate those six breadsticks.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because I really didn't eat it. I had like, this is like a small thing of cereal in the morning. Like very small.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And then like nothing the rest of the day. Which is not the way you're supposed to do it.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No, you don't want to starve yourself. That's not the way to do it.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But weekends for me like throw off my rhythm anyway. Like if I have to diet, I have to fix my weekday routine.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Like I have to eat a better breakfast. I have to not buy candy bars from the vending machine at work.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I have to, you know, not eat out all the time at lunch. Or if I do eat out, you know, make better choices.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's where I can really make changes. The weekend is always weird, you know.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And I, often times I find that I'm traveling a lot on the weekend and that screws up stuff too, you know.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, so I mean I've been good for the most part. I've been pretty good. So we'll see how it works out.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright. Well I want to introduce our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So if you are joining us in chat, a big hello to you guys.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Which I think we have some faces who I haven't seen in a while. We have some new faces as well.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So we've got a whole lot of kind of a different mixture of folks tonight.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I see the Rob D, who I haven't seen in a long, long time, is listening to the show again tonight.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How are you doing? Hope you're doing good, Rob. We missed this day in gaming. Or was that the name of the show?

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know, but he had a great radio voice on that show.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And then PJ Reno, who I think is newer to the show, is listening saying,

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to play Civ 6 while I listen. Civilization 6 got a new expansion just this past week.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I need to check it out still. I've barely scratched the surface on Civ 6.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I mean, I played a couple games right when it first came out.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And of course I love the new Christopher Ten song that's in the introduction, because those songs set the mood.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Right? Baba Yetu for Civ 4 set the mood.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He didn't do the song for Civ 5, but the music in Civ 5 wasn't bad. It just wasn't the same.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It kind of sets the mood of, those songs really say to me, like Baba Yetu, or the meaning of flight,

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
or whatever it translates to, the dream of flight. It's translated in Italian.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Those songs really say to me, like, prepare to lose your entire evening to this bullshit.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It really sets that mood of, you know, kiss your evening goodbye.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're going to be up until 3am tonight because you don't know when to quit.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's what those very epic Grammy-winning and nominated songs say to me.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are there a lot of Civilization streamers?

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh sure, over on Twitch. I've seen a few.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, I mean, it's an intensely strategical game, so there's some people that will, you know, yeah.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And especially for the people that really like to find that mix between IRL streaming and Civ 6,

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you don't have to think a lot while you're playing Civ 6, but it's not action-oriented.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you sit there and take a long time taking your turn, you're not really going to get penalized for that.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So people that like to interact with their audience a little more probably actually favor a game like Civilization,

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
where you're not, you know, when I'm playing something like Overwatch, I'm going to have to focus on the match the whole time,

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
because you don't really get a chance to stop and catch your breath. You know what I mean?

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So I think that's why Civ does pretty well over there.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's not, I mean, it's not in the top 25 games, but there's an audience for it. There sure is.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's see, over in our chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm looking at some other comments.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, Rob D. corrects me on the name. This Day in Gaming. I apologize.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It was a long, long, long time ago. TDig.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's see, also in chat, PJ Reno saying, my hubby's playing Monster Hunting World.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He rented it from a red box.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I wanted to play Monster Hunter World, but I don't, I watched, we did the SharePlay thing.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I did the SharePlay thing with Shane, because he has it and he's really into it right now.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And I wasn't, I wasn't feeling it. Like I remember playing the demo on the Wii U, and I thought it was awful.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Like I just wasn't into it. And then I was kind of watching Shane play it.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And I was like, I don't know, these battles don't look like my kind of thing.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Like I kind of see the Phantasy Star Online element of it that looks really fun.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You know, you know, I love me some Phantasy Star Online, Phantasy Star Universe,

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
but I didn't like the whole, like, you know, you're, you're whacking on the monster over and over and over again.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And then it kind of runs off. And I don't know, maybe, maybe if I explored more of the classes,

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you could play in it and found something I like, I'd probably be into it more.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I like the Final Fantasy ripoff Monster Hunter game they did on 3DS, Final Fantasy Explorers, I think it was called.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I like that one, but I could be like a black mage and stuff.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And, you know, I didn't necessarily have to like actually like chase monsters in melee range or any of that.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So, but I know Monster Hunter World has its fans, so I'm not, I'm not dogging your game.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's just, you know, not everything's for everyone. I couldn't really get into it at first.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't want to drop 60 bucks on a game that I don't feel really, really good about.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If that makes sense.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's see, also looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, see the bestest man in chat says,

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
civilization is the closest I get to referring to a game as crack.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yep, pretty much. Those games are, you know, there's a reason why the just one turn quote,

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
one more turn quote is pretty infamous out there because it's very easy to think,

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
oh, the next turn is when I'm going to get some big science discovery that's going to change the game

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
or, oh, one more turn until I invade that capital city and it's just, you know, one more

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and then suddenly it's 4 a.m. and we're, look at your life, look at your choices.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
All right, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about another video game franchise.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I know we are really into, so a lot of news coming out this weekend about Loki.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Kingdom Hearts 3. So the epic guest, I didn't know that they had an expo in Japan for D23.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I didn't either.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So apparently that's a thing.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It makes sense though. I mean, Disney's huge in Japan. The D23 expo does very well here in the States.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So it makes sense that Japan gets their own version of it.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, so they had, you know, a new trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 and they even still says it's 2018.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So I'm hoping that that stays true. But the big thing that they showed off, of course, was one new world

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and it's Monsters, Inc. world. So they have, you know, Sora, Donald, and what the fuck, Goofy.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Goofy looks fucking nuts.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, they're all monsters basically, but cute Pixar-ified monsters.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right, exactly. So it's cute. Like the trailer, they have, one of the gameplay trailers I saw was, you know,

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Boo calling Donald Mike Wazowski because healing has one eye in that world as well.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was like, no, but I'm Mike Wazowski.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So it looks like Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be a lot of Pixar-influenced stuff, right?

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Because we have, what, Big Hero 6, we have Toy Story, we have Monsters, Inc.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There's a lot of the Pixar-

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think Hero 6 is in Pixar though.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, I thought it was.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No, that was just Disney animation. And same with Tangle, that's also Disney animation.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's just now all the Disney animation is not social.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's right. Princess and the Frog was their last traditionally animated movie, right?

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, that's exactly the best way to go out, but yeah, that was.

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I like that movie, come on. Tiana's one of my faves. I like Tiana because she wasn't just born into the princess-dom.

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
She worked her way there.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, I give it that. It's just the story's kinda meh. I don't know.

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It was alright. But yeah, I mean, it looks good. See, the problem is, like, for me, like, I never really played a lot of the Kingdom Hearts games.

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I played a little bit of one, and, like, I'm so lost in what the story is right now.

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, yeah, it blows me away that the story is intended for, I guess, children. I'm using my quotey fingers.

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
God, God, my children would never be able to follow this.

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, right? I was like, maybe it's not really for kids. I guess maybe it would. But even adults have a hard time understanding it.

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So, sometimes it's just not about the plot, but it's about, ooh, it's pretty, and ooh, I'm in Tron World, yay!

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You know, it's just kinda the little throwbacks to your youth. Although, I mean, I would go for some real deep cuts.

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Like, I wanna see, like, Muppet Baby's world, where we have to dodge Nanny.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm still waiting since now.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then Skeeter just disappears halfway through.

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now with, you know, everything, we're gonna have Star Wars World and Avengers World. I mean, that's gonna be pretty amazing at some point.

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hmm.

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And you were talking before the show, maybe Bad Movie World would be a lot of fun.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes, I would love to see a whole new game. It's not necessarily Kingdom Hearts, but it's just like going through terrible movies.

136
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So instead of, you know, having the classics like, you know, I don't know, Cinderella and stuff, it's just like The Room or Manos Hands of Fate.

137
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Showgirls.

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Showgirls.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes. Keeping an E for everyone rated game. That would be a really good time.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, like Goofy's like, why am I wearing fishnets and heels?

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Plan 9.

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Eraserhead, I don't know.

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That'd be fun. I don't know if that would be a Kingdom Hearts game, but maybe that's another game somebody could make someday.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Somebody did make a game based on The Room, actually. There was, like, some Newgrounds, one of those types of games.

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Was there like a point and click adventure game?

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, one of those types of things. But it had like the Super Nintendo looking graphics and stuff.

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So there was a game based on The Room, but it wasn't Kingdom Hearts style. It was more 90s PC game, I suppose.

151
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Ah.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So something else I guess we learned about Kingdom Hearts was that there is a new Utada Hikaru song.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, we knew she was gonna do one, but now we got more details on it, right?

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, they actually have clips of both the English and the Japanese versions of the song.

155
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, I'm sure many of you ran out to find those clips as soon as it was announced they were out there.

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But just in case you haven't heard yet, here's the song in Japanese, which is called Chikai, which is like oath or vow.

157
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I like the scene that they're showing in the trailer here, which I don't know the character's name because, like I said, I don't play a lot of these Kingdom Hearts games.

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But he's there with Mickey and he's talking about how he's gonna leave his keyblade behind and Mickey's just like, huh? What? I'm not paying attention, what?

159
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's all the dialogue that Mickey has, like, huh?

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
King Mickey.

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Huh? Yeah.

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's like, are you fucking paying attention? You're standing right here. Are you not listening to anything that I'm saying?

163
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Here's the English version.

164
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't wanna know, baby. I don't wanna know everything. It's just fine.

165
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So it sounds a lot like, you know, her other works. It doesn't have that same kind of intensity of something like Simple and Clean, at least the Planet B remix or whatever that was that they used in the opening of the game.

166
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

167
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I feel like the original Simple and Clean was a little bit more of a ballad and then, you know, so her songs have been ballad-y for those games.

168
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So it'll be interesting to see, though, maybe if that song gets remixed and maybe they use that for an intense intro or whatever they choose to do.

169
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But Utada's sounding great.

170
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, they have all those collections now on PlayStation 4, so I guess I gotta get those.

171
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, if you wanna catch up, there's like an Uber, Ultimate, all the things collection on PlayStation 4.

172
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What I like that they do is that they take some of the side games and they just made them movies, basically.

173
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They just did a bunch of the cutscenes, they made them movies.

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I think it would be worth it before Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out to do like a movie that just catches you up on the freaking story.

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't know, maybe it'd have to be a mini-series or something, or an entire Netflix binge season of 22 episodes or something.

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Last time on Kingdom Hearts!

177
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, I mean, honestly, there's enough story there, they could do it.

178
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But obviously that would take a lot of work. It's not just as easy as recording all the cutscenes and putting it on television.

179
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If you want that, go to YouTube.

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm so surprised, though, that something that they would dedicate a lot of time to at a D23 event still doesn't have a big presence in Disneyland somewhere.

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You know, it's just kind of... I don't know.

182
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, it is surprising. Well, I think it's because at the end of the day it's still Square Enix's thing, even though it has the Disney characters in it.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But in Japan, I know it's a little more mainstream, but it's not like you have a Sora Blacklight ride or anything like that.

184
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But I think you see some of the stuff for sale in the shops and things like that.

185
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think I said it to this day, the one thing I absolutely regret was the one time I ever saw something Kingdom Hearts-related at Disneyland, I didn't buy it.

186
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And that was that store at California Adventure, the Off the Page, that has more of the art-based things.

187
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You can actually buy art that's on the wall, and they have sculptures, and they had a Sora sculpture.

188
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And so at the time it was a little bit out of my price range, but looking back I'm like,

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I should have tried to make it work, because I've never seen anything Kingdom Hearts in the parks again since then.

190
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, that's too bad.

191
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Except kids dressing up as Sora. I did see that.

192
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So I'm totally gonna dig when people are gonna be cosplaying, you know, Monsters Inc. Sora, so that'll be interesting.

193
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com with some of the comments, Fantaz in chat says,

194
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'd be down for a Kingdom Hearts movie. In Act F degrees, I'd be down for that.

195
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
TheRobD says, Kingdom Hearts' big flaw is that it tried to make its own continuity.

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The villains of Kingdom Hearts should be Disney villains.

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They kind of are, but I get that it's more complicated than that. There's a lot going on.

198
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Because the Organization XIII is not a thing in the Disney universe.

199
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But when you're first playing the game, it sure feels like Maleficent and Hades and all that.

200
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But yeah, it did try to establish its own continuity and its own characters,

201
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
but that was probably a little bit for Square Enix's benefit too.

202
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So, and Bobby Blackwell says, I think they reference it more in Tokyo Disneyland.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And also bringing up this was done at D3, or D23 Japan. So Disney did acknowledge it over there.

204
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And to be fair, I seem to recall last year was when we got the announcement Toy Story would be in the game,

205
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
was at D23 America. So Disney hasn't completely ignored it.

206
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It just sometimes feels like Frozen gets a fuck of a lot more attention. Right?

207
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Um, yeah. Yes, Disney's grip on that movie. They need to let it go, let it go.

208
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Tiger Claw says, if they did a Kingdom Hearts movie, you know it won't be exactly like the game.

209
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They would probably change things around to make it work for the average audience.

210
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm strangely okay with that, because I feel when it comes to the Kingdom Hearts story,

211
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I may need it dumbed down for the average audience. So, anyway.

212
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So are you going to pick up Kingdom Hearts 3 when it comes out?

213
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I mean, it looks interesting. The trailer is kind of like, it's like, yeah, this looks kind of cool.

214
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But it's just, I don't know. I'm not versed in Kingdom Hearts, unfortunately.

215
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I used to play, I played the original game when it first came out, because I was like, oh man, this is awesome.

216
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I was like, way back in 2002 now.

217
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Right, yeah, I kind of just like, ehhh, and I never really finished it. My sister is more into it than I was.

218
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But, um, yeah, I never finished the original game, so I don't know.

219
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Bobby Black Wolf and Chad also following up, I do not believe the 2018 part of the trailer.

220
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm guessing it gets delayed to March or April 2019.

221
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Right, and it's just more wishful thinking. It'd be nice.

222
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I think Square's going to need a tentpole this holiday, and if it's not this, then it's going to be the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

223
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And I would see this coming out before the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

224
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Although, the Final Fantasy 7 remake is supposed to be in episodes.

225
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But, if they push it back because it's not done, then, you know, fine, I support that.

226
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't want them putting out a half-assed product.

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm going to try really hard to never be that guy again that gets pissed off at a delay ever since what happened to Mass Effect Andromeda.

228
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, um, yeah, I mean, if they have to push it back for quality reasons, then fine, let it get pushed back.

229
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It would be nice if it was fourth quarter this year, but if it's not, you know, whatever.

230
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
There'll be plenty of other stuff to play. Whatever Nintendo's going to put out fourth quarter.

231
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh darn, I'll just have to spend more time in Red Dead Redemption 2. That would be so tragic.

232
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Which got pushed back to fourth quarter, right?

233
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, well, for now.

234
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
For now.

235
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I mean, that game looks like it's almost done.

236
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Kingdom Hearts. Kingdom Hearts is what they showed.

237
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It really has work in progress.

238
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It looks pretty complete to me.

239
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah. Well, they've been working on it, god, how long?

240
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
A very long time.

241
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They've been working on that game a very long time.

242
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So, I think we're all ready for it, but it's got to be done right.

243
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's the important thing.

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks.

245
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So, usually at the top of the show, we like to talk about a little bit of our gaming weeks.

246
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And how was your gaming week?

247
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What types of games have you been playing this week, Loki?

248
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I wish I played new things, but it's been basically the same stuff.

249
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So, a little bit of Stardew Valley.

250
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I did play a little bit more Pokemon this week.

251
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Have you romanced anyone in Stardew Valley yet?

252
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No, I haven't.

253
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But, because all the characters kind of irritate me.

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Like a lot of them do.

255
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's honestly fair.

256
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Shane's back, or he's kicked his alcohol problem, so way to go, Shane.

257
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Congrats.

258
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But, like, I forgot to mention this last week, actually.

259
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So, because I've gotten...

260
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You know me, I like to cheat in games.

261
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And so, I, of course, am playing with a trainer just to stop some of the...

262
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Because you have limited energy and stuff, and it's just a pain.

263
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I have to keep running back to the house every few minutes just because you're out of energy.

264
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm young and invincible. I have limitless energy.

265
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Exactly. So, with that, I bumped all the relationships up to max and stuff.

266
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So, the only downside to that, though, is that I get cutscenes all the fucking time.

267
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like, every time I go near a house, it's like four cutscenes.

268
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Or go into another place that's like four more cutscenes.

269
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So, finally, that's kind of died down a bit.

270
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But, one of the cutscenes I got to when I went to the beach was one of the...

271
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't remember the guy's name, but he has this long, blonde hair or something like that.

272
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Kind of looks like a Fabio type guy. He's a writer.

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Anyways, and so, he's like, hey, you want to go rowing on my boat?

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm like, uh, okay.

275
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And so, the dude tries kissing me on there. I'm like, dude, what the hell?

276
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's like fucking Dennis because of the implication.

277
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You can't say no because what are they going to do?

278
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They're going to dump you off the side of the boat.

279
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
They have to say yes because of the implication.

280
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So, it's just weird. All these characters trying to romance me. I'm like, dude, okay.

281
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Well, maybe next time you'll set the boundaries with Fabio before you do.

282
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Dude, Fabio, listen.

283
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It ain't like that.

284
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I understand you're living in your shack on the beach, writing.

285
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't fucking care.

286
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's like, whatever.

287
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But, no, it's a silly game.

288
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And actually reading up on it, there's actually a lot more to it.

289
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Once I've finished some of the stuff, there's more questing stuff in there that you can do.

290
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's alright.

291
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So, I've been playing that a bit.

292
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And then, of course, I've been doing my routine of Dance Dance Revolution every day.

293
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So, it's been slowly getting easier to do stuff.

294
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I still can't do the things I used to be able to do.

295
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Every now and then I'll try to, hey, let's play Aeon Heavy and see how well we can do that.

296
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Nope, can't do that still.

297
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Or my kids, God bless them, will decide, hey, I'm going to pick this song.

298
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And so, I'll just leave it on whatever.

299
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And they hit random.

300
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I didn't get a chance to play it.

301
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So, it's like I'm playing Orion 78, the 2MB remix or whatever, Civilization remix.

302
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm like, dude, what the hell?

303
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And they're playing on beginner.

304
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And they're like, okay, this is easy.

305
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Keeping you in the game.

306
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Esther 200, Matt in Chat says, do you still remember the step charts for most of the songs?

307
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
No, because I used to play doubles.

308
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So, now I'm playing singles.

309
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And so, I don't remember most of the step charts for the songs.

310
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Now I'm starting to recognize them more because I'm playing some of the same songs over and over.

311
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But I don't.

312
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't remember any of them.

313
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Like, Dynamite Rave, I even went and played basic on that.

314
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Just like, I don't remember this anymore.

315
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So, it's alright.

316
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah, so I've been doing that.

317
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And then, what else?

318
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I played a little bit of Lego Marvel's Super Heroes 2, just on the grind, unlocking everything to 100% the game.

319
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But that's what it feels like right now. It's just a grind.

320
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's kind of not really entertaining anymore.

321
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It wasn't really that much of an entertaining game to begin with.

322
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The earlier games are much better.

323
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And then, a little bit of Ingress.

324
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Just normally when I'm playing Pokemon Go or whatever, it's both Ingress and Pokemon Go at the same time.

325
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I've done that, yeah.

326
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So, that's what I did today. I was down at the Arcade Creek Park, which has a ton of portals there.

327
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So, I was able to do both and stock up on Pokeballs because I was getting low.

328
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That's about it.

329
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I feel like I've barely played any Ingress this week, actually.

330
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I know, I just was throwing really long links to things.

331
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Whenever I had keys available, I'm like, eh, who's gonna yell at me?

332
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If it throws, it goes.

333
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Exactly. What are you gonna do? Yell at me? I don't have the app on.

334
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I don't have notifications on. I don't care.

335
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I honestly think in your part of town, garbage links are encouraged, I think, over where you're at.

336
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So, it's all good.

337
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Anyway, let's see, my gaming week. Well, then I'll piggyback off that.

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So, even though I haven't been playing a lot of Ingress, I played a shit ton of Pokemon Go, like, yesterday.

339
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And that was because the reason why I was playing a lot of Pokemon Go is because I'm able to use my Bluetooth, you know, catching device to catch stuff.

340
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because yesterday, I had a friend from out of town who was visiting and he didn't know a lot about Sacramento because he's just recently moved here from back east.

341
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So, we were going to the Capitol, we were going to Midtown, we were going to Old Town, we were going to the Art Museum.

342
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We walked, like, everywhere. I probably walked several miles yesterday.

343
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But the nice thing about having the Bluetooth is I was catching Pokemon, like, everywhere I went.

344
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And because they're doing that Gen 3 event right now, I'm catching nothing but the Gen 3 stuff.

345
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Which, you know, like the Trapinch, there's a lot of those downtown because Capitol Park's the nest for Trapinch right now.

346
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And then, you know, just a variety of different stuff.

347
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So, that's cool because I don't know what's going to happen when it goes back to, you know, Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3.

348
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
How much these newer Gen 3 things are going to show up because there's only so many limited spawn points.

349
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I have to admit, I really like this whole, like, one Gen at a time type of thing.

350
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And I hope Niantic kind of does this stuff a little more often.

351
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And they should feel free to do it even with just Gen 1 and Gen 2, like, go back to old school.

352
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Don't do it forever, but just for a couple days.

353
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Or even just mix it up where stuff normally spawns, like, you know, hey, let's put water.

354
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I like the water Pokemon event they did because we don't really live near a lot of water.

355
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So, it was nice to be able to, you know, catch Dratini's and all sorts of things everywhere.

356
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Well, and I always thought one thing they could do, and they have a model for it from Ingress,

357
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
is because Ingress divides the world into different cells, you know.

358
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So, for example, Sacramento is in one cell. It's like a scoring cell in Ingress.

359
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And you start to move west, and somewhere between Sacramento and Davis, which a lot of people know from the university there,

360
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
there's a line that separates. So, Davis is in a different cell that it's shared with San Francisco.

361
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So, my point with all that is that, you know, it would be cool if maybe monsters,

362
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
because I'm sick of this, like, region-locked shit, as I think a lot of us are, where it's like,

363
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
now there's a new one that's only in Africa, you know, and it's like...

364
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Oh, right, let me hop on a plane.

365
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hop on a plane.

366
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You know, I understand the desire to do region exclusives.

367
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I understand that as a mobile game that needs to have years and years long longevity,

368
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
they need to make some of these things really hard to catch.

369
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But at the same time, like, why not, you know, mix it up?

370
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think the one they're doing the best is the Mongoose, Zangoose, and Seviper. Is that it?

371
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Where they were exclusive in some places for a little bit, and then they switched.

372
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then during this event right now, they have the minus one that's usually in Asia.

373
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Little Pikachus that are plus and minus. Plus hole and...

374
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah, I got the minus one.

375
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, because you weren't supposed to get that in Quiddifingers because that was exclusive to Asia,

376
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
but during this Gen 3 event, they are having minion everywhere.

377
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And I like stuff like that. Like, that makes it cool and that gives you incentive to go out, like, every day and do stuff.

378
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And they still have four more generations of Pokemon to catch up on before they're current, you know.

379
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And then even after that, then they'll be Gen 8 at some point, you know what I mean?

380
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So, I still feel like there's a lot of ways Niantic can kind of better divvy this up.

381
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But for the time being, I really like the Gen 3 exclusive event and I hope they do more stuff like that in the future.

382
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I talked a lot more about Pokemon Go than I planned to.

383
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Other stuff I've been playing is a lot of the same old samples.

384
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Probably because of Pokemon Go, I was like, I should go find my copy of Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and I'm going to play that again.

385
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So, in my rush to clear out my file in Alpha Sapphire, I was like, oh, wait.

386
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But I have, like, legendaries that I got through codes or through the download thing.

387
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I don't want to get rid of those. I don't want to delete them off my file.

388
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So, I'm going to transfer them into the Pokemon bank.

389
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So, I had to download the Pokemon bank and get that up and running.

390
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So, I did that and then I was like, oh, but the Pokemon bank, oh, that's right.

391
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
That's how you get the stuff from Pokemon Crystal or Silver, well, and Crystal, and Pokemon Yellow and stuff on virtual consoles.

392
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I was like, I want to go back and play Pokemon Yellow on virtual consoles so I can bring, like, Pikachu and shit into my new Alpha Sapphire game.

393
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And now it's, here I go again where I'm never going to have the attention span to just play one fucking Pokemon game from start to finish.

394
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I never do. I even, like, I, you know, Shane's a good friend of mine and plays a lot of Pokemon.

395
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So, I even sent him a picture of my save file in Alpha Sapphire where I have six badges.

396
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And I was like, Shane, I don't know if I should start over because I have six badges. I'm, like, this close to the end of the game.

397
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
He's like, just start over. You'll catch up.

398
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So, I guess I'm going to start over. We'll see.

399
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Let's see, I'm looking for comments over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

400
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It looks like they're talking about DDR tournaments in the chat room.

401
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I guess there was a couple of those this weekend.

402
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah, there was the international one, I think.

403
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah.

404
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Didn't they, like, debut a new song or something like that?

405
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh, probably. I'm so out of the loop on that stuff.

406
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But you know what I did like was the, what's the new name of the game? The Dance Rush.

407
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
As some, Dancing Stage Rush.

408
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Dance Rush, yeah.

409
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Remix, the third, Lupin, I don't, what, whatever that game is called.

410
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Dance Rush.

411
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Dance, well, no, it has a new name now.

412
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It has dance, no, it has dance and rush in it, but it's, like, dancing over rush.

413
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I thought that was just a specific version that was, like, because it was linked together.

414
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh, is it?

415
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I thought that's what it was. That's how I interpreted it.

416
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I don't know. Well, whatever that game is, where now it's, like, the whole floor is, you know, like, what you dance on.

417
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That game looks really cool and I want to check that out when it inevitably comes over here.

418
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes, and it'll be nice because by the time it eventually gets out over here, hopefully I'll be back in shape enough to where I can actually play it.

419
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yay!

420
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That's the spirit.

421
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:34,000
As far as other games I've been playing, I'm still playing an unhealthy amount of Final Fantasy XIV, but that game just got a patch a week ago, so there's, like, more things to do in that.

422
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I just did the primal, the new primal fight, the Jade Stoa, or what's the monster's name, Byako.

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I did that for the first time and that was cool.

424
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And then I've been playing Heroes of the Storm.

425
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I ended up getting a stim pack and one of my loot chests, which will double the amount of experience you earn, so it just makes you want to play more Heroes of the Storm, so I've been doing that.

426
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And I find that I'm really, my favorite character to play, I think, right now in that game is Lieutenant Morales, who's kind of a healer, but the other players really love you when you play Morales.

427
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And Morales is the one that has one of the skins that's totally Samus.

428
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They can't say it's Samus, they have to say it's Space Explorer or something Morales, which, she's from fucking StarCraft, of course she's a Space Explorer.

429
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But, you know, they have to do a wink and a nod that it's not really Samus, but it's an orange and yellow suit with the green vibe, like it's fucking Samus.

430
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Just not in name.

431
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Not Samus.

432
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah, not dash Samus.

433
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Alright, so yeah, that's been my gaming week. A lot more MMOs and Heroes of the Storm and a little bit of Pokemon.

434
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Some housekeeping, so follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio.

435
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And no shows that we're canceling in the near future.

436
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Next week is President's Day weekend, which is a three day weekend for me, but I don't think it is for everybody.

437
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Not for me.

438
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah, so, but we will be here on Sunday night, so I'm looking at maybe taking a quick trip, but we should be back by Sunday night in order to do the show.

439
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Maybe have some guests, if it works out the way it's supposed to. Some of my pals in the Bay Area were supposed to go on a trip with me.

440
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So we'll see, I don't know. We might have some guests next week. That would be fun.

441
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And then, what else? Oh, at the end of March, though, we will be missing a show, but I'll remind you guys about that as it gets closer, because I am going way out of town in March.

442
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So, meanwhile, let's get into what else is going on in gaming. So, some more gaming news. Loki.

443
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So, Twitch has added some new policies for sexual content and harassment on its platform to try to clean things up.

444
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Mainly because there's been quite the, quite the trend in what some people call titty streamers.

445
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Where they basically are dressed very provocatively and kind of using that to get, you know, bits and other donations.

446
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Kind of, you know, oh, I'm gonna bend over and stretch or do yoga or whatever the hell it is.

447
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You know, playing my game with my top. I mean, that's fine. You can dress like that all you want, but you know what? There are, y'all are gonna pay it and they're not.

448
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't see the quote unquote problem with that, but I get, I mean, but I get that Twitch doesn't want their reputation to be that that is what they are.

449
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
There's a difference between, it's just that it keeps getting pushed, I think, more and more. Like, who's gonna argue? Well, you can't wear that. No one's gonna make that argument.

450
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But until it keeps getting pushed further and further. So, they now have, you know, a little bit more policy, including, you know, that attire is, that you cannot wear an attire that tended to be sexually suggestive.

451
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh, darn it. That's what I was gonna wear tonight. No fishnet top for me tonight.

452
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Undergarments, intimate apparel or exposing slash focusing on male or female genitals, buttocks or nipples.

453
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Wait, I thought they banned a lot of this stuff a long time ago. I thought you weren't, like, there were a lot of dudes who streamed shirtless, and I thought you weren't supposed to do that anymore.

454
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I thought they did that a long time ago.

455
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I thought that what was happening was that these streamers that were doing this were actually being treated more kindly than, you know, by the Twitch staff than other streamers because they were getting away with more of this stuff.

456
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Because, you know, they thought they could gain favor with them or some nonsense. But whatever, that it's, it makes sense. This is like, you know, this is a platform where I don't know if they have really age gating in this stuff.

457
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So, I mean, kids are gonna be exposed to this. You know, we gotta think of everybody. Think of the children.

458
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Also, they're saying that, you know, attire in gaming streams and most at home streams and all profile slash channel imagery should be appropriate for public street, mall or restaurant.

459
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
As a reminder, we will not tolerate using this policy as a basis to harass streamers on or off Twitch.

460
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Sorry, sorry. Have you all been to Kentucky Fried Chicken? Sometimes, like, some of the things, I mean, I'll never forget. It was before going to Rocky Horror, which, yeah, it again is a whole lingerie clothing thing of its own.

461
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:21,000
My pal Victoria from Shaking Your Crying, when she lived up here, and I, we went to a KFC in South San Francisco, and we saw some choices in the outfit department there. Some real choices.

462
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And then, of course, you know, along with that, they're saying that in addition to these, they also mentioned...

463
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm sorry, I have to cut you off. Bobby Blackwell says, have you been to Walmart? Thank you. You're right. There's a whole website, thepeopleofwalmart.com. That's a mall in Walmart Mall.

464
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's not a mall. It's a shopping...

465
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, but they have subways and vision centers. It's a mall.

466
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay, sorry, I won't cut you off again.

467
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Anyways, then they were saying that, you know, we're also looking at Twitch list emotes, stream titles, camera angles, as contextual elements as well they'll be monitoring.

468
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So, you know, if you have a crotch cam, maybe not the best thing to be, you know, putting on Twitch.

469
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You know, of course, along with that, they're saying that with that, you know, the camera angles, emotes, panels, attires, overlays, chat moderation, offering access to prohibited sexual content,

470
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
such as ludes on Twitch also remains prohibited.

471
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And basically saying if someone gets reported for breaking our community guidelines based on sexual content, we will take a holistic look at the channel.

472
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So meaning that...

473
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
We're gonna bookmark all of those channels.

474
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I think that means that they have to take... they're really trying to figure out what's the intent.

475
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If your intent is to sell sex, they don't want that on Twitch.

476
00:35:44,000 --> 00:36:01,000
If your intent is to show off the game and you just happen to be a very attractive person who wears very attractive clothing and maybe incidentally had a camera shot that you didn't realize was pointed at your chest or at your crotch or something, then, you know, they're not gonna... they're not gonna question that.

477
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Don't get me wrong. Like, I watched a lot of Twitch during... I had a thing for work that we were studying esports and streaming and Twitch and stuff like that.

478
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But we watched a lot of Twitch streams and stuff and we did encounter quite a few Twitch streamers that, you know, they're women and they're using their looks to, you know, get more people interested in the channel.

479
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And that's not a terrible thing, but there are some people that take that too far and to the point where they know that's bringing people in, getting people to donate.

480
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And it's kind of like, hey, where are you across the line between this being, you know, Twitch and Chatterbait or, you know, just... you have to draw the line.

481
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I think that's what it is. I see in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Harry Chestman, who I guess is streaming and is fishing at top right now, says Twitch is for gaming.

482
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Twitch is blurring a little bit. I mean, Twitch is for cooking and competitive eating and Twitch is for IRL streams.

483
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But I get it. Like, Twitch is... I think it would be more accurate to say Twitch is not for sex. And so that's why Twitch is trying to have to draw a line here.

484
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Right. Yeah. So why? And so if your intent is to be a titty streamer or, you know, and there's dudes that do the same.

485
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You know, go to some of the, you know, like gay oriented or even straight oriented. There's enough women that watch Twitch.

486
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,000
There's some dudes out there that are selling it just the same, although it may not be, you know, they don't have titties in the same way.

487
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
They sit there shirtless or they do other stuff.

488
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
No one wants to see me sit shirtless and play a game.

489
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
No. I don't want to see me do that.

490
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Even though that may be a way, I do play games a lot, but no one's going to want to watch it.

491
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That's a private thing. When the cameras aren't on, when I'm not doing OLR podcasts or I'm not doing...

492
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm probably on the couch without pants playing a particular game, you know?

493
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And I will say this. I do remember doing one livestream where I wasn't wearing pants.

494
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I was wearing like a snuggie, a blanket over my legs, but you can't see that part.

495
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And I made sure the whole time I kept reminding myself, don't stand up to get to the restroom or anything like that.

496
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Like if you do, turn the camera off to someone like that, but you can only see...

497
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, and now Rob's on stream fails.

498
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah, right. No, I don't know that. Well, I mean, I'd be wearing something so you wouldn't see everything, but you know what I mean.

499
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You fill in the blanks. But that's actually a trick that they use in regular television too, at least.

500
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I don't think it works as well in the age of HD, but I know back in the day when I interned for a TV station,

501
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,000
like the weatherman, when he would do his report and stuff, he was wearing a nice suit top and all that stuff,

502
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
and tie and stuff, and then jeans, because you didn't see anything below the waist.

503
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So you couldn't tell that he wasn't wearing slacks or a full suit outfit or nice shoes.

504
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It was like they had a nice top and then jeans and sneakers.

505
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I can't trust that man. He doesn't have floral pants on. He doesn't know anything about weather.

506
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But I think now in this day and age, it doesn't matter.

507
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
That's kind of like the thing though. That's pretty common to wear kind of like a formal top and jeans.

508
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yeah, but on the nightly news, you're supposed to look totally formal for whatever reason.

509
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
On the nightly news, anyway, if you're on one of those talk shows, Ellen doesn't really dress up for her show.

510
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
She doesn't have to, so it just depends on what you're doing.

511
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I thought there were other Twitch guidelines about if you got reported, they were going to look at some of the things.

512
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I know this was the really controversial thing.

513
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
They were going to look at some of the things you weren't necessarily just doing on your channel.

514
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
They were going to look at what you were doing on your social media and what you were going to be doing outside of that.

515
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think the intent is that if you are bullying people on social media or you're being a real asshole outside of Twitch,

516
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
if you're an affiliate or partner, you're still kind of representing Twitch.

517
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
They said that they are not monitoring other platforms.

518
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It means when finally a report, users can provide documentation that illustrates harassment.

519
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh, we'll not be monitoring those platforms.

520
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So, yeah, if they're finally a report, they can include stuff from other platforms.

521
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I guess, I don't know.

522
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Looking in chat at live.vognetwork.com, the Rob D says,

523
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It very much sounds like they're trying to avoid specifics.

524
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I kind of agree.

525
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I really do think they're trying to keep it vague from a legal perspective.

526
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
They probably kind of have to, especially if somebody gets really mad.

527
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Somebody who does make a lot, a lot of money suddenly gets shut down by Twitch.

528
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'd imagine there's going to be a little bit of pushback there.

529
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But look at what's going on right now with that guy.

530
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't even remember his name and I don't even want to say it.

531
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Logan Paul.

532
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But the guy who went to the forest, and we all know that was terrible what he did there.

533
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But now, in the past week, YouTube has pretty much, they haven't banned him, but they kicked him off the ad network.

534
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
He fucking liked animal cruelty on a mouse or something.

535
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
He tased a dead rat.

536
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I heard he gave mouth to mouth to a fish or something like that.

537
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I cannot.

538
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
He's a douchebag. What are you going to say?

539
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I can't fucking believe after what he went through in Japan and with all that,

540
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
and he comes out this boohoo, I should have learned my lesson.

541
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I cannot believe, cannot believe after all that he thought it would be a good idea or a funny idea.

542
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
To fucking taser rat.

543
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Here's why. Because that controversy got him more followers.

544
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
He ended up in the positive on the whole thing with that.

545
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And he probably, I mean, he's making money off YouTube, but he's making, he, if you watch any of his videos,

546
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and I don't, I watch other people that talk about his videos.

547
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
They, he just pimps out merchandise.

548
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
They're selling merchandise and that's where they're making their money is off merchandise.

549
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
He just bought a seven million dollar mansion.

550
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You know, and so he's doing well off and he figured any controversy gets him more views

551
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
because the people that follow him don't give a shit.

552
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It's the people that are, you know, in an outrage aren't watching him in the first place.

553
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't want to hear stop stupid people from being famous ever again at the Kardashians

554
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
when there's guys like this in the world.

555
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The Kardashians are nothing.

556
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
At least the Kardashians know how to make a movie.

557
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's like you look, you look at, but you look at like what the Kardashians do

558
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and it's not as irritating as fucking Logan Paul.

559
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's just in their whole family is like that.

560
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Like their dad came out defending Logan Paul and he's a douchebag as well.

561
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Like he was in one of their videos.

562
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
He was making out with some like teenage girl or something like that is super, super cringy.

563
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's terrible, but like it, the whole family is like that.

564
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And it just, the sooner they like get wiped off of, you know, the internet, the better.

565
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Bobby, Bobby just reminds me of an important fact here.

566
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yet YouTube kicked us off their network.

567
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Well, you know, to be fair, Bobby, we were, we're producing a ton of videos for, you know, VOG,

568
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
but I totally get the point.

569
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Like it does feel like kind of like a whole, like how the fuck are guys like that successful

570
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and other hard, so many other hard working people are.

571
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So like, okay, so the Logan Paul thing, he was basically taking a break from YouTube for a while

572
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
because they let the heat die down or whatever.

573
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So by accident, YouTube somehow sends out notifications to people

574
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that aren't even subscribed to his channel or following him

575
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that, hey, Logan Paul's back, go check out his videos.

576
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And then people are like, what the fuck is this shit?

577
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And they're all, Oh yeah, sorry. It was a setting.

578
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It was a glitch setting thing.

579
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Why is YouTube playing into that hype?

580
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I don't know because it makes them money, I guess.

581
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
They're making money off of it because of the views and ads.

582
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I, you know, I am getting to this point where I'm more and more like,

583
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
fuck YouTube with a capital F and a capital Y.

584
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I just want to like strip all my videos off their site.

585
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I was looking at trying to put shaking and crying up on YouTube

586
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
so that more people could find it to download it.

587
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And I'm at, give me this point where I'm like, no,

588
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I mean, I'm just going to tell those other people they need to find a better other way

589
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
and stop supporting YouTube because YouTube is so much garbage all over the place.

590
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So much. And it's not even just like this Logan Paul,

591
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
but clearly when they send out emails like this, it's like, Logan Paul's back.

592
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Like, you know, that just shows they're working with him and they want.

593
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's just, it is, seriously.

594
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And the hard part about this is you have this douchebag

595
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
that's causing all these site-wide changes because of the shit he's doing

596
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and it's affecting other YouTubers that are doing this stuff.

597
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
There'll be guys, there was a guy that did an experiment just for sillies.

598
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
He took, he took his pee, I guess, and he let it like dry out

599
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and got the nitrates from it and made black powder from it,

600
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
which it took like, I think like 18 months or something to do that.

601
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And he put the video on the, oh, because he's making explosives,

602
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
you know, that's a strike against him or something.

603
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It was just like a science thing.

604
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's not like anyone would actually use that to create a bomb.

605
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm going to store all my pee from like several years

606
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and make bombs out of that.

607
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's just, it's silly.

608
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Uh, yeah, we need a decent competitor to YouTube, we really do.

609
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And the Rob D points out a good point,

610
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
is that Twitch isn't trying to do the same thing

611
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and Dailymotion and Vimeo don't cut it.

612
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Twitch is inching closer and closer to that direction though,

613
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
because they are trying to do more like with the videos on demand,

614
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
but they have to just have a premiere live on your channel or something,

615
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
you know, but I mean, as a primarily gaming content creator,

616
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I wouldn't have a hard time moving all my stuff over to Twitch.

617
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Um, but I would wonder how is Twitch going to police all this stuff?

618
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I mean, it sounds like it's,

619
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
it's requiring more of their moderation team and their moderation.

620
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
They're going to do the a word algorithms.

621
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I sure as fuck hope not.

622
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I really, cause that's where it's all going to break down.

623
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That's where it's all going to break down.

624
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Um, let's see, act deft and chat brings up some good points.

625
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I use YouTube for my podcast.

626
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I depend on YouTube to make it work.

627
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Uh, but people being turned off on YouTube,

628
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
like Rob is going to hurt our podcasts in the long run.

629
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Good thing we're now on iTunes and all, but still,

630
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and I would agree with that.

631
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
That's why you want to kind of put your show as many places as possible.

632
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And that's why I was looking to put Shaking and Crying,

633
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
the new show over on YouTube, because I was like,

634
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
okay, well maybe there is an audience there.

635
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You know, they can, uh, even though we don't really do video,

636
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
at least they could have the audio with maybe like a waveform

637
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
in the background or something.

638
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But the more YouTube does this shit,

639
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the more I'm like, well, maybe not, maybe not.

640
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We did, I, that is a Shaking and Crying is the first show though

641
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
that I've had that's on iHeartRadio.

642
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So that is, you know, I was like,

643
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
where are all the podcast apps we're going to,

644
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
so we're on iHeartRadio with that.

645
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So I might put this show on there too.

646
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I'm trying to, I want to see how it works.

647
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So Shaking and Crying first before I go that length.

648
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
We'll see. Yeah. So, because you know, they,

649
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
they are tied to corporate radio, which is interesting,

650
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
but that can be, that can be for better for worse.

651
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Uh, let's see. Let's move on, I guess.

652
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
We'll move on to some more news.

653
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Uh, let's talk about, let's talk about Space Channel 5.

654
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
This is a series that's been dormant for a while

655
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
that I love this series.

656
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And it sounds like it may be coming back in a way in VR.

657
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Uh, it was recently announced at the Niko Niko Tokagi Festival.

658
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Uh, uh, this past week that Space Channel 5 VR,

659
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Arakata Dancing Show is, uh, going to be demoed there

660
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and that the game will be seeing a release in spring of 2018 for the HTC Vive.

661
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Now a little while ago, we had talked about a Space Channel 5 thing in VR.

662
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That was called Uki Uki Viewing Show.

663
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And that's where you threw confetti and helped Ulala to improve the viewership counts.

664
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But this new game will be, you're going to dance and do the same poses.

665
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I suppose it's a little more similar to what you were doing on the Dreamcast

666
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
where you were doing it in, you know, up, left, two.

667
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And you probably have to do, like, you know, that type of thing with actual motion

668
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
since it's going to be in VR.

669
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
So I'm here for that because I love Space Channel 5.

670
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So I'm just excited they're doing a new game in the series.

671
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm a little surprised it's only Vive and they're not talking PlayStation 4,

672
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
you know, which is usually where I see a lot of gamey stuff,

673
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
you know, that I remember from consoles and up.

674
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But, okay, I mean.

675
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Maybe it's just the motion control stuff.

676
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah, it could be. It could be.

677
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Because you're not required to have a move stuff on, I don't know.

678
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
A lot of people do, though.

679
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah, it's free.

680
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Can you have a game?

681
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You kind of have to have to.

682
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Okay, you can have a game that requires the move stuff, right?

683
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, there's a lot of them.

684
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah.

685
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
What was that?

686
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Was there a noise in the background or was it just me?

687
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I think it was just you.

688
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Maybe it was his website. I don't know.

689
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
All right.

690
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Anyway, maybe Mr. Smoosh knocked something over. I don't know.

691
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
All right. Well, anyway.

692
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So Space Channel 5, in VR, I would be very excited to play that.

693
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I still need to get something that does VR already,

694
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
besides just the little cell phone VR.

695
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Maybe over the summer.

696
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Maybe with a tax refund. Who knows?

697
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
They have some pretty good PlayStation VR bundles.

698
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Okay, thank you. Yeah, the chatters heard that noise, too.

699
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm sorry, guys. I don't know what that was.

700
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I think the website I was on might have one of those autoplay videos or something,

701
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
so sorry about that.

702
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
All right. Well, moving on.

703
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
All right.

704
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So Google is looking to possibly get into the video game streaming business.

705
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So they've got a company that they are working on a service called, what is it, Yeti,

706
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
which allow people to stream games to them online,

707
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and I guess it allows you to avoid having a console or high-end computer or something like that.

708
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So kind of like all those other streaming services that they had out there for a while,

709
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
like PlayStation Now and stuff.

710
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
They have Phil Harrison hired on now.

711
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You may remember him from such companies as Microsoft and Sony.

712
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And now they're working on possibly this service.

713
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
They haven't really said what the pricing is going to be or what the details are on this yet.

714
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Still kind of early, but it is something that's being worked on.

715
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So I guess we'll have to see what happens with this.

716
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Maybe cool, though, like if they're saying that like you could work with like Chromecast or something like that.

717
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You know, that'd be neat to see how that works out.

718
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I just don't I'm not really turned on to the idea of like paying a subscription service to like something like that,

719
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
where you can play all these different games because I have a library of steam games,

720
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
like five or some games that I can play and probably all very entertaining and same on my PlayStation.

721
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And I just don't do that.

722
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So unless you can like get me something, it would be hard for me to want to do something like that.

723
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah, I kind of feel like nothing has really hit that level of GameTap back in the day,

724
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
which was like game streaming in a way.

725
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I don't think it really streamed per se. It was like you're kind of downloading a copy of the game temporarily.

726
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But, you know, is that the whole like rich library on demand?

727
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But GameTap was really good at having a rich library of retro stuff, too.

728
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So I don't know. I guess it would really depend on what the game offerings look like.

729
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But I find that also playing a lot of PC stuff on my TV just doesn't like I don't know the SteamBox.

730
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm not getting as much use out of that as I thought I would when I first bought it.

731
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I thought I would use it a lot to play stuff on the TV.

732
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Oh, the SteamLink?

733
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I'm sorry. Yeah, SteamLink. Sorry, not SteamBox.

734
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
SteamBox is the computer. SteamLink. I really use SteamLink, but I know other people that use it a lot.

735
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So maybe that's just...

736
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I still haven't hooked mine up. I need to do that.

737
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
You should do that. Test it out.

738
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Well, it's because you need to have your computer on, right? To do it.

739
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So I have my laptop on. It would just be kind of silly.

740
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's like, well, I can play on my laptop, which is right in front of me.

741
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Or I can play on my TV that's a little bit more in front of me.

742
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's like, I don't know. I should try it.

743
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah. So, I don't know. It depends on what's in the library.

744
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That's what it's really going to boil down to.

745
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And if there's a really rich retro library, that was something that GameTap did very well that I didn't mind paying for.

746
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Especially another thing that I think GameTap did well back in the day was the leaderboards and some of that stuff that they did.

747
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I think if a game streaming service can incorporate more of that, that'll be really cool.

748
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You know what you want to bring people back with if you want to do something? One versus 100.

749
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Oh, don't get me on that rant again.

750
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Man, why did Xbox ever have to get that?

751
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Well, now everybody's crazy about HQ.

752
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
What's HQ?

753
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's that phone app, which is like the live game show that's like 10 or 15 questions.

754
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And if you answer them all, you win real money. You win a share of the pot.

755
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
They just started one at 6 o'clock. That was because I was getting all the notifications.

756
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But they do them at 6 o'clock every night, so obviously when OLR is going on, we start at 6 o'clock.

757
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Like in the middle of my drive.

758
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Well, no. It's in the middle of the show.

759
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Well, that too.

760
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh, at nights when you're commuting home. Yeah, it's in the middle of your drive. You got it.

761
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But during the weekdays, they do them at noon and 6, I think, for our time.

762
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I realize East Coast is different hours, but it's noon and 6 for us.

763
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I think tonight they were giving away $15,000 or something like that, but it's split between all the winners.

764
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So if 100 people win, they're really only winning 150 bucks each.

765
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That's still $150 you didn't have.

766
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
For what's essentially a free app that I don't even think is running ads still.

767
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I think all of the money that's funding that app came from investment money.

768
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I mean, they probably could start selling ads and make it decent, because they've got like...

769
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I haven't played it in a while, but there was at least 80,000 people in each game when I would go check it out.

770
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But it's one of those games where the first few questions are easy, but then they get really fucking hard.

771
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So that's why most people don't make it to the end.

772
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And you only have, as he reads the question, when he starts reading the question, you have like 10 seconds to answer.

773
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So you can't Google it. If you think you can sit there and Google it, you're not going to have enough time to do it.

774
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I've tried. You don't have enough time to do it.

775
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Voice search.

776
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It's still not going to work, because usually by the time he's done reading the question, you have like 3 seconds left.

777
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And that's not enough time to wait for the search results.

778
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Is it multiple choice? You have to type it in.

779
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It is. A, B, or C. Or D. I think there's 4 answers.

780
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It's harder than you'd think.

781
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Bobby Blackwolf says HQ trivia equals 1 vs. 100. They use the same concepts. Live host, etc.

782
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Yeah. HQ's probably the closest thing.

783
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I just don't care for HQ.

784
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's a really basic-ass trivia show.

785
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's nothing but 4-question multiple choice.

786
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And for me, it's been very buggy.

787
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
The video gets really shitty.

788
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I haven't played it in a while, and I know they've done a lot of patches, so maybe it's better now.

789
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
But in my experience with it, it was a lot of frame skips, a lot of missing stuff.

790
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It kind of was clunky.

791
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Maybe that's better now, I don't know.

792
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
But there was a certain flair that 1 vs. 100 had on Xbox 360 that I just liked so much better.

793
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So anyway, thanks for getting me on that rant again about how much I miss the Xbox game shows.

794
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I shouldn't bring up Classic Game Room then, should I?

795
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
No, let's not. Let's not do that. Let's do another story instead.

796
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Alright.

797
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So, there was a guy that created a mod for The Division that was used for doing kind of cinematic screenshots, I guess.

798
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So, the modder, he put out this thing. It was a set of tools called Cinematic Tools.

799
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And I believe that it allowed you to kind of do a freecam and move stuff around.

800
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But apparently, I think it used Cheat Engine as well to kind of do this.

801
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And because of that, Ubisoft detected that he was doing this and basically banned him for life from the game.

802
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And what's ironic, though, is there was an update.

803
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Actually, some Ubisoft, you know, let's see here.

804
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
We had a creative director, Julian Gerdy.

805
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Looks like he reached out to him saying, hey, yeah, I love your stuff.

806
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I mean, it worked. I'd like to see more of it.

807
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
You know, he's going to look into the whole situation.

808
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Because I guess he was tweeting Ubisoft these pictures that are really amazing.

809
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Yeah, no, I don't even play the game.

810
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And I was looking at those pictures when, you know, I was looking at the news for this week.

811
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And he goes, look at those pictures and, man, they're beautiful.

812
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And that's the direction that video games are moving into looking more and more alike.

813
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Although, of course, that takes a lot more art and all that stuff.

814
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But, man, it looks incredible.

815
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I can see a happy medium where they reverse his ban and maybe work with him to build a cinematic mode or something into the game.

816
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Well, yeah, and it also seems to me that algorithms probably detected what he was doing and ended up banning him.

817
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Which, you know, technically he probably did, you know, but Ubisoft should try to work with this guy, I think.

818
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
There's exceptions to every rule, right?

819
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah.

820
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Absolutely.

821
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
All right, well, let's talk about Ages of Mayhem, which was a game that you kind of skipped, right, Loki?

822
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Oh, yes. Totally skipped.

823
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Yeah, and it sounds like a lot of people skipped it because I don't think this game did as well as they were hoping for being a, you know, Saints Row spinoff game.

824
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Well, that's my problem is the Saints Row spinoff game.

825
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You wanted it to be its own thing.

826
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Well, it was its own thing at one time.

827
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Like, in the very beginning, when the very first trailer, they announced it, it was just its own game and they, like, kind of hinted a little bit that it might be in the same universe as Saints Row.

828
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And then by the time we get to the end of it, they have fucking Johnny Gat in there and, like, they're putting, like, Pierce and fucking just, like, Kinsey, all the fucking people from, like, Saints Row practically in there again.

829
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It's like, dude, what the hell? You couldn't make this game stand on its own? You just had to borrow from Saints Row and then make it some underwhelming piece of shit?

830
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, it may be getting another life in a board game form, of all things, and the way people found this was through Academy Games' website, which they do a lot of, I guess, more historical-based type of games.

831
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
For example, they have a game called Freedom the Underground Railroad, which is about the Underground Railroad.

832
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They have a game called Conflict of Heroes, which is about World War II.

833
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But apparently, there's a Kickstarter campaign link for a game called Agents of Mayhem, Pride of Babylon.

834
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
It's a 3D tabletop game based on the game and you, it is a real Kickstarter campaign. You can go check that out.

835
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's on Kickstarter.com and it's already met their goal four times over.

836
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,000
So apparently, there were enough fans of Agents of Mayhem or at least board games where this thing got funded.

837
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You can still get in on it. There's 15 days left to back it.

838
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Depending on how you feel about Kickstarters, I don't always like to talk about Kickstarters on this show anymore because I realize a few of them come to full fruition.

839
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:10,000
However, this does seem to be a company that has kind of proven themselves through these other historical-based games.

840
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And they probably have other stuff too. I'm just not as up to speed on board games as other people are.

841
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
But anyway, so through the Agents of Mayhem, Pride of Babylon game, it's a board game for two to four players.

842
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's on a module 3D board that is fully destructible. That sounds like fun.

843
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Like maybe you get to build things up and then destroy them. That's kind of fun.

844
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
That's a neat little concept.

845
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Knock it over. Aren't all board games fully destructible?

846
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
When you're losing Monopoly, fuck this and you flip it over and it's destructed.

847
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Although, did you hear about the Monopoly that's like the cheaters Monopoly?

848
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
No.

849
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Because you know how there's a million versions of Monopoly, right?

850
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You could get like Golden Girls Monopoly, Scooby Doo Monopoly.

851
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Like Cheaters as in the show?

852
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
No, no, no. Cheaters.

853
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Oh, not the show. Not even Cheaters the show.

854
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That would be hilarious.

855
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
That would be great.

856
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I don't like this community chest. Next.

857
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
No, it's none of those dating shows.

858
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It's like you are encouraged to steal money from the bank and do things that people do in regular Monopoly that try not to get caught.

859
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Like they steal money from the bank or they, you know, will draw extra cards or try to steal a property.

860
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Haven't you known somebody who's tried to cheat at Monopoly?

861
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
No.

862
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I totally know, yeah.

863
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Anyway, I got a little bit distracted from the topic at hand.

864
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So, Ages of Mayhem, board game, but it looks like you're going to be able to build multi-level buildings that can be destroyed.

865
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And that part's kind of cool actually, I gotta say. That sounds kind of fun.

866
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You can either play Legion or Mayhem in the game and yeah, so folks I'm sure are getting in on that.

867
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So, very cool. And it sounds like $90 is the minimum pledge for a reward and that will get you the 3D board game.

868
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
No thanks.

869
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And an expansion and so on. So, neat.

870
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Yeah, I'll play the video game when it comes in one of those Humble bundles or something like that.

871
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Or when it's inevitably on PlayStation Plus.

872
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, it's going to be marked down. Like they marked down all the Saints Row games to like dirt cheap.

873
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It only took four years for Knack to come to PlayStation Plus.

874
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It's just a matter of time, Loki.

875
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
It's just waiting game.

876
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
That's right.

877
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeah, I bought Saints Row on console because I got the bundle with that and Johnny got out of hell.

878
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Bobcoffee in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

879
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:36,000
When's RuPaul's Drag Race Monopoly? Hey, wait. I'm sure there's going to be something where it's like, go directly to jail.

880
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You better sissy that walk to the cell.

881
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Hey, you know, it's still in review right now to be a Lego set.

882
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Yeah, so the Lego set might happen. That's going to be awesome if it does.

883
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But I think there's no way it's going to lose to that Christmas Story house.

884
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And that Christmas Story house is going to be the winner.

885
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
No, you don't understand. It's not a voting thing. They're not picking one out of there.

886
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
They look at all of them. They approve multiples.

887
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I thought out of each group of eight, only one ever got approved.

888
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
No.

889
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Oh, I thought that's how it worked.

890
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
That's the case at all.

891
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So it's whatever ones they think that they can work into a set and get the licensing and everything for.

892
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So it could very well do.

893
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Well, if there's a Lego thing out there, fucking do it. Do the drag racing.

894
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:20,000
They have, and y'all know how I feel about the pop vinyl figures, you know, and here's the thing.

895
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm trying not, I'm really not trying to hate on the pop vinyl thing.

896
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I get why they're really popular. I get why people collect them.

897
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But they're everywhere.

898
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
They are everywhere.

899
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
You go to conventions, it's every other booth.

900
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
You go to the mall, it's every other store.

901
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Every store has them.

902
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
But despite what I'm saying about all that, look over there.

903
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I got RuPaul, Alaska, and Trixie pop vinyls that I found at a Hot Topic when I went to the DDR thing in the Bay Area.

904
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Because our malls didn't have them, but that mall did.

905
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So I was like, you know, and it dropped like 45 bucks on those fucking dolls.

906
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
But my love for-

907
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Try and find more of them. I bet they've got them stocked down in San Francisco.

908
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Those are the only three for drag race that are out now, but I'm sure there'll be more.

909
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It blows my mind there's not a Bianca Del Rio doll, but maybe they just couldn't get the rights for it.

910
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And, you know, I don't know.

911
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Maybe they just drag it out and make sure they sell all of them.

912
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Maybe. That could be part of it, too.

913
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
So we'll see.

914
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Anyway, let's move on.

915
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You got a story about Fortnite, right?

916
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Yeah, so Fortnite Battle Royale's been pretty popular, especially that, you know, that portion at least is free to play.

917
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So now they've got, they've hit a new record.

918
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Apparently 3.4 million concurrent players at one time.

919
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And so the previous record was held by PlayerUnknown's Battleground at 3.2 million.

920
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
But now they have smashed that record, and it's only gonna go up from here, right?

921
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So, yeah.

922
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Pretty awesome that they're doing well.

923
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I mean, those Battle Royale games are definitely popular, so I'm sure we'll see a lot more of that.

924
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I heard, was it even, that they're talking about that there's gonna be a Battle Royale-type game in Red Dead Redemption 2.

925
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Yeah, I think a lot of games are looking at doing a mode like that now.

926
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So, it's...

927
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Meanwhile, the creators of PUBG are coming out saying,

928
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And you have us to thank! I made you, and I can break you just as easily!

929
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Or H1Z1, King of the Kill, had that fucking first.

930
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You missed the joke, because PUBG was...

931
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I know, PUBG is...

932
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
A little salty at this whole thing to begin with.

933
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Wasn't it like Capcom and do something like that?

934
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I don't know.

935
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Capcom has sold oodles and oodles of Monster Hunter World.

936
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
They have nothing to be upset about right now.

937
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Like, Capcom has no reason to complain, at least this week.

938
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I just, like, the PUBG guys, like, you know,

939
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I'm sorry that your game is not the most popular game anymore.

940
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Darn, you'll just have to settle to be the second most popular game in the world.

941
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It's like...

942
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I feel so terrible for you.

943
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Minecraft couldn't be number one forever. No game's gonna be number one forever.

944
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Minecraft's not number one, but it's got fucking feet, so make your game have feet.

945
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Make people want to keep coming back and playing. Give it long legs.

946
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Alright. Let's move on.

947
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Other big games that have cooled down a little bit.

948
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Alright. And then...

949
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Let's see here. So, other stuff.

950
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
We can talk about, you know, one of the not very popular games.

951
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And that being, you know, Pokemon Go. No one plays that anymore.

952
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
But Pokemon Go, they have...

953
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
There's a rumor that there's gonna be some story-based quests coming soon.

954
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Thanks to data miners who have taken apart the latest version of the game to see that.

955
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
So, with that, apparently there's gonna be both short and long-term goals with these.

956
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
They're gonna include different characters from the franchise, including, like, Professor Willow.

957
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
They're saying that according, I guess, the website, Silph Road,

958
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
these characters are gonna be given animations and facial expressions and stuff like that,

959
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
so you'll be able to see them emote and stuff.

960
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And then also, they're noting that...

961
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
What else?

962
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
They're gonna basically...

963
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Yeah, different, I guess, indicators about the quests and stuff.

964
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And then, of course, the actual patch notes they're talking about.

965
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
You know, that they'll let trainers...

966
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I guess you'll be able to search your Pokemon collection using terms like shiny.

967
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
So, if you wanna look at all your shinies, you can do that.

968
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Then, improved in-game news feature, which...

969
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Swear to fucking God, I've been playing, like, today.

970
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I swiped it away the first time.

971
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It's like, hey, did you know there's Pokemon from Gen 3?

972
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
And I'm like, fucking, I'm trying to play this game.

973
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
This, like, pop-up is getting in my way.

974
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Yeah, I mean, it looks a lot better, but it's...

975
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, I get alerts all the time from it, too.

976
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It's like, dude, no shit.

977
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Is that where all these Gen 3 Pokemon are coming from?

978
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't need to know that.

979
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Well, I think the story mode could be really cool.

980
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I think it's something a little different, so it's not just, you know,

981
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
catch all the nests and raid all the things.

982
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I'm wondering if it's gonna be like, you know, the missions that they do in Ingress.

983
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I mean, that wouldn't be bad.

984
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh, God, I'd love that, like, where you get little mission badges.

985
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
That's, like, the best thing in Ingress right now.

986
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm so bored of the fielding game.

987
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It's just, I like doing the missions.

988
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Like, maybe it could be, like, they could have,

989
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
instead they can't capture anything.

990
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I doubt they'd have you capture a gym,

991
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
because that takes a long time.

992
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I, like, did that during, I was watching my kid do gymnastics or whatever,

993
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and, like, I sat there hacking away at their gym,

994
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
and it's just, it takes so long.

995
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
For those that don't know missions in Ingress,

996
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
and what I'm referring to is that in Ingress,

997
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
you can, like, you know, you'll go to places,

998
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
and you can hack, like, they are user created,

999
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
and they're in the game once they're approved

1000
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
by the moderation board or whatever,

1001
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
and it's, like, you hack these six portals in a park,

1002
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
and you'll get a permanent badge on your profile

1003
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
that shows you completed this mission,

1004
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and, you know, so it's just a nice way to show that you visited this park.

1005
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
For example, and some of them have, like, banners,

1006
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
so instead of just one mission, it's, like, 18 missions,

1007
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
but when you put them all together,

1008
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
it does a nice little banner on your profile.

1009
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
For example, when I was in Atlanta for Dragon Con last year,

1010
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I did an 18-part Ingress mission that took you around the hotels

1011
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
and around that part of Atlanta,

1012
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
and now I have a permanent copy of the old carpet at the hotel,

1013
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
the infamous, you know, carpet, on my profile.

1014
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So that's really cool, because they actually took that carpet out last year,

1015
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
so, but it's really funny that now that's on, you know, my profile in Ingress.

1016
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
That would be kind of cool if they did something like that.

1017
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I mean, I guess they could have it, like, be within distance of this portal,

1018
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
or not portal, Poke Stop and catch a Pokemon or something like that,

1019
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
or I don't know.

1020
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But, yeah, the cool things with Ingress missions, too,

1021
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
it's, like, aside from just, like, you know, hack this, destroy this,

1022
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
upgrade this or whatever, they also have walk to this spot

1023
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and answer this trivia question, you know.

1024
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Yeah, those can be cool.

1025
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
They can also be annoying when the source of the question is gone.

1026
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Like, I did a mission in Seattle.

1027
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It was when they were newer,

1028
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
we didn't have a lot of the multi-part stuff yet.

1029
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I did one in Seattle at the Pacific Science Center there,

1030
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and I had to hack, like, 40 portals, I swear.

1031
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And then, finally, I got to, like, the last one.

1032
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It had a trivia question.

1033
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
The board with the trivia question was gone.

1034
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I could not answer the trivia question.

1035
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I could not finish the mission.

1036
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I was so irritated.

1037
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So, when it works, it's great, but when it doesn't work, it's fucking annoying.

1038
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
So, yeah.

1039
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Anyway.

1040
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Let's move on.

1041
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week,

1042
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and this has to do with Crash Bandicoot.

1043
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And, of course, Crash Bandicoot had the N. Sane Trilogy,

1044
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
which did pretty well on PlayStation.

1045
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I don't know if you guys know, but it did pretty well on the PlayStation.

1046
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Apparently, there was an article that came out on the, what,

1047
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Licensing Sourcebook Europe apparently mentioned that

1048
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
there's going to be an N. Sane Trilogy Switch port was mentioned in the article.

1049
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And that also a new entry in the franchise was going to be coming out next year.

1050
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Well, that would make sense that if the trilogy did so well,

1051
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
they're probably going to revisit this franchise at some point.

1052
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But the trilogy coming to the Switch?

1053
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Huh.

1054
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Well, the article was edited to remove all the mentions of those details.

1055
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Hmm.

1056
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Could this be something we hear about at E3 or maybe a little sooner?

1057
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I don't know.

1058
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
But that's very interesting that Crash Bandicoot was mentioned for the Switch,

1059
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
because I think most of us think of that as very Sony-related property,

1060
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
even though it's an Activision...

1061
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I guess. I mean, I don't know.

1062
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
They had Crash games, I think, on the Wii.

1063
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Did they? I don't remember.

1064
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I want to say that maybe the racing game was on the Wii.

1065
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Oh, you might be right.

1066
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Or the 3DS, I feel like, had something.

1067
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Something, yeah.

1068
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
The DS or 3DS had something.

1069
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
All right.

1070
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Well, it's time for us to get to the classic game of the week.

1071
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
We're going to take a trip down memory lane to a time

1072
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
when we were all playing Crash Bandicoot for the first time.

1073
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And we are going to be joined by Dark Soccer at this point in the show,

1074
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
so let's try to get her on the line here.

1075
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And she's going to take us on a trip down memory lane

1076
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
to find a classic game that we're going to look back on this week,

1077
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
as she's going to step into the gaming vault

1078
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and find a game that she wants to talk about tonight.

1079
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And we are calling the actual phone,

1080
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
and I think we have her there.

1081
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
You there, Jamie?

1082
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Yes.

1083
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I forgot that I changed your ringtone.

1084
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Well, but we're calling from the computer.

1085
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I'm not calling from my cell phone.

1086
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Yeah, but it still comes through.

1087
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I mean, I didn't like your ringtone, but my ringtone in general.

1088
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
My new default ringtone is the Dark World theme from Link to the Past,

1089
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
and it used to be the Doctor Who theme.

1090
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Oh, okay.

1091
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So you didn't realize there was a phone call coming through at first.

1092
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
No, I knew.

1093
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I heard it, and I looked at it, and I'm like, what?

1094
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Because my brain's all addled because I had an accident.

1095
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Well, I hope you're feeling better.

1096
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I missed you tonight, but I understand.

1097
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So if you're not okay to drive, then don't drive.

1098
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yeah, I wasn't okay to walk.

1099
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Well, feel better.

1100
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Feel better.

1101
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Are you okay to do the Classic Game of the Week?

1102
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Oh, yeah.

1103
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Well, then let's get to it.

1104
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
What is the Classic Game of the Week, Darth Zagara?

1105
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
It is the arcade stage.

1106
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Good choice.

1107
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I'm going to play some of the music loud here at first

1108
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
so people can hear the awesome Eurobeat in this game,

1109
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
but I'm going to take it way down so that you can talk over it.

1110
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
All right.

1111
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Well, the game is in the initial arcade stage,

1112
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
which has spawned many other games,

1113
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
and I'm half talking about the first game

1114
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
and half talking about the whole series.

1115
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
So the first game came out,

1116
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
and, you know, I had the date on here a moment ago.

1117
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I think it was 2002.

1118
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

1119
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
No, I'll take that back.

1120
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
2001 in Japan and 2002 in the English version.

1121
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
So, you know, basically it was based off the manga and anime,

1122
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
which is basically all street racing and drifting and cars.

1123
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Ooh.

1124
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And cars that kind of exist.

1125
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Ooh.

1126
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,000
So anyway, you have different types and modes to play through.

1127
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It's all, you know, one-on-one racing.

1128
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And there are some interesting things about the arcade versions themselves.

1129
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So basically the arcade stage,

1130
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
which we only just got it over here as just initial D,

1131
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
and then they started putting out the version numbers and all that later.

1132
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But you can save your progress with a magnetic card system,

1133
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
and you can save your customized card and your progress,

1134
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
or you lose your progress,

1135
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,000
but with those cards you have to play only on an initial D cabinet with the same version,

1136
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
and you have to renew every 50 plays,

1137
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
so that way you can get their money.

1138
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Yay!

1139
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And of course they're not backwards compatible,

1140
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
like a version 2 card cannot be used on a version 1 machine.

1141
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And if you upgrade it on another machine it's a permanent upgrade.

1142
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
So that's how the card thing works.

1143
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
As far as the games in the series,

1144
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
there was arcade stage and then version 2,

1145
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
version 3, arcade stage 4, arcade stage 5,

1146
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
and those were all the arcade ones.

1147
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And then there were three home versions.

1148
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
There was initial D special stage for PlayStation 2,

1149
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
which I have it,

1150
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
initial D street stage for PSP,

1151
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
which I don't have it,

1152
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and initial D exchange stage for PS3, which we have it,

1153
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
because Hubby is kind of obsessed.

1154
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So as far as the different modes for the first one,

1155
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I mean first of all the cabinets themselves,

1156
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
they look like standard racing cabinets,

1157
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
but they play all the Eurobeat,

1158
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and you get to pick which songs you start off with,

1159
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
which was pretty much for me,

1160
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
it was always Heartbeat,

1161
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
because I love that song.

1162
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
So as far as the first version that you had three different modes,

1163
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
you have Legend of the Street,

1164
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
which is your main story mode

1165
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
where you go against different opponents who are in the manga

1166
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
or in the anime,

1167
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and you have to go against them.

1168
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And then there's Time Attack,

1169
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
which is basically racing against other players

1170
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
or at the current machine or across the internet,

1171
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
you rank that way based on your time.

1172
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
And then Battle Mode,

1173
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
which is I guess just the one-on-one race.

1174
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You had four different courses,

1175
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
you had Miyogi,

1176
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
you had Usui,

1177
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
you had Akina,

1178
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
and you had Hapagahara,

1179
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
which the cool thing about this is that

1180
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
it actually has two different versions of each track.

1181
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So for Miyogi and Usui,

1182
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
you had Clockwise and Counterclockwise.

1183
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
For Akina you had, since it's a mountain drive,

1184
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
it's downhill or uphill.

1185
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And then for Hapagahara,

1186
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
you had Inbound and Outbound.

1187
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
So it actually had technically eight different ways you could race.

1188
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And then later versions,

1189
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
if I remember right,

1190
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
brought in Time of Day and different weather conditions.

1191
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Version 3, which was the 2003 one that came out,

1192
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
had different tracks,

1193
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
like Irohazuka,

1194
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
which was one of the expert modes,

1195
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
the new export one.

1196
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
You had Akina Snow,

1197
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Shomaru,

1198
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
and Shisaka.

1199
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So you had a bunch of different ones.

1200
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I just want to jump in real quick,

1201
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
because the chat room is lighting up,

1202
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
saying the Initial D went up to,

1203
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
they actually are past Initial D8.

1204
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I guess they did a game called Initial D0,

1205
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
which is kind of like the ninth game,

1206
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
but there's more than five.

1207
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
They're up to like nine.

1208
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yeah, they're up to Arcade Stage 0,

1209
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and then there was Special Stage, Street Stage,

1210
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
and Extreme Stage.

1211
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And there was also,

1212
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
6 was Stage 6 AA,

1213
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and 7 was AAX.

1214
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I'm sorry, I was going between two different lists of the games.

1215
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
So the one I had hasn't been,

1216
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
the first one that was going off hadn't been updated in a while,

1217
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
but I know that all of them exist.

1218
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
In fact, Stage 0 is actually pretty neat.

1219
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And that was on the SEGA New 2 Arcade board.

1220
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
It came out just last year in March.

1221
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And it has a six-speed gear shift,

1222
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
like the ones in One Gun Midnight Maximum 2.

1223
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So, pretty good.

1224
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But as far as though back to the earlier ones,

1225
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
because your rears are in the classics,

1226
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
because all up until we hit 2007,

1227
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
they of course, they all had great music.

1228
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
It was all, you know,

1229
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Eurobeatle.

1230
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
The newer games, of course, have some other music.

1231
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
In fact, our TV Zero brought in some rocks from,

1232
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
in fact, Jeff Smith, The Hug Me, The Vow, Gecko Green.

1233
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:08,000
And it also reduced the vehicles back to the originals.

1234
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
So, you know, but the games, I mean,

1235
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I've never seen them not busy.

1236
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Even some of the older ones at arcades these days,

1237
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
they're still pretty busy.

1238
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And of course, you know, for people who were not,

1239
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
you know, para para people,

1240
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
this was a lot of people's introduction to Eurobeat, you know?

1241
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Heck yeah, Eurobeat rules.

1242
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah.

1243
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So I figured that a game that kind of hearkens back to another one of our

1244
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
big, you know, video game loves being, you know,

1245
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
pata pata in the Devony series.

1246
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
They have that in common.

1247
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
So I figured this would be a good one to bring up for classic games.

1248
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So yeah, there are 12 games in the series,

1249
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
nine for arcade, three for home consoles.

1250
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And I don't think it's ever going to stop even though,

1251
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
what was the last movie they brought out like three years ago?

1252
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Oh, I don't know.

1253
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I think?

1254
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I've never seen any of these movies.

1255
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I rarely play the games, to be honest.

1256
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I'm not a hater.

1257
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
It's just usually these are the things I'm playing in between waiting for

1258
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
games of DDR.

1259
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Somebody said this exact same thing in the chat room earlier,

1260
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
but it was kind of like it was that other game at the arcade that wasn't DDR.

1261
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
All right.

1262
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
So I was kind of right.

1263
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
The Legend 3 movie, hold on.

1264
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
There was, yeah,

1265
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,000
the final stage was a four episode series that came out in 2014.

1266
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And then there were the movies that they did,

1267
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:41,000
and then they did a live action initially that was, hold on.

1268
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
It came out in 2005 as well.

1269
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So one thing I was reading about,

1270
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
just the areas that they filmed part of the movie is that now there are

1271
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
apparently a bunch of like figure and model car museums.

1272
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And then there are, what else did they do?

1273
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
They actually have like photo ops at where the races are,

1274
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
where they were the places that were modeled.

1275
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Like Akina isn't really a real mountain location.

1276
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It had a different name.

1277
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And off the top of my head, I can't remember what it was called,

1278
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
but a lot of those places, they are real places,

1279
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
but they were renamed for the series.

1280
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So anyway, you know, that's Initial D.

1281
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Lots of Eurobeat, lots of fast driving, and a car from 1986.

1282
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
All right.

1283
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
There it is, your classic.

1284
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It has the Tofu delivery logo on the side.

1285
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1286
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Initial D.

1287
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
The whole dang series.

1288
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Although we're focusing, I guess, on the first game for this,

1289
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
since we have to name something.

1290
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
The first few,

1291
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
which is why I was going for anything that was like 2007 and earlier.

1292
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yeah.

1293
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
All right.

1294
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It brings back memories of playing at the arcade because, you know, again,

1295
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
it was kind of like, you know, your DDR fans had that, you know,

1296
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
your racing game fans had, you know, Initial D,

1297
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and then your fighting game fans had like, you know, back at the time,

1298
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
like Soul Calibur 2 or, you know, continued Capcom versus SNK 2.

1299
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
You know, I know I'm dating this a little bit,

1300
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
but that was back when DDR was, you know,

1301
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
we were playing Fourth Mix and shit in the arcade.

1302
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
So good times.

1303
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Yeah.

1304
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So I, you know, it's something I haven't done before,

1305
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
and I can't believe I've never done that one before, so.

1306
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
It's like as long as we've been doing this segment,

1307
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
every week there's a new game where it's like,

1308
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I can't believe I never did this before.

1309
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
But that's the joy of this segment.

1310
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Why do we still do it?

1311
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Seriously.

1312
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
All right.

1313
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Well, I wish I could bear.

1314
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I'm sorry I was, you know, messed up.

1315
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
No worries.

1316
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We'll get through the show.

1317
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
So we'll see you next week, okay?

1318
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
All right.

1319
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
See you then.

1320
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
All right.

1321
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Bye.

1322
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Bye.

1323
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
To register participation for this week's episode

1324
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1325
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
use the passphrase DREAM.

1326
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
All right.

1327
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
DarkSakra here on the show,

1328
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
making a guest appearance via the telephone.

1329
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
She'll be back in the studio next week.

1330
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break.

1331
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
We have plenty more show to come,

1332
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
including some rapid fire news.

1333
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
We're going to get into the mailbag,

1334
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
which I don't know if we have emails or not.

1335
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I'll look in there and see.

1336
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And then we'll talk a little bit about,

1337
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
oh, that debate that's going around Twitter this week

1338
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
about Toad, and is that a hat or not?

1339
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And Nintendo made an answer,

1340
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
and it sounds like everybody's rejecting the,

1341
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
well, not everybody.

1342
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Half the people are rejecting the answer.

1343
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
It's GIF and GIF all over again,

1344
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
except now it's Toad's hat.

1345
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
That's what it is.

1346
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
The creator has said something,

1347
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
and there are other people out there saying,

1348
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
nope, the creator's wrong.

1349
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
So we'll talk about that when we come back

1350
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
after our break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1351
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1352
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Live tonight with the 718th episode of our show

1353
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
already in progress for this February the 11th.

1354
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Just Loki and I here tonight.

1355
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
DarkSakura was joining us a little bit via phone over there

1356
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
for the Classic Game of the Week,

1357
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
but she's unfortunately not here in studio tonight,

1358
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
hopefully back next week.

1359
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
But in the meantime,

1360
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
we still have a lot of news to get to,

1361
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
so let's do some rapid fire news.

1362
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Let's get to it.

1363
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Let's get to it.

1364
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Let's get to it.

1365
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
All right.

1366
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
So let's talk a little bit about Doom.

1367
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
The new one or the old one?

1368
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
The old one.

1369
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Cool.

1370
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
The old one.

1371
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I like the new one, too.

1372
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Yes.

1373
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So there's been a lot of mods for Doom.

1374
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
So this new mod is actually a mod that was created by

1375
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
a user by the name of My Name Is,

1376
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
and it's basically...

1377
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
What?

1378
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Your name is what?

1379
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
My name is My Name Is.

1380
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
What?

1381
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Your name is what?

1382
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Funny.

1383
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Basically, it adds D.Va's mech from Overwatch into Doom,

1384
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
and so the mod is called Overdoom,

1385
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and so they have this neat little animation

1386
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
where you're getting into the mech.

1387
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
You can even see the hairy arms of the Doom guy and stuff

1388
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
as you're doing all that.

1389
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So it's quite funny, but looks pretty awesome.

1390
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So they have that, and then of course they also have

1391
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
a bunch of other weapons as well

1392
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
that they've introduced from the game,

1393
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
so lots of cool things.

1394
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So if you want to check that out,

1395
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I'm not sure which you can grab.

1396
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Oh, okay, let's see here.

1397
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,000
You can grab that at moddb slash mods slash Overdoom.

1398
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
So go check that out.

1399
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And then this is kind of exciting.

1400
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
So there was a LinkedIn profile for Bandai Namco

1401
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
that suggests that they're working on a Switch FPS game.

1402
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
And Ridge Racer 8.

1403
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Speaking of racing games,

1404
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
since we were just talking about that before the break,

1405
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Ridge Racer is one that's been gone a long time.

1406
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Yeah, so apparently there was a LinkedIn profile

1407
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
which was a developer that was at Bandai Namco

1408
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
and made mention that it said unannounced IP,

1409
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
first person shooter slash adventure,

1410
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
exclusive to Nintendo Switch.

1411
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And the other one just says Ridge Racer 8.

1412
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Have you heard the rumors about what shooter that is?

1413
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I'm sorry, it doesn't say Ridge Racer 8 specifically.

1414
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It just says drift-based, high-speed car racing game exclusive

1415
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
to Nintendo Switch is another one that they had.

1416
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So Ridge Racer 8 coming to the Switch?

1417
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Ooh, wouldn't that be something if the infamous Ridge Racer

1418
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
were to come over to Switch as an exclusive?

1419
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Have you heard about what the exclusive FPS is?

1420
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
No.

1421
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I mean, it's just a rumor, but Metroid Prime 4

1422
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
that perhaps Bandai Namco is the ones that are making it,

1423
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
so be interesting.

1424
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Yeah.

1425
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I mean, quality products, quality product,

1426
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I'll wait and see what they turn out, if that's true,

1427
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
but that's what some people have been putting together.

1428
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I just want Ridge Racer,

1429
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
and please don't make it exclusive to Switch

1430
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
because we all want Ridge Racer.

1431
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But don't you want Ridge Racer to go?

1432
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Handheld?

1433
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I don't need it to go.

1434
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I just need it to be on a system that I own.

1435
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
You're so selfish.

1436
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
All right.

1437
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Oh, yes.

1438
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I'm so selfish.

1439
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
You know what?

1440
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I got Ridge Racer to go.

1441
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
It was for the Vita, and it sucked ass.

1442
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And I want a redo.

1443
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
All right.

1444
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Well, moving on, the next story I had slotted

1445
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
was the response from Billy Mitchell

1446
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
to the Donkey Kong high score controversy,

1447
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
except now the website that I was supposed to be using won't load.

1448
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
That's great.

1449
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Gotta love live radio.

1450
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Let's see what I can remember off memory,

1451
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
and hopefully I don't misappropriate this.

1452
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I didn't do it.

1453
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Well, I mean, it kind of boiled down to a lot of the stuff

1454
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
we talked about last week,

1455
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
is that one of the scores that he got was...

1456
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
All right.

1457
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I'll help you out here.

1458
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Thank you.

1459
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Well, let me say the part I remember.

1460
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
One of the scores he got was in front of a live crowd,

1461
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
and that score didn't go anywhere.

1462
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It's just that these higher scores that he also did,

1463
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
those did get discounted,

1464
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
although Twin Galaxies has not really formulated

1465
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
an official response to this whole debacle as of yet.

1466
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
But the reason why I want to clarify that is because

1467
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
last week we also were talking about the dragster guy

1468
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
that had made up those times,

1469
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
but had never really proven that he could even get in that ballpark.

1470
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And part of why I said the Billy Mitchell story was different

1471
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
is I was like, well, Billy Mitchell can at least prove

1472
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
he can hang in that league.

1473
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Like, he is good at Donkey Kong.

1474
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
He's gotten a score very, very high before.

1475
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
So, I mean, who knows?

1476
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
It would be very weird to fake that.

1477
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

1478
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
But, I mean, did he know that those machines were running main?

1479
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
People do weird shit with arcade cabinets all the time.

1480
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
So that's all I was saying is that, you know,

1481
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
give him a little bit of the benefit of the doubt.

1482
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
He's not always the super villain that you saw in that movie.

1483
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
So, you know.

1484
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But, you know, fair is fair, and if it was an emulator,

1485
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
then it does need to be discarded.

1486
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
It's not the same rules that everybody else is playing on.

1487
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
But if I were Billy Mitchell, this would just motivate me

1488
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
to get a higher record and do it again.

1489
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Yeah, so apparently this was from an internet talk show

1490
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
called Eastside Dave, and he commented on the whole situation

1491
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
saying that I've never played MAME.

1492
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I don't have MAME loaded in my home.

1493
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
The film footage that he has that Jeremy,

1494
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Donkey Kong 4 moderator who analyzed the footage has,

1495
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
shows MAME play.

1496
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Now, I contend that if he gets the original tape

1497
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
or gets the original room shot,

1498
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
he will see that what I say is true.

1499
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I'm not disputing what he says.

1500
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
What I'm disputing is the fact that I want him

1501
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
to have the original tape, and the fact of the matter

1502
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
is that the original footage given to Twin Galaxies,

1503
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Twin Galaxies has it or should have it,

1504
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
and that's if it's anywhere other than Twin Galaxies,

1505
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
that's the real problem.

1506
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So, I remember the responding back saying,

1507
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
if that were for them to fake that footage,

1508
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
like say this was a whole conspiracy

1509
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
and it wasn't really his footage that he submitted to them,

1510
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
that they would have to mimic what he's done in the game.

1511
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
It would just be like a really elaborate thing.

1512
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So, I don't know.

1513
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
All this over fucking Donkey Kong, my God.

1514
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And then it basically said that also,

1515
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
you know, with that, that apparently...

1516
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
What was it?

1517
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
There was another comment here.

1518
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It says here.

1519
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
From Twin Galaxy owners, Pete Bovier,

1520
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
was saying that, you know,

1521
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
when I absolutely had a good fortune to get the...

1522
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I think he's talking about the whole thing with Todd Rogers.

1523
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
So, when I had the absolutely good fortune

1524
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
to get the score on Donkey Kong,

1525
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I turned around and one of the people shaking my hands

1526
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
was one of the people patting me on the back

1527
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
was Pete Bovier, the owner of Twin Galaxies.

1528
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
So, basically saying, hey, when I got those scores,

1529
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
it was a witness of the guy that runs Twin Galaxies.

1530
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

1531
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So, this shit's never gonna end.

1532
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
The advances in technology are gonna make people

1533
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
really analyze those footages.

1534
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Right.

1535
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And, like, I would be more on the side of believing Billy Mitchell

1536
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
versus definitely the other dude, you know,

1537
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
that has all these impossible scores

1538
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
that they have proved to be impossible to get.

1539
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Whereas, you know, Donkey Kong,

1540
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I mean, he's definitely got the skills to do it.

1541
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
It's just a matter of, like, getting this whole thing straightened out.

1542
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And, like, I have to wonder, like, with, you know, VHS,

1543
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,000
like, how, like, could any of that have been caused by the VHS?

1544
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Mm-hmm.

1545
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Like, if, I mean, obviously,

1546
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
every screen readjaw's not gonna be, but, I mean,

1547
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
VHS is exactly the most high-definition format out there.

1548
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I can only imagine that'd be pretty hard to get into the details on that.

1549
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1550
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Rob D. in chat says,

1551
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I actually watched King of Kong again this week after hearing the story

1552
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
and it bothers me so much.

1553
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
You say that Billy Mitchell isn't always a supervillain how he appears,

1554
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
but he's so much scummier with the knowledge that those runs were emulated.

1555
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I feel so much worse for Steve Weeby.

1556
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Well, I mean, I'm saying is that, you know,

1557
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I met him at Dragon Con this last year

1558
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
and he's pretty much a normal freaking person.

1559
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
You know, he's not, like, ego all the time,

1560
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
but when the cameras are on, I think it's part of the persona.

1561
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And could he go that far to try to one-up the next guy?

1562
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I mean, in line, maybe.

1563
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I don't know him that well, you know.

1564
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
People are capable of crazy shit,

1565
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
but there's also that part of me that doesn't want to give him the benefit of the doubt

1566
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
of, well, maybe he didn't know.

1567
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Because I think of the Man vs. Snake thing

1568
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
where the board was overclocked or whatever.

1569
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Assuming that he did do this in MAME,

1570
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
what would be the advantage of him doing this in MAME

1571
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
versus, like, an actual arcade cabinet?

1572
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Like, what possible ways would he be cheating in that?

1573
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
That you would probably be able to detect,

1574
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I would assume, like, you know, if it's scoring,

1575
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
if he's, like, giving himself a higher score for everything that he picks up,

1576
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I mean, that would be pretty detectable.

1577
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Technically, since it's emulated, it's not the real thing,

1578
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
but I get what you're saying. What advantage is the emulation giving him?

1579
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Right, because, like, that would be, like,

1580
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
the only way I would think he would do that on purpose

1581
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
would be to gain some sort of advantage.

1582
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I don't see why he would do that if he knew it would invalidate his run.

1583
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Like, I would think if he's gonna cheat, he's gonna cheat,

1584
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
and it's gonna be to, you know, somehow game the system somehow,

1585
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
and I just try to figure out what he would be doing in that regard.

1586
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Rob follows up with this, saying,

1587
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
in the worst case scenario, he could replay levels over and over

1588
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
and record his input as he goes, getting the best RNG.

1589
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
That's from live.vognetwork.

1590
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Oh, so, like, a tool assisted run?

1591
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Tool assisted, yeah, I guess.

1592
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That comment from live.vognetwork.com.

1593
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Anyway, rapid fire news, right?

1594
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I'll be curious to see where this goes,

1595
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
but, um, I think maybe thanks to the All Games days,

1596
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I'm so over Twin Galaxies drama.

1597
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Over it, I have had it officially.

1598
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Take the damn score away, see if I care.

1599
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
None of you get the score.

1600
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
We're not playing Donkey Kong anymore.

1601
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
In fact, Donkey Kong doesn't exist anymore.

1602
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It's off the table.

1603
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
The non-game. Donkey Kong is cooking software.

1604
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Cooking software.

1605
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
All right, let's talk about Red Dead Redemption 2,

1606
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
because that's a much newer game

1607
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
that people will be setting records on,

1608
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
you know, when it comes out.

1609
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Apparently, there's leaked notes,

1610
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
good old leaks, that's why I'm putting this in rapid fire,

1611
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
leaks and rumors, and what's possible and what's not.

1612
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
The leak features a slew of online modes,

1613
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
including Battle Royale,

1614
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
a team-based shootout known as Fight and Revive,

1615
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
and Money Grab, where you race against

1616
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
to get bag stacks of gold, return to your base,

1617
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
and get a fortune as fast as you can.

1618
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
There's supposed to be a huge online world

1619
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
where you can roam at will, and so on and so on.

1620
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It sounds like they're really trying to make this

1621
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
a little more of a service type of game,

1622
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
which I don't know how you feel about that.

1623
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It just sounds like Grand Theft Auto Online,

1624
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,000
and I want to say that they have similar gameplay modes

1625
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
already in Grand Theft Auto Online.

1626
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I know they have like a PUBG type game

1627
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
in Grand Theft Auto Online they can play,

1628
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
and I know one of the rumors is the first person mode,

1629
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
which that's already in Grand Theft Auto 5,

1630
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
so I wouldn't see why it wouldn't be in this.

1631
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
It seems plausible.

1632
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Oh, my favorite word, thank you.

1633
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Well, I guess, I mean, it's not like,

1634
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
oh my god, that's so shocking.

1635
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
It's just, it's not.

1636
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
It's not shocking at all.

1637
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
It sounds like it's just stuff that they're reporting

1638
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
from Grand Theft Auto 5,

1639
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
and they already have it built in the engine,

1640
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
so yeah, I can probably see that happening.

1641
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Yeah.

1642
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
It is a little bit one of those

1643
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
safe prediction type of things.

1644
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I think there may be a Final Fantasy XVI at some point.

1645
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I think it's very possible there will be

1646
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
a Final Fantasy XVI at some point.

1647
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Square Enix is developing Final Fantasy XVI.

1648
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
That's right.

1649
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Sources say.

1650
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
All right, moving on.

1651
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
What else do you have, Logie?

1652
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,000
So after much teasing on the Steam forums,

1653
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
apparently Puyo Puyo Tetris is coming to PC

1654
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
on February 27th, so they were putting out

1655
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
these ASCII art wallpaper things

1656
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
that were in different forms,

1657
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
like showing a Tetromino and one of the Puyo Puyos.

1658
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
So now, after all that, it's been confirmed

1659
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
that they're gonna be releasing it,

1660
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
so you get to check them out.

1661
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Oh, hooray.

1662
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
For those of you that have already bought the game twice

1663
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
on Switch and PlayStation 4,

1664
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
now you can buy it again.

1665
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Yay.

1666
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
So, interesting.

1667
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And then along with that,

1668
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:38,000
so EVO 2018 is adding Dragon Ball FighterZ to the lineup.

1669
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
What's kind of ironic, though,

1670
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
is what's not being added to that,

1671
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.

1672
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Yikes, because that's kind of a newer fighting game.

1673
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I don't think it was received as well.

1674
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Reception just wasn't there for that.

1675
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
But Capcom has good news with Monster Hunter World,

1676
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
but just the news over here isn't as good, that's all.

1677
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Yeah, I mean, at the very least,

1678
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Street Fighter V is gonna be there,

1679
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
so that's represented, but other games,

1680
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
you know, Tekken 7, Smash Brothers Melee,

1681
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Smash Brothers Wii U,

1682
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle,

1683
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
and then, of course, you know,

1684
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
they're saying that Injustice 2 is still on the roster,

1685
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
so that'll be there.

1686
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
And then, specifically, Street Fighter V,

1687
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
the arcade edition will be there.

1688
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Well, that's, you know, the new one.

1689
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
The new one.

1690
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And then Guilty Gear Xrd Revision 2.

1691
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
So, it's disappointing,

1692
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
but, I mean, I don't know.

1693
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I wasn't impressed by Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.

1694
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
All right, well, let's travel around the world

1695
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
and check out some releases that will hopefully impress you

1696
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
a little more that are coming out around the world this week,

1697
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
starting with the US.

1698
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
All right, so let's take a look here.

1699
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I can't imagine there's too much coming out,

1700
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
although we are in February, and that's an okay month.

1701
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
So, let's see.

1702
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Coming out this week, we've got a few things.

1703
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Dynasty Warriors 9.

1704
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
That's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1705
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Kingdom Come Deliverance on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1706
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Uh, okay.

1707
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Monster Energy Supercross, the official video game on PC,

1708
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1709
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Owlboy finally getting released on console.

1710
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1711
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Radiant Historia Perfect Chronology on 3DS.

1712
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:40,000
The longest five minutes on PC, Switch, and the Vita.

1713
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And, let's see.

1714
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Legend of Heroes Trails of the Cold Steel 2 on PC.

1715
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
And then, this is interesting.

1716
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I'm curious to see what this actually looks like.

1717
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Remember, I think we talked about this a while back,

1718
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
but a certain magical virtual lawn

1719
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and the Vita,

1720
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
but that's not actually for PlayStation VR,

1721
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
so that might be cool.

1722
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Fe, or Fe.

1723
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I remember.

1724
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
That's on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1725
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Secret of Mana on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1726
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Yeah, that's the big release this week.

1727
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Now, hold on.

1728
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Before you speak too soon there.

1729
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
The big release.

1730
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
That's going to be hard to top the Secret of Mana remake.

1731
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I'm really looking forward to that.

1732
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
How about I'll give you Bayonetta 1 and 2 on the Switch.

1733
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Oh, fuck, that's this week?

1734
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
That's this week.

1735
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Why did I think that was like March?

1736
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Oh, shit.

1737
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
You're right.

1738
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
That is the big release this week.

1739
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Wow, and you tried to write this week off

1740
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
at the beginning.

1741
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It's not a big deal.

1742
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Those are two big fucking deal games.

1743
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Those might be the things that finally tear me away

1744
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
from fucking Final Fantasy XIV for a little while.

1745
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
All right.

1746
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Great.

1747
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
And then there's a game called Long Gone Days

1748
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
on PC, Mac, and Linux coming out one week from today.

1749
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
That's it.

1750
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
All right, traveling over to Japan.

1751
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
The releases this week in Japan include

1752
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
on the PlayStation 4, Cyber Troopers Virtual On

1753
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
cross Tora Majutsu no Index.

1754
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
It's that same.

1755
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Yep.

1756
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
The Secret of Mana remake.

1757
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Of course, you would notice Seiken Detsetsu 2 over there.

1758
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
That is also released on the 15th this week.

1759
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
There's also a game called Shinobi Koi Utsutsu

1760
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Banka Aya Imakai in a regular and limited edition.

1761
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
That should not be confused just because it has the word

1762
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Shinobi in it with Sega's big series.

1763
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
This is a different game that actually looks like it's more

1764
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
like it based on an anime based on the various faces

1765
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
that are there.

1766
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
That is on the PlayStation 4.

1767
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, Idol-ish.

1768
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It's not Idol.

1769
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
It's just Idol-ish.

1770
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Idol-ish 712 Fantasia is out as well as that same Virtual On

1771
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
and the Secret of Mana remake on the Vita, don't forget.

1772
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Like a rare Vita sighting.

1773
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And then on the Nintendo Switch this week over in Japan,

1774
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
actually nothing sadly.

1775
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I'm not showing anything in Japan this week except that

1776
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
same Bayonetta 1 and 2 remake is on February 17th.

1777
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So I guess that is the day before our next show.

1778
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
So the Bayonetta remake is on the Switch in Japan as well.

1779
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,000
And the Nintendo 3DS, nothing this week.

1780
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Do you have Europe up, Loki?

1781
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
You wanna do that?

1782
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Sure.

1783
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
So let's see.

1784
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
This week we've got Kingdom Come Deliverance on PlayStation 4,

1785
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Xbox One, and PC.

1786
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,000
South Park, The Stick of Truth on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1787
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
The Secret of Mana on PlayStation 4, Vita, and PC.

1788
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
That's all they have listed.

1789
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
All right, let's get to the mailbag.

1790
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Every week you guys email us.

1791
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Participate at Orangelaungerator.com

1792
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
if you wanna email us for a future week.

1793
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And we will read your emails live on air.

1794
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
So let's get to it.

1795
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
We have a couple of emails tonight.

1796
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I know I said before the break I wasn't sure if we had any

1797
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
and I forgot there were a couple that came in.

1798
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
There was one earlier in the week and then one yesterday.

1799
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
So we have a couple emails to get through tonight.

1800
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
So let's start off with this first email from our pal YYR

1801
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
who emails us saying,

1802
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Hello, LR. I'm just gonna do what I often do.

1803
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Comment on last week's episode.

1804
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Regarding the Rock Band Network songs being delisted,

1805
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I can tell you the most likely cause of that

1806
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
and has nothing to do with licensing.

1807
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Guess what system powered the submission and sales of Rock Band Network songs?

1808
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Xbox Live Indie Games.

1809
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Yep, Xbox Live Indie Games is the backbone of Rock Band Network

1810
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
and I'm surprised they didn't both go down together.

1811
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Or perhaps they will be doing just that

1812
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
because while all Xbox Live Indie Games were officially delisted in October,

1813
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
the system's still up

1814
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
and three of the games were left on sale up until just recently.

1815
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
My belief is they're finally bringing that system down this month.

1816
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
That could be.

1817
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Probably.

1818
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I think you're onto something there.

1819
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
It's surprising that they didn't just rebuild that system to support it.

1820
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
No. It is what it is.

1821
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
So if you're wondering why those songs are disappearing,

1822
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
yep, that's the reason.

1823
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
And as far as custom music in-game goes,

1824
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
that was something we talked about last week,

1825
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
personally, I barely ever do that.

1826
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
But I admit that I played both Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge

1827
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
on the original Xbox with a custom soundtrack.

1828
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And not just for any soundtrack, but the best one.

1829
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
The soundtrack from Wangen Midnight Maximum Tune

1830
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
composed by the one and only Yuzo Koshiro.

1831
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Dude, I've done the same thing in racing games.

1832
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I have done the same thing.

1833
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
You've done the Wangen soundtrack.

1834
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Gives you the edge.

1835
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Fuck yeah. Makes me...

1836
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Here's the dangerous thing.

1837
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I've listened to that soundtrack in my car driving to LA

1838
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and I shit you not.

1839
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I shit you not.

1840
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
That's like when you're going down the cow towns on iFET,

1841
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
which I know not everybody knows the west coast,

1842
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:44,000
but between Sacramento and LA on i5, there ain't shit.

1843
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
It's a lot of cow towns and stuff.

1844
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I caught myself going 95 miles an hour on the freeway to LA

1845
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
because I was listening to the Wangen Midnight Maximum Tune.

1846
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
That's one thing I liked about Ridge Racer

1847
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
was the music in the game.

1848
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Yes.

1849
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
So anyhow, let's see.

1850
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
And by the way, if you happen to go to round one,

1851
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
play the fifth version of that game.

1852
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
He's still doing the music and it's fantastic.

1853
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I didn't know he was still doing the music.

1854
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
That's great. I've got to find those soundtracks then.

1855
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
All right.

1856
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I'll close with a response to your response to my previous email

1857
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
that if you acquire a game and put it in your house,

1858
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
it ought to not be ripped away from you.

1859
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
But the unfortunate fact is that we don't actually own

1860
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
any of these network-based games and we never have.

1861
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
We never will.

1862
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Whether it's Miitomo or World of Warcraft or Overwatch

1863
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
or any other network-based game on any platform,

1864
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
we simply can't approach it with the mentality of I own this

1865
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
because no, you don't and you still won't

1866
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
when the service is eventually terminated

1867
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
even if you spent a significant amount of money on it.

1868
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Am I wrong?

1869
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Not necessarily, but didn't we have that whole thing

1870
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
with the Congress, like somebody was trying to petition

1871
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
with copyright.

1872
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I think it was one of these gaming archive sites

1873
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
that they should be able to,

1874
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
if the official companies are not going to run the servers,

1875
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
then somebody else, hackers or whoever figured out

1876
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
how to reverse engineer a server,

1877
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
should be able to run their own servers for games

1878
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
so that these types of games can be preserved.

1879
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Because you're right.

1880
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Everybody's fucking talking about Overwatch now

1881
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
and it's at full-time fever with Overwatch League

1882
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
and all that stuff, but it'll go away someday.

1883
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
But how are people a hundred years from now

1884
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
going to be able to play Overwatch?

1885
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I can go back and watch Gone with the Wind,

1886
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
which was made 80-plus years ago.

1887
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Eighty years from now, how are they going to play Overwatch

1888
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
if the servers are down?

1889
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
So, it'll be interesting.

1890
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Anyway, and yes, if you have a copy of Super Multitasking,

1891
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
you can stream it now.

1892
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Well, I plan to after tonight's show, actually,

1893
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
because I haven't streamed in an awfully long time

1894
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
because I've been focusing on the podcasts

1895
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
and just other stuff,

1896
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
but I will be doing Super Multitasking tonight

1897
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
because I've been waiting for this one.

1898
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
And if you'd like to stream it before release

1899
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
and you have an audience of any size,

1900
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
please reach out to me at yyr at yyrgames.com

1901
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
and I'll send you a copy right away.

1902
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Now, if only I could find some time to sleep.

1903
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Have a great week, Aaron, yyr.

1904
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Best of luck on the release of the game, by the way.

1905
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
So, it's coming out, I think.

1906
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
In fact, I know it was the February 23rd

1907
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
is when the game's coming out,

1908
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
so check that out on Steam.

1909
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Or if you have an audience on Twitch of any size,

1910
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
yyr is a nice guy. He'll help you out.

1911
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Just send him an email if you're interested at all.

1912
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
All right, one more email. Let's get to it.

1913
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
This email from Midnight Dream,

1914
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
who says, dear Orange Ons Radio,

1915
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
firstly, thank you for your podcast.

1916
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I've been enjoying it off and on since 2005.

1917
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Holy shit. Well, thank you.

1918
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Thank you. That means a lot.

1919
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
You're in the 10-year club. You get a gold star.

1920
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And I even called in once in 2015.

1921
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
You probably don't remember,

1922
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
but I'd been playing Sega Master System games

1923
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
and told you that I started listening to you guys

1924
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
and I was looking for podcasts to listen to

1925
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,000
while I was getting wired up to participate in a sleep study.

1926
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I have to be honest, since I was about three years ago,

1927
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I don't remember that specific call.

1928
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I don't remember anything that happened last week or last month,

1929
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
so don't feel bad.

1930
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Yeah, don't feel bad.

1931
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I have a hard time remembering what happened in my own life yesterday.

1932
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Two aspects of your podcast that I enjoy in particular

1933
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
is the friendship of you three, the hosts.

1934
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Yeah, Logie's okay.

1935
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I am.

1936
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
This is a good way for us to hang out every week.

1937
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
And the discussion of all games,

1938
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
from retro to PC to mobile to modern console.

1939
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
In fact, I think the only genre of games you guys rarely discuss

1940
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
is text-based games,

1941
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
though you did do Zork as Classic Game of the Week

1942
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:31,000
and have discussed text-based roadlikes here and there.

1943
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I am only aware of this fact

1944
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
because I am actually the nerd of nerds

1945
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
and still enjoy interactive fiction and text-based games.

1946
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Well, you know, there's that witty part of me that wants to say,

1947
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
or not so thinks he's witty part of me that wants to say

1948
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
they're still making text-based games,

1949
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
but they really are because Twine has made it so easy

1950
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
to make those types of games

1951
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
and even with some limited interactions with it.

1952
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And I know, correct me if I'm wrong,

1953
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
but wasn't Depression Quest,

1954
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
remember the whole, you know, that was the Zoe Quinn game

1955
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
and then that led to, you know, a Kotaku article, dot dot dot,

1956
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
that's all I'll say,

1957
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
but Depression Quest was a text-based game, right?

1958
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I believe so.

1959
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Yeah, and that was, you know,

1960
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
obviously it was hugely impactful in gaming culture.

1961
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
We'll leave it at that.

1962
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
So, you know, text-based games,

1963
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
oh, they definitely still have a place, you know.

1964
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Books still have a place against movies,

1965
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
so I think there's some people

1966
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
that definitely like those text-based games.

1967
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Why did anyone ever give a shit about such like an indie,

1968
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
whatever, okay, we're not going to go on that topic,

1969
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
but like I just like,

1970
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
why make a big deal out of something like that?

1971
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Yeah, yeah, let it go.

1972
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
No, I understand.

1973
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
It's just pondering.

1974
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Some topics, some topics aren't worth revisiting.

1975
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
One versus 100, worth revisiting every single week.

1976
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Classic game room, worth revisiting every week.

1977
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
That, let's not revisit it.

1978
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
There you go, Nintendo.

1979
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
You want a good idea to get people interested

1980
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
in virtual console games?

1981
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Just have them be able to build like your own virtual arcade

1982
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
with your classic NES, Super NES games.

1983
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
And to be clear, I'm not dogging on Depression Quest,

1984
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
which is an important game and you should check it out

1985
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
because it is, you know,

1986
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
it's something I don't think we'd really seen in gaming before.

1987
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
One more brief aside,

1988
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I'm glad you guys got rid of the F.U. of the week not long ago.

1989
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Personally, while I realize this is your show

1990
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
and it's an outlet in many ways,

1991
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I tune into your show for the aforementioned camaraderie,

1992
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
inclusiveness, and positivity,

1993
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
and there is enough negativity that is bound to pop up naturally

1994
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
without having to dedicate a pre-scheduled block of the show

1995
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
to it every week.

1996
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I thank you for seeing the exact reasons

1997
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
why I really pushed to have it sunsetted.

1998
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I know, I wish DarkSakura was here so she could say her piece

1999
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
because I know the F.U.s were, you know, a lot her as well.

2000
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
But I know she agrees and she's on the same page

2001
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
and I think, ironically enough,

2002
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
that whole topic we just brought up was around the same time

2003
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
when we had that intense negativity in gaming,

2004
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
was around the same time we decided to sunset the F.U. of the week

2005
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
for many of those reasons.

2006
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
But we always reserve the right to bring it back

2007
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
because sometimes there's just going to be things we have to,

2008
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
you're right, it is an outlet

2009
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
and sometimes we just have to let it go.

2010
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
All right, continuing with the email.

2011
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
So, after awakening from the three-year metaphorical sleep study

2012
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
since my call in 2015,

2013
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I've decided to write in to ask y'all's opinions on social media.

2014
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I personally have cut social media out of my life for many months now.

2015
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,000
That means no Facebook, Twitter, YouTube comments or anything like that.

2016
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I am subscribed to some Discord servers and subreddits

2017
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
that are well-moderated,

2018
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
mostly related to my chosen trade and its related fields,

2019
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
and built on communities based on mutual respect.

2020
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Even these, however, I don't check on a daily basis.

2021
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I find myself less distracted and more peaceful as a result of these changes,

2022
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
and personally I find the aforementioned services

2023
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
to be a net negative influence for most people in most cases.

2024
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
My girlfriend, after doing some reading and noticing my example,

2025
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
has also dropped social media.

2026
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
She held onto Instagram for a while, but eventually she gave that up too.

2027
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
We still look up cute animal photos and videos from time to time though,

2028
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
so tell Mr. Smoosh not to worry.

2029
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I just posted a new pic of them before the show too.

2030
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Mr. Smoosh, spelled M-I-S-T-E-R, Smoosh on Instagram.

2031
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Cheap plug.

2032
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I love that Rob has decided to focus on podcasts

2033
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
because I find podcasts to be my favorite way to consume information through the Internet.

2034
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
They are generally long form,

2035
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
which gives you the chance to flesh out an idea and go deep on a topic,

2036
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
and you get to hear people speak for themselves,

2037
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
which humanizes the speaker and usually makes nuances in their ideas clearer.

2038
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Thank you, because you're saying it, yes,

2039
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,000
but I'm going to cut that out and put it on the back of the box, exactly.

2040
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Also, I'm under the impression that podcasters are generally more reflective,

2041
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:51,000
thoughtful, and respectful than video jockeys or clickbait article writers and twitterers,

2042
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
though when it comes to why exactly this is,

2043
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
or even whether this is a fair assessment, I can't say for sure.

2044
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
My intuition is that it may be due to the short attention span

2045
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
plus ad-driven nature of most of the Internet.

2046
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Shock value might get you to stop and listen to a host

2047
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
when you are flipping through the channels while you're stuck in traffic, old time radio,

2048
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
or browsing links online, modern Internet,

2049
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
but it is not likely to get you to download a podcast

2050
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,000
and sit and listen to it for 30 minutes, an hour, or even gasp three hours.

2051
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
And podcasting doesn't yet attract fly-by-night trolls

2052
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
willing to do or say anything for views or listens.

2053
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I find that people that stick with podcasting generally value community,

2054
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
discussion, and in some cases,

2055
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
evangelizing about whatever it is they care about

2056
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
much more than they do view counts and ad revenue at any cost.

2057
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I think it's harder for, this is not in the email, this is my thought,

2058
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I think it's harder for the negativity in podcasts to kind of float to the surface

2059
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
because there are so many podcasts out there

2060
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
and because a lot of the algorithms are focused on what is being downloaded

2061
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
and what is highly rated.

2062
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
It can be very difficult for all sorts of new shows to kind of rise up,

2063
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
but also people that want to get into this for the wrong reason

2064
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
have a really hard time kind of rising up.

2065
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
In the video-based world, in the YouTube-based world,

2066
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,000
it's very easy to clip a video and show 30 seconds of something,

2067
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
whereas with a podcast, that doesn't really happen.

2068
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I'm fully aware of things like Anchor

2069
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
and people that will take clips of podcasts and put them on YouTube,

2070
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
but they don't really seem to catch that same fire

2071
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
that I think you're kind of referencing here

2072
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
when it comes to little bits, short attention span moments.

2073
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Well, there's a podcast that I sometimes listen to,

2074
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
the Totally Unnecessary Podcast with Pat the NES Punk.

2075
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
So what they do for their podcast is they just have,

2076
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
they cut out basically each story that they're talking about or each topic,

2077
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,000
and they split it down to basically like a 10-minute video,

2078
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,000
and they just like for a whole week they'll have like 20 videos that go up.

2079
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
So that's one way to do it so that you have that kind of short thing.

2080
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Plus, you're uploading lots of videos,

2081
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
so that also helps with the algorithms and whatnot.

2082
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Interesting.

2083
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
So anyways, so what are your thoughts,

2084
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
experiences with different forms of social media?

2085
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Has the internet really made progress since 2005,

2086
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
when podcasts were the new hot tech and blogs were dominant?

2087
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Or have we devolved into a culture of ADD,

2088
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
an outrage fueled by ad revenue

2089
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
and technological manipulation of our monkey brains?

2090
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Thanks again for the show, and until next time,

2091
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
may your lounges be orange and your soccer has dark.

2092
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
That's from Midnight Dream.

2093
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Great email, Midnight Dream. Thank you so much.

2094
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Thoughts on social media?

2095
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
You know, I got to be honest.

2096
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I have come so close time and time again to just getting rid of Facebook.

2097
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
It's, it's, Facebook sucks for a lot of things.

2098
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
It's very unusable right now.

2099
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
It's the clickbait culture and the headlines

2100
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
and the outrage that that leads to

2101
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
and the fact that people will say things behind a computer screen

2102
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
that they won't say to somebody's face in real life.

2103
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
A lot of that shit is getting to a point where it's, it's just becoming,

2104
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
I think a lot of people are doing what you're doing

2105
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
and kind of reflecting like, why do I waste my time on this?

2106
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
And now that's even like doubled by,

2107
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
we have these recent stories about people in the tech industry

2108
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
that are kind of regretful they committed,

2109
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
or that they created this stuff.

2110
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
You know, like what was that thing we just talked about last week

2111
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
that, you know, Tim Cook from Apple,

2112
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
like doesn't let his nephew use social media.

2113
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
And then there's also the part that, you know,

2114
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
and I don't mean to get too political here,

2115
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:29,000
but the reality is Russia impacted our election

2116
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
by using social media engineering.

2117
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Now, I'm not going to go so far as to say how much of an impact did it have

2118
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
and did it tip the election the entire way.

2119
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Y'all can draw your own conclusions on that.

2120
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I'm not going to open that can of worms.

2121
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
But the fact is, because the reports are out there

2122
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
and Facebook will tell you if you go click on,

2123
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
these pages were created by Russian entities

2124
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
to try to distract what was going on basically in American politics.

2125
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
That is fact that it happened.

2126
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And it's still happening on Twitter,

2127
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
and it's probably still happening to some extent on Facebook as well.

2128
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And all that noise, all that garbage,

2129
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
kind of makes you go like,

2130
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
well, why am I still continuing to use these websites?

2131
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
But here's reality.

2132
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
If I didn't use Facebook,

2133
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I probably wouldn't know when certain people got pregnant.

2134
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
I wouldn't know when certain people got married.

2135
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I wouldn't know so and so went on a trip lately.

2136
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I would be so far behind on the news.

2137
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
And I do have a friend that left Facebook behind some time ago,

2138
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
and I'm finding all the time I'm messaging her something about duh-duh-duh,

2139
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
and I have to stop for a minute and go, shit, she never saw the post on this.

2140
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
She has no idea that I did this new thing

2141
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
or I hosted this other show last weekend or something.

2142
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
She has no idea about any of that because she's not on Facebook.

2143
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
So it's one of those things where kind of like we all have to make a decision

2144
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
to leave Facebook or there's going to be some of us

2145
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
that are putting their news updates on there and others that aren't.

2146
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
And then another big reason that I stay on Facebook is Messenger

2147
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
because the reality is that's just replaced email,

2148
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
and there's friends that I talk to every single day on Messenger,

2149
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
and if I don't have Messenger, I wouldn't be able to talk to them.

2150
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
But my understanding is you can deactivate Facebook but still keep Messenger.

2151
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
But I still kind of feel like, well, you're supporting Facebook by using Messenger,

2152
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
so I don't know.

2153
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
One other thing I want to get out with this,

2154
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I realize it's not like completely gaming related, but I think it is.

2155
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
A lot of this stuff is very adjacent.

2156
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I do use Twitter a lot, and I really enjoy Twitter,

2157
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
and I've met a ton of people on Twitter,

2158
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
some of which I consider really close friends

2159
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
or that I have relationships that have gotten closer because of Twitter.

2160
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
It's very similar to LiveJournal.

2161
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I met my husband on LiveJournal many, many years ago,

2162
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
which was the social media that we were using before Myspace

2163
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
and Facebook and all that stuff took off.

2164
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:52,000
This community that formed OLR got stronger because of LiveJournal,

2165
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
because of social media and all of that.

2166
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
So I realize there's a lot of bullshit on Twitter.

2167
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,000
There's a lot, a lot of bullshit on Twitter.

2168
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:06,000
But I found that with every block I make, with every mute that I do,

2169
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
it gets a little easier to dodge that noise.

2170
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I blocked Notch, I don't know how long ago,

2171
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,000
and it's great because when people get mad about whatever he posts,

2172
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I don't see it, because I blocked him.

2173
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
He's not going to give a shit, he has no idea who I am.

2174
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
On top of that, I follow Notch,

2175
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:29,000
but even the way Twitter is with their feed and stuff,

2176
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
even when he does post something that people are getting mad about,

2177
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I can't see it because it sorts my feed all fucking weird.

2178
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Oh, here's the new thing I get is now on my feed

2179
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
because it shows a heck of a lot of what other people liked.

2180
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I get so much softcore gay porn.

2181
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Yes, thank you Captain Spike and all the other people.

2182
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Yes, I've had to, I think I had to unfollow them or something

2183
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
because I'm all, okay, it's cool to like your own things,

2184
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
but Twitter, there was no way for me to block people's likes.

2185
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I can't block people's likes, and if you're liking

2186
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
scantily clad photos, be it of women or men,

2187
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I can't block that. I can't view Twitter at my work

2188
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:20,000
because, oh hey, here comes this guy posed all seductively.

2189
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,000
It's like, okay, that's going to be awkward.

2190
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Yeah, no, I totally get it.

2191
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I think you can get around that by using lists

2192
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
because I don't think that happens on lists,

2193
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
but then if you've muted a person's retweets,

2194
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
it doesn't matter when you go to the list.

2195
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So Twitter has some bullshit that needs to really be fixed.

2196
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
And then, you know, there are still a lot of problems on Twitter

2197
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
that they have had a real hard time policing certain parts of it,

2198
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
but the good news is it's very easy on Twitter,

2199
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
at least in my experience, to cut that out.

2200
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
It's just that you feel a little dirty being on the website

2201
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
where all that shit is happening,

2202
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
but it is kind of easy to block out that noise, if that makes sense.

2203
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
And there are a lot of people on Twitter I haven't befriended,

2204
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
be friended, and have some good friends with them.

2205
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Yeah, and all I did, I think, for the pictures

2206
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
is I just started blocking those people,

2207
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
not the people retweeting that stuff,

2208
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
but the actual people whose pictures they were.

2209
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
And that's why I don't see Notch's shit,

2210
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:23,000
or the people, all the crazy right-wing guy

2211
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
when he was still on Twitter before they kicked him off.

2212
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Like, I was able to dodge that shit

2213
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
because I just blocked them all, or muted them.

2214
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Yeah, or just don't follow anybody that has that kind of stuff.

2215
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
It's hard sometimes, you know.

2216
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,000
So anyway, let's see, I haven't been looking at chat in a minute.

2217
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says,

2218
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I never like anything on Twitter anymore.

2219
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I don't want to spam people's feeds.

2220
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I only like tweets that are positive and to me or about me.

2221
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
I can't help myself. If I see a fucking funny Drag Race reference,

2222
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I'm gonna like it.

2223
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Well, it doesn't make sure...

2224
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Sorry, I do not like the thirst pics of some of the people that I follow

2225
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,000
because I don't want my followers to have to confront that in their own feeds.

2226
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:17,000
So I hope my friends understand that it's not that I don't like your pictures.

2227
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I just don't want my followers to be subjected to it,

2228
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
and I know how Twitter works.

2229
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Well, that's why they have retweet.

2230
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
If I want my followers to see a certain thing that someone else has posted,

2231
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
then I can retweet it.

2232
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Why do I need to have, like, if I like something, it retweets it.

2233
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
That doesn't make any sense.

2234
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Yeah, I'm totally with you there.

2235
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
That's something that Twitter needs to fix.

2236
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Anyway, here's the other thing, though, is that, you know,

2237
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
just like there was LiveJournal before,

2238
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
even if Facebook and even if, you know, Twitter fade away,

2239
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
there's gonna be something else.

2240
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
There's always Ello.

2241
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Stop it.

2242
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,000
All right, yeah, the Rob D hits the nail on the head.

2243
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
All it would take is a group of celebrities and athletes

2244
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
to promote something else, I feel.

2245
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Exactly right.

2246
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Twitter took off when the president started using it, you know,

2247
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
when celebrities were using it.

2248
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And the same thing happened with Myspace, really.

2249
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Now all the adults are using it. It's not cool anymore.

2250
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
All right, let's move on.

2251
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Let's move on. That was a great email.

2252
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
But, yeah, I mean, those are my thoughts,

2253
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
is that there are still good things on social media,

2254
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
but I totally understand where, like, sometimes it's just too much.

2255
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Like, the way, like, you will see people that know each other

2256
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
go at each other's throats on Facebook.

2257
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
It's like, I want no part of this

2258
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
because you're both being ridiculous right now.

2259
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Like, you both wouldn't say that to each other's faces.

2260
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
This is dumb.

2261
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
And I've seen some really ugly stuff go on on Facebook

2262
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
and some of these social media campaigns and lies.

2263
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
They get spread because somebody's feelings get hurt

2264
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
and all this shit.

2265
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,000
And it's like, I don't want any part of it.

2266
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:59,000
But at the same time, it's a really great way for me to promote,

2267
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
hey, I'm going to be hosting this.

2268
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Like, I did a screening of The Room in Sacramento in Midtown last night.

2269
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
And, like, I wouldn't have really been able to tell people that any easy way.

2270
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
And it's something I'm very proud of that, you know,

2271
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I got asked to host an event that's something different that, you know,

2272
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I'm getting more of these types of live hosting gigs.

2273
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,000
And I'm very proud of that.

2274
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,000
And I do want people to know so they can come see me if they want.

2275
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
So, anyway, Facebook makes that easy.

2276
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,000
All right, let's move on.

2277
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
We do have some more news.

2278
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
And then we'll get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio,

2279
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
all one word, on Skype.

2280
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
But first, Loki.

2281
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:39,000
All right, so there has been a secret ending for Metal Gear Solid 5

2282
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
that people have found out about a while back.

2283
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
But it's never actually triggered until recently.

2284
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
And that's right.

2285
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:51,000
What is involved to get the secret ending is basically all the players

2286
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:56,000
that have to dismantle all of their nuclear weapons.

2287
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
So, basically, everybody has to disarm the nukes,

2288
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
and there's world peace, and yay.

2289
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,000
So the nuclear disarmament ending, I guess,

2290
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:11,000
would have triggered and shows basically this cut scene.

2291
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Well, that happened recently on February 2nd.

2292
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
However, it was a glitch.

2293
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Whoops.

2294
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
It wasn't.

2295
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
They didn't actually disarm all the nukes.

2296
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
No.

2297
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
So, apparently, Konami came out and said, you know,

2298
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:30,000
the nuclear disarmament event was triggered in the Steam version

2299
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
of Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain on February 2nd,

2300
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
approximately 12 o'clock GMT,

2301
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
we're still investigating, but we can confirm that the event was triggered

2302
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
while the nuke count hadn't reached zero.

2303
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:50,000
The thought is that hackers have been manipulating the nuke count in the game,

2304
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,000
and they got it so high that it wrapped back around to negative numbers,

2305
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
and that caused it to trigger.

2306
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Huh.

2307
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
That game's been out a long time,

2308
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
so it's kind of funny that people are just now finding it.

2309
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Yeah.

2310
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:09,000
And so that was basically the thing that happened.

2311
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,000
And so everyone thought, oh, hey, is this going to trigger a new chapter in the game?

2312
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Nope.

2313
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Just the cut scene, sadly.

2314
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Nothing else.

2315
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,000
And, well, that's it.

2316
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I guess that's the end of that bookend for Metal Gear Solid 5.

2317
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,000
For your favorite series, it's probably never coming back,

2318
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
because remember, Kojima, no affiliation with Konami anymore.

2319
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Metal Gear Solid survivor.

2320
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
That's true.

2321
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Konami could always take the franchise and give it to somebody else,

2322
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
but anyway.

2323
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Meanwhile, over on Nintendo Switch, I don't know about you guys,

2324
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
but I've amassed all these gold coins that I can't fucking spend on anything,

2325
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,000
because it's just discounts on software I don't want,

2326
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
or it's free stuff that's also things I don't want.

2327
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Well, the good news is Nintendo is going to be changing their gold point system

2328
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
a little bit starting in March, and that's going to affect Europe,

2329
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Japan, and North America.

2330
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
So an update is going to occur where you can use gold points

2331
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,000
to buy Switch games from the Nintendo eShop.

2332
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So they are saying that will be something you can use in the Switch eShop.

2333
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I just hope it's like, well, for one,

2334
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
maybe they'll offer select games and so forth,

2335
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
but the stuff they're offering on 3DS and Wii,

2336
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,000
or it's like old Wii U, it's stuff that I bought a long time ago

2337
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
and I don't need again or what.

2338
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Based on what they were saying before, it was supposed to be one-to-one,

2339
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
so each coin you get in Japan is equal to one yen,

2340
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
which is basically like a penny here.

2341
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
So I don't know how many gold coins you earn.

2342
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
So not only will there be the Switch rewards,

2343
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
but there's this other element of it where you could use one gold coin

2344
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
to basically be, yeah, you're right, in Japan it would be one yen.

2345
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,000
So that's nothing.

2346
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
How many gold coins do you earn at a time?

2347
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:00,000
You get like 5% back in gold if you get a digital version,

2348
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:05,000
and it's only a 1% return for packaged Switch purchases.

2349
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:11,000
So if I buy a $50 game, I get like 50 coins.

2350
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,000
So that would be 50 cents from my $50 game.

2351
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
That sounds pretty terrible.

2352
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Yeah, I know.

2353
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
It's almost like I would just rather take the crappy little game

2354
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
that I missed and cash out that way.

2355
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
But it is another way you could do it.

2356
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I have something like 200 coins in my account,

2357
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
and if it's only worth two bucks, forget it.

2358
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:32,000
It's not the way I want to spend those points.

2359
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
I'll just wait and hope something good or a really good discount comes around.

2360
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,000
All right, let's move on. Loki.

2361
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
All right, so I don't know.

2362
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
This is a big controversy, I guess,

2363
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,000
but apparently the debate on the Internet has been,

2364
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Toad, is the mushroom part of his hat, or is that part of his hat,

2365
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
or is that his head?

2366
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Which is it? Is it attached to his skull, or is it just cosmetic?

2367
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,000
And apparently Nintendo came out and answered that question,

2368
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:10,000
saying that yes, canon is that it is attached to his head.

2369
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:15,000
That's what the story is, and apparently even though in the cartoon

2370
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,000
he does take it off, that's just him removing the top portion of his skull

2371
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
and not his hat.

2372
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Nintendo also didn't make the cartoon.

2373
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Nintendo allowed somebody else to make the cartoon.

2374
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I would subscribe to the theory that it is not a hat,

2375
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
because if they're from the Mushroom Kingdom,

2376
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
then they look like mushroom people.

2377
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:40,000
So if it's just a hat, mushrooms don't wear hats.

2378
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,000
That's my perspective on it, but I guess this is going to be the new argument.

2379
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,000
This is the new pineapple on pizza, which, by the way, I love Hawaiian pizza,

2380
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,000
so don't try to come at me with the whole pineapple doesn't belong on pizza,

2381
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
because it totally is fine.

2382
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Hawaiian pizza's great.

2383
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I wouldn't put it on every pizza, but I put it on that one.

2384
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2385
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
So that's how I officially feel.

2386
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
It's not a hat.

2387
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Yes to pineapple on pizza.

2388
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Gif.

2389
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Just so we're clear.

2390
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Dark Tetsuya says,

2391
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Well, why did they animate that scene with Toad taking his hat off?

2392
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Nintendo didn't animate that scene.

2393
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Nintendo had another company animate that scene.

2394
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Another company had the rights to do their own cartoon thingy from Nintendo.

2395
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,000
So technically, all of that is not official canon.

2396
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
So there's that.

2397
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I'm fine with that too.

2398
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Yes. Why doesn't Zelda or Link, I should say, in Zelda ever say,

2399
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Excuse me, princess.

2400
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
That never once happens in any of the games.

2401
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,000
So, you know, who either believe the cartoon or the games?

2402
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I am already sick of this argument.

2403
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
All right.

2404
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Speaking of ways to get muted on Twitter, come at me with this argument.

2405
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
All right.

2406
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Let's move on, Loki.

2407
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
All right.

2408
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,000
And then finally, this is kind of cool.

2409
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:10,000
So you may, if you've played Super Mario Odyssey,

2410
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,000
especially if you've done some of these weird hat tricks where you jump to

2411
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
No more hat talk!

2412
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
You jump to, like, these, like, hard to reach places and stuff,

2413
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
and you find there's coins there.

2414
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
And you think, well, why the hell did they put coins there?

2415
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
That's kind of odd.

2416
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
So apparently in testing this game,

2417
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:33,000
a lot of the game testers were able to get to different places in the game

2418
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
that you normally wouldn't be able to get to.

2419
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
I guess some unexpected areas.

2420
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
And to kind of pay tribute to those testers as well,

2421
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
they put coins in those places.

2422
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
So they hid coins in all these places that you would not normally go

2423
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,000
to reward people that have found ways to get to those places, I guess,

2424
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
if that makes sense.

2425
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
So that's kind of neat.

2426
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Yeah, that is kind of neat.

2427
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I don't know if this has to do with Toad's hat, though,

2428
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:05,000
but, you know, it's neat.

2429
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
No, because Mario's hat is the item in Odyssey.

2430
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
But yes, people get to very hard to reach areas,

2431
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
and I think that's kind of cool that Nintendo was like,

2432
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
well, I never thought to get up there, let's put a coin there

2433
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
so other people think to get up there.

2434
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I think that's kind of cool that, you know,

2435
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
they let the testers kind of find the hard to reach shit for them in a way.

2436
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
So, kind of neat. I like that.

2437
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
All right, one more story for you guys,

2438
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
and it also has to do with Nintendo.

2439
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
And then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

2440
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
all one word on Skype if you want to call in tonight.

2441
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,000
And it's about Nintendo Online,

2442
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
and they're saying that it's going to be worth the wait.

2443
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,000
That's right, in a Q&A session for investors,

2444
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
the Nintendo Switch architect Shinya Takahashi

2445
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
says that this service is going to be, again, worth the wait.

2446
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
The question was about Nintendo Switch Online.

2447
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
The official start of service has been significantly delayed.

2448
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Has anything changed during this extended development period?

2449
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Also, how do you plan to popularize the service?

2450
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
The answer.

2451
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
We view the online service as one component of our efforts

2452
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
to diversify how our games are played

2453
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
and get people to play more of our games.

2454
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,000
That is why we want to apply substantial resources to the online service

2455
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
with the thinking that we will devote our energies

2456
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
to making this a for-pay service.

2457
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
As for how we plan to popularize the service,

2458
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
it is less about the mechanism

2459
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
and more a question of what kinds of products we can offer.

2460
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
The spread of the service will depend on whether consumers want what we offer.

2461
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Please give us a bit more time to announce more details about the service.

2462
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I think that announcement will convey to you how we plan to popularize the service.

2463
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,000
It does sound very clear to me from that

2464
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
this is not just pay to play online.

2465
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:46,000
There is definitely another component to this

2466
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:50,000
and whether it is the classic game a month that you play online,

2467
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
whether it's that whole thing

2468
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
or there's another twist to it that we just don't know yet,

2469
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
there's something else there.

2470
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:02,000
It's not just 20 bucks to play online Splatoon anymore.

2471
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
But I think we all kind of knew that was the direction it was going in,

2472
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:10,000
but it really does sound like Nintendo is trying to push for something more

2473
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
and that something more they really think is a big deal,

2474
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
whether they're right or not.

2475
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,000
But the Switch is selling like fucking crazy,

2476
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
so what do we know anymore?

2477
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Anyway, one more follow-up by Takahashi,

2478
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,000
who said we have some ideas about how to make Nintendo Switch Online appealing

2479
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
when it becomes a four-pay service,

2480
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:33,000
so I think our next announcement will be worth the wait.

2481
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
How about that, Loki?

2482
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
It's going to be worth the wait.

2483
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Balloon fight with your friends. Worth the wait.

2484
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
We'll see what's worth the wait.

2485
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

2486
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I mean, if they are really exceeding my expectations,

2487
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
maybe what they're even doing with the classic games,

2488
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
like maybe they are doing more leaderboards,

2489
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
maybe they're infusing some of these old classic games

2490
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:59,000
with newer technology and it's not as simple as just emulating the old ROM,

2491
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
maybe if they are going back and doing some crazy shit to their catalog,

2492
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
then bring it on. Let's do it.

2493
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
For now, though, I do enjoy that I can play Splatoon Online for free.

2494
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

2495
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:18,000
You can also do the old school phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2496
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Also in chat, more comments at live.vognetwork.com.

2497
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
SSG100Matt says, hey, as long as they don't mess it up, they can take as long as they want.

2498
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Nintendo Arcade Room. Don't tease me. Don't tease me with that.

2499
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
We have a call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2500
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Hey, what's going on? This is Ron. I'm a long time caller, long time listener.

2501
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Yeah, great. Great to hear from you again. No, I'm kidding. It's always a delight.

2502
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2503
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:49,000
A couple of things. Now, one thing, I tagged you with something on Facebook

2504
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
and I understand you're going away from Facebook and I get that,

2505
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:58,000
but I'm dragging you back over for one thing you have not responded to. I need to know.

2506
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I have a feeling I know what this is, but go for it.

2507
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Yes. Spice Girls, are you down?

2508
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Absolutely. Here's the thing. Here's why I didn't respond, Rama.

2509
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Because I got tagged in posts by five other people on that.

2510
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
And although I love that people associate me with that news,

2511
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I just didn't get around to responding to every single one.

2512
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,000
But let me just put it this way. The name of my other show, Shaking and Crying,

2513
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
is not ironic at this point.

2514
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Especially when this news inevitably comes up on the show this week.

2515
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I'm so happy. I fucking... I know people are going to laugh, but I shit you not.

2516
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,000
The Spice Girls reunion tour they did, like back in, what, it was 06 or so,

2517
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
was seriously one of the best concerts I've ever been to.

2518
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I had so much fucking fun.

2519
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Well, I'm going to try to make it this year, because I saw Spice World in theaters,

2520
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
and I have the VHS tape, so you know I'm a fan.

2521
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I know, and I saw Spice World in theaters, too.

2522
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I don't have the VHS tape, but I have the DVD.

2523
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
But did you play the PS1 game?

2524
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I did, and did you know that Brad from Pod Culture found a copy of it,

2525
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
like a thrift store or something, and he sent it to me,

2526
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
so that I could play it on my PlayStation 3?

2527
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Because PS3 will play PS1 games.

2528
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:22,000
So I can go through the, let's put another girl through her paces, all over again.

2529
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,000
What is this about? Human trafficking?

2530
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
What? The Spice World game?

2531
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Oh, the Spice World game.

2532
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:33,000
No, the Spice World game. Jesus, don't take it to a dark place.

2533
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,000
But this is Loki here. Of course she's going to take it to a dark place.

2534
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
That's a very good point.

2535
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:42,000
So yes, I'm excited about the tour. I hope they are coming to the States.

2536
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Although the excuse to go overseas, I wouldn't really complain,

2537
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
but we'll wait and see what's going on.

2538
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,000
The only outlet that's really confirmed anything is TMZ,

2539
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
so I am still kind of just cautiously waiting.

2540
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I would like the Spice Girls themselves to say something,

2541
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,000
because TMZ is kind of, you know, trashy news.

2542
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
True.

2543
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
So I'm waiting for something a little more official,

2544
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,000
but it does seem like something's going to happen. I'm very excited about it.

2545
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Me too, and I did also see it linked from Entertainment Weekly,

2546
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
so, you know, getting there.

2547
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Getting there. Well, what else is on your mind, buddy?

2548
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,000
All right, so I was traveling back from Michael Charles' birthday party,

2549
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
so I missed parts of the show, but I spoke to Hack Def.

2550
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
That's my boy, and I appreciate that.

2551
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:30,000
So I wanted to comment quickly on the whole Twitch community guidelines thing,

2552
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,000
because I'm starting to see some of the backlash of that on my feed.

2553
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Oh, really?

2554
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Yes, because, well, I have friends with various cosplayers,

2555
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
and some of them stream on Twitch,

2556
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
and I know some of them stream on adult sites and so forth, you know?

2557
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Sure.

2558
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Everyone's got to hustle, make their money, and I respect that.

2559
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Sure.

2560
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:57,000
And I know a few who are doing both, and it's all good.

2561
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I mean, personally, I really don't want to see some of the titties

2562
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
all up on my gaming screen while I'm watching,

2563
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
but if that's part of the hustle, so be it.

2564
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:14,000
But Twitch is mostly for gaming.

2565
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I mean, whether it's male or female, if you want to sexify yourself, that's fine.

2566
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Be on one side of the screen,

2567
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:28,000
and let's see you playing through Super Metroid or another game on the other side.

2568
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
You know, that's how it's supposed to be.

2569
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,000
But I get why this happens, because believe it or not,

2570
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
it's much more accessible to get onto Twitch

2571
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,000
as it is to the various other adult sites that are out there.

2572
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I have two things to say real quick.

2573
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,000
To the Rob D. in chat who named Posh sporty and scary,

2574
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
you forgot Baby and Ginger.

2575
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
There you go. Anyway, those are the five.

2576
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Then to your point, here's the thing,

2577
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
and this is what I think everybody needs to keep in mind.

2578
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,000
For everybody that's saying Twitch is gaming, Twitch is gaming,

2579
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Twitch is gaming, y'all, not for much longer, quote me on this.

2580
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
I mean, ever since Amazon bought Twitch,

2581
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I think you've seen it inch closer and closer to being more than just gaming.

2582
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,000
And I realize the irony here that, you know,

2583
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Twitch once started as a life casting site through Justin TV.

2584
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,000
But I don't think it's really, I don't think it's that Twitch is going back to Justin.

2585
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I think it's that Twitch is kind of getting closer and closer

2586
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
to answering our fucking prayers and giving YouTube a competitor

2587
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
that can take them on at their level.

2588
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Amazon is at the level where they can compete with Google.

2589
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I think that's where Twitch is headed, eventually.

2590
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,000
So I just don't want people to be shocked when that news inevitably comes out

2591
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,000
that Twitch is much more than games.

2592
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I like that. I kind of feel as if Twitch is going back to Justin TV as part of their roots.

2593
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
It's like, you know what, this is where we started.

2594
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Let's add a little bit of this and go out there.

2595
02:18:53,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Because I know cosplayers who have their own creative channels on doing live streams of making various cosplays.

2596
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I know people who do art and stuff like that. I get that.

2597
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:10,000
But there are some levels of lewdness that goes on in Twitch that really shouldn't be there.

2598
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Am I going to sit there and tell someone they shouldn't do it? Nope.

2599
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Not my business. Not my monkeys.

2600
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,000
But if it's my site and I see it's causing an issue, then I'm going to be like,

2601
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,000
yeah, you gotta reel that back in. Simple as that.

2602
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Yeah.

2603
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:29,000
And I honestly feel some are saying, you know, Twitch just opened up an 18 plus site.

2604
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:33,000
I'm just like, well, that's not going to do you any good.

2605
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,000
I don't think Amazon doesn't want to moderate that. They don't want to have that in their holdings.

2606
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:40,000
For whatever reason in this country, and I'm not saying it's right,

2607
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I'm just saying for whatever reason in this country, nobody wants to do sex-related stuff

2608
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,000
and that keeps to an industry all its own.

2609
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Oh, go ahead. I was gonna say, you know, I was hearing someone talking about like, you know,

2610
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
what they thought who could be a possible contender.

2611
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
They would have the infrastructure to be able to compete with YouTube.

2612
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
And it makes so much sense. It's so easy for them to do this.

2613
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Pornhub. Pornhub come out with a video platform called like VideoHub or TubeHub or something like that.

2614
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
You know, basically like a non porn site.

2615
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,000
They have the infrastructure in place to be able to do this.

2616
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,000
And they have a section off for porn already.

2617
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
They could compete, I think.

2618
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Yeah, but when you can already submit videos, it's just a matter of time of streaming live videos.

2619
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Oh yeah, and I love it when people are like, they post those videos that are like,

2620
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:38,000
70 year old man fucks the entire country at once and it's like Trump giving the speech or something.

2621
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Pornhub is out there fighting for our internet rights and so forth.

2622
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:44,000
You gotta understand something.

2623
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Here is a site that makes money off of guys and girls getting off, fapping, all of this.

2624
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:56,000
And they're out there on the forefront fighting for your right to spank and so forth.

2625
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
And they do something like that.

2626
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:05,000
I can actually see everybody just going over and then there's just tumbleweeds going through Twitch and YouTube, you know?

2627
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Yeah, and I totally get what you're saying.

2628
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:13,000
And here's the thing, with this whole argument, it's like, I don't want to shame sex workers.

2629
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
And I don't think you do either.

2630
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,000
And I think there's a lot of, you know, people earn, make a living however they're going to make a living.

2631
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,000
And that's, you know, as long as everything is consensual, that's the most important part.

2632
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:28,000
What happens between two consenting adults is their business and that's fine.

2633
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
And I'm not out here to shame sex workers.

2634
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I think the reality of the situation aims a little closely to what you're talking about where,

2635
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:39,000
but I don't want to be looking for video games and then come across that.

2636
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,000
You know, there's a time and a place for that.

2637
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I get it, you know.

2638
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Yeah.

2639
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,000
If I'm watching somebody, you know, they're going through a game.

2640
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:50,000
If she's wearing something cute, that's fine.

2641
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I mean, I'm cool with that.

2642
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:57,000
I mean, but if they're doing like, you know, if you tip and they pose a certain,

2643
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:05,000
I get that I'll get more people in, but that kind of takes away from what the reason why you're there.

2644
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Yeah, I get it.

2645
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I get it.

2646
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Yeah.

2647
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,000
And again, I mean, it's still going to be a great area.

2648
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:17,000
And I see Twitch is still trying to dance around it because if they just come down and be like, this is what it is now.

2649
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Oh, the backlash is going to be horrible.

2650
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,000
But you know what?

2651
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I laugh when people say, oh, I don't like what you're doing.

2652
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I'm going to leave the site.

2653
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I'm going to leave the site.

2654
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Go right ahead.

2655
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:33,000
For one person that leaves the site, three more people will come through and be like, I like what's here.

2656
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
That's what it boils down to.

2657
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I believe it's the 85-15 rule or in this case, the 90-10 rule.

2658
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:44,000
As long as 90 percent of the people are happy with what's going on, that's all that matters.

2659
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:51,000
And that may end up, you know, referencing the early email that goes on, that may ultimately end up being what happens with Facebook.

2660
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:59,000
You know, once enough people are tipped off about it and go somewhere else, especially when it ends up being the celebrities and so forth.

2661
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
That's when Facebook is going to be hurting.

2662
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
No.

2663
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Anyway, Rama, great call.

2664
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:08,000
But I'm going to let you go to see if anybody else wants to get in since we're coming up on 10 minutes.

2665
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
But thank you so much for the call.

2666
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Hey, no problem. You all take care now.

2667
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Yeah, take care, buddy. Bye.

2668
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Bye.

2669
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you would like to give us a call.

2670
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I didn't check on last minute stories because the phone's lit up pretty quick there.

2671
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Do you have any last minute stories to share?

2672
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
No, I don't really have any. I don't remember talking about these, but there was like some...

2673
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I thought there was one I wasn't able to fit in. I didn't know if you...

2674
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Oh, I didn't look at it.

2675
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Way to prepare. Way to prepare.

2676
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
All right, we do have the phone lighting up with another phone call, so let's get to it.

2677
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2678
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Hi, it's Aaron, YYR.

2679
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Oh, you're going for the two for tonight, email and phone call.

2680
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,000
But no, we love hearing from you. What's up, YYR?

2681
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Well...

2682
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Oh, yeah, that's right. My mind just totally blanked out.

2683
02:23:52,000 --> 02:24:02,000
I've been kind of burning the candle at both ends and living, breathing, trying to fix all the little problems with the game.

2684
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Actually, JD has been a humongous help.

2685
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,000
He pointed out a couple of bugs I don't think I would have found otherwise,

2686
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:19,000
including the fact that my entire routine to figure out the aspect ratio of your screen and adjust accordingly,

2687
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I broke it and I didn't even notice until he pointed it out.

2688
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Wow, gold star for you, JD.

2689
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Honestly, I've been playing the game, and besides the alt-tab thing, which you already knew about,

2690
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,000
and I didn't get to test your workaround, but besides the stuff you already knew about,

2691
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I was really not finding stuff, so good job, JD, who found new stuff in there.

2692
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Well, actually, it's pretty funny because the alt-tab crash, I think it has something to do with the resolution,

2693
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:57,000
and JD's fix had to do with resolution, so I just tried this new build in Steam and I couldn't alt-tab crash it,

2694
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:00,000
so I'm wondering if it maybe is fixed now.

2695
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
But he's not going to be able to test for an hour and a half because he's at a friend's place right now.

2696
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Yes, it's Star Trek Discovery finale night. It's a very big deal, so yes, that's what's going on.

2697
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Well, now I feel bad for having interrupted him.

2698
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:15,000
No, no, no, no, no, I'm sure he's fine.

2699
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:21,000
But yeah, no, but you know what, I know making a game is hard and selling it is even harder.

2700
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Well, actually, I shouldn't say that. Making a game, making some games are really easy.

2701
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Making a game in ZZT and Twine and stuff with all the tools that are out there, easy.

2702
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:37,000
But making something that other people want to buy, that's where it gets hard.

2703
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:42,000
So, you know, props to you for these late nights, and I really, really hope you do see success with this game.

2704
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I understand you're not going to be a multimillionaire that ends up buying Beyonce's house from a game like Super Multitasking,

2705
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:54,000
but I do hope it gets people to recognize your talent, if nothing else.

2706
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
I do hope it gets people to take you seriously.

2707
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I hope you get everything I could never get through this podcast, YYR.

2708
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Well, you know what, like I've always said, if this does wind up becoming big and then people are all of a sudden lining up to try to interview me,

2709
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:17,000
I'm going to be like, okay, well, okay, so the game's coming out on a Friday, right?

2710
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Right.

2711
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:27,000
So if everyone is all of a sudden lining up to interview me, I'll be like, okay, well, I'll start entertaining those requests on Monday,

2712
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:37,000
but Sunday night, I'm doing an exclusive interview with Orange Lounge Radio, the longest running podcast about video games on the internet,

2713
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:40,000
and not a thing is going to change that.

2714
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
And that loyalty, that loyalty means a lot to me, my friends.

2715
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:50,000
And hey, if I bring in a whole bunch of new listeners, that's not a bad thing, right?

2716
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I appreciate that, but at the same time, I don't want to set false expectations either.

2717
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I get really excited about Super Multitasking, I think it could be a success, but you know what?

2718
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,000
I thought this show would be a bigger success.

2719
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Hey, you did just get an email from a very long time listener.

2720
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:10,000
You're right, and I don't ever want to make it sound like this show wasn't a success.

2721
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:16,000
If it wasn't, I wouldn't be doing it, but the reality is, you're not hearing ads for Squatty Potty for a reason.

2722
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Oh, and actually, you know what? I missed the beginning segment of the show.

2723
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:28,000
We were visiting my folks today, and I was still on my way home, but you didn't happen to mention KAC at all, did you?

2724
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:32,000
KAC, is that one of the DDR championships that happened?

2725
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Konami Arcade Champion.

2726
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:40,000
We, like, tangentially mentioned it happened, but we didn't get into details, so if you'd like to bring up details, go for it.

2727
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Well, you know what? To spoil the details, I think would be detrimental to anyone who would watch it.

2728
02:27:49,000 --> 02:28:02,000
So I would very strongly recommend, if you're into the DDR scene at all, and if you want to see some really, really great competition,

2729
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I would definitely recommend that you go to, actually, really, the easiest way to say this would be if you go to ddrcommunity.com.

2730
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:20,000
I mean, they'll probably spoil who won on the front page, but if you scroll down just a little bit, you'll get all the links to watch everything that happened.

2731
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:28,000
And, I mean, really, just knowing the result is not going to spoil your enjoyment of just watching how everything went down,

2732
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:37,000
and also the quality that went into the production. Like, they did a great job. They did, like, you know how, you know, before a wrestling match or whatever,

2733
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:47,000
they always do, like, interviews, and it's like, oh yeah, I'm going to take this person down. They did all that with all the contestants for KAC also,

2734
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:53,000
so it was pretty cool to watch. Like, they had the WWE promo videos down pat. Like, it was pretty cool.

2735
02:28:53,000 --> 02:29:01,000
That's funny. Okay, I like that. I like that. I do want to just clarify an earlier statement, because the Rob D in chat makes a great point over at live.vognetwork.com,

2736
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:07,000
saying, this show is a success for the camaraderie and community it's generated. And you know what, buddy, you're absolutely right.

2737
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Don't think I don't, you know, even though I like to make tongue-in-cheek jokes, like, if you can't make fun of yourself, who can you make fun of?

2738
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:21,000
But it's one of those things where it's like, it hasn't been the money that's motivated us for 16 years, let me tell you that.

2739
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:28,000
But take it as a compliment that this show has lasted for 16 years without that, and I hope everybody understands what I mean by that.

2740
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:34,000
So, anyway. Oh, the other thing I was going to say with that, it's funny, because you bringing up the Konami Championships and saying all that,

2741
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:42,000
it made me think of the DDR freestyle tournament that happened recently, which I can say, I don't think I'm stepping out of line by saying,

2742
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:49,000
they are working on what's next. It's not going to. Freestyle will continue. But I don't have any specifics beyond that.

2743
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I'll be lucky if I can get them to do the OLR exclusive, like YYR does with me, gives me the exclusive.

2744
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Anyway, but I want to say this, because I don't think Loki's heard this. Did you know there was an earnings call with Round 1, the popular, you know, chain that does,

2745
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:12,000
there was an earnings call, and they talked about, because this is on front page of Imani Style, as well as some other sites, they talked about what the future holds for Round 1.

2746
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:19,000
They are opening a brand new Round 1 in Hayward later this year. So the Bay Area is going to get another Round 1, which is pretty cool.

2747
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:24,000
And in the fourth quarter of 2019, Roseville confirmed getting a Round 1 entertainer.

2748
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Nice.

2749
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Right at the, they say it's at the Galleria, which I don't, I'm like, what closed?

2750
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Where?

2751
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yeah, that's my question. I'm like, where? But then I'm thinking across the street from the Galleria, they've had that empty furniture store for years,

2752
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:40,000
so they do the haunted houses and all that stuff. I would bet that's where they put it.

2753
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Huh.

2754
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Sweet.

2755
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Well, their patterns thus far have been, you know, low rent in a mall, like a mall in a low rent area, so.

2756
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Yeah, yeah, the Hayward one.

2757
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Well, I've got a mall in a low rent area just down the street from my house.

2758
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Sunrise mall?

2759
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Sunrise mall, hey, let's bulldoze all the stores, let's just turn the whole thing into a Round 1.

2760
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,000
They're going to turn that mall into an arena, it's doing so bad.

2761
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:10,000
That happened in Sacramento, by the way. Our downtown mall was so bad, they bulldozed it, and that's what the Sacramento Kings played out.

2762
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
It's a pretty nice mall, too.

2763
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:15,000
It was when they first opened it, but did you go there in the past couple years it was open?

2764
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,000
No.

2765
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Where, like, nothing was open and you'd be walking through just these empty halls, and then there'd just be a random TCBY in the middle of it?

2766
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
I went there when they had BattleTech.

2767
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:31,000
So, ooh, apparently Dark Tetsuya did not know that news. Yeah, go check out Bomani Style DT.

2768
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:38,000
And there's some other ones they announced, too. I mean, there's a few in California, which you would expect, but there's some in other parts of the nation as well.

2769
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I think in the Ohio area there was one that was opening, so go check it out.

2770
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Yeah, they're really expanding all over.

2771
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Yeah, awesome news. Well, while we are, I'm going to be doing super multitasking after the show tonight.

2772
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:53,000
So, I imagine I'm not the first to stream it, but I've got to be one of the first, right?

2773
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:02,000
You know what? I sent codes to a few people on a message board, and they said they would be looking forward to streaming it.

2774
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:08,000
But, to be honest, I've been so busy, I don't know if anyone's streamed it yet or what.

2775
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:14,000
So, because the show is ending a little bit early tonight, I will actually be able to tune in for a bit.

2776
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:18,000
So, you will be the first person that I watch stream it.

2777
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I'll fucking take it. There we go! Live with the creator.

2778
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Alright, and that'll be coming right up here. I'm going to wrap things up here pretty soon.

2779
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:31,000
So, while we are on that note, I'm going to let you go, and I am going to wish you luck with the game that is out February 23rd.

2780
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:39,000
And I'm usually not such a commercial whore for products, but those of you that have been listening to OLR for a long time know that, like,

2781
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I like to think we've personally had a hand in pushing this game to make YYR, like, fucking motivate him to do it.

2782
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,000
So, now if only it could just push me into making a game.

2783
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
I'll try. I'll try.

2784
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I'll tell you what I've been doing lately. I've been down this rabbit hole of trying to hack arcade DDR mixes to add new songs to them.

2785
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:06,000
So, there is a little piece of this baby that I do think, I do feel like we owe a little bit to.

2786
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,000
So, that's why I want to see you do well.

2787
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Thank you. Thank you. And, Loki, seriously, like, just throw Stepmania on it if you want to add songs.

2788
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:20,000
It's just going to be so much easier, and it's going to save you so much time.

2789
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I know, but I like the challenge.

2790
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:31,000
You just, you don't know him like I do. He's just, it's just, he, sometimes he has to do it the hard way to say he fucking did it the hard way.

2791
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
He's a guy like that.

2792
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:39,000
I understand, yeah, I have all the stuff that puts Stepmania on there. I have all the hardware and everything I need to do that.

2793
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I just, I want to try it this way, because it hasn't been done yet.

2794
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Alright. Alrighty. Cool. Well, enjoy.

2795
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Alright, my friend, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy.

2796
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Have a great week, you guys.

2797
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
You too. Bye.

2798
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Yep. Bye bye.

2799
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Okay, I am going to close up the Skypline on that note. Sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always send us an email.

2800
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

2801
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:05,000
But I think with that, if there are no last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

2802
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:11,000
But I want to thank all you guys for downloading the show and checking it out this week or being here live to listen, whatever the case may be.

2803
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:18,000
I know some of you all skipped the 12 hour delayed Olympics footage to come out and listen to the show tonight, so I appreciate that. Thank you.

2804
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:25,000
And yeah, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play.

2805
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.

2806
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:39,000
So tell a friend or two or fifteen about the show. We appreciate it. We appreciate the loyalty, just like YYR has for us.

2807
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Alright. We're going to get final thoughts, and then I think we're out of here for the night. So, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2808
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I do actually need to work on a game. I've been thinking about it lately because I've been wasting a lot of time with this whole DDR stuff.

2809
02:34:51,000 --> 02:35:01,000
And it's actually kind of fascinating because there are people that have managed on the PlayStation 2 versions to swap songs out and do the music and stuff.

2810
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:09,000
And apparently format-wise, it's pretty similar. It's just the tools that do it for PlayStation 1 stuff and a lot of that.

2811
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:15,000
It's ironic. I had it on my old hard drive, and then I was copying stuff over from my old hard drive to my new hard drive.

2812
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:21,000
I'm like, I don't need that. And I deleted it. And immediately after I deleted it, I'm like, ah crap, I did need that.

2813
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:32,000
So, it's alright. But the other day I dumped, because apparently I own most of the arcade discs from the pre-Extreme stuff.

2814
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:38,000
So, I dumped all those onto my computer to take a look at them. But I'm curious to see.

2815
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Because I know that they've hacked in Marvelous ratings in rankings into Extreme for the arcade.

2816
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,000
So, if that's possible, then what else is possible is what I want to know.

2817
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Anything is possible.

2818
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Exactly. Anything is possible.

2819
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
That was a long final thought. Jesus, alright.

2820
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Sorry.

2821
02:35:53,000 --> 02:36:00,000
That's okay. My final thought is I think Marissa is going to win Celebrity Big Brother because I'm trash.

2822
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Goodnight everybody. We'll see you in seven days for another OLR. Goodnight.

2823
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
But you know they were all still true.

2824
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
See you next week.

2825
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Thanks for watching!
