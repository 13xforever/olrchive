0	17760	This week Death Stranding News continues its slow trickle as the latest cast members
17760	20280	have been announced, inadvertent as it may have been.
20280	23800	Once the news is out it's near impossible to take back, so let's press on with episode
23800	27000	720 of tonight's show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	33800	Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet,
33800	36680	welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36680	45440	It is Orange Lounge Radio for tonight, February the 25th, 2018, episode number 720 of our
45440	46440	show.
46440	50640	We are now an HD show, we are 720 episodes wide.
50640	51640	There you go.
51640	56640	Anyway, hi I'm Rob Roberts and you can of course hear me on this show every week talking
56640	60940	about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts over there,
60940	62560	DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
62560	68520	I was regaling the chat room about the time that was you, me, Chris, and Megzi staying
68520	75240	at a hotel and we decided to wake you up with loud lesbian porn and you slept through it.
75240	76680	What a way to start the show.
76680	78440	Okay, here's the thing though.
78440	79440	First off, I miss those two.
79440	80440	I really do.
80440	81720	They were a lot of fun to have on the show.
81720	83600	For those that don't know, they moved far away.
83600	86600	They moved to a far away distant land called Wisconsin.
86600	87600	Wisconsin.
87600	91800	So, unfortunately it's hard to get them on the show anymore, but here's the thing.
91800	95200	I used to live right next to train tracks.
95200	99260	When I went to school in Chico, California, I lived on this apartment complex that was
99260	100920	right next to the railroad tracks.
100920	103400	Was it the wrong side or the right side?
103400	104560	One way to find out.
104560	109000	So anyway, the train would just come roaring through and they blew the horn and everything.
109000	110520	So I would have to sleep through that.
110520	116600	So because of that, I sleep through a lot, but the one thing, so you can do whatever
116600	117800	porny noises you want.
117800	118960	It's not going to wake me up.
118960	123240	But the one thing that does wake me up without fail, Mr. Smoosh snoring in my ear.
123240	124240	Yeah.
124240	125240	Go figure.
125240	128860	And that's Mr. Smoosh is the cat if you weren't already aware.
128860	131160	Also say hello, joining us every week to Techmaster Loki.
131160	132160	Hello.
132160	133160	How are you, Loki?
133160	134160	I'm good.
134160	135160	Good.
135160	136160	Awesome.
136160	138520	What'd you bring for the show tonight for dinner for the folks that like to play the
138520	139800	OLR food betting game?
139800	148360	Oh, I just got tacos from a place called Cafe Rio that has a Barbacoa pork tacos.
148360	153440	So it's like kind of like flavored and stuff, but their rice like that they make on the
153440	154440	side though.
154440	157640	Like, I don't know if they know how to cook rice because it's just like, I don't know
157640	159680	if it's actually cooked.
159680	160680	It's very crunchy.
160680	161680	Oh yeah.
161680	162680	Oh yeah.
162680	163680	I don't like no.
163680	164680	Sounds like it's reconstituted.
164680	167120	It's like, do you not know how to cook rice long enough?
167120	170000	Rice is very important in the Mexican.
170000	171000	It's not my dinner.
171000	172000	I ate it anyways.
172000	173000	But yeah.
173000	174000	What?
174000	175000	No.
175000	176000	I was like, is not my dinner equally important?
176000	179400	You know, your dinner is important, but we were talking about lesbian porn.
179400	180400	Oh yeah.
180400	181400	That is true.
181400	182400	I don't know.
182400	187040	I could smell those tacos when I stepped into the room and I was like, oh my God, that smells
187040	188040	amazing.
188040	193240	Let's go to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com where of course we do tape live every Sunday
193240	197480	night, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
197480	201920	And you live chatters are here to help us through the show and offer your commentary
201920	203880	because it's not just about us here at OLR.
203880	207400	It's about all the gamers, including those of you in chat and those of you on the Skype
207400	211840	line a little later on at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
211840	214540	So I'm not alone in my loud noise stuff.
214540	219760	Brad from pod culture in chat saying I used to live on the Ohio river, used to have loud
219760	221800	barges go through in the wee hours.
221800	222800	Yikes.
222800	228240	I don't know if like a party boat came through who, uh, let's see, uh, Dr. Ken, hi Dr. Kim
228240	229520	from starboard power coupling.
229520	232160	Shout out says, grats OLR with a heart.
232160	233160	Thank you.
233160	237900	I don't, I didn't think anything was particularly notable about seven 20, but I guess that means
237900	240320	we've gone around the sun twice.
240320	241320	Right.
241320	242320	Is that what that means?
242320	243320	I reckon close close.
243320	246080	No, cause three 65 and actually seven 30.
246080	247080	Math is not my strong suit.
247080	251880	Uh, I'm just sure on the podcast to look pretty.
251960	254800	Uh, and this is two and a hundred, Matt says taco every day.
254800	255800	I agree with that.
255800	256800	You don't have to.
256800	257800	Those are good.
257800	258800	You don't have to wait for Tuesday for tacos.
258800	259800	Absolutely not.
259800	265720	I didn't have enough time to get a poke again, so, uh, that's, that's the new trendy thing,
265720	266720	huh?
266720	267720	I don't, I don't.
267720	272920	It's just, it's like if you want, if you want sushi, but you don't want it in sushi form,
272920	278840	you just want to kind of just disassemble poke to me is like sushi inside out, except
278840	285080	that there was, you can already get chirashi, which is basically sushi on top of sushi rice
285080	286880	in a bowl.
286880	289280	Yo dog, I heard you like sushi.
289280	290800	It's sashimi on the rice.
290800	291800	Okay.
291800	292800	That's delicious.
292800	294840	I don't dislike poke by any means.
294840	298760	In fact, funny, when I had the pokey stop podcast show, like there was a pokey place
298760	302120	that wanted to like work together and so I got to try some of their poke and it was really
302120	303120	good.
303120	307560	Um, but I just, you know, I don't know, like I feel like when I'm in the mood, I not a
307560	310120	big fish person, but I will eat sushi.
310120	312480	So if I get in the mood for sushi, I'm going to have sushi.
312480	314640	I've never had poke.
314640	315640	Not sushi in a bowl.
315640	316640	I don't really like sushi.
316640	319480	I normally will have like a, well, I guess it's sort of sushi.
319480	323840	It's a McGrew, which is basically tuna draped over some rice.
323840	324840	Oh sure.
324840	328520	It's basically you just chop that up and we got poke now.
328520	329520	It's very basic.
329520	330520	You like your nigiri.
330520	331520	Sashimi.
331520	332520	Yes.
332520	333520	Yeah.
333520	336360	Well, because I can't eat as much rice as I used to, pretty much all I get anymore is
336360	342000	sashimi or my new standby, which is not sushi at all, but agarashidofu.
342000	344120	I love it.
344120	345120	So good.
345120	346120	It's what I ate that night.
346120	348960	I was gonna say that night cause we went out after OLR once to go get food.
348960	352600	I remember it was like really late and one of the, there's a sushi bar around here open
352600	354760	till past midnight or till midnight.
354760	359720	So we were just mad that the last two places I went to had no Saba, the mackerel, which
359720	364760	is like my favorite cause it is the fishiest smelliest tastiest of all fishes.
364760	365760	So bad.
365760	366760	All right.
366760	367760	Anyway, believe it or not, it's not a food podcast.
367760	369360	It's a video game podcast.
369360	372320	So let's get into some gaming discussion and I want to kick this off.
372320	376520	Loki, I'll kick it to you if you want to, uh, with some E3 news cause believe it or
376520	382220	not, we're staring down what, four months I think about till E3 actually probably less
382220	386080	than that cause E3 is in like early June, so about three and a half months till E3.
386080	388040	We know the public tickets went on sale.
388040	389040	Yeah.
389040	391120	Um, I don't, I hadn't heard if they sold out or not.
391120	394200	Um, I know last time it took them a little while to sell out.
394200	401280	But E3 in the year 2018, very different from E3 when the show first started in 2002.
401280	404720	And I think what the first show we all went to was 2004, right?
404720	407600	So E3 is very different now than it was then.
407600	411440	So tell us a little bit about what's, uh, what's going to be going on at E3 this year,
411440	412440	Loki.
412440	416280	Well, pretty much the same thing as the last few years, EA is not going to E3.
416280	419640	They're doing their own thing just outside of E3.
419640	425160	Um, so they're going to have their own event where they can try out the new battlefield
425160	432120	game that they're supposed to be showing off and of course Anthem.
432120	433120	And yeah.
433120	437720	And then you, you can go check that out and that's between June 9th and 11th at the Hollywood
437720	438720	Palladium.
438720	441200	Sports, sports, and more sports as well.
441200	442200	I'm sure with EA.
442200	449120	You can try, try the Madden's and the FIFA's and the NHL's and all the EA Sports as well,
449120	452080	which I'm not, I'm not poo-pooing those games.
452080	454160	They're huge moneymakers, cash cows for EA.
454160	459740	They've probably made EA the big company that it is, but you know, um, I, I think here's
459740	460740	the thing.
460740	465160	I think people kind of know what to expect out of a FIFA game, out of a Madden game.
465160	467060	Now granted, they sometimes do new modes.
467060	470400	They do things that will kind of throw a curve ball in the formula, but generally, you know,
470400	474560	you're going to get a football game, either British rules or American rules in those two
474560	475560	series.
475560	476560	Right.
476720	479600	What you don't know what you're going to get right now is Anthem, right?
479600	481040	Anthem's a big wild card.
481040	485160	I know those of us that have been long-time Bioware supporters, well, I should, some of
485160	488920	us, not all of us, but Dark Soccer and I are on the side of, we're a little salty.
488920	495240	I'm not exactly ready to turn cartwheels for Anthem, um, because I kind of feel like EA
495240	498920	gave the finger to the Mass Effect series in a really nasty way.
498920	504880	And so, um, especially hearing that Anthem has been delayed, but it will come out in
504880	505880	this fiscal year.
506000	512560	I'm already worried for Anthem, but I suppose EA3 is the place to prove me wrong and show
512560	516400	me what a kick-ass game Anthem might be.
516400	517840	You know what Anthem better be?
517840	519600	Another Mass Effect.
519600	520600	In the Mass Effect universe.
520600	523760	It's just Mass Effect Anthem.
523760	529960	So you want, you want basically, was it the Volition version of, no it wasn't the Volition
529960	534760	version, it was, um, I can't even, see, my mind has already blocked out their terrible
534760	537560	game that they released, so I'm not even going to try to reference that.
537560	541400	Basically, hopefully, they're not going to implement too much Mass Effect, make it its
541400	542400	own thing.
542400	545080	I think it's going to be more Destiny, though, than anything.
545080	548280	I would forget, well Destiny's not EA, Destiny's Activision.
548280	549280	I understand.
549280	554040	I understand it's Activision, but they want a piece of that money.
554040	555040	I get it.
555040	556040	I get it.
556040	560840	Um, I would, I would forgive EA quite a bit if they would just give us the fucking Mass
560840	562680	Effect remaster already.
562680	568440	Like, I know EA is really skittish about remastering their games, however, I'm sure
568440	572360	some of you have heard, and we have a news story coming out later, looks like EA's changed
572360	577640	their mind on that a little bit, so, it's possible, who knows.
577640	581400	Well let me- Other than that, all we have are mods, which,
581400	589000	by the way, Mass Effect 3 high-res mods look really good, so it should be fucking easy.
589720	597240	Uh, let's see, go into our chat at live.vognetwork.com, um, let's see, uh, sg100matt says Mass Effect
597240	598840	Kart Anthem Edition.
598840	605240	Uh, let's see, uh, let's see- I gave two fingers up for that.
605240	609000	Also, uh, bobbyblackwool says Anthem is just a Mass Effect game and they'll name it Mass
609000	611560	Effect at the very end, who knows, who knows.
611560	617560	Uh, megamanx400 suggests Mass Effect Trilogy Definitive Edition for Switch.
617560	618560	Let's go.
619120	621680	So when he's saying Anthem is the- You know why?
621680	622720	I only play console.
622720	626480	I want a Definitive Edition also released for- But Switch is a console.
626480	628480	I mean not console, I mean PC.
628480	631200	Oh, so whatever they do needs to also be on PC.
631200	633600	And I want a Mac version, so that I can play it on my Mac.
634320	635600	Our list of demands.
635600	640880	So, um, so basically bobby's saying the Anthem should be like, you know, Metal Gear Solid
640880	645280	5, the Phantom Pains, where it's gonna be, what, Mass Effect 4 Anthem?
645280	646400	The Phantom good game.
646400	655440	Yes, it was much better than some other shit that certain Konami companies decided to put
655440	658320	out recently that, we can do this ourselves!
659040	659760	No, we can't!
660640	664640	Let me back up, let me back up a little bit, and, and, uh, MegamanX clarifying his, uh,
664640	669440	dream statement there saying, well, it would obviously come out for all, not just Switch,
669440	670720	but doesn't want Switch to get left out.
671440	675600	Um, let me ask this question, a little, little bit of a different question, you know, enough
675600	680640	about Anthem, we'll, we'll see more in the coming months at E3.
680640	685520	But, you know, I mentioned when we started this discussion is that E3's changed a lot
685520	686720	in the past few years.
686720	690640	And I think the show that it's become is not the show that we remember.
690640	696880	Now, granted, there might be a question if E3 could ever go back to the show that we
696880	697520	remember.
697520	704960	I mean, keep in mind, when we were going to E3 in 2004, 2005, uh, we didn't have the internet
704960	708000	as prolific with video as it is now.
708000	714800	I mean, when this, when this show first started on live 365, we were dial-up friendly radio,
714800	715120	right?
715760	717760	Anyone remember dial-up modems?
717760	719360	They were still a thing in 2002.
719360	722800	That was right around the, that was right around the years where that was starting to
722800	723280	change.
723280	727280	Like, you know, DSL, I think was a big thing a lot of people had, and then, you know, cable
727280	728560	really came in a few years later.
728560	732960	But anyway, I digress a little bit, but my point is, is that, you know, a lot of the
732960	737520	experience that we were getting at E3 some time ago, you just go on to Twitch, you go
737520	742560	on to IGN, you go on to YouTube, you're seeing a lot of the stuff that you used to have to
742560	746000	wait in line, get a ticket, go into theater to go see.
746000	748000	So let me ask you guys this.
748000	754240	If you were in charge, and I open this up to chat as well, and reasonably please, if
754240	758400	you were in charge of E3 now, what would you do?
758400	760960	What would be the show that you would do?
760960	765120	Do you think that the ESA, do you think they're doing the right thing right now?
765120	767200	Or how would you run E3?
767200	771840	You know, and, you know, make it reasonable, but at the same time, I'm not going to draw
771840	773120	many more boundaries on it.
773120	778320	You know, we won't, we will assume that money is not a factor in things like that.
778320	779200	Jamie, I'll start with you.
779200	781360	What would you, how would you run E3 if you were the boss?
781360	784240	I would seriously seriously want to put it back to like it was the first year I went.
784800	790400	And I want to see more, the whole thing for me was that Cantia Hall, you know?
791040	795440	It was seeing the indie developers, the smaller developers, and having, I loved the little
795440	796960	video game museum that they'd have there.
796960	800960	It was something that's like, yes, here's the future over here, but here's also where
800960	802080	we came from.
802080	806480	And I loved having, like, seeing the dev units for older systems.
807120	811680	And I loved going in and trying new technology that even if it wasn't going to come out,
811680	815120	you know, like that one sphere thing, you know, where you put your hand on it and it
815120	816000	gave you the feedback.
816560	819040	Like you could touch what was in the game through that thing.
819040	819920	That was cool.
819920	823600	And it was seeing just the innovations that were coming out there.
823600	827440	I'd really like a lot of focus on the innovators, you know?
827440	829360	And yeah, the swag was great.
829360	834720	I mean, I have a few things to this day I still use, you know, but in the long run,
834720	840560	you know, the big thing was the going and seeing and the tactile part of, you know,
840560	844720	the experience, getting to put your hands on new, new things.
844720	847040	And of course, sitting in a skyline wasn't that bad.
847040	851040	That year they had the skyline there at the whatever the racing thing was.
851040	851440	Oh, yeah.
852640	853280	That was fun.
853280	855360	I think that's great that you call out Kensha Hall.
855360	858160	I mean, that was from the earlier years of E3.
858160	862320	You know, that was a lot of the especially like foreign developers really seem to be
862320	863040	in that area.
863920	867920	You know, things that folks from this show might remember when we talked about dance
867920	871760	based games, like In the Groove was shown there.
871760	877440	Red Octane probably showed the Guitar Hero thing first in Kensha Hall before that really
877440	878320	blew up.
878320	883280	It's also where you could like go to the Natsume booth, you know, some of the other,
883920	887920	I would say, like medium developers overseas, you know?
887920	890720	But it was also, was it in Kensha Hall?
890720	892480	No, it might have been in one of the bigger ones.
892480	896720	They had like that dragon flying game where you have to get and flap your arms with it.
896720	898160	I don't even know if I played that.
898160	904000	But I liked just seeing the stuff like that, the interactivity, you know, again, technology
904000	909840	that may not even come out anytime soon, but you get to see it sort of nascent, you know,
909840	910560	version of it.
911280	915920	Let me get to some comments in chat because some great discussion in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
915920	919920	Bobby Blackwolf says, the problem is I fully believe that the gaming industry needs an
919920	921520	expo for the industry.
921520	925200	I know consumers would be upset because they feel they are the most important part of the
925200	929040	industry, but every other industry in the world has a trade show for just themselves.
929040	932880	But the gaming industry is special and that the consumers feel more connected to the industry
932880	934960	more so than you see in other industries.
934960	938640	There are still trade shows and expos that I go to that aren't gaming, that have all
938640	941440	the swag and the types of stuff that you saw at early E3s.
941440	945680	But consumers of business software don't necessarily want to go to a business software trade show
945680	946640	for industry people.
948240	952160	JD in chat says, I would cancel E3 and make it GamerX instead.
952800	953280	I do miss GamerX.
953280	954880	We need GamerX to come back.
955760	963040	MegamanX400 says, I would like to see more developers launch an online E3 on their consoles.
963040	968000	For example, whatever games are being featured at E3, you can download a time-limited demo
968000	972240	at home and try it out for a fee most likely, somewhat of a virtual pass.
972240	977600	I love that idea because that's a really good idea is that embrace the online.
977600	980720	Doesn't Blizzcon do that to an extent?
980720	981360	To an extent.
981360	983600	I mean, they have their DirecTV coverage that they sell.
984320	986160	They don't really let you play demos.
986160	990240	But I remember back in the early days of the Xbox, you could download the same demos they
990240	991040	were doing.
991040	993840	That was a big thing that they had online.
993840	998320	The only thing is, though, and I think where game companies get a little cautious is that
998320	1002080	people will make up their mind on the games based on said demos.
1002800	1005760	And I think that might be why you don't see it as much anymore.
1005760	1009360	But maybe game companies should really consider doing that for titles that are going to be
1009360	1011840	coming out in the next couple months anyway.
1012240	1018400	I think that should be something they should do because we are looking at a more year-round
1018400	1019520	release for games.
1019520	1021520	It's not just the fall anymore.
1021520	1022880	Is fall the most important?
1022880	1024080	Sure, it still is.
1024080	1028400	But you see games released in January, February, all times throughout the year that still succeed.
1028400	1030640	And I think we are moving to a more global calendar.
1030640	1032000	It's just like movies.
1032000	1035760	Movies used to be summer, summer, summer, and the holiday break.
1035760	1043040	But now Black Panther came out in March and that's what it's like the fifth highest grossing.
1045440	1046960	Clearly I need a calendar.
1046960	1047460	Thank you.
1048640	1052880	It came out in February, which was not, you know, you don't think big block releases in
1052880	1053840	February, right?
1053840	1054400	And what?
1054400	1057520	Fifth highest grossing opening movie of all time, right?
1057520	1058880	So you don't have to.
1058880	1059680	Was it fifth?
1059680	1061040	But it's up there.
1061040	1063200	We know that movie made a shit ton of money, right?
1064000	1066320	That was the official figure actually was shit ton of money.
1066880	1069680	Going to chat for some more comments at live.vognetwork.com.
1070480	1072480	Oh, and great comment by Bobby.
1072480	1074400	Who the hell releases a console in March?
1075200	1075680	Good point.
1075680	1078880	Maybe that's why I was thinking Nintendo, because they've done it a few times already.
1078880	1080000	That was the tongue in cheek joke.
1081600	1082000	Dungeon.
1082000	1085040	Who the hell releases a console with no online support?
1085040	1086080	Nintendo.
1086080	1087280	Who succeeded anyway.
1088320	1092720	Dungeon Buster says E3 used to be focused exclusively on industry members from retail
1092800	1094080	to corporate shareholders.
1094080	1098080	Now it needs to cater to a new audience to stay relevant, which is going to change that
1098080	1098580	dynamic.
1099200	1102160	So 200 Matt says, step one, make the holodeck.
1102160	1106000	Step two, make an E3 holodeck where there are no lines and people can play what they
1106000	1106480	want.
1106480	1108160	Step three, charge money for it.
1108160	1109440	Step four, profit.
1110080	1111840	Are you sure you're not Franky?
1112960	1114960	Since you said the holodeck, we may as well go there.
1114960	1116560	Loki, your dream E3.
1116560	1118160	What would you do if you were inside?
1118160	1119920	I mean, honestly, wow.
1120400	1122640	It's just it's take it out back.
1122640	1126400	Well, no, it's just because it's everybody's doing their own thing anyways.
1126400	1131040	And it's just, I think, easier to get access to stuff when it's split up like at different
1131040	1133840	events instead of having all one thing.
1133840	1137280	E3, I remember when you go there, it's very chaotic.
1137280	1142320	And I feel that staying home, you actually see a lot more than you do at the show.
1142320	1144480	And I know for like a lot of people have never gone.
1144480	1147920	You know, it's probably pretty exciting to be like, you know, part of the public to go
1147920	1149760	there and experience that.
1149760	1151520	But it gets old fast.
1152080	1159200	And I just can't imagine now that it would be that exciting to go to E3 and check out
1159200	1159680	all that stuff.
1159680	1161440	It's just I don't know.
1162960	1168800	I can I can enjoy it just fine on TV or streaming and stuff and check it out.
1168800	1172640	I do wish they used to do more demos and stuff like they used to do.
1172640	1177840	But I understand that that's a big strain on developers to actually put out a demo that's
1177840	1179680	not running on test hardware and stuff.
1179680	1181600	And it's that's hard enough.
1182160	1184640	So I'll just accept.
1185200	1188480	Just let it let it go wherever the way it is.
1188480	1192400	Honestly, you know, I don't want to reward the USA any more than I have to being that
1192400	1195840	they're defending these companies with the practices that they're doing now.
1195840	1197680	And they've got their backs for that.
1197680	1201280	So it's not like they have the consumer in mind anyways when it comes to a lot of this
1201280	1201600	stuff.
1201600	1204720	They're clearly signing with developers.
1204720	1205520	So just let die.
1206080	1210880	Let them do whatever they think needs to make the show successful.
1210880	1213440	But inevitably, it's just going to just going to die.
1213440	1215520	A harsh but realistic answer from Loki.
1215520	1220000	But let me let me poke you on this point, though, because Bobby said that, you know,
1220800	1226240	the gaming industry needs a trade show and you've been on the very trade side of things.
1226240	1229920	Some people don't remember, but you used to work in video game distribution.
1229920	1235360	So you've been to E3, not as an OLR host, but in the shoes of a video game distributor.
1236160	1239840	Doesn't the gaming industry still need something like that that caters to that crowd?
1240400	1241280	Not necessarily.
1241280	1245440	That's more of like they'll go and make deals about different things, you know, especially
1245440	1249280	upcoming titles, trying to secure allocations and stuff like that.
1249280	1253760	But they have other shows that they go do that at that are specifically for trade.
1253760	1258720	Like, for example, they have Destination PlayStation, which is a strictly industry
1258720	1260480	event that it's all Sony.
1260480	1262560	They have the Xbox.
1262560	1267200	I don't remember the Xbox one's called, but they have some Microsoft Xbox show that's
1267200	1268560	along the lines of that as well.
1268560	1270320	That's also just industry.
1270320	1271840	Nintendo doesn't fucking do anything.
1271840	1272320	They don't care.
1272320	1273280	They play by their own rules.
1273280	1275760	But those two companies do that.
1275760	1280880	And a lot of the other people, because you have reps that you're talking with, they come
1280880	1283040	out to your company and they make deals as well.
1283040	1285280	You don't necessarily need to do that at E3.
1285280	1286560	It's just it's exciting.
1286560	1289600	E3, all the stuff is announcing like new consoles are announcing stuff.
1289600	1293760	It's like, oh, OK, let's secure our allocations and sit down and talk with these people that
1293760	1298240	we haven't met with in a while to discuss what we're going to do to make sure that we're
1298240	1301120	getting enough, you know, enough product in for these things.
1301120	1307040	But then again, independent stores are kind of dying anyways because these companies don't
1307040	1307600	fucking care.
1307600	1313120	They want to do a, you know, a preorder bonus with GameStop or Walmart or Target or Best
1313120	1314880	Buy and they're going to Amazon.
1314880	1319280	They're going to do deal with those companies and fuck everybody else.
1319840	1322960	I mean, honestly, that's kind of the way they treat everybody.
1322960	1327680	So, yeah, I don't think I don't think it's necessary.
1327680	1328800	They have those events.
1328800	1329360	That's what I'm saying.
1329360	1334320	It's like just because you haven't heard of them because not a lot of news leaks out from
1334320	1336880	them doesn't mean that they don't exist.
1336880	1341840	It's just there's a lot of shows out there already available and there's this PAX.
1341840	1345280	And I mean, there's plenty of shows to see games.
1345280	1349360	Bobby Blackwell points out GDC is probably a better industry trade show.
1349360	1352240	Where the people who make the games also get together to learn.
1352880	1357040	Sia Tabiri in chat says if it's becoming more and more like a show than a trade show, why
1357040	1361600	not start a new trade show and break off of E3 to be more like a convention, especially
1361600	1364880	if E3 is being seen as catering increasingly to the general public.
1366880	1368160	These are all good questions.
1368160	1369440	Let me get into my answer to this.
1369440	1371760	So how I would envision E3.
1371760	1377520	First off, I just want to say I really like what Delvin Mega Man X 400 suggested in chat.
1378400	1383440	The whole like online experience so that people that are playing the home game have something
1383440	1384720	to do.
1384720	1390800	And I think that's like getting there because you see like the press conferences or something
1390800	1392320	you can kind of watch throughout the day.
1393040	1398560	You see these companies like Jeff Keeley doing stuff with his online networks and IGN and
1398560	1401920	so forth building these 24-7 experiences out of it.
1401920	1406160	It would be nice to see something maybe of an official capacity, but maybe they don't
1406160	1407600	need it because they have these other companies.
1407600	1411520	But I like the idea of some of E3 being a little bit more of an online experience for
1411520	1412640	people around the world.
1412640	1414640	So everybody gets excited about E3.
1414640	1416400	Well remember like PT?
1416960	1417760	Remember when that was?
1417760	1419840	Oh yeah, but that was Tokyo Game Show, wasn't it?
1419840	1421040	I think that came out of Tokyo Game Show.
1421040	1424160	I don't remember, but still, I mean, that's basically the E3.
1424160	1425120	That's great.
1425120	1427760	Anyway, okay, here's my thought.
1428560	1433440	I love the idea to reopen Kensha Hall as more of like an indie showcase.
1433440	1435280	Except it's a parking lot, but you know.
1435280	1441520	Well, you know, okay, but downtown LA has been through a lot of changes and surely they
1441520	1446560	have more parking somewhere, especially with the freaking Staples Center down there.
1447200	1451840	And people just have to start taking transit or find other ways to get to, especially with
1451840	1454240	Uber and Lyft being more prolific.
1454240	1457760	People have to find other ways if they take a few parking spots out of E3.
1457760	1461280	Okay, so anyway, I would say turn Kensha Hall back into an indie showcase.
1461280	1468080	But I would like to see E3 kind of embrace gaming and gaming culture, because I think
1468080	1472560	that's a lot of what's changed in the industry in the past few years is that you have more
1472560	1475040	and more for gaming culture.
1475040	1479440	Because so much is digital, look at where like GameStop's going is that they want to
1479440	1481520	sell a lot of these things that are gaming culture.
1481520	1484800	But not just that is what I mean by gaming culture and like the things that are kind
1484800	1487200	of secondary to the video games.
1487200	1492400	But I mean things like how Twitch TV is growing and people are watching online with streaming
1492400	1494000	stuff, that is gaming culture.
1494000	1498000	YouTube, you know, whether I love them or hate them, they are still a part of gaming
1498000	1498480	culture.
1498480	1503440	And a lot of these online things, esports, that's gaming culture.
1503440	1507840	I would like to see E3 kind of looked at a little differently about how it's laid out
1507840	1513680	strategically, have an area that really embraces and involves gaming culture.
1513680	1517680	And that is the part that would really appeal to the public for some time.
1517680	1522720	And I would say the part of it that then is left for the gaming, I would say maybe a similar
1522720	1523840	to the Tokyo Game Show.
1523840	1527200	For a day or two, it's just the trade people only.
1527200	1530960	But then like on the third day or what have you, they open it up to everybody.
1530960	1535280	Having been to E3, you know, even in the early years, I felt like you could get a good chunk
1535280	1536640	of stuff done in the first two days.
1536640	1539760	Then by the third day, it's like, okay, I'm tired.
1539760	1543520	Let's go get a recap of, you know, things we enjoy to go do it again or whatever.
1544400	1548800	So I kind of feel like they could still do a lot with, you know, just even a day or two
1548800	1550320	if it was like trade only.
1550320	1555600	But have other stuff that celebrates the culture of video games that would be something that
1555600	1559120	the public has for them, if that makes sense.
1559120	1559920	That's my idea.
1562000	1566080	And Bobby Blackwell says they had an art gallery, Rob, an art gallery.
1567200	1568000	That's a start.
1568000	1573760	But that's not, that's maybe 1% of what I wanted to do there.
1574320	1580160	Bobby Blackwell also bringing up E4ALL as a follow up to Sia Tabiri's comment about
1580160	1582320	why don't they split it up into a public show and a trade show?
1582320	1584160	Because E4ALL flopped.
1584160	1590320	But I think they did not succeed in drawing the right talent into E4ALL.
1590320	1594000	They had maybe one big publisher there each year they did it.
1594000	1596960	Like one year they had Nintendo, one year they had Microsoft.
1596960	1601040	You know, I think they've really got to draw in the talent to make something like E4ALL
1601040	1604320	work, which is why, you know, it didn't end up working.
1605280	1609520	Bob C. points out that downtown LA has good public transit and LA Convention Center is
1609520	1611760	getting too small for even Anime Expo now.
1611760	1614240	So anyway, let's see.
1614240	1617120	Dungeon Buster says, yeah, first two days, rush, rush, rush.
1617120	1620080	But by the third day, I just go back to play the games I wanted to spend more time with
1620080	1621360	or collect more swag.
1621360	1628480	So anyway, I hope the folks that put on E3 will look to change the X, whether they take
1628480	1633600	these ideas or not, I hope they do look to modernize and change the expo for the year
1633600	1634640	2018.
1634640	1639520	You know, I'm not going to expect to see that this year, but if the attendance numbers start
1639520	1642560	dipping, they're going to really have to probably look at doing something.
1642560	1643600	So, yeah, we'll see.
1644160	1644480	All right.
1644480	1649520	Anyhow, well, let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we
1649520	1650880	have been playing this week.
1650880	1652400	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1652400	1656960	I didn't really play much of anything I was supposed to stream, but I was pretty sick
1656960	1657840	at the beginning of the week.
1658880	1660880	So I really just haven't touched anything.
1663200	1671600	You know, just Animal Crossing on my phone, a little Ingress, a little Pokemon Go, still
1671600	1673280	playing the wrap up of Miitomo.
1673280	1680800	I've been playing the new Bust-A-Move game that's on iOS, but it's not...
1682560	1687040	I hate how they're taking all of them from just the old school gameplay to the, oh, you
1687040	1689840	get bombs if you pay this many points.
1689840	1691520	I'm like, no, that's boring.
1691520	1693120	I just want to play fucking Bust-A-Move.
1694080	1695360	So I'm mad.
1697040	1697680	That's it.
1697680	1698800	I haven't really been playing much.
1699440	1700640	All right, let's check in with Loki.
1700640	1701600	How was your gaming week?
1701680	1702800	I really only...
1702800	1703600	One last, wow.
1706320	1710960	I really didn't play too much this week, except for, of course, Dance of the Revolution
1710960	1714000	Extreme, and then a little bit of mobile stuff.
1714000	1719120	I did play a little bit of Ingress, a little bit of Pokemon Go when I was at places near
1719120	1726560	that stuff, and then a little bit of my Office Space game, although I only played that very
1726560	1727440	sparingly.
1727440	1728400	So that's about it.
1728400	1729200	I wanted to play more.
1729200	1731280	Just, I don't know.
1731280	1732160	I was working on stuff.
1732960	1733920	Unfortunately, not games.
1734480	1734880	All right.
1734880	1738400	Learning HTML5 and CSS3.
1739440	1740160	Fun stuff.
1740160	1742560	Well, I feel like I played a lot this week, so get a chair.
1743200	1744560	I'll take up for the time then.
1745360	1749520	So I've also been playing the phone games, the Ingress, especially the Pokemon Go, since
1749520	1750880	they did the community event yesterday.
1750880	1752080	Yes, I got a shiny.
1752080	1753760	Yeah, I got three shinies.
1753760	1757200	But I didn't get enough to get a dragon.
1757200	1758240	Oh, bummer.
1758240	1763280	Yeah, I went out with Shane from Ranger Pride, which came back this week, by the way, you
1763280	1763520	guys.
1763520	1764640	So check that out at VOG Network.
1765280	1768720	Shane from Ranger Pride, myself, some of our other buddies.
1768720	1773600	We went over to Capitol Park here in SAC, and it was lit up with lures, as you can imagine,
1773600	1775520	and we walked around the entire three hours.
1775520	1779200	We walked around the park, and I probably caught easy, like 150 Dratini's.
1779200	1782160	I caught three shinies, which was the minimum I wanted.
1782160	1786240	So that way I could have a Dratini, Dragonite, Dragonair.
1786240	1788080	I could have each one of them in a shiny form.
1788960	1789920	I got that.
1789920	1790800	So I'm happy with that.
1790800	1794800	But yeah, lots and lots of Dratini candy and just a good time and good exercise, which
1794800	1795040	is good.
1795040	1797040	A good excuse to just get out, walk around.
1797040	1800560	And I'm telling you guys, and I'm using my quotey finger, dead game.
1800560	1804640	And I realize less people are calling it that now because they end up embarrassed, but it's
1804640	1805440	not a dead game.
1805440	1810080	Like looking at Capitol, there was a lot of people there, and it was to the point where
1810080	1813840	the police were kind of coming around going like, what is going on?
1813840	1817600	And then when somebody was like, Pokemon, there's a lot of Pokemon stuff going on.
1817680	1818800	Oh, okay.
1818800	1822640	Because they were showing up because they're like, what is this unpermitted event that's
1822640	1824480	happening at the Capitol right now?
1824480	1825840	Like, they thought it was a protest.
1825840	1827520	How dare people use our parks?
1827520	1831520	Which ironically, there was a protest because we walked by.
1831520	1837280	There were two guys there on the state Capitol with a mega horn talking about the California
1837280	1838960	seceding for the nation, that whole thing.
1839520	1841440	California being the whole separate.
1841440	1842400	Yeah, right.
1842400	1843600	So that is what was going on.
1843600	1845120	I'm sure those guys were confused, too.
1845120	1847280	Like, why would these people look up for their phones?
1847440	1849840	We got a great turnout here, right?
1849840	1850960	We're not here for you, bitch.
1850960	1852400	There's a shiny here.
1852400	1852900	All right.
1853520	1855680	So anyway, that's how you get us to succeed.
1855680	1857680	Or you just, you know, but I'll wait now.
1857680	1858400	That wouldn't work.
1858400	1860320	I don't know if we can succeed and join Canada.
1860320	1863040	That would be great in the nation of California.
1863040	1864640	Shiny Dragon Knights for all.
1864640	1865140	Yay.
1865680	1865920	All right.
1865920	1868160	Anyway, all that political stuff aside.
1868160	1870640	So that was just a quick side note.
1870640	1873760	Super multitasking is listed as one of the featured games on Steam right now.
1874640	1876480	Is that just your library?
1876480	1877440	Because it's tailored to you.
1878080	1880800	It might be tailored to you because everybody's playing it.
1880800	1881760	But it's on there.
1881760	1882000	All right.
1882000	1883360	Well, since you brought it up.
1884400	1885520	Spoiler, Jamie.
1885520	1886800	Geez, I was going to get to it.
1886800	1889520	But I wasn't saying it to spoil it.
1889520	1891040	I'm saying that it was.
1891040	1891540	It's fine.
1892880	1894480	Congrats to Aaron or YYR.
1894480	1899200	His game Super Multitasking officially released on Steam on Friday, Thursday.
1899200	1900080	I think it was Friday.
1901040	1902880	So it's officially out there and you can buy it.
1902880	1905120	It is still $4.49.
1905120	1907280	It's 10% off the $5 price.
1907280	1909120	And you've heard us talking about this game a lot.
1910320	1912880	You know, please consider going to support Aaron.
1912880	1914560	Best way I can describe the game.
1914560	1920080	It's similar to WarioWare, but obviously kind of different types of games.
1921040	1924960	And the fact is you play four of them all at the same time.
1924960	1925520	Sometimes.
1925520	1926640	Sometimes it's one, it's two.
1926640	1928800	It gets harder and harder as it moves along, right?
1928800	1931520	So just honestly, go look at YouTube.
1931520	1932800	Go look at Twitch.
1932880	1934240	Go watch somebody play it.
1934960	1936880	Because it's just a lot of fun.
1936880	1940320	I think the best way to sell quote unquote the game is to watch.
1940960	1948320	And if you're a streamer, I would really urge you to pick up Super Multitasking or contact
1948320	1950080	YYR underscore on Twitter.
1950080	1953520	Because if you're a streamer, he may just straight up like, you know, help you out with
1953520	1954800	getting hooked up with the product.
1954800	1957120	Because I think they make for a very fun stream.
1957120	1961600	Because I did a stream of Super Multitasking on Friday and people were, you know, I was
1961600	1964720	getting really mad because those challenges get hard.
1964720	1967120	And you know, it's just like over and over and over again, you're doing it.
1967120	1971520	And then finally you get through and it feels really, really, really good.
1971520	1973520	So yeah, that's great.
1974080	1979040	So congrats to Aaron or YYR on his release of Super Multitasking and check that out on
1979040	1979280	Steam.
1980240	1981520	Other stuff I played this week.
1981520	1986080	So today with my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness, we did a live stream.
1986080	1990240	So I didn't do a post OLR stream because we're doing something else after OLR tonight, which
1990240	1991760	I'm going to get to in a minute here in housekeeping.
1992320	1996880	But I did a pre-OLR stream tonight with my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness.
1996880	2000480	And we played 20XX or as I call it 20XDX.
2000480	2002800	That's the Mega Man-esque type of game.
2002800	2007200	But it's more like a roguelike, I guess, where you try to gather as many items as you can
2007200	2008880	and it carries over into the next game.
2008880	2011440	And that was a lot of fun because you can actually play that co-op online.
2011440	2013520	So that's something that you can't really do in Mega Man.
2013520	2014720	So that was really fun.
2014720	2016000	And then we played Mario Kart.
2016000	2019120	You know, we had to have that standby game that other people could join in.
2019120	2020080	And that was a lot of fun.
2020080	2023200	And it was funny because Bobby kept coming in last place.
2023200	2028000	And then all of a sudden, like the last ones, he whooped our butt in the 200cc.
2028000	2030400	And I was like, Bobby's not going to play 200cc.
2030400	2032160	And then that's the one he murders us at.
2032160	2033600	So congrats to Bobby.
2033600	2035120	And now he can't complain about that.
2035120	2036720	But that was a lot of fun that Mario Kart stream.
2036720	2041600	So you can follow me on Twitch if you want to see more of that at Rob Roberts on Twitch.
2041600	2046320	And of course, a shout out as well to Delvin at VG Realness over on Twitch for doing the
2046320	2047600	co-streaming with me today.
2047600	2052320	And congrats, of course, to VOG's very own Bobby Blackwolf for getting affiliate this
2052320	2052480	week.
2052480	2055520	So you can check him out on Twitch at Bobby Blackwolf.
2056160	2058400	And he just finished up Police Quest 2.
2058400	2061360	He is streaming on original hardware.
2061360	2064400	He is not no emulators, no good old games.
2064400	2064880	No, no, no.
2064880	2070960	That is the original Pentium computer with his Roland MT-32 card that he is streaming
2070960	2071520	these games on.
2071520	2072160	That's a lot of fun.
2072720	2076640	So well, the streaming doesn't happen on that machine, but the machine is running the game.
2077280	2077920	You know what I mean.
2078880	2080080	One other thing I want to mention.
2080880	2081440	No, I lied.
2081440	2082400	Two other things I want to mention.
2082400	2087680	One, I want to give a quick shout out to Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 on the Switch because I did
2087680	2090240	play Bayonetta on the Switch this week for a little bit.
2090240	2093680	It's a good port and just love and play in that game again.
2093680	2097680	By the way, you remember the story last week about how some of the codes for Bayonetta
2097680	2100880	2 for the original Bayonetta were bad.
2100880	2102000	Hey, guess what?
2102000	2104080	I got a bad code for Bayonetta.
2104080	2109200	So I actually had to call Nintendo on Monday, I think it was, and talk to the guy about
2109200	2111680	getting a replacement code, but they were very good.
2111680	2114080	All I had to do was give them the code that I did have.
2114080	2117840	And it sounded like they had a program on their side that was like translating the codes
2117840	2119600	from the bad code to a good code.
2119600	2123200	So I don't know where the screw up was, but they were able to fix it pretty quick.
2123200	2125360	Waiting on hold was the hardest part.
2125360	2127040	So I guess props to Nintendo for at least.
2127040	2131040	Waiting is the hardest part.
2131040	2134720	And then lastly, lastly, the last thing on Switch that I played this week was Pac-Man
2134720	2137360	Championship Edition 2 Plus.
2137360	2140480	And you're probably thinking, Rob, haven't you played this game before?
2140480	2146320	Yeah, I own it on PlayStation 4 and PC and now Switch.
2146320	2150960	But in my defense, I bought it on PC as like part of a bundle where it cost me like $2
2150960	2151520	on PCs.
2151520	2153280	Like it was nothing on PC.
2153280	2157600	The reason why I got the Switch version was A, for the portability of it and B, there's
2157600	2161280	actually a brand new mode now that is a two player mode.
2161280	2165840	And what might not be obvious, which I think is unfortunate, but what's probably not obvious
2165840	2170240	in the marketing material for the game is that you can have the computer control the
2170240	2171360	second character.
2171360	2175280	Now, obviously, it's going to be way more fun if you actually have a second person doing
2175280	2175760	it.
2175760	2181520	But it is kind of cool that you can play with your computer as the partner and you can still
2181520	2184000	kind of experience the new mode because it is different.
2184000	2188720	It's very different from the regular game because in the two player game, you each are
2188720	2192240	eating the pellets and you can kind of help each other or you can kind of stick to your
2192240	2193200	side of the maze.
2193200	2198160	But once you're finished eating the dot, you don't reset to the bottom to pick up the fruit.
2198160	2199840	You actually have to kiss.
2199840	2203840	The two Pac-Man's have to kiss because they're each holding, they're holding the fruit and
2203840	2204320	bubbles.
2204320	2207520	And then when they kiss, they make the fruit and then you go to the next level.
2207520	2209360	So it does add a new element to it.
2209360	2213920	And then when the ghosts are on rails, when you are in the power pellet mode, it's kind
2213920	2217760	of the most controversial switch in Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 is that they put the
2217760	2220480	ghosts on rails during that part.
2220480	2225440	But what happens is that one Pac-Man has to eat the head and the other has to eat the
2225440	2225760	tail.
2226480	2230560	But once one of you hits the head, it freezes for like 10 seconds.
2230560	2232400	So it gives you an opportunity to grab the tail.
2232400	2235680	So I mean, these little twists really kind of change it up a bit.
2235680	2237280	So it almost feels like a different game.
2237280	2242720	So if you're into the Pac-Man Championship game, it's worth checking out, especially if
2242720	2244720	you missed it on all the other platforms.
2244720	2248400	I would say the Switch version is now probably the definitive edition.
2248400	2253920	However, one thing I do have to read it for, the game works really well in handheld mode.
2253920	2256400	It seems like it's optimized for handheld mode.
2256400	2262160	In console mode, I did notice some frame skip and some bad optimization, which considering
2262160	2266320	this game is not exactly new, it's been out on PlayStation 4, it's been out on PC.
2266880	2268080	That's a bit of a no-no.
2268640	2274080	So I do hope Namco will look at this issue and address it because it was something I
2274080	2275040	definitely noticed.
2275040	2278720	And if you've seen Pac-Man Championship Edition 2, it is a little bit graphic intensive.
2278720	2282000	So especially during some of the transitions, like if you notice, like with the Pac-Man
2282000	2286640	floats off one board down to another board, which is a very money shot you see in the
2286640	2289600	trailers, that's where I noticed the frame skip the worst.
2289600	2294800	And that's kind of a bummer because that is a very cool visual flare that the game has.
2294800	2297280	So yeah, there you go.
2297280	2302240	But I would say check that out for those of you guys that are on the Nintendo Switch and
2302240	2305360	maybe have not played Pac-Man Championship Edition yet.
2307520	2310720	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2310720	2314160	Brad from Paw Culture says, got to get the Xbox version and complete the set.
2314720	2315600	What do you think this is?
2315600	2316320	Mass Effect?
2316320	2318480	No, no, I'm done.
2318480	2320240	I'm not going to buy this Pac-Man game anymore.
2320240	2324720	The only reason I bought it on the Switch was for handheld and the fact that it had
2324720	2328880	like this whole new sub game in it that I think is important to check out.
2328880	2334080	So, um, which also, you know, not to humble brag, but I think I will a little bit, probably
2334080	2337120	because not a lot of people are playing this game on Switch right now.
2337120	2339760	I have a top 50 score in the base board.
2339760	2344480	I have the 40th highest score, uh, out of like maybe 4,200 players.
2344480	2349200	So what's cool is that if you're in the top 50, you can actually watch a replay.
2349200	2352240	So if you look for Rob, I might still be, I might've got bumped off by the time you
2352240	2356240	hear this, but if you look at the top 50 for just the basic beginner champion board and
2356240	2360320	you see Rob, you can actually watch my replay and see that I did have some imperfections
2360320	2362080	in my run, but I'm going to try to get better.
2362080	2364160	Cause I, I really enjoy the game.
2364160	2369360	Um, even though the ghosts on rails, you know, it's a little bit of a shortcoming.
2369360	2373040	I wish they'd kind of done that a little bit differently, but I love the music too.
2373040	2377440	The music just like gets, it's like the Pac-Man Championship Edition games have great soundtracks
2377440	2378640	and this one's no different.
2378640	2382160	So anyway, I have blabbed enough about my gaming week.
2382160	2382880	Let's move on.
2382880	2387120	I want to go to some housekeeping here cause I've got something big to talk about tonight.
2387120	2394320	Um, over at the voice geeks network, vog network.com, we have introduced a brand new show and we

2483360	2486720	I hope I did not screw that up, but I'm doing that off the top of my head.
2486720	2489520	I'm double checking myself on the website right now.
2489520	2490400	I think I got it right.
2490400	2493200	If I got that wrong, just holler at me and chat DJ star Sage.
2493200	2493700	All right.
2494180	2496660	Um, that's all I have for housekeeping.
2496660	2498500	You'll follow us on Twitter at OLR.
2498500	2501700	We're also on Facebook at orange lounge radio.
2501700	2505460	Let's get into some gaming news.
2505460	2506260	Loki.
2506260	2506660	Yes.
2506660	2512820	So apparently square Enix has plans for final fantasy 15 that go on through 2019 as far
2512820	2516260	as the download content schedule that they have.
2516260	2518500	So they're going to keep adding different things to it.
2519140	2525540	Um, including actually, um, with the launch of the PC version, they have a skin that is
2525540	2527700	half-life themed as well.
2527700	2532820	So yes, you can actually, um, dress up like Gordon Freeman if you want.
2532820	2533460	I hate this.
2534420	2536260	Like I, I just, I hate it.
2537060	2537460	Thanks.
2537460	2538020	I hate it.
2538820	2546180	But it is, it's any less, is this more ridiculous than, um, you know, the whole cup noodle stuff?
2546180	2547700	I mean, come on.
2547700	2551060	I guess not, but I just, I hate it for multiple reasons.
2551620	2558580	For one, like really like half like, like stop shoving half-life in our face.
2558580	2561460	If you're not going to fucking make half-life three, like just stop it.
2561460	2562260	It's fucking rude.
2562900	2564660	It sounds like a valve problem.
2564660	2565300	It is.
2565300	2567700	And I'm, I'm giving him, giving him shit for that.
2567700	2572020	But then at the same time, it's like, you know, I just, I feel like this is such a weird
2572900	2576100	out of place addition, but then at the same time, and I know somebody is going to call
2576100	2580340	me out on chat on it, so I might as well just say, I know they did the Mass Effect
2580340	2585460	costumes in Final Fantasy 13 too, but I was okay with that.
2585460	2587620	No, they were kind of ridiculous there too.
2587620	2589700	They were, they were kind of ridiculous.
2589700	2592420	I'm kind of okay with them going ridiculous.
2592420	2594340	Let's make it even more ridiculous.
2594980	2596980	I mean, might as well, because you know what?
2598260	2600820	That's, hey, there we go.
2600820	2602100	It worked for Volition.
2602100	2602740	Let's do that.
2602740	2606740	You know, let's take Final Fantasy in the, in the direction of Saints Row.
2607460	2608740	Let's put Johnny Gat in the game.
2608740	2609140	Why not?
2609140	2611380	Like everybody wants fucking Johnny Gat and stuff.
2611380	2611860	Over the top.
2611860	2612980	Throw Johnny Gat in there.
2612980	2615060	He can be another member of their team.
2615060	2618420	And actually I'd be fine at that actually.
2618420	2622100	How do you feel about Final Fantasy 15 continuing on into 2019?
2622100	2626500	Because I kind of wish they'd let it go and let the team work on some, like Final Fantasy
2626500	2627940	16 or something new.
2628580	2637380	Like, I just, I feel like I played and I finished Final Fantasy 15 and I'm getting irritated
2637380	2641300	that it keeps saying, nope, you got to come back and play through the whole game again.
2641300	2645220	Cause we changed this one little thing or we did this one, you know, new thing that's
2645220	2648260	different or now there's this one character you can play as or something.
2648260	2653060	It's like, okay, if you're going to like, then I'm just going to check out until you're
2653060	2656180	done releasing all this shit and then I'll play the game again.
2656180	2656820	You know what I mean?
2657700	2658420	Yeah.
2658420	2659140	It was funny.
2659140	2662340	Like I was actually talking to my son about, I was like, oh yeah, I need to finish that
2662340	2662500	game.
2662500	2665940	Cause he was asking me, he's all, what was that game that you're playing?
2665940	2670660	They had a guy at the large sword and, and you got food out of eggs.
2670660	2671860	I'm like, geez, you know what?
2671860	2674420	That could be like a billion different things.
2674420	2676740	I like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
2676740	2679780	And I still don't know what he, what game he was referring to, but I was like, Final
2679780	2681140	Fantasy 15, maybe.
2681140	2686020	I mean, like, I don't think I ever saw me playing that game, but, uh, but I'm like,
2686020	2688180	oh yeah, I do need to go play that.
2688180	2692980	I mean, I guess for the people that really enjoy Final Fantasy 15 and are really, you
2692980	2694740	know, into the game and the lore.
2694740	2697460	I mean, it is cool that the game is continuing on.
2697460	2702020	I mean, I guess it would be similar to, you know, that continued DLC they did for the
2702020	2703700	Mass Effect games for a while worse.
2703700	2706580	They could make spinoff games like they did with seven.
2706580	2708580	Final Fantasy 15 was a spinoff game.
2708580	2709300	Remember?
2709300	2711300	It started as a spinoff game.
2711300	2711800	True.
2712660	2713620	This is true.
2713620	2713940	Yes.
2713940	2717700	Now that I think it, um, but like, you know, I'm talking about like, you know, they could
2717700	2720020	do a dirge of Severus or something like that.
2720020	2720520	Cerberus.
2721380	2726820	Uh, Jamie, I, are you, I don't think you really got into Final Fantasy 15, but how do you
2726820	2731140	feel about the, the life till 2019 of this game?
2731140	2732100	I don't care.
2732100	2733300	I'm not going to play it.
2733300	2737620	I hope they actually make that stupid VR mode that they actually were showing off originally
2738740	2742020	that was going to be the VR modes instead of the fishing bullshit.
2742020	2743300	Oh, so angry.
2744740	2747140	I, it's just so ridiculous.
2747140	2748820	I mean, I'll be honest.
2748820	2755380	I haven't really enjoyed a Final Fantasy game past other than the MMOs.
2755380	2760980	I mean, like the last one I played any significant amount of was eight and I don't think it was
2760980	2761860	as good as seven.
2761860	2763300	I barely touched nine.
2763940	2764660	Ten was fun.
2765300	2769620	And after that, I mean, it's just, it's just lost me.
2769620	2770740	Twelve though, girl.
2770740	2771780	Twelve's so good.
2772820	2773700	I don't like twelve.
2774340	2775300	Eleven and fourteen.
2775300	2776180	I hate the draw system.
2776180	2777860	She said besides MMOs.
2777860	2778980	I hate the draw system.
2778980	2780900	Draws not in twelve, draws in eight.
2780900	2783380	Well, I mean, not eight, but the targeting system.
2783380	2785060	Oh, it is a little, it is a little different.
2785060	2785380	Yeah.
2785380	2786500	It's annoying is what it is.
2786500	2790420	Twelve wasn't, see that was the one I was supposed to play was twelve because it was
2790420	2796020	similar, the combat system was similar to like look like eleven almost where you kind of
2796020	2796900	get near something.
2796900	2801060	Actually, that's almost like Parasite Eve even, but I don't know.
2801060	2804260	I kind of, I wouldn't mind if they remastered thirteen, honestly.
2804260	2808260	I know that's the one people love to hate on, but I liked thirteen well enough and I
2808260	2812980	think that trilogy deserves a nice little, you know, boost into the PlayStation four
2812980	2814340	and Xbox one era.
2814340	2816420	But, you know, I'm not going to hold my breath.
2816420	2816920	First one.
2817780	2820900	I mean, cause I have this ending spoiler and I'm like, eh, what's the point now?
2820900	2825540	I think Final Fantasy thirteen is one of those Final Fantasy games that actually had a
2825540	2827460	good ending, I think.
2827460	2829780	I mean, it was, it did not go on for a half hour.
2829860	2830980	It was like a five minute.
2830980	2833380	Well, it depends on what you look at as ending.
2833380	2839300	If you want to look at just from when final boss dies to directed by so and so in the
2839300	2841620	credits, it's like maybe five and a half minutes.
2841620	2844500	You know, it's, it's pretty succinct, but it's a, it's a really good five and a half
2844500	2845000	minutes.
2845460	2848820	So anyway, uh, okay.
2848820	2850580	I guess we'll move on other stories.
2850580	2855140	I just want Final Fantasy six in Final Fantasy fifteen's engine.
2856420	2859060	I could go for that, but you know, we're getting Final Fantasy seven.
2859460	2864340	Yeah, I'll settle for seven, but like after we're done with this and they run out of ideas
2864340	2869380	again, which will be like five minutes later, the best six, the best Final Fantasy story
2869380	2871060	right now is in Final Fantasy fourteen.
2871060	2874980	And it's just a bummer that so many people are going to miss it because of the multiplayer
2874980	2878180	slash MMO slash monthly fee elements are getting bored with it.
2878180	2882100	And I, well, I mean, what part of the game made you bored?
2883060	2887860	Pretty much anything having to do with not being able to jump to the next quest because
2887860	2888980	of a level cap.
2888980	2889380	Okay.
2889380	2890980	That's, that's fair.
2890980	2892820	Um, they have an end game.
2892820	2896020	They have done some reduction on the experience you need.
2896020	2900100	So hopefully it would help, but I'm already paying for a while, so I'm not going to pay
2900100	2904660	for another major course with 11 was the whole level cap system.
2904660	2906020	Do you have to do like level breaks?
2906020	2908500	Do they have that system in 14?
2908500	2909540	Oh, thank God.
2909540	2911220	Well, wait, I take that back.
2911220	2916020	Um, well, it's nothing like it wasn't, I'd have to grind for days just because I would
2916100	2919780	not have enough experience or not be a high enough level to take my next quest.
2920900	2921620	Stupid.
2921620	2923860	Especially in the beginning, it can be.
2923860	2927380	And the story unfortunately doesn't get like really good until like level 45.
2928020	2932580	Well, and I mean, I've got a higher level character already, but I mean, the thing
2932580	2938340	that I really liked with what world of Warcraft did is now you've got the scaling leveling
2938340	2940740	and that has been working out amazingly.
2940740	2942740	Did they fix the old dungeons ever?
2942740	2943460	Cause that was the part.
2944180	2948420	I just walked into the one in Orgrimmar by accident and it's, it was a level 20 dungeon.
2948420	2951780	So, and I, um, my character is like 35 right now.
2951780	2952820	My, uh, night born.
2953460	2954180	Interesting.
2954180	2961700	So yeah, I think that if you did it in a dungeon finder, it would scale, but if you just walk
2961700	2963940	into it, it's, it's native level.
2965140	2965380	All right.
2965380	2968100	Well, let's move on to some news about Nintendo.
2968100	2972980	Nintendo bringing something that, you know, a lot of other companies did a long time ago,
2973060	2974580	but they're finally introducing it.
2974580	2977060	And it could be interesting to see how it works out for them.
2977060	2979940	This has to do with user reviews.
2979940	2980420	That's right.
2980420	2983620	Nintendo.com now has a user review system.
2984340	2988900	So if you have ever played a Nintendo switch or a Nintendo 3DS game, and this of course
2988900	2994660	is all going to be noted by your play history, um, you can actually go into your, my Nintendo
2994660	2998500	account and you can actually find a game that you've played either on desktop or mobile.
2998500	3002580	And there should be a review this game prompt, or you can actually review the game.
3002580	3007060	Now, in order to actually leave a review, you have to have played the game for at least
3007060	3008340	two hours.
3008340	3012100	If you've played the game for two hours, you can give the game a one to five star rating,
3012100	3015060	do a headline, and then fill out a review box.
3015060	3020500	And you can use some pre-made tags, including kid appropriate, challenging online play and
3020500	3021300	so forth.
3021300	3022740	And then there's a spoiler box.
3023460	3026180	And then you also get to identify what type of gamer you are.
3026180	3029700	Are you a Nintendo fan, a core gamer, a casual gamer, and a parent?
3029700	3032340	That's interesting how they have both.
3032340	3035140	Because parents can't just be, you know, any of them.
3035140	3036420	I'm assuming you're not limited.
3036420	3039540	Oh no, it says you can't pick more than one of those.
3039540	3043940	So if you're a casual gaming parent, Nintendo fan, I guess you have to pick the one you
3043940	3044580	are the most.
3045700	3051700	Anyway, reviews will be moderated, but it will not be modified, uh, just because they
3051700	3054500	give a negative evaluation of a Nintendo product.
3054500	3058980	Uh, it says that reviews will go live within three to seven business days, assuming it's
3058980	3059700	for all ages.
3059700	3063540	So I'm assuming you can't go in there and write a review that's, fuck this fucking piece
3063540	3064660	of fuck garbage.
3064660	3067380	You know, you can't, sorry, Loki.
3067860	3073700	Um, anyhow, this is just interesting just because Nintendo is doing this after so long.
3073700	3075780	Why are they just now adopting this?
3075780	3081380	My thought is, is that it's because of the Switch's library, because so much of the
3081380	3085220	Switch's library is online and there's so many indie titles.
3085220	3090180	And I think a lot of them get lost because, you know, for all the, we, you didn't have
3090180	3094900	any software talk, there's like four or five games a week coming out on Switch.
3094900	3099060	Now, granted, most of them are online indie titles, but that doesn't mean they're bad
3099060	3099300	stuff.
3099300	3101380	In fact, there's a lot of really good stuff in there.
3101380	3105380	I see tons of people playing that Celeste right now, which I admittedly don't know much
3105380	3108660	about, but I know that's something that came out on Switch, but maybe through user
3108660	3110420	reviews, I would get to hear more about it.
3111300	3113860	Loki, what do you think about Nintendo rolling out user reviews?
3113860	3121140	This is a good thing or only worked so well in Steam and as long as they moderate it,
3121140	3126580	you know, I think that's because people will try to abuse the system, but it couldn't
3126580	3130580	hurt or at least, you know, even they have like something basic, like ratings, like one
3130580	3135540	to five stars and stuff in the PlayStation Network, although it's hard to see what people's
3135540	3136740	feedback is on that stuff.
3136740	3137780	I think that's a good thing.
3137780	3138180	Mm hmm.
3139380	3144180	Bobby Black Wolf in chat suggests that what they're going for with the tagging is what
3144180	3146340	voice are you rating that review?
3146340	3150500	So you might be a casual gaming Nintendo fan parent, but they want you to focus your review
3150500	3153060	on how it is for your kid since you're their parent.
3153060	3154100	That's a good perspective.
3155940	3160580	I hope they call that out as such in the rules, but that's a good way to figure out what tag
3160580	3164180	would be most appropriate is what voice are you using to talk about it.
3164180	3168740	So, um, yeah, pretty, pretty interesting to see Nintendo get on board with that.
3168740	3174820	Could this be because they have closed Miiverse and maybe Miiverse was a way that you got
3174820	3176500	the user experience before?
3176500	3181060	I don't know, but that's one other suggestion that's out there where as to why now is the
3181060	3185780	time for Nintendo reviews because Miiverse is unfortunately no more.
3186340	3187540	So, all right.
3187540	3191460	Well, I think we are good to move on to Dark Soccer, even though she's got Mr. Smoosh in
3191460	3192020	her lap.
3192020	3195460	I was giving him good scritches and he was like, oh, this is great.
3195460	3196820	Yeah, he's up to no good today.
3196820	3200020	He's been, now he's stepping on the Pikachu pillow over there, making his way back to
3200020	3200500	the chair.
3200500	3202660	Did you see my photobomb from the other day?
3202660	3202900	No.
3202900	3204820	I was taking a selfie and Midna's butt was in it.
3204820	3205780	Oh no, I didn't see that.
3205780	3209060	This cat, that's the best, you know, the best photobomb is cat butt.
3209060	3212260	You didn't hear me, but Mr. Smoosh jumped up on the mixing board again.
3212260	3214980	That's something he likes to do to disrupt the show.
3214980	3216820	Luckily he hasn't figured out how to move the switches yet.
3216820	3218900	Why are you not paying attention to the cat?
3218900	3219220	Pretty much.
3219220	3221140	The cat is the most important person in this room.
3221140	3221860	Pretty much.
3221940	3222580	Seriously.
3223380	3229940	So, well, speaking of Warcraft, since I had brought up my wowing earlier, Warcraft 3,
3229940	3235220	which is arguably the best of them, had gotten a patch.
3235220	3238020	Patch 1.29 was released.
3238020	3243540	It has some balance changes for the heroes, puts in widescreen support and updates to
3243540	3244500	the map pools.
3244500	3249620	I also was reading on the update that they're allowing now like a 24 player thing.
3249700	3258900	But anyway, but the thing about this is that it seems like it's leading up to something.
3258900	3268100	The last update that Warcraft 3 got was in 2017 when it was, you know, I guess just more
3268100	3268980	fixes and everything.
3268980	3276500	But the other thing too is that the thought is that when you install Warcraft 3, this
3276500	3283380	time, and this is actually pointed out by r__eazy on the World of Warcraft subreddit,
3283380	3290100	that when you install it, it opens a new launcher that's similar to the battle.net launcher.
3291780	3296900	And it's been replicated by other places by installing Warcraft 3, the Frozen Throne.
3298420	3305780	And the launcher was previously used to update the game while the installer was still legacy.
3305780	3310260	So what's going on right now is the theory is that this is going to lead to a Warcraft
3310260	3315220	3 remaster, kind of like how the Starcraft remaster went last year, which would be nice
3315220	3319540	because I mean, Warcraft 3 is actually still a really solid game.
3319540	3323300	I mean, yeah, it's kind of similar to Starcraft in the fact that people are still playing
3323300	3323700	it.
3323700	3324340	Yeah.
3324340	3330100	Well, on top of that, too, I mean, if you're, you know, a lore whore, you know, it's basically
3330100	3333700	everything that led up to the start of World of Warcraft.
3333700	3338340	You know, you had the whole, you know, the Frozen Throne itself was the whole, you know,
3338340	3339940	Lich King story and all that.
3339940	3341540	So it's pretty, pretty crazy.
3342260	3353380	But yeah, there is a Warcraft 3 Invitational Tournament also to be held on February, tomorrow.
3354340	3356660	Sorry, not tomorrow, February 27th and 28th.
3356660	3357860	So that's just next week.
3359380	3366900	That will be hosted by the people from Back to Warcraft and it's going to be on Twitch.
3366900	3372180	It includes free for all, four versus four, friendly competitions, stuff like that.
3372180	3374100	So who knows?
3374100	3379780	I have the theory that they're going to make the announcement at this thing, so it'll be
3379780	3380260	pretty nice.
3380260	3383860	But I wonder if they're, you know, if it's that they're going to charge again for a new
3383860	3389140	version of Warcraft 3, or if they'll like have some deal that if you launch it through
3389140	3392660	your original disc, you get like a special something or.
3393700	3395780	Yeah, I'm trying to think of how they did the Starcraft remaster.
3395780	3398980	Well, ultimately with the Starcraft remaster, they never got rid of the old version.
3398980	3401540	So the old version, in fact, became free.
3401540	3404740	And I think it was to drum up interest in the remaster, which I think they were charging
3404740	3405780	15 bucks for.
3405780	3406660	It's not terrible.
3406660	3407300	It's not terrible.
3407300	3410740	It's enough to pay the artists back, but they didn't necessarily have to reinvent the game.
3411540	3415540	I would just kind of hope, though, that they'd have like some sort of legacy adoption or
3415540	3420180	something like, yeah, you have the old, you know, who has discs anymore?
3420180	3421220	You know, if they catch like.
3421220	3422660	Was it all serial keys too?
3422660	3424660	Like you have the serial key on your account?
3424660	3430100	Like, so if you have like the serial for having purchased, you know, the game, then maybe
3430100	3435060	you get like some bonus thing for like a legacy account or something.
3435060	3439940	Let us not forget Warcraft 3 is where basically MOBAs were born, right?
3440020	3443460	You know, Dota 2 was a mod of Warcraft 3.
3443460	3446820	Dota is 2 because Dota was a mod of Warcraft 3.
3446820	3447540	That's been often.
3447540	3451300	And that's where you now you have Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends and all this
3451300	3454180	really have Warcraft 3 at its core to thank.
3454180	3454980	So kind of neat.
3454980	3458900	And then on top of it, I mean, you know, again, great stories.
3458900	3464740	And it's where I guess the for the people who play WoW today who maybe not have played
3464740	3467300	that, that's where these big characters come from.
3467380	3468100	I mean, sure.
3468900	3472580	I would say specifically most of the big names come from Warcraft 3.
3472580	3473540	A few from 2.
3473540	3476180	Like I think Deathwing was the plot of 2, wasn't it?
3476180	3476660	Well, yeah.
3477300	3480980	But I mean, but you know, and what is old is new again.
3480980	3483460	And who doesn't who doesn't want to move the peons around?
3483460	3484100	Zug, zug.
3485140	3485940	Jobs complete.
3486820	3491220	And I love I was actually just doing because the whole thing I like about the whole level
3491220	3496180	scaling right now in World of Warcraft is that I've gone back and do content from.
3497380	3500900	Cataclysm that I'd never done because I didn't play Horde at the time.
3500900	3501460	All right.
3501460	3505940	So but I love like how it's like the same, you know, kind of peon voices.
3505940	3506180	Yeah.
3506180	3506660	Yeah.
3506660	3509060	I think they like totally lifted it from the original game.
3509060	3510340	I think it's just so funny.
3510340	3510580	Yeah.
3510580	3511220	Super fun.
3511220	3511540	Yeah.
3511540	3513140	So that's a Warcraft 3.
3513140	3513620	Who knows?
3513620	3515060	We'll we'll find out this week.
3516100	3517540	Well, let's move on.
3517540	3519060	Loki was something else.
3519060	3519380	Yes.
3520020	3524740	So let's talk a little bit about that brand new mode that they have in Mario Odyssey.
3524740	3528900	Remember, they teased it a little bit where you hide balloons and find balloons and stuff
3528900	3529400	like that.
3530020	3534100	So like all good things, people have to fuck with it.
3534820	3541140	And so we're getting issues where people are actually taking the balloons and hiding them
3541140	3548740	in places that are very hard to get to or are out of bounds in the map, because of course
3548740	3549220	they are.
3549860	3554500	So there's people glitching through walls and stuff and hiding them within buildings
3554500	3555700	and stuff like that.
3557060	3557780	It's kind of funny.
3560100	3565300	You know, hopefully Nintendo patches that out, but it's it's interesting to see that
3565300	3569620	it might be a little bit frustrating to get some of these balloons because they are in
3569620	3571460	places that you can't really get to.
3571460	3577700	Yeah, I hear a not a lot of people are a big fan of this new patch for Mario Odyssey, but
3577700	3580260	I mean, it's nice that they kind of did something new that's free.
3580260	3584180	But I guess this was a little maybe a little rough around the edges, it sounds like.
3584180	3590580	Yeah, especially if you're going to play with people that are going to put the balloons
3590580	3591940	in not so easy places.
3592580	3592980	Yeah.
3592980	3593780	All right.
3593780	3597060	Well, another game that I think some folks are looking forward to on the Switch is the
3597060	3598900	Mega Man Legacy Collection.
3598900	3603380	Now, Mega Man Legacy Collection, of course, this already released on PlayStation 4 and
3603380	3605380	Xbox One, I think the PC as well.
3605380	3608340	But that doesn't stop people from wanting to buy it again, especially when you can have
3608340	3609460	it on the go.
3609460	3612740	And maybe some people never got it the first time around because Switch is your primary
3612740	3613460	console.
3613460	3619140	So it was confirmed that Mega Man Collection 1 plus 2 is going to be released for the Nintendo
3619140	3619460	Switch.
3619460	3624820	So, yes, it is being bundled together that will have Amiibo support for the Mega Man
3624820	3625300	Amiibo.
3625300	3627060	I think it just unlocks some things.
3627060	3631940	And apparently the way it works is that you will actually be purchasing apparently Mega
3631940	3638820	Man Legacy Collection 1 is on the cartridge, but then you get a DLC code for Mega Man Legacy
3638820	3639860	Collection 2.
3639860	3643940	It's very, very similar to what they just did with Bayonetta 2, having the digital code
3643940	3645860	for Bayonetta 1, except it's the other way around.
3646580	3647780	So that's pretty cool.
3647780	3649060	So you can check that out.
3649060	3651620	And what was the release date on this?
3651620	3654180	Release date is May 22nd.
3655060	3661380	You can buy the two games together for $39.99 retail.
3662020	3668980	Or you can get them DLC $14.99 for Mega Man Legacy Collection and $19.99 for Mega Man
3668980	3670180	Legacy Collection 2.
3670180	3673860	That's interesting because it's actually cheaper to buy them digitally than to buy the
3673860	3674420	cartridge.
3675060	3680020	But I guess that's because of, A, the cost of the cartridge and, oh, maybe that exclusive
3680020	3684820	Mega Man 30th anniversary cleaning cloth that comes with it.
3684820	3685380	Oh, geez.
3686180	3689620	That is interesting, though, that you're really seeing a direct, like, nope, going to be
3689620	3691540	cheaper to buy this one digitally.
3691540	3693860	So interesting how they're kind of doing that.
3693860	3695700	But, yeah, we'll see how that works out.
3695700	3698180	I'm starting to have storage issues on my Switch.
3698180	3703140	I had to archive so much stuff in order to be able to fit Bayonetta and Pac-Man.
3703140	3704660	Like, I had to go...
3704660	3707460	Now, granted, the stuff I was able to archive was really easy.
3707460	3710020	Like, I archived the old Splatoon demos and stuff.
3710020	3712580	But still, I mean, it was weird that I was running out of space.
3712580	3715860	I think I actually did have to move, like, something I'd actually been playing a little
3715860	3718260	bit, but just hadn't touched in a few months.
3718260	3722260	So I might need to buy more memory for my Switch.
3722260	3723140	Yikes.
3723140	3728500	By the way, Mega Man fans, there are some new Mega Man toys that we're showing off at
3728500	3730020	the New York Toy Fair.
3730020	3735940	There are some new 66-action minifigures for Super Mega Man, Star Force Mega Man, Cut Man,
3735940	3736820	and Vile.
3736820	3738100	$8 each for those.
3738660	3740580	You can actually get some Ride Armors.
3740580	3743700	X and Vile Ride Armors will be $50 each.
3743700	3746180	And that was all, again, being shown at the New York Toy Fair.
3746180	3749540	So those of you guys that really like to collect can check that out.
3749540	3750900	I like the Cut Man figure.
3750900	3754100	That's kind of a deep cut, too, because not everybody remembers the bosses from the very
3754100	3754900	first game.
3754900	3757780	But I certainly remember that stage and what a pain in the ass it was to beat.
3758980	3760740	Because that game was hard.
3760740	3762340	The original Mega Man was hard.
3762340	3766900	I mean, the other ones were hard, too, but they did kind of dumb down the second game
3766900	3770420	a little bit when they released it here, as opposed to Japan.
3770420	3770900	But the first game-
3770900	3772740	I didn't think the first one was that hard.
3773940	3774900	It was kind of hard.
3774900	3776420	Like, try to go back and play it now.
3777620	3779860	Well, I have not too long ago.
3779860	3784260	Like, 12-year-old you versus now you is going to be very different.
3784260	3789060	Keep in mind, I didn't beat the first Mega Man until I was 18.
3789060	3789560	Huh.
3790900	3793700	So, I started with Mega Man 2.
3793700	3794200	Okay.
3794820	3795940	So, anyway.
3795940	3796900	Fair enough, fair enough.
3796900	3799700	What do you have for us, Dark Soccer, before we get to the classic game of the week?
3799700	3800740	More Blizzard stuff.
3801540	3805620	There is a rumor, and you know how we are about rumors.
3805620	3809460	So rumors, bolded, underlined, slow news week, salt.
3810580	3811540	It's in italics.
3811540	3811860	All of it.
3811860	3812820	With quotes.
3812820	3813320	Yes.
3814260	3818180	That Blizzard is working on Diablo 3 for Switch.
3819460	3823460	Which Diablo, who knows.
3823460	3824340	It got better, didn't it?
3824980	3825300	It did.
3825300	3826580	Diablo 3 is a lot of fun.
3826580	3827380	It would be-
3827380	3828180	Oh, go ahead.
3828180	3832340	Well, just that they want to implement local play with multiple Switches.
3832980	3837300	So you could have the local co-op on-
3837300	3839780	I guess you could just play it on the handheld.
3840500	3844420	What's kind of rad about this, I'm of two mindsets, because there's part of me that
3844420	3849380	says Diablo 3 is like- how old is Diablo 3 at this point?
3849380	3849880	At least-
3850500	3851220	Five years?
3851220	3852020	Five years old?
3852020	3852740	Six years old, maybe?
3852740	3858180	Diablo 3 was- you got it for- it was like a thing during Cataclysm.
3858180	3859860	I want to say it came out almost like 2012.
3859860	3862340	I think it was coming up on six years old pretty soon.
3862340	3865060	I thought it came out right after Cataclysm.
3865060	3867060	Well, anyway, regardless, it's kind of an older game.
3867060	3871380	Now, to be fair, so is Skyrim, and Skyrim's been doing very well on the Switch, and people
3871380	3872660	are really excited about that.
3872660	3874500	Here's what I think is neat about Diablo 3.
3875060	3880900	What the PlayStation and the Xbox can't do is that if you're playing multiplayer in the
3880900	3886180	same room, you have to basically share the loot drops, and you can't run off the screen
3886180	3888500	because you only have one TV, right?
3888500	3889700	So you can't run off the screen.
3890340	3897220	If Diablo 3 launches for the Switch, and you are not beholden to be online all the time,
3897220	3901060	which I wouldn't think you would be because the Switch is a portable system, and Diablo
3901060	3905220	dropped that requirement with the console games, not the PC version.
3905220	3906580	PC is still always online.
3906580	3913540	But my point is, Diablo 3 on the Switch is going to be the closest thing to the LAN experience
3913540	3918820	from the old Diablo days than even necessarily the PC versions which are always online.
3918820	3919460	Think about that.
3919460	3923140	The Switch is now, if you have Diablo 3 on the Switch, it's basically going to be a LAN
3923140	3924180	game, right?
3924180	3927940	And you have your own thing going on, and so do your friends, and you don't have to
3927940	3930260	be confined in the same part of the level.
3930260	3931300	That's kind of rad.
3932260	3941140	So, but I just, I wish it was Diablo 4, or a new Diablo expansion at least for 3, because
3941140	3943140	the story kind of didn't end.
3943140	3948020	They left it wide open for more, so I kind of wish it was a new Diablo thing.
3948020	3951700	But I really like the idea of this game on Switch.
3951700	3954260	I think it could be a very good console game.
3955540	3958420	Atdeftinchat at live.vognetwork.com says,
3958420	3961540	I want Overwatch on Switch, dammit.
3961540	3962740	I almost said over swatch.
3963700	3965380	Overwatch on Switch, dammit.
3966660	3972100	I mean, it makes a lot of sense if it can handle the graphics, which, you know, Overwatch
3972100	3976580	can be played on a pretty, you know, a PC that's a few years old.
3976580	3979780	I mean, it's gonna take some, you know, it's not gonna look as good as it does, you know,
3979780	3985380	4K on, you know, a PC and some things, but, you know, you can run it.
3985940	3990340	But I think the only problem with Overwatch is that a game like that kind of always has
3990340	3995540	to be online, so you can't really have the portable element.
3995540	4002980	However, it would be pretty fucking cool if you could, like, take a Switch to a convention
4002980	4006980	and just do, like, a local area network Overwatch game that isn't ranked or anything.
4006980	4008260	You don't get points, it doesn't rank.
4008260	4011940	Just a, just a brawl that you could do offline with friends.
4011940	4013300	That would be kind of rad.
4013300	4015140	So, I'd like to see it.
4015700	4016200	We'll see.
4017300	4017800	Anyway.
4018580	4019080	All right.
4019620	4022180	Anything else with the Diablo story?
4022180	4026260	I didn't want to miss anything, but I know it is a rumor, so there's probably not a lot
4026260	4026760	else to say.
4027620	4028820	All right, let's move on then.
4028820	4031460	Loki, just a few more stories for our classic game of the week.
4031460	4032180	All right.
4032180	4036580	And so, this used to be a game I played quite a bit, Star Control.
4036580	4044340	And as you remember, there was a lawsuit between the developers and Stardock as to who has
4044340	4046260	the rights to the game and that type of thing.
4046980	4049620	So, there's a little bit more to go along with this.
4049620	4057300	So, apparently now, the developers are filing a counterclaim against Stardock, who had originally
4057300	4066020	filed the claim, and basically saying that, you know, they filed, Stardock had filed a
4066020	4072020	complaint in federal court against us, personally alleging, among other things, that we are
4072020	4074500	not actually the creators of Star Control.
4074500	4075940	This is news to us.
4075940	4084420	Are we clones of the original Fred and Paul, just now learning of our squelchy vat birth?
4084420	4087540	Unfortunately, Stardock's complaint is not a prank.
4087540	4093060	So, today we took an action, filed a response in federal court, answering Stardock's false
4093060	4093540	claims.
4093540	4098820	Of course, we also filed a counterclaim against Stardock as the original Fred and Paul would
4098820	4099300	have wanted.
4100820	4104180	So, I guess they're alleging that they're not the people that they say they are.
4105380	4107540	What a mess this whole situation is.
4107540	4112100	It is, and I would really like a new Star Control game, but, you know, we'll see.
4112180	4117540	First, we have to, like, figure out copyright law and trademark law.
4118420	4120260	There's something that needs to be reformed, man.
4120980	4121540	It's that.
4122500	4123300	All right.
4123300	4129380	Well, something that's getting reformed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for a new generation,
4129380	4131700	I suppose, is Burnout Paradise.
4131700	4132180	That's right.
4132180	4133060	It has been confirmed.
4133060	4136820	We had a rumor about this previously, but it was confirmed this week that a remaster
4136820	4139140	will be arriving on March 16th.
4139140	4140820	It will set you back 40 bucks.
4140820	4142980	It will run in 4K.
4142980	4144260	That's pretty awesome.
4144260	4148180	60 frames a second, and of course, online mode is going to be there.
4148180	4155140	When you buy the game for 40 bucks, all 150 cars, all eight expansion packs, including
4155140	4161140	Big Surf Island, it will run in 1080p on PlayStation 4 and Xbox hardware, and apparently,
4161140	4166740	4K resolution and 60 frames a second on the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X.
4166740	4169220	I don't know how they're going to do that on the PlayStation 4 Pro.
4170180	4174260	It was really intended for gaming at 4K, but that'll be impressive if they do it.
4174820	4176020	PlayStation 4 Pro?
4176020	4176340	Yeah.
4176340	4177140	That's what they're saying.
4177140	4178820	They could do 4K in Pro.
4178820	4180740	In 60 frames a second?
4180740	4181220	Probably.
4181220	4181540	Wow.
4181540	4181940	All right.
4181940	4182900	That's that's great.
4182900	4183700	Old game.
4183700	4185300	I mean, all right.
4185300	4186100	Yeah, no.
4186100	4187060	Hey, I'm all for it.
4187060	4188100	I'm down.
4188100	4189460	That's day one for me.
4189460	4190020	Yeah.
4190020	4191780	And what's also really cool about it.
4191780	4196100	They did confirm, even though there was a screenshot out there that had an in-game
4196100	4199060	purchases optional thing, they did confirm on Twitter.
4199060	4200660	There are no microtransactions.
4200660	4202580	There's no additional paid for content.
4202580	4204100	So pitchforks down.
4204100	4206420	So because all of that old stuff is being included.
4206420	4211380	Also, the game's soundtrack is returning in its entirety.
4211380	4212260	Yes.
4212260	4218660	So any of the licenses you were worried about from before, you will get the whole welcome.
4218660	4220580	No, is it Take Me Down Paradise City?
4220580	4221060	Has to be.
4221060	4222580	Was the intro song to that game?
4222580	4222900	Yeah.
4222900	4225780	Take me down to the paradise city.
4225780	4226820	That you're going to get all that.
4227540	4227860	Nice.
4227860	4228820	Excellent impression.
4228820	4229300	Thank you.
4229860	4230020	Yeah.
4232180	4233700	Now you just got to be more of an asshole.
4233700	4234660	He's just screaming in pain.
4234660	4238580	Honestly, for the remastering, it doesn't all it looks less bloomy.
4238580	4242420	I don't know that anyone can be as big of an asshole as Axl Rose.
4242420	4245220	Couldn't tell you which one is the new version or not.
4245220	4246660	Yeah, I'm excited.
4246660	4249860	Bobby Blackwell says people are excited that the Avril song is in it.
4249860	4250900	Well, why shouldn't they be?
4252500	4253860	Which Avril song was in it?
4253860	4254340	I forget.
4254340	4256020	Is it complicated or is it one of the other ones?
4256020	4257060	Sk8r Boi?
4257060	4258260	Which girlfriend?
4259140	4263700	Hey, that song is so bad, but I love it.
4263700	4264100	All right.
4266100	4269940	So this is coming out on its PlayStation 4 and Xbox.
4269940	4270820	What about PC?
4270820	4272020	Are they doing a PC version?
4272020	4272500	I don't know.
4272500	4274100	I have the original PC one.
4274740	4276340	I don't know if I saw PC in the list.
4276340	4278420	Let me look again at the list that I'm looking at here.
4281140	4284260	They're just saying PlayStation 4 and Xbox one is where you can order it right now.
4284260	4286100	So not seeing anything on PC.
4286100	4287780	I bet that comes later.
4287780	4288900	I bet they're going to go.
4288900	4289400	Hold on.
4290020	4290340	Sorry.
4291220	4295380	I bet they're going to go Grand Theft Auto style with it and do the PC version later.
4295380	4297940	Yeah, because that'd be really nice.
4297940	4300340	Act F in chat actually confirms PC is coming.
4300340	4302580	But later, if I recall correctly.
4302580	4304100	So those look nice.
4304100	4305300	I do want it.
4305300	4306260	I don't want it.
4306260	4306660	All right.
4308500	4313140	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
4313140	4314820	use the passphrase page.
4315540	4317460	Well, let's take a trip down memory lane.
4317460	4318980	Let's go back even further.
4318980	4321460	You know, why stop at like 10 years of Burnout Paradise?
4321460	4326580	And we can go back like 30 years with the classic game of the week.
4326580	4332980	Every week, Dark Sakura picks a classic game from the gaming vault and says, hey, hey,
4332980	4335300	hey, you, you go and play this video game.
4338740	4341220	Dark Sakura on this very special episode.
4341780	4344420	What did you pick as the classic game of the week?
4344420	4345940	I picked 720 degrees.
4346740	4348340	I see what you did there.
4348340	4350260	Because of reasons.
4350260	4351700	It's episode 720.
4351700	4354020	So why not pick 720?
4354020	4354520	Right.
4356420	4359140	So it came from 1986.
4359140	4361620	It's a skateboarding game done by Atari Games.
4364100	4366580	It has to keep the game going.
4366580	4368180	You have to keep scoring points.
4368180	4373060	So as a little bit of a timer on it as well.
4373780	4377460	So that's how you get it to take more of your money.
4377460	4377960	Right.
4378900	4388260	But anyway, you are playing as a skateboarder going around a middle class neighborhood.
4388260	4389620	You have to do tricks.
4389620	4394980	You do jumps and you have to acquire enough points to go compete at a skate park.
4396500	4397940	I'll read this story.
4398740	4403460	It's just you, your trusty skateboard and a hundred bucks as you skate, jump, slide,
4403460	4408820	spin and move through four levels of difficulty, picking up loose cash, earning money through
4408820	4412740	events and finally earning a ticket to one of the big skate parks.
4412740	4418180	If you're lucky, you'll get to buy some rad equipment to make you the coolest skateboarder
4418180	4418820	alive.
4420420	4425620	So you start off with a number of tickets that get you admission to one of four skate parks
4425620	4427700	or the events in Skate City.
4428740	4435380	And so your ticket is used at that point and you go and you do tricks.
4435380	4443780	But, you know, if you're not in an event, you see a countdown bar that starts sending
4443780	4447220	bees after you with the word skate or die.
4447220	4449060	Fuck those fucking bees.
4449060	4449700	Right.
4449700	4450500	Fucking bees.
4450500	4451860	Why does it always have to be bees?
4452740	4458100	But once the bees arrive, you have a very small amount of time not to get to the park.
4458100	4458900	Not the bees.
4460340	4466180	I remember watching the first X-Files movie and we wouldn't say the future is out.
4466180	4467300	They would say the bees are out there.
4469940	4473700	But anyway, you have to keep doing stunts and, you know, bees.
4475140	4481380	So you have your ramp, you have downhill, you have a slalom and you have jump.
4481460	4486340	So those are your four events.
4486340	4493060	And then you have different power ups that you can buy starting from $25 going up to
4493060	4494260	$250.
4494260	4497540	So you get shoes for higher jumps and faster acceleration.
4497540	4502500	You get a board for higher speed, pads for quicker recovery from wiping out and a helmet
4502500	4504980	so you can be more aggressive.
4504980	4509940	So you spin faster to get that famed 720 degree jump.
4511700	4516020	The cabinet, I always thought the cabinet was cool because the speakers were put on
4516020	4521700	top of it kind of like a boombox, you know, so it just kind of fit that whole theme.
4522340	4528020	And it was one of those large ones that they use for Paperboy, the large monitors.
4528980	4535380	Your joystick was a circle, a circular motion instead of just your standard, you know,
4536260	4538020	regular D-pad style.
4538020	4543380	And then you had two other buttons, one for kicking, you know, to push off instead.
4544260	4546740	And then you're the one for jumping.
4546740	4550420	So it was a great popular game.
4550420	4551940	It did have many ports.
4552980	4556420	There was Commodore 64, got two ports of it in 1987.
4556980	4561380	The Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum came out in 1988.
4561380	4565940	NES version came out in 1989, Game Boy Color in 1999.
4565940	4569140	There's an unreleased port for Atari Lynx.
4571780	4573540	Unfortunately, the bees got to it.
4573540	4574580	Yeah, the bees got it.
4574580	4575220	It didn't skate.
4575220	4575860	It just died.
4577940	4586020	And there was on side two of the game cassette, I guess this one would be for one of the other
4586020	4587060	computer versions.
4587060	4589380	I had the soundtrack from the original game on it.
4589380	4594980	There are emulated versions included in Midway Arcade Treasures, Midway Arcade Origins,
4594980	4597780	and Lego Dimensions in 2015.
4597780	4607460	But also that phrase, Skate or Die, was used to inspire another game, EA's Skate or Die,
4608020	4610180	which spawned a sequel called Ski or Die.
4611380	4612660	And there you go.
4612660	4614340	Which is also known as Ski Free.
4616340	4616900	Is it really?
4616900	4618420	If I was skiing, it would just be die.
4618420	4621380	No, because, you know, the bomb little snowman would come after you.
4621380	4622260	Oh, Jesus.
4622260	4622820	That's right.
4622820	4623700	That's right.
4623700	4624420	All right.
4624420	4626100	I didn't play Ski or Die, really.
4626100	4627380	I played Skate or Die.
4627380	4630740	I feel like there was a Skate or Die 2 at some point.
4630740	4631300	There was.
4631300	4632500	There was Skate or Die 2.
4632500	4633780	But these games are very different.
4633780	4636100	It's very important with 720 and Skate or Die.
4636100	4636660	Very different.
4636660	4637700	Skate or Die was fun.
4637700	4638980	I really should put it.
4638980	4641300	I like 720 a lot.
4641300	4643220	I think I like 720 more as a game.
4643220	4646900	But the problem is you would never get more than, like, two minutes before the fucking
4646900	4649300	bees killed you and you had to put in another quarter.
4649300	4651620	Like, it's very hard to be good at that game.
4651700	4654500	Even, like, the Nintendo version was very hard.
4654500	4659300	Yeah, I was not a fan of really any of the skateboarding games.
4659300	4660500	I really didn't like Skate or Die.
4660500	4661620	I didn't really care.
4661620	4667380	I mean, 720 I probably played a bit more because we had one at my arcade, but I don't know
4667380	4667620	why.
4667620	4669140	I mean, a lot of people would play them.
4669140	4674820	A lot of people would just be all into them, but it was never really my Cup of Joe.
4674820	4675700	That's all right.
4675700	4676180	It happens.
4676820	4678820	You know what game I also didn't care for?
4678820	4680100	California games.
4680100	4681140	Not very good.
4681140	4687140	California games was a spinoff of summer games and winter games and Epics like Olympics.
4687140	4691220	But I played it on Lynx and it just wasn't all that great.
4691220	4693700	Well, our trip spent playing that game on Lynx.
4693700	4697140	I bet the Lynx port wasn't as good as it probably was.
4697140	4700660	It was the surfing part just I hated.
4700660	4701860	Oh, I love the surfing.
4702420	4703700	I don't remember California games.
4703700	4706420	And then it had the town and country gorilla.
4706420	4707380	Wasn't it the gorilla?
4708100	4709540	The mascot for the TNC?
4709780	4711540	Uh, that was surf and skate.
4711540	4714660	I turned off 720 music because clearly we've gone tangent.
4714660	4718420	Yeah, I remember like they had BMX, so that was for like downhill BMX.
4718420	4720260	And so that was cool.
4720260	4725140	And then they had surfing, hacky sack, TNC, surf and skate, which wasn't great.
4728340	4731940	I might be getting California games and TNC, surf and skate mixed up.
4732820	4736900	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says I have the VCR California games board game.
4736900	4738340	I didn't even know they made that.
4738340	4740020	That's pretty awesome.
4740020	4740980	Does that even work?
4740980	4742260	I don't think somebody took the license.
4742260	4743220	You played hacky sack.
4743220	4744980	Well, two points.
4744980	4746580	No, cause it's a VCR game.
4746580	4749780	So you probably had to watch people playing the sports and then
4749780	4752740	you probably something to do with those VCR games.
4754260	4756820	No, the clue VCR game was bomb.
4756820	4759460	The clue VCR game was so awesome.
4759460	4762980	And I know I've talked about this on the show before because the first magfest I went to,
4762980	4767060	they screened some documentary about the clue VCR game.
4767060	4770020	And like the fact that, you know, all the people, all the act, all the
4772180	4774740	bad actors and actresses in that, and they weren't really bad.
4774740	4780020	They were all like theater people up in the Northeast that, that just did this on a whim.
4780020	4785780	The only mixed game like that, that I've played was a quest for the rings on the Odyssey too.
4785780	4787700	And then we just never played the board game part of it.
4788340	4789220	We just played the game.
4790100	4795540	What was the one, what was the VCR game where like it would be silent the whole time.
4795620	4798740	And then all of a sudden this like monster would come up on the screen and go,
4798740	4800660	maggot, maggot.
4802020	4804980	There was, I'm not somebody who knows VCR games.
4804980	4806340	Bobby's got to know this game.
4806340	4810100	It was some like scary VCR game and it was ridiculous.
4810100	4810900	I wouldn't play it.
4811540	4812900	It was ridiculous.
4814340	4815460	Is it a nightmare?
4815460	4816580	That sounds right.
4816580	4817140	Nightmare.
4817140	4818100	I think it might've been that.
4818900	4824820	Oh, Bobby, Bobby has the receipts with a YouTube.
4824820	4826500	That's probably, that's yucky.
4826500	4827460	I think that's probably it.
4827460	4827860	Let me see.
4827860	4828580	Wait, hold on.
4828580	4829300	I've got it.
4829300	4832500	Usually I don't click on YouTube links randomly, but I trust Bobby.
4834820	4836980	Which has nightmare game video.
4836980	4838980	Oh, let's see.
4838980	4839300	Hold on.
4839300	4840020	Let me see if I can.
4840820	4841060	Okay.
4841060	4844260	So here's, here's one of his little taunts coming up here.
4845780	4847060	Who's standing next?
4848180	4850260	Who is just about to roll the dice?
4857380	4858820	If you fail to answer.
4858820	4859140	Yes.
4859140	4860420	My gatekeeping time.
4861300	4865140	You must roll time before you can play again.
4865940	4868580	You must run a six before you can play again.
4868580	4868820	All right.
4868820	4872660	Anyway, I'm getting up.
4873620	4877380	We need to remake nightmare using Loki.
4878980	4883220	Hey, all right.
4883860	4885540	We're going to take a break when we come back.
4885540	4887940	Plenty more of orange launch radio to come, including rapid
4887940	4892100	fire news, release dates, some emails, and, uh, your calls
4892100	4893620	at orange lounge radio.
4893620	4895460	All one word on Skype.
4895460	4896100	Don't go anywhere.
4896100	4898740	We'll be back after this quick break with more of orange
4898740	4899700	lounge radio.
4899940	4905940	Welcome back, everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight,
4905940	4911140	February the 25th episode number 720 of our show, a very
4911140	4914020	appropriate choice for our classic game of the week.
4914020	4915540	Just before we took that break.
4915540	4918900	And now we're back to get into some rapid fire news.
4918900	4921540	Loki, why don't you start us off getting some rapid fire
4921540	4921940	news?
4921940	4925140	Yeah, we got more video game movie news.
4925140	4928260	Yeah, we got more video game movie news.
4928900	4933300	So they're apparently going to make Sonic the Hedgehog, the
4933300	4938900	movie confirmed to be in production with Paramount and
4938900	4941940	supposed to be coming out in November 2019 because the
4941940	4945140	minute they heard that a Mario movie was happening, somebody
4945140	4948420	had to make a fucking Sonic movie and his shitty friends
4948420	4949620	better stay away from it.
4949620	4950660	Who's making it?
4950660	4952660	Paramount Paramount.
4952660	4953140	Who's there?
4953140	4954340	What anime is the anime?
4954900	4956580	My friend calls them poop amount.
4956580	4957780	It better be animated.
4958580	4962260	I don't know who they're if it's a live action star, if it's
4962260	4966820	a live action Sonic movie starring David Vito as Sonic.
4966820	4967380	Let's hope.
4967380	4968420	Oh, my God.
4968420	4969700	Starring, you know.
4971460	4974500	Yeah, Ron Jeremy is Sonic the Hedgehog.
4975700	4976340	I'd love that.
4977220	4981860	Um, yes, apparently it's going to be directed by Jake Fowler
4981860	4986980	who apparently had an Academy Award for his work on the
4986980	4992980	animated show Short Gopher Broke and Tim Miller, who was
4992980	4994260	the director of Deadpool.
4995220	4997540	Another I guess he owned.
4997540	5000980	He's the owner of an animation and CG production company
5000980	5002340	called Blur Studios.
5002340	5003780	I don't know if they're going to be the ones that are
5003780	5005940	actually doing it, but yes, it'll be a mix.
5006660	5007220	Oh, no.
5007220	5015460	So it's scheduled to come out November 15, 2019 is a mix of
5015460	5017220	live action in CGI.
5020420	5021780	Oh, no, no.
5022740	5028100	Oh, yes, it's going to have Sonic in the real world alongside
5028100	5028900	humans.
5028900	5031780	Oh, God, like Sonic Adventure.
5031780	5033460	So this is already terrible.
5033460	5034740	This is already terrible.
5034740	5037220	I don't know.
5037220	5040020	It could have the whole Roger Rabbit vibe to it.
5040020	5046660	Because that works so well for Peter Rabbit, the Smurfs, the
5046660	5050420	Chipmunks, Sonic 2006, the next Chipmunks movie, probably
5050420	5052980	another Chipmunks movie, another Smurfs movie.
5053620	5055940	Um, Woody Woodpecker.
5057700	5060020	Those have all been smashing successes.
5060020	5060740	Hard pass.
5060740	5068660	So look forward to that in theaters next year, you know, or
5068660	5072660	not, because, you know, what am I judging?
5072660	5076260	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about games of gold.
5076260	5079940	So Microsoft has announced what the next lineup for games
5079940	5083540	of gold is going to be starting March 1st on Xbox one, you're
5083540	5086340	going to get trials of the blood dragon, and that's going
5086340	5087540	to run for the entire month.
5087540	5089300	And then for the second half of the month, you're also going
5089300	5093620	to get, um, or I should say from March 16th to April 15th,
5093620	5094180	super hot.
5095220	5099940	And then on Xbox 360 or the compatible games with Xbox one,
5099940	5102980	you're going to get brave the video game, you know, because
5102980	5106020	that movie tie in games, totally current.
5106020	5109060	And then how many years ago did that movie come out and then
5109060	5110340	quantum conundrum.
5111300	5114180	And that'll be the second half of March, March 16th through
5114180	5116900	the 31st, honestly, having played super hot and super
5117140	5119460	awesome trials of the blood dragons kind of, eh, it's all
5119460	5119860	right.
5119860	5120580	It's a trials game.
5120580	5121540	Trials games are all right.
5123220	5123540	All right.
5123540	5124180	Check this out.
5124180	5124820	If you have gold.
5125940	5129140	Well, um, you know, once something is on the internet, it
5129140	5130580	doesn't really go away.
5131140	5135380	That's because of an Instagram post that actress Emily O'Brien
5135380	5139140	made that said, quote, honored to be working aside these two
5139140	5143220	fine lads on Hideo Kojima's new project, death stranding.
5143220	5144500	I'm a lucky gal.
5144500	5147140	And it was a poster that had Norman Reedus, which we already
5147140	5150260	know is in the movie, Emily O'Brien, which we didn't know
5150260	5151380	in the movie in the game.
5151940	5152180	Sorry.
5152180	5152820	I thought poster.
5152820	5155940	My head immediately went to movie Emily O'Brien, which we
5155940	5158180	didn't know is in the game, but we do now.
5158180	5160100	And Troy Baker.
5160100	5162420	Well, then that's an instant purchase because I buy all the
5162420	5163700	games of Troy Baker in it.
5163700	5166180	What game isn't Troy Baker in these days?
5166980	5167860	Sonic the Hedgehog.
5169060	5169700	Now, now.
5171300	5173940	So confirmed, I suppose, thanks to Instagram.
5173940	5175620	Because, you know, even though she deleted the post, she
5175620	5176340	probably feels terrible.
5176340	5179060	But the reality is once it's out there, it's out there.
5179060	5182500	So it's confirmed that Emily O'Brien, Troy Baker in the game
5182500	5184740	as well, of course, Mads Mikkelsen, which we know about
5184740	5190020	before, and Guillermo del Toro as an actor, very, very, very
5190020	5193860	distinctly, possibly a best director, Oscar winning actor.
5193860	5196340	And the races show him in the leads.
5197060	5198340	I did love shape.
5198340	5198740	I see.
5198740	5200020	I want to go so good.
5200020	5202660	I know I want to go like I'm rooting for Greta Gerwig, but
5202660	5204180	can I be mad if he wins?
5204180	5205300	I really can't.
5205300	5207460	Like that's the thing about the Oscars and why I don't like
5207460	5209060	the huge race that it turns into.
5209060	5212420	Like there's so many good people that, you know, and good
5212420	5214820	movies like out of the movies I've seen that have been
5214820	5215220	nominated.
5215220	5216020	None of them were bad.
5216660	5221700	So yeah, I wouldn't be mad if he won because that movie was
5221700	5223060	amazing and deserves it.
5223060	5226980	I mean, I would love for Greta Gerwig to win for the women
5226980	5229940	power and, you know, seeing more women win those awards.
5230020	5234420	But, you know, he made a hell of a movie.
5234420	5235300	It's going to be hard.
5235300	5237300	So, but I'll be happy if either one win.
5237300	5237540	Yeah.
5237540	5238180	Yeah.
5238180	5238500	All right.
5238500	5241940	Anyhow, it's a privilege just to be nominated.
5241940	5242340	That's right.
5242340	5243940	It's a privilege just to be nominated.
5244980	5247300	The nominations are important, I think, you know?
5247300	5251940	So anyway, also important is your music library, because
5251940	5253700	I know it's what gets you through the day at work and why
5253700	5255220	many of you listen to podcasts.
5255220	5258900	Well, if you use Spotify or of course iTunes and, you know,
5258900	5262500	other places that you can find music, you can now check out
5262500	5267940	over 3000 music tracks by Zuntata.
5268500	5271860	That is the sound team who made Taito Games.
5271860	5276420	So over 3000 music tracks by Zuntata on Spotify.
5276420	5281540	That would mean, you know, Bubble Bobble, Arcanoid, Darius,
5282100	5283140	Ninja Warriors.
5283460	5286100	Oh, Arcanoid, boom, boom, boom.
5286100	5289300	Well, there was music in some later ones, but Groove Coaster.
5289300	5292820	I know those games are not the rhythm-based ones, but
5292820	5296100	probably the ones that were on phones and stuff.
5296100	5300020	So you can check out all those cool soundtracks all over Spotify.
5300020	5300660	Very, very cool.
5301620	5302340	Also on Amazon.
5302340	5303460	That was the store I left out.
5303460	5304500	So, all right.
5305380	5307460	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to releases?
5307460	5311780	Japanese Splatfest, which is, I don't know how many people are
5311860	5314260	familiar with the phrase Hanayori Dango.
5314260	5316900	There were also anime and manga called that too.
5318020	5323940	But it basically means dumplings over flowers for people who are
5323940	5326820	more practical versus people who are more aesthetic.
5328420	5333780	So the Japanese Splatfest coming up is Hana, which is flower,
5333780	5336020	versus Dango, which is dumplings.
5336020	5337620	And they're delicious.
5337620	5339140	Yeah, Team Dango all the way.
5340100	5343220	And see, as Sakura, I might have to go with Team Hana.
5343780	5344340	Just because.
5345380	5346500	So that is going to be...
5348020	5350180	We won't get anything as classy here.
5350180	5354260	We're going to get like Team Fartjoke versus Team Boobs.
5354260	5356340	Like that's Team Boobs.
5358260	5360020	That's what we'll get here in the States.
5360020	5362500	We're not going to get anything as philosophical.
5363780	5366020	Team Jake Paul versus Team Logan Paul.
5366020	5369140	Fuck all the way off.
5370260	5375140	But the thing is, I mean, we do get things that are more specific
5375140	5376420	to our culture or show.
5376420	5377300	So whatever.
5378580	5379860	You know, we should have like...
5380980	5382580	Team Chicken versus Team Egg.
5382580	5385060	But I feel like they did that before.
5385060	5386660	Like which came first, the chicken or the egg?
5387540	5389860	That's a saying you hear in our culture.
5389860	5392020	Team Carnivore versus Team Merbivore.
5392900	5395220	Oh, Carnivore is going to have such an edge.
5396020	5399780	You know, Team Media...
5399780	5403460	Oh, oh, oh, Team Round Earth versus Flat Earth.
5405300	5408900	No, because people with intelligence wouldn't want to even be associated
5408900	5411780	with that type of up to stupidity.
5411780	5415380	Team Flat Earth versus Team's vaccinations are harmful.
5417700	5418740	That's not even funny.
5420020	5421300	That is not even funny.
5422260	5423460	I couldn't help myself.
5423460	5423940	I'm sorry.
5423940	5426100	Well, if it's not funny, you better throw another story out there
5426100	5426980	before I think of more.
5426980	5430180	Team Tide Pod versus Team Differently Colored Tide Pod.
5431220	5431940	There we go.
5431940	5439620	Team Tide Pod.
5439620	5443940	She's laughing whether she's trying to show it or not and rubbing her head.
5443940	5446820	I see a smile underneath that when we said Tide Pod.
5446820	5449140	Just because I can't even right now.
5450900	5453140	You know, we should have Team Llama versus Team Malpaca.
5454260	5454900	What about that?
5456020	5459940	I'm sorry, I just I just love too much the whole, you know,
5459940	5465860	philosophical dumpling or flour versus Team Tide Pod versus Team Broken Glass.
5465860	5468180	This is America, land of the stupid.
5469460	5472340	Wasn't another like terrible eating trend thing.
5472340	5474660	I mean, they've got a cinnamon challenge.
5474660	5475460	Cinnamon challenge.
5475460	5477060	Yeah, that's not deadly, though.
5477060	5477780	So we got it.
5477780	5478580	No, yes, it is.
5479220	5479700	Really?
5479700	5480500	It is.
5480500	5482100	Cinnamon is very thermogenic.
5482100	5484180	It blocks your people have died from it.
5484180	5484820	Yeah.
5484820	5485620	Team Cinnamon Challenge.
5489060	5491780	What if they did like Team Cinnamon versus Team Ice Bucket?
5493460	5495140	But Ice Bucket was for a good cause.
5495140	5497620	See, that was the whole Lou Gehrig's disease awareness.
5497620	5499060	So that's hard dumb things.
5499060	5500900	Team Dab versus Team Plank.
5500900	5501540	I don't know.
5501540	5503700	OK, that's that's good.
5503700	5505060	Team Dab versus Team Plank.
5505780	5507060	Anyway, still stupid.
5507060	5508500	Betty White dabbed.
5508500	5511060	So automatically Team Dab.
5511060	5512260	Anyway, can we move on, please?
5513220	5516260	So there's going to be another Dungeons and Dragons movie.
5517140	5523540	And it is being actually the rumor as who the director is
5523540	5525620	would be Chris McKay.
5526660	5530500	He is in negotiations for the Dungeons and Dragons movie,
5530500	5533780	which, first of all, Krul was originally supposed to be
5533780	5535300	a Dungeons and Dragons movie.
5535300	5537380	And I saw that shit in the theater and it was great.
5538100	5540100	And then they did a Dungeons and Dragons movie.
5540100	5542420	And it was not great, but it was fun.
5542420	5543860	And it had Tom Baker in it.
5544980	5547060	So I love that movie because Tom Baker was in it.
5547620	5549220	That was the one from like the late 90s, right?
5549860	5550820	Early 2000s.
5550820	5551140	Was it?
5551140	5554820	OK, maybe mid 2000s, because but I just I just remembered
5554820	5556980	I only cared to watch it because Tom Baker was in it.
5556980	5559780	Bobby Blackwell says Team Dungeon versus Team Dragon.
5561220	5562100	No, I got it.
5562900	5565060	Team Fantasy versus Team Sci-Fi.
5565060	5567380	I they had to have done that one.
5567380	5568980	I'm most positive they did that one.
5568980	5572260	Yeah, maybe that or it was sci-fi and something.
5572260	5576420	I like I know they did that team elf versus team orc.
5577540	5580100	Maybe we need no collusion versus team.
5582100	5586020	No, too topical, too topical, too soon, too soon.
5586020	5586740	All right.
5586740	5587300	Let's try.
5588500	5588900	Oh, I'm sorry.
5588900	5589380	Is there more?
5589380	5590020	I'm sorry.
5590020	5593300	It was a little bit, but I forgot.
5593300	5594260	So, yeah, let's go.
5594900	5597060	It's as it's a Dungeons and Dragons movie,
5597060	5601140	which already means we're a little afraid, which means I'll probably see it.
5601140	5605380	But if Tom Baker is in it points, Tom Baker, though, is getting on.
5606420	5608100	Well, Tom Baker was just in that Dr.
5608100	5611140	Who thing not that long ago, a year and a half ago.
5611140	5612260	OK, it wasn't that long ago.
5612260	5614020	Maybe two years ago.
5614020	5614260	All right.
5614820	5616260	Anyway, let's move on.
5616260	5618980	We're going to travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.
5618980	5620340	Loki, what's coming out in the US?
5620340	5622260	It's like what's old is new again.
5622260	5626740	So we've got the blob to remastered the remastered that nobody asked for.
5627220	5629780	That's coming on PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5630340	5634660	We have girls and Panzer dream tank match.
5636740	5637780	That sounds weird.
5637780	5640420	I'm sure it involves anime girls in tanks.
5640420	5641300	I can only imagine.
5641940	5643060	We'll say no more.
5643060	5645220	Is it a dating sim where I can date a tank?
5645220	5650100	Because let's hope that sounds like it could be team anime versus team tank.
5652100	5653700	Tank Girl, the anime series.
5654820	5655700	I would watch that.
5656500	5660420	Gravel on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5661540	5667700	Heroin Anthem Zero on PlayStation four and Payday two on Nintendo Switch.
5668500	5671140	And we have Darkest Dungeon on Xbox one.
5671860	5679220	And one week from today, Death End Request on PlayStation four.
5679220	5680580	Well, that sounds pleasant.
5682740	5683220	All right.
5684180	5688660	Let's hop on a plane and go to Japan and check out the releases this week in Japan.
5688660	5690820	Actually, I'm not seeing a lot this week in Japan.
5690820	5697220	The only things I see is that there is a Dragon Ball FighterZ arcade stick that's coming out.
5697220	5698340	So if you want to check that out.
5699060	5703700	Also coming out in Japan, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Advanced Edition.
5703700	5705380	That is coming out in Japan this week.
5705380	5707140	That's at least in on the PlayStation four.
5707140	5707860	There must be something.
5707860	5709940	Is there something on the Switch this week that is the reason?
5710740	5713540	Well, Doom gets its Japanese release this week.
5713540	5714740	That's a pretty big deal.
5714740	5719140	As well as Dragon Quest Builders gets its Japanese release this week as well.
5719140	5721460	You know, that game came out on the Switch not that long ago over here.
5722260	5727940	And then on the 3DS, Doraemon Nobita no Takara Jima comes out this week.
5727940	5729540	So there it is.
5729540	5731700	That's really it for the Japanese releases this week.
5731700	5732900	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5733460	5735060	A few things.
5735060	5742500	On the 27th, we have Apocalypsis, Harry at the End of the World on Mac and PC.
5742500	5745300	And DeBlob 2 for Xbox One.
5745300	5748260	On March 1st, we have Subsurface Circular for Switch.
5748820	5750100	That's kind of a cool name.
5750100	5751060	I name a band that.
5752500	5753000	All right.
5753700	5756980	I think it's now time for us to dive into the mailbag.
5757620	5758740	It smells funny.
5759780	5762740	DarkSakura is going to get on her skateboard in 720.
5762740	5763700	Is this Anthrax?
5763700	5764900	Right into the mailbag.
5765460	5766980	And find some emails.
5766980	5768340	Every week you guys can email us.
5768340	5771060	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5771060	5775220	If you want to have your email read here on air or deleted on site.
5775220	5775860	No, I'm just kidding.
5775860	5776580	We don't.
5776580	5780100	The only time we've ever not read emails was either like they were just mean.
5780100	5781540	Like they were like, not nice.
5781540	5782260	We don't read those.
5783060	5786980	Or we would just press for time, which that does happen once in a while.
5786980	5790020	Like the one week, like some weeks, nobody will email us.
5790020	5791940	And then one week we get 10 emails.
5791940	5794180	Dear DarkSakura, I love you forever.
5794180	5795860	Here's 50 million dollars.
5795860	5797140	Why thank you, stranger.
5797140	5797780	I'll take it.
5798660	5799160	No.
5800900	5802260	This one's just labeled correction.
5802260	5805460	So I don't know what the correction's about, but it comes from Robert M.
5806100	5812980	Harmonix beats sports, which seems to me more related to Rhythm Heaven than to Wii Sports.
5812980	5814820	Is not an Apple TV exclusive.
5814820	5816980	Well, not since it's released on the Switch.
5816980	5818980	I really ought to check it out sometime.
5818980	5820180	And it's from Robert M.
5820180	5823140	Already investing this week's vog points from the podcast checking.
5824340	5828980	And don't forget to check in every week to spend your points on nothing.
5828980	5831780	But it makes you look good at vognetwork.com.
5831780	5833380	You can check in if you're live.
5833380	5834980	You can check in while you're listening live.
5834980	5839220	Or, of course, you can use a passphrase hidden somewhere in the episode to check in that way.
5840020	5842820	As far as the email goes, yeah, it came up last week.
5842820	5844020	I don't remember the discussion.
5844020	5846660	We were talking about Apple TV and like the limited games that were on it.
5846660	5848020	And I mentioned the harmonix game.
5848020	5850820	I had no idea they ported that to Switch, actually.
5850820	5856660	See, that's an example of a game that got lost amongst all those Switch releases is I had no idea.
5856660	5860100	Everybody's talking about when it comes to harmonix these days, everybody's talking about drop
5860100	5861220	mix, right?
5862260	5865540	You know who super got into drop mix is Shane.
5865540	5867860	He has like every single card you can get.
5867860	5869540	I think he might be missing one.
5869540	5871220	But yeah, like, but that gives a lot of fun.
5871220	5876580	So well, also speaking of Shane and from the same email or another email.
5876580	5880420	Just to add, kind of disappointing to see that Ranger Pride hasn't updated since July.
5881140	5883380	Unless I'm missing something, you are.
5883380	5886500	I would love to hear Shane's take on the Toy Fair announcement.
5886500	5890740	Well, funny you should send that email in, because probably the day after you sent that,
5890740	5893540	Ranger Pride came back with a brand new episode.
5893540	5898580	And they actually, they really explain why they've been gone for a few months.
5898580	5904500	And it's very honest and kind of brave for them to be very blunt and upfront about what's going on.
5904500	5907700	So check it out, Ranger fan or not, honestly.
5907700	5911380	But they talk about some of the things that have been missed.
5912900	5916740	Another one that came through our website from Shash OG.
5917460	5918420	Hey, OLR.
5918420	5921700	So many characters is allowed when sending you an email.
5921700	5924020	I typed what didn't seem to be that long of an email.
5924020	5926740	A couple paragraphs at most, and it says it's too long to send.
5926740	5929860	I'm trying to send from orange.radio.com.
5929860	5930740	Love the show, by the way.
5931620	5933220	Just email us directly.
5933220	5936340	Yeah, honestly, I would say 10 times over,
5936340	5939860	just send directly an email to participate at orange.radio.com.
5939860	5945140	The website is there to try to make the process easier, but obviously it's not.
5945860	5950500	Also, I am well aware our website is extremely out of date.
5950500	5954900	I mean, we're so thankful to Dekeman and VX JasonXV
5954900	5957060	without who we wouldn't even have a website.
5957060	5959460	And in Jason's case, we wouldn't have an intro every week.
5959460	5965060	But the reality is that websites get old and we know ours is growing mold.
5965060	5965700	It's pretty old.
5966340	5967060	Hey, I rhymed.
5968100	5971780	So, yeah, we just need to give that whole stuff a kick in the butt.
5973540	5980340	Well, to bring a point to that, when I finish my current WordPress project, it can happen.
5981220	5981620	Awesome.
5981620	5985700	Just be sure to team up with Mr. Jason, because without Jason, I would...
5986580	5992340	Here's the thing, the podcast feed came in from an old PHP Nuke run website
5992340	5996340	into the Joomla thing that is there now into whatever you're going to build.
5996340	5998900	The beauty is like it still fucking works.
5998900	6002420	And I almost feel like Jason like wrote it from scratch at one point.
6002420	6006900	So just make sure you work with him to not break the most important part of the site.
6006900	6009300	Have time to make it happen in the next couple of months because
6009940	6012740	I'm still working on one for charity I'm involved in.
6013140	6014740	But a new website would be rad.
6014740	6015300	I'm not gonna lie.
6016100	6017620	So last email.
6017620	6018100	Yep.
6018100	6019060	Hello, LR.
6019060	6020100	We know who this is.
6020100	6020820	Oh, boy.
6020820	6022420	That sounds like a YYR email.
6022420	6023060	You are correct.
6023780	6027700	I come to you with a couple of rebuttals from last week's Skypline segment.
6027700	6028900	Yes, rebuttals.
6028900	6030580	Also, I just made you say butt.
6030580	6031460	No, go away.
6031460	6032660	Buy super multitasking.
6032660	6033620	End of email.
6033620	6034420	Okay.
6034420	6035060	You know what?
6035060	6039220	I said cat butt at the start of the show, which is the best kind of butt that can exist.
6039220	6042900	So cat butts are the best butts.
6043300	6044260	I'm just gonna leave it at that.
6045940	6050580	The first is for Kai Judo, who was talking about a game he felt could be the VR equivalent
6050580	6051300	of Wii Sports.
6051300	6055860	The problem is that, in at least my opinion, there will never be a VR equivalent of Wii
6055860	6057460	Sports for one simple reason.
6057460	6061460	Wii Sports attracted people when they saw other people playing it and then thought,
6061460	6062420	wow, that looks like fun.
6062420	6063540	I want to try it.
6063540	6069460	The simple and sad fact is that there's no way to get even an approximation of what a
6069460	6072820	game is actually like in VR until you physically play it.
6073060	6076740	This is, I think, one of the main things holding VR back from the mainstream.
6077380	6081700	I really think that the best way for VR producers to combat this is to load up Dave and Buster's
6081700	6085060	VR experiences, but that's another discussion for another time.
6086420	6092100	My second response is for Actdeft, who insisted that Super Smash Brothers Melee needs to die.
6092900	6097700	Beyond the fact that it was a fantastic game when it was released in 2001, if you're looking
6097700	6101460	for the reason Melee was and continues to be so popular, look no further than Super
6101460	6102340	Smash Brothers Brawl.
6103060	6107700	Brawl released in 2008, it brought new character stages and items and looked better than ever,
6107700	6113060	but the core gameplay was changed quite a bit, mostly to appeal to casual players.
6113060	6116980	Several changes were made to the physics to slow down the speed of the game, making it
6116980	6119780	more accessible but lowering the intensity of the action.
6119780	6121940	Also, elements of chance were added.
6121940	6126020	I'm not sure if you remember, but characters could actually trip while running, render
6126020	6127940	them temporarily helpless.
6127940	6132980	This was actually 100% random, and most serious fighting game players would agree that the
6132980	6135940	elements of luck do not belong in a skill-based game.
6138340	6142420	For these concerns, Super Smash Brothers Brawl was completely rejected by the fighting game
6142420	6143460	community.
6143460	6144340	So what did they do?
6144340	6145860	They went back to Melee, of course.
6145860	6151300	Other than the official Project M, which was a fan-made mod of Brawl to make it feel more
6151300	6155380	like Melee, there was no version of Super Smash Brothers that was taken seriously by
6155460	6158900	the tournament scene until Smash 4 released in 2014.
6159620	6164180	By this point, folks had been playing Melee for 13 years, so had gotten very used to it,
6164180	6165220	and guess what?
6165220	6170500	While Smash 4 was a big improvement, many would argue that it still is not as faster
6170500	6171860	intense as Melee.
6171860	6176100	With the exception of the mediocre character balance, Melee still holds up very well in
6176100	6180420	2018 as a competitive game, and that is why people still want to play it, watch it, and
6180420	6181540	enjoy it in general.
6181540	6182820	So, um, sorry?
6183700	6185300	That's all I've got for this week.
6185300	6189140	Now excuse me while I continue to look for new Twitch videos of people playing challenge
6189140	6192980	mode of super multitasking so I can laugh at them when they fail.
6192980	6195380	BobbyBlackWolf may have been right.
6195380	6199940	I guess I am a bit of a sadist after all, or perhaps more than a bit, maybe.
6199940	6201620	Happy gaming, AaronYYR.
6202500	6207700	Alright, so we have rebuttals to the rebuttal in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6207940	6213140	Kaijuto says, not correct, people can see you playing in the living room AND watch the
6213140	6214980	TV, so I call BS.
6215940	6219940	It sounds like it would depend on which VR experiences, you guys might be thinking of
6219940	6224820	two different VR experiences, whereas something like I believe Oculus Rift does not really
6224820	6226020	let you do that.
6226020	6226980	PlayStation VR.
6226980	6227460	You can.
6227460	6228180	Oh, does it?
6228180	6229140	Yeah, you can do that.
6229140	6229620	Oh.
6229620	6234180	Well, I know PlayStation VR does, like you can do the VR thing and see what's on the
6234180	6236980	TV, but I don't, I didn't think every VR headset let you do that.
6236980	6237540	Yeah, you can.
6237780	6238660	Okay, well then I stay graphic.
6238660	6241620	And they even have some where it's more advanced where you can actually set up virtual
6241620	6246020	cameras, so you can actually put yourself in a green screen in the middle of the environment,
6246660	6250420	and you can actually see yourself interacting like you were a character there.
6250420	6256340	But I do, I do understand to some extent the point that Aaron's trying to make where it's
6256340	6263460	like, and because I was in the same boat, you don't get VR until you do VR, right?
6263460	6267300	Because I didn't get VR until Bobby was like, hi, you're in my hometown.
6267300	6268500	We're at a convention together.
6268500	6269540	You're gonna fucking play this.
6269540	6271620	He didn't put it that way, but that's essentially what it was.
6271620	6276100	And I did it and I was like, alright, I understand why you are obsessed.com with VR.
6276660	6277540	This is a lot of fun.
6277540	6278580	This is great.
6278580	6285220	So I kind of get that to an extent, but at the same time, you could kind of say the same
6285220	6289060	thing about Wii Sports even is that it's one thing to watch Wii Sports, but then when you
6289060	6291540	kind of actually get in there and do it, it's different.
6291540	6292820	So I don't know.
6293460	6296980	I'm Switzerland in this debate, but I appreciate the spirited argument.
6298340	6303540	Also, we have a rebuttal to the rebuttal from Act Deft, who says that's the thing.
6303540	6305300	We have Smash 4.
6305300	6310500	Brawl was awful for the competitive scene, but Smash 4 fixed all the problems Brawl had.
6310500	6313700	So it sounds like Act Deft is kind of taking issue to the fact that we kind of glossed
6313700	6316740	over the fact that we do have the Smash 4.
6316740	6318260	He brought up Smash 4, though.
6318260	6318500	Yeah.
6318500	6321940	And so the problem with Smash 4 is that it's still a little bit slower and doesn't have
6321940	6323860	the same level of intensity.
6323860	6329220	But to be fair, that's not quite the criticism the Brawl got in that.
6329220	6331060	I think it's a little slower.
6332020	6334820	I mean, again, I don't want to take sides.
6334820	6336100	I appreciate all you gamers.
6336100	6336660	I really do.
6338740	6340100	But yeah, I get both sides.
6340100	6340420	I do.
6341060	6341560	All right.
6342340	6343460	So I think that's that.
6343460	6345380	I think that's it for the emails.
6345380	6345940	Was that it?
6345940	6346660	Last one?
6346660	6347140	That's it.
6347140	6347860	All right.
6347860	6352740	You can send us an email to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send
6352740	6356100	us an email if you want to send that in a future week.
6356100	6359060	But we have some more news to get to, starting with Loki.
6359060	6359380	Yes.
6360980	6365700	So this is kind of a weird little game, but, you know, you may remember there was actually
6365700	6369700	a Mario game that came out on the system as well, the Sharp X1 computer.
6369700	6374100	So it was a game that's actually published and developed by Hudson Soft.
6374740	6380020	This is Donkey Kong 3, the great counter attack.
6380020	6384740	And it's definitely a lot different from most Donkey Kong games.
6384740	6388820	You actually play this character named Stanley and you're shooting.
6390020	6396820	I guess a gun or something up at Donkey Kong, who is falling down, holding some parachutes
6396820	6398660	and there's birds and stuff flying around.
6398660	6400020	You have to shoot as well.
6400020	6403220	And the goal is to get Donkey Kong up to the top of the stage.
6404340	6411940	And apparently this recently sold for, I guess, $415 on a Yahoo Auction, which I forgot that
6411940	6413860	even Yahoo Auctions was a thing still.
6415380	6420420	But apparently now there's some actual screenshots and video of the actual game as well.
6420980	6426740	But yeah, I remember there was a Mario game, too, that got released on there that was kind
6426740	6430180	of different that someone then later created.
6430180	6434420	And yeah, Super Mario Brothers Special was the other one that they also released.
6435460	6437700	That was on the PC-ABI.
6441700	6442260	Interesting.
6442260	6442740	I don't know.
6442740	6443700	I watched the gameplay.
6443700	6450580	It looks kind of boring, but it's neat to find these unique games that we probably didn't
6450580	6451540	even know existed.
6452100	6457380	Yeah, honestly, as much as I appreciate the old computer history and stuff, I totally
6457380	6460660	forgot about this whole Sharp had the license stuff.
6460660	6462020	So I didn't even...
6462020	6466900	When I first heard new Donkey Kong game was unearthed, I thought they finally got that
6466900	6468900	music game that was originally...
6468900	6472180	It's in some of the promo material for the Japanese Nintendo Entertainment System.
6472180	6474100	You know how there's Donkey Kong Junior Math, right?
6474100	6477940	There was a Donkey Kong music game that showed up in some ads recently.
6477940	6479060	I've been seeing floating around Twitter.
6479060	6480500	I thought that was the game they unearthed.
6480500	6482900	And then when I actually kind of went into the article and read about it, I was like,
6482900	6484340	oh shit, I didn't even realize.
6484340	6488260	So they just kind of recycled Donkey Kong 3's assets in another game.
6490260	6492660	Because Donkey Kong 3 was so different.
6493700	6496980	I think it's one of the few YouTube videos I did some years ago was about...
6496980	6498740	I don't think I've ever played Donkey Kong 3.
6498740	6502980	It's just different, because whereas Donkey Kong 1 and 2 are like platformers, Donkey
6502980	6504580	Kong 3 is basically a shooter.
6504580	6505780	Yeah, that's what this is too.
6505780	6508420	So I guess I didn't realize that that was what the game was.
6508420	6511940	But it keeps shooting Donkey Kong in the testicles until he flies away.
6511940	6512820	That's exactly what it is.
6512820	6513940	That's what you do in Donkey Kong 3.
6513940	6517140	It's basically you're shooting him up the vine to try to get rid of him because he's
6517140	6518900	a pest and you're trying to shoot the other bugs too.
6519940	6521700	And then that guy never showed up.
6521700	6524500	Stanley, the exterminator, whatever his name is, never showed up again.
6525220	6526820	You would think he'd be perfect for Brawl.
6526820	6528260	New Smash Brothers character.
6528260	6531460	I would think, or I say Brawl, but you know Smash Brothers, you think he'd be a perfectly
6531460	6534260	Smash Brothers character, like from deep from the archives.
6534260	6537060	No, they need to be like Captain Rainbow before they do that shit.
6537060	6539860	If they can do fucking Duck Hunt, they can do Stanley.
6541220	6541860	That's my thought.
6542580	6546100	Did the power pad have any sort of like mascot characters or anything?
6546100	6552340	Not really, because both those games, the world-class track meet and the bandai, or
6552340	6556500	whoever did the power pad in the first place, like stadium events, you know, the very rare
6556500	6557140	power glove.
6557140	6558260	We'll just have the power glove.
6559220	6560660	But that also was not Nintendo.
6561380	6564660	That was the third party peripheral.
6564660	6568260	So they have to do, well, I mean, it's not that they can't ever get third party stuff,
6568260	6571300	but you know, it's harder when that comes into play.
6572100	6572420	All right.
6573220	6577300	Well, let's move on to talk about something that Sony has rolled out this week for those
6577300	6580180	of you that enjoy sharing your PlayStation stuff online.
6581460	6584340	You can now share PlayStation profiles online.
6585060	6587700	PlayStation has put user profiles on the web.
6587700	6592500	If you go to the PlayStation website and use a tab in the upper right that says My PlayStation,
6592500	6596980	you can see what a classic, basically a classic PlayStation page would look like.
6596980	6598900	There's a lot of white space in it.
6598900	6603940	You can't really customize a lot online, but you can get a sense on your desktop or on
6603940	6608020	your mobile what the profiles are going to look like on a PlayStation.
6608020	6611620	You can only change the headers on an actual PlayStation and all of that stuff.
6612260	6613780	But at least it's something.
6613780	6617540	It's a little more minimalist than what is on the Xbox side of things.
6617540	6622420	But I think some people think the Xbox website's a little cluttered, so it works.
6622420	6626820	So we'll see how this develops as it gets refined and so forth.
6626820	6629860	But I think that's kind of neat that PlayStation profiles are on the web.
6630740	6634900	I don't know how many of you guys actually look at other people's profiles online on
6634900	6638500	these types of websites, but once in a while, I go to like a Steam profile, maybe.
6639140	6644820	I leveled up on Steam today because all the 20XX streaming, I was able to make a new badge.
6645780	6647140	So fun.
6647940	6649940	All right, let's move on to Dark Sakura.
6650740	6660340	Well, one of our favorite Twitters, the Kazurai CEO, is going to discontinue the Twitter as
6660340	6664100	of June 15th, so right after E3 this year.
6664100	6668340	But the person doing it wants to go out with something important.
6669220	6670740	And I'll just read what the quote says.
6671540	6675860	Like the PlayStation Network, my Twitter account has provided a free online service to gamers
6675860	6676900	for many years.
6676900	6680020	But just like the PlayStation Network, I've decided to change that.
6680020	6684900	Kazurai's CEO is moving to a free-to-read business model with microtransactions for
6684900	6685460	charity.
6686100	6692820	So basically, he hopes to collect 599 pounds for SpecialEffect, which is a British group
6693380	6699380	that helps people with physical conditions play video games that they might not otherwise
6699380	6699940	be able to.
6700900	6707060	So it's adaptive technology that helps people, you know, whether using customized controllers
6707060	6709300	or letting people use eye movement tools.
6709300	6718420	So, but already he's, well, at least as of what, a day ago, he's raised about 37% of
6718420	6718900	that goal.
6718900	6719940	Oh, that's great.
6719940	6725300	So I'd say go ahead and join in, try to help out because it's for a good cause.
6725300	6728180	And well, it'd be nice to see it go out with a bang.
6728260	6730820	Do you think this person is going to reveal themselves on the way out?
6730820	6731380	Who it is?
6731380	6737220	I mean, I imagine the author is not somebody that is from a AAA gaming website or something.
6737220	6739220	I imagine it's just somebody, you know, who's...
6740100	6741540	I think it's going to be like V.
6743060	6743620	Meaning?
6743620	6744580	It's not the name.
6744580	6745380	It's the idea.
6745380	6745700	I see.
6747780	6748180	All right.
6748180	6749540	They're not the face or the person.
6749540	6753700	It will be like the masked magician who reveals all the secrets and then finally reveals who
6753700	6754340	they are in the end.
6755300	6756740	We've already got Penn and Teller for that.
6758180	6758660	All right.
6758660	6762980	Just a few more stories before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all
6762980	6764180	one word on Skype.
6765060	6765860	Let's get to it.
6765860	6768020	Loki, I like this story that Loki's going to get into.
6768020	6769300	So yeah, this is kind of cool.
6769300	6777300	So there was a 14 year old fan of the game Firewatch who was inspired after playing the
6777300	6781220	game to kind of go visit some of these fire watch towers.
6781700	6788260	And so actually, you know, traveled quite a bit with his dad around the country.
6788260	6791540	Just, you know, says travel almost 1200 miles.
6792260	6798580	And finally, I guess one of their last trips, he found a...
6800180	6800740	What was that?
6800740	6803940	There was a watchtower that was in Wadley Mountain.
6804660	6807620	And when they got there, they'd stay there quite late.
6807620	6812740	And apparently some of the other trips they were talking about, they basically just visit
6812740	6814020	all these different places.
6814020	6818180	Well, there's one actually in particular, though, that is kind of run down that they're
6818180	6823220	looking at, you know, actually kind of helping bring this back.
6823220	6826340	So I guess there's this...
6826340	6830020	I didn't even realize that they had this whole associated with the FFLA.
6832340	6837540	Basically, they have this several chapters across both the North America and United States
6838500	6847060	and with that, they're talking about like, I guess, bringing back one of these towers,
6847060	6851860	which honestly, compared to like the game, these are pretty basic.
6851860	6854100	It's not like actually enclosed and nice like that.
6854100	6857700	It's more of just like, you know, open air tower or whatever.
6859700	6865460	But yeah, basically he's been inspired to try to help restore one of these towers.
6866180	6867220	That's pretty rad, though.
6867780	6872660	Even if it isn't exactly like the game, that's pretty cool that the game kind of inspired...
6872660	6876180	We always hear such negativity about video games and so forth.
6876180	6879620	And video games cause these horrific things to happen in the world.
6879620	6881620	And I'm so sick of that narrative.
6881620	6883460	It's really nice to hear that.
6883460	6888420	Oh, but video games also have inspired people to get into history, which is essentially
6888420	6892980	what a lot of this with the fire towers and so forth is before we had satellites to do
6892980	6893780	a lot of this.
6893780	6896100	Apparently, yeah, there used to be a lot more of these towers.
6896100	6901700	But like a lot of them have been just run down, either have been burned by wildfires
6901700	6904900	themselves or just been disassembled or whatever.
6904900	6908340	And so kind of looking to kind of preserve some of these things are kind of neat.
6908340	6909300	Which is weird.
6910020	6911620	There was more to the game, too.
6911620	6913780	The game wasn't really about the tower.
6913780	6916500	I mean, it was because it was kind of like your base of operations.
6916500	6918020	But there was obviously a whole nother layer.
6918020	6921460	I mean, I guess minor spoiler alert, but it's basically...
6922500	6923140	I don't...
6923140	6925860	It's basically a how did this person die type of mystery.
6926180	6928260	Type of thing is what the game basically boils down to.
6928260	6937220	But, you know, it's cool that this kind of inspired somebody to, you know, maybe save
6937220	6938820	one of these somewhere else.
6938820	6939140	Yeah.
6939140	6939640	Neat.
6940180	6941060	All right.
6941060	6945300	Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com says kid needs a girlfriend bad.
6945300	6946100	Don't be mean.
6947060	6949620	Just because you have a hobby doesn't mean you don't have girlfriends.
6949620	6949780	Yeah.
6949780	6952660	Would you say that to every boy scout out there or whatever?
6952660	6956980	You know, people get into interesting causes and so forth.
6956980	6958100	So, all right.
6958100	6959060	I like this.
6959060	6960020	At least it's doing good.
6960820	6961320	Okay.
6962020	6966660	One more thing before we get to the Skype line tonight at Orange Launch Radio.
6966660	6972740	And that has to do with a new Pokemon Go-esque type of game coming out.
6972740	6976260	And this one is based on Ghostbusters.
6976260	6977300	That's right.
6977300	6979780	Ghostbusters World is coming.
6979780	6985220	It's a collaborative effort between Sony Pictures Entertainment, Ghostcore, and publisher
6985220	6986820	433, Inc.
6986820	6988820	You'll notice Niantic is not involved with this one.
6988820	6990820	So, it's different companies.
6990820	6993460	I'll try it, but like, I don't know.
6993460	6996180	Neither is the company behind Garfield Go.
6996180	6997940	So, it is not out yet.
6997940	6999140	They just have a teaser trailer.
6999140	7001140	I see Loki getting his phone, but it's not out yet.
7001140	7007380	No, my phone was starting to dig against my keys and that's how the screen gets cracked.
7007940	7011060	There's a teaser trailer, but it really doesn't show any gameplay.
7011060	7014980	But neither really did the Pokemon Go teaser trailer and that didn't seem to stop that.
7014980	7018340	So, anyway, you're apparently in this game going to be able to catch specters, ghosts,
7018340	7019700	and apparitions with your phone.
7020340	7021540	It uses AR.
7021540	7024500	So, you see the ghosts over, you know, your usual things.
7025220	7029700	So, I'm assuming it isn't going to use like real world landmarks, which is what, you know,
7029700	7031220	Pokemon Go and Ingress do.
7031220	7034500	Instead, it's going to use the world around you to be able to, you know, have the ghosts
7034500	7035860	appear and so forth.
7035860	7037300	So, let's see.
7037300	7042500	They don't say when it's coming out, but I guess in the next year or so.
7043140	7047380	Probably whenever Harry Potter Wizards Unite comes out, because we know that is coming
7047380	7048900	and Niantic is involved.
7048900	7050020	Here's the bandwagon.
7050020	7051060	Let's jump on it.
7051060	7051700	Might as well.
7052340	7052900	Might as well.
7052900	7054740	How's Draconis going these days?
7054740	7056500	That was the real big knockoff.
7056500	7059860	It's like the same fucking game, but with these different characters.
7060500	7061140	All right.
7061140	7061640	It's...
7062820	7064100	I'll still check it out.
7064100	7064820	You know what?
7064820	7067780	Pretty much any like AR based game.
7067780	7068580	I've checked it out.
7068580	7069060	Try it out.
7069060	7069540	Delete it.
7069540	7069860	Whatever.
7069860	7070420	Exactly.
7070420	7074820	I played Garfield Go for two minutes and then I was like, garbage.
7074820	7076020	It's absolute shit.
7076020	7076820	All right.
7076820	7077860	Orange Lounge Radio.
7077860	7078980	All one word on Skype.
7078980	7082340	If you want to give us a call and say hello and talk about anything we've talked about
7082340	7086100	tonight, or maybe there's something else you want to get into while we wait to see if any
7086100	7086740	calls come in.
7086740	7089460	Let me check in with the Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.
7089460	7089700	Yeah.
7089700	7094580	So, even though Melger Survive is a big pile of shit, you may remember that
7095460	7098100	Konami has some trouble thanking Kojima for some stuff.
7098100	7104420	Well, the developers of the game hid some stuff in Melger Survive to kind of pay homage
7104420	7109140	to Kojima, including there is a list of some of the different combat units.
7109140	7114980	And if you look at the initials of the last word in each one, it says KJP Forever or Kojima
7114980	7116580	Productions Forever.
7116580	7122820	And then, of course, it has Yoda and Yuji at the bottom there, which are the designers
7122820	7127540	of the Melger Survive game kind of, you know, paying homage to him.
7127540	7129300	So good for them.
7129300	7134580	And I know they sort of paid homage to they said, you know, like credit to the, you know,
7134580	7136340	Melger team or something like that.
7136340	7140580	But yeah, it's it kind of sucks, the whole situation.
7140580	7143620	But it's neat to get that hidden in there.
7143620	7144980	I wonder if someone's gonna get in trouble now.
7146500	7148260	I it's too late now.
7148260	7150100	The game's out there and people have it.
7150740	7154020	I guess that would be extreme.
7154020	7155860	I would be like really surprised.
7155860	7156740	Be a big dick.
7156740	7158180	That would be a very big dick move.
7158180	7161060	But then again, so would be delisting PT completely.
7161060	7162180	And here we are.
7162900	7164100	So I know it also.
7164100	7166260	Let's talk about why Melger Survive is shit.
7166980	7170340	Ten dollars a save slot in a game.
7171060	7172580	Ten dollars a save slot.
7172580	7173700	You have one character slot.
7173700	7175300	If you want to unlock the other three.
7175300	7177060	Ten dollars each one.
7177060	7179220	Oh, hey, my more inventory slots.
7179220	7181700	Those are going to cost you three to five dollars each.
7181700	7182740	Is it a cell phone game?
7183300	7187220	No, it's a it's an it's an well, because it sounds like a cell phone game.
7187220	7188820	And then what else do they have?
7188820	7192980	They also had, of course, you can buy boost packs to do different things in the game.
7192980	7194820	So they have their own microtransactions.
7194820	7199780	And in like additional throw it in loadouts or whatever additional loadouts, I think,
7199780	7201780	cost like five bucks each as well.
7201780	7204820	If you want loadout slots, throw it in the trash.
7204820	7205940	Well, absolute garbage.
7205940	7210980	J.D. with a counterpoint saying, to be fair, MMOs charge for character slots.
7210980	7215700	I think EverQuest may have back in the day, but OFAVS11 did.
7215700	7217780	I know OFAVS11 did charge for character slots.
7217780	7218660	Wow, doesn't.
7218660	7220420	Yeah, well, with that, though.
7220420	7224580	And I understand like, OK, you want to charge for that because of like server space or whatever,
7224580	7225300	which is dumb.
7225300	7226100	It's an excuse.
7226100	7228100	But this is a single player game.
7228100	7232820	Yes, I know they force online connectivity all the time, but it's mostly a single player game.
7232820	7237700	No, I appreciate the trying to find a reason why.
7237700	7240660	But no, Konami is just being douches.
7241380	7241880	All right.
7242660	7244660	Oh, Guild Wars does this a lot.
7244660	7249300	Guild Wars doesn't charge a monthly fee, so they pay for the servers in other ways, right?
7249300	7251460	And do they charge for their expansions, though?
7251460	7253860	They do charge their expansions, but so does any other.
7253860	7255460	So does WoW, so does 14.
7255460	7256180	Any of them do.
7256820	7262260	So anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
7263620	7267940	Akuma JP in chat says, Loki, don't you know how hard it is to make a memory slot?
7269780	7272420	I thought you would just take the first one and just kind of copy that.
7274340	7279460	JD points out, is this a one time cost or recurring is a one time ten dollar cost, right?
7279460	7280820	One time for each slot.
7280820	7281780	One time for each slot.
7283140	7284340	So thirty dollars.
7284340	7284840	Wow.
7285460	7289620	Dungeon Buster says the division from Ubisoft gives you four character slots for free.
7289620	7291300	Destiny two gives you three.
7291300	7295540	Yeah, it's also it's also just kind of dirty that it's one character slot for free.
7296260	7296820	One.
7296820	7298740	That's a little that's a little silly.
7299700	7302340	Well, they're assuming that you're going to want to replay through this game more than
7302340	7305940	once anyways, which no, I don't think so.
7305940	7308740	I have a feeling the phone is assuming you're going to want to play through it once.
7309940	7312260	I have a feeling the phones aren't going to go off tonight.
7312260	7317380	I don't know if that's a Celebrity Big Brother finale or if that's the Olympic closing ceremony.
7317380	7319700	I thought Celebrity Big Brother was already over.
7319700	7320980	No, Big Brother ends tonight.
7321620	7325300	Oh, because I was like, didn't Courtney Act already win that?
7325300	7325700	Oh, no.
7325700	7327140	Celebrity Big Brother US.
7327140	7327460	OK.
7327460	7328660	The one that who's left.
7328660	7330340	It's I don't watch it.
7330340	7331380	So it's all those.
7331380	7331880	Yeah.
7332420	7334180	Omarosa is not going to win the whole thing.
7334180	7335780	It's going to be and I haven't watched.
7335780	7336500	I haven't watched.
7336500	7337620	I said this a week ago.
7337620	7340180	I think Marissa was playing the best game out of anybody.
7340180	7341860	So that's who I get.
7341860	7343780	Marissa Janae Whitaker.
7343780	7344280	Who?
7346100	7349300	Oh, she she won the Tony for Hairspray.
7349300	7349800	She was.
7351140	7352660	Good morning, Baltimore.
7352660	7353620	Tracy Turnblad.
7353620	7354260	Is that her name?
7354260	7354740	OK.
7354740	7355240	Yeah.
7355540	7356040	Anyway.
7356660	7358420	If it's the new Hairspray, I didn't see it.
7358420	7359060	All right.
7359060	7363220	Let's go to the Skype line where we have a call.
7363220	7364260	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7364260	7364760	Who's this?
7365220	7365860	It's Ron.
7365860	7367540	I hear you're not getting any calls tonight.
7367540	7368580	Yeah, well, we do.
7368580	7369220	You fixed it.
7369220	7369940	Thank you so much.
7369940	7370660	What's up, my friend?
7371220	7371700	Not much.
7371700	7375540	I only called because I needed to correct you on something you said on last week's episode.
7376100	7377460	Oh, well, please.
7377460	7378660	I live for getting corrected.
7378660	7380020	This is episode rebuttal.
7382820	7383320	OK.
7384500	7389060	You know, just as much as you do, I love my 80s shows, my 90s shows.
7389060	7393060	There are times I sit there and listen to the full theme to growing pains because it's
7393060	7393940	friggin awesome.
7393940	7397940	But you talked about the Hogan family last week.
7397940	7398440	I did.
7399140	7399640	Yes.
7400020	7401620	You said that was Valerie Bertinelli.
7403460	7405460	It was the other Valerie, wasn't it?
7405460	7406580	Valerie Harper.
7406580	7407220	God damn it.
7407620	7408980	You're right.
7409540	7410020	You're right.
7410020	7412660	Why was I thinking that in the moment that it was Valerie Bertinelli?
7412660	7412900	You're right.
7412900	7414340	It was Valerie Harper.
7414340	7416260	Because you were talking about one day at a time.
7417460	7419060	Drag me, expose me.
7421060	7423860	I believe you denied if you deny it.
7424660	7425160	What?
7425620	7428580	I will only drag you if you deny it and say that you're still correct.
7428580	7430820	No, I'm not going to deny it because you're absolutely right.
7430820	7434900	It was Harper because the show was originally Valerie's family.
7434900	7436980	But the name Harper came into it somewhere.
7437060	7438420	I should have known better.
7438420	7439940	It was called the Hogans.
7439940	7441940	Then they changed it to the Hogan family.
7441940	7442440	Yeah.
7443620	7445940	And it was kind of a mess of how they wrote her off the show.
7446500	7446900	They did.
7446900	7449300	Didn't they, like, kill her in a car crash or something?
7449300	7451860	Well, she died from brain cancer.
7451860	7452660	Oh, that's...
7452660	7456580	But so they just basically, like, killed her off screen, right?
7456580	7457080	Yeah.
7459940	7460740	Which is sad.
7460740	7462100	Rhoda was a fun show.
7462100	7463460	That's what she was also in.
7463460	7466020	That's what you do to your difficult actresses, I guess.
7466020	7468820	So at least back in the 80s, that's what they did.
7468820	7474020	So, I mean, now if you tried to do that, how did they kill off What's Her Name on Grey's Anatomy?
7474020	7475220	I'm assuming they killed her off.
7475220	7477620	Maybe they just moved her, but I never watched that show.
7477620	7480420	What's Her Name, that actress that everybody says is difficult to work with.
7481460	7482260	The blonde girl.
7482260	7483940	So her show was called Valerie.
7484580	7485080	Right.
7485080	7487460	Not the Harper family or anything.
7487460	7490660	No, it was Valerie's family, but she did have a show called Valerie.
7490660	7495460	Yeah, but that was when she had the dispute, the salary dispute with NBC.
7495460	7497860	So she was fired from that show.
7497860	7500900	I thought they had called the show Valerie's Family the whole time.
7500900	7501780	No, it was called...
7501780	7505780	It was renamed to Valerie's Family and then the Hogan family.
7505780	7506500	Okay.
7506500	7509380	So they said that they just continued the...
7509380	7511220	I'm checking the thing about the page.
7511220	7512500	So, yeah.
7512500	7513220	So that's what happened.
7514260	7516740	What is the name of that actress on Grey's Anatomy?
7516740	7517940	Or she was on it.
7517940	7521380	And, like, everybody in Hollywood says she's difficult to work with.
7521380	7523620	And she left Grey's Anatomy to go have a movie career.
7523620	7525700	And she's made nothing but stinkers.
7525700	7527780	And I think she finally came back to television.
7528420	7529940	The one, the first girl that...
7529940	7530820	Or she...
7530820	7534180	Didn't you have cancer in the show or something like that?
7534180	7535460	Apparently, this is a trope.
7535460	7539220	But for the record, it was Valerie Bertinelli on One Day at a Time.
7539780	7540580	Katherine Heigl.
7540580	7541460	That's who I was trying to think of.
7541460	7542180	Yeah.
7542180	7543940	But it was Valerie Bertinelli who was on One Day at a Time.
7543940	7546100	It was Valerie Bertinelli on One Day at a Time.
7546100	7547700	And it was different Valeries.
7547700	7551460	But in my mind, so many years had passed between the two.
7551460	7552980	I didn't realize they were different.
7552980	7554580	So I made a mistake.
7554580	7555540	You corrected me.
7556180	7556680	Whatever.
7557780	7558980	That's because we love you.
7559700	7560340	I know.
7560340	7560660	I know.
7560660	7562820	At least you're not coming on here screaming at me.
7562820	7563860	So I appreciate it.
7563860	7567780	You're having a nice, calm, rational, you know, you made a boo boo.
7567780	7568500	And here's why.
7570100	7572900	And you need to sit down and watch One Day at a Time on Netflix.
7572900	7574260	The reboot is really good.
7574260	7577300	Everybody is telling me that One Day at a Time on Netflix is great.
7577300	7581540	And then with the exception of Loki, everybody's telling me that the new Queer Eye is fantastic.
7581540	7582580	It's not fantastic.
7582580	7583380	It's all right.
7583380	7583940	I'm not gonna.
7585060	7588900	But most of my other people are like, like the new Queer Eye is amazing.
7590420	7591780	I'll take that word for it.
7591780	7592580	All right.
7592580	7592820	All right.
7592820	7597620	Well, Rama and also the Joel McHale or the Joel McHale show.
7597620	7598580	Oh, that's right.
7598580	7602260	He kind of replaced Chelsea Handler because basically it's just the soup.
7602260	7603540	It's basically the soup.
7603540	7605140	But that's the soup was funny.
7605140	7606980	So that's yeah, it's good.
7606980	7609220	Yeah, they don't have mankini anymore.
7609700	7612900	It's like one piece man or so.
7613540	7616260	Because, you know, it's kind of what they have to do.
7616260	7617780	They get around the trademark.
7617780	7620420	I really wanted to like the Chelsea Handler show.
7620420	7624180	And I did in the early episodes, but it kind of became a mess.
7624740	7627300	Like, was it a sit in the studio show?
7627300	7629220	Was it a dinner party episode?
7629220	7631700	Was it this like the Chelsea show was just a mess.
7631700	7633700	And I hate it when they reduced it to once a week.
7633700	7635460	It didn't make sense anymore.
7635460	7639140	Anyway, sorry, I'm just going on a tangent, but I hate when I get invested in shows.
7639140	7640820	And then they just like they fuck up.
7642660	7643220	Yep.
7643220	7643780	So.
7643780	7644420	All right.
7644420	7646580	Uh, Rob, I'm going to let you go to see if anyone else calls in.
7646580	7647620	But thank you so much.
7647620	7648260	Hey, no problem.
7648260	7649460	I like the plan and take care.
7649460	7652660	Have a good whatever Sunday and all that and drink the rest of the wine for me.
7652660	7653300	I will do that.
7653300	7654260	Happy rebuttal.
7656100	7656420	All right.
7656420	7657300	Orange launch radio.
7657300	7658260	All one word on Skype.
7658260	7660020	Do you have any other last minute stories to get to before we?
7660020	7660980	I certainly don't.
7660980	7662900	Oh, I thought there might have been a few others.
7662900	7665780	You know my favorite thing about the old Queer Eye other than Carson Kressley?
7667140	7668100	The soundtrack.
7668100	7669380	Yeah, the soundtrack was great.
7669380	7670740	I bought that soundtrack.
7670740	7672260	We used it in spin class.
7672260	7675220	It was here back when we did that cage match on O.L.R.
7675220	7677620	Probably every track on that CD was in the cage match at some point.
7677620	7677940	Right.
7677940	7678440	Yeah.
7679860	7680980	Oh, so long ago.
7680980	7683780	How many how many episodes ago did we finally get rid of cage match?
7683780	7684580	It was a while ago.
7686580	7687380	I'm not a fan.
7687380	7688980	I don't keep track of this shit.
7688980	7691860	It's on the wiki, so I am not one of your fans.
7692660	7693780	It's on the wiki, I'm sure.
7693860	7698180	But it was it was we'd moved it to after birth because
7699540	7703140	when we started podcasting the entire show, we had to take the cage match out of the show
7703140	7705300	because it makes it you can't have that in the podcast.
7705300	7707620	So we had it in the afterbirth and then we finally got rid of that.
7708580	7710100	Or in the 400s, I feel like.
7711140	7712900	Every so often, you know, I'll listen to something.
7712900	7714820	I'll be like, that'll be fun in the cage match.
7714820	7717460	You know, we made a Tumblr for that and we never used it.
7717460	7719620	We have like a F yeah cage match or something.
7719620	7721700	Yeah, because everything on Tumblr is fuck yeah this.
7721700	7723380	I think there's F yeah cage match or something.
7723380	7724500	We never used it.
7724500	7726500	So you should you're the Tumblr queen.
7726500	7727540	You should fire that up.
7727540	7730100	And I don't think it's actually a part of my Tumblr,
7730740	7732820	but I might maybe I'll remake it or something.
7732820	7733220	I don't know.
7733860	7735700	Ragenator in chat says Rob Roberts.
7735700	7738820	Any chance the cage match will come back on your life?
7738820	7741780	Never, never say never, but never.
7743380	7748260	No, there's no no plans at this time.
7748260	7750900	So, all right.
7750900	7753860	Well, our phone lines aren't aren't ringing up.
7753860	7755220	So I guess we're going to close up shop.
7755220	7757540	It's a little early tonight, but it was a slower news week,
7757540	7760100	probably because the Olympics and, you know, other stuff going on.
7760900	7762900	Just not as much games news to get into.
7762900	7766580	So we'll we'll just wait until next week.
7767220	7769620	But thank you guys for being here and thank you for listening to the show
7769620	7771620	and spending the last two hours with us.
7772260	7774500	Not quite three tonight, but thank you guys for being here.
7774500	7775300	Appreciate it.
7775300	7777140	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,
7777140	7779300	a nice five star review goes a very long way.
7779940	7781940	So please leave us a nice five star review.
7781940	7783620	Tell a friend or five about the show.
7783620	7786980	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7786980	7792100	But we can only spread those voices if they're here to air.
7793060	7795700	And then some folks in chat talking about Twitch streams.
7796580	7799940	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says bringing back the cage match means getting rid of the post show
7799940	7800820	Twitch stream.
7800820	7804740	Yeah, essentially, although I'm not always the best at doing the post show Twitch streams,
7804740	7807300	but somebody's been doing it lately and that's really good.
7807300	7811300	And then tonight we have a new podcast to play for you all right after the show,
7811300	7813140	at least live on the Voicegeese network.
7813140	7815940	If you're listening on the podcast, you can go to vognetwork.com
7815940	7819140	and listen whenever you want to our newest show, The Far Way Nearby.
7819140	7820260	Anyway, that is it.
7821060	7822820	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
7822820	7823940	I'll start tonight.
7823940	7828980	My final thought is I really should play some more Overwatch
7828980	7832260	because I have completely missed out on that holiday event.
7832260	7834900	I need to get some of my loot boxes in Overwatch.
7835540	7836740	Loki, your final thought tonight?
7837460	7842260	My final thought is I hope to play some more games this week.
7842900	7843700	Yes, please do.
7844420	7845460	That's your homework assignment.
7845460	7847620	Play a game or make a game.
7847620	7848120	You choose.
7848740	7849940	I do want to do that.
7849940	7856100	I've been just working on stuff for work because we have to switch systems.
7856100	7860660	And my old macros that I wrote for terminal stuff doesn't work anymore
7860660	7861620	because they're shutting it off.
7861700	7863060	Work is important.
7863060	7866420	And it's not really, this isn't, this is kind of above and beyond stuff.
7867700	7870580	Well, last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought?
7872340	7876900	I want a banana covered in chocolate.
7876900	7879220	I was going to say, I just saw Alan bring back bananas.
7879220	7880340	If you want a banana.
7880340	7885060	No, I want a specifically, I want a banana covered in chocolate in the middle of Pinkberry.
7885060	7887780	Oh, well, I've been to Pinkberry at an age.
7887780	7889860	I can help you with one of the three of those things.
7889860	7891620	They have the new Pink Beast chocolate.
7891620	7893060	It's made with Ghirardelli.
7893060	7893620	It's all right.
7894580	7895940	I haven't been to Pinkberry in a long time either.
7895940	7898340	I'm actually going to be going to hang out with Becky.
7898340	7901700	Now it's not Yogurtland, but now there's a new one.
7901700	7902660	Meet Menchies.
7902660	7903380	I think that's it.
7903380	7905860	That's the one that Alan likes to go to now.
7905860	7906580	And I like it too.
7906580	7908180	So they have all the crazy.
7908180	7910420	Isn't Menchie the dog from...
7910420	7913220	I might be saying it wrong, but I feel like that's the name of the place.
7913220	7914260	Call it Munchies.
7914260	7914660	Munchies.
7914660	7914900	All right.
7914900	7917860	Anyway, that needs to be a fast food joint right there.
7917860	7918340	Munchies.
7919220	7921060	I think that's Jack in the Box's specialty.
7921060	7921700	All right.
7921700	7922500	That's it.
7922500	7923700	Good night, everybody.
7923700	7924420	That's a show.
