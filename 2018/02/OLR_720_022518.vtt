00:00.000 --> 00:17.760
This week Death Stranding News continues its slow trickle as the latest cast members

00:17.760 --> 00:20.280
have been announced, inadvertent as it may have been.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.800
Once the news is out it's near impossible to take back, so let's press on with episode

00:23.800 --> 00:27.000
720 of tonight's show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.800
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet,

00:33.800 --> 00:36.680
welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.680 --> 00:45.440
It is Orange Lounge Radio for tonight, February the 25th, 2018, episode number 720 of our

00:45.440 --> 00:46.440
show.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.640
We are now an HD show, we are 720 episodes wide.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.640
There you go.

00:51.640 --> 00:56.640
Anyway, hi I'm Rob Roberts and you can of course hear me on this show every week talking

00:56.640 --> 01:00.940
about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts over there,

01:00.940 --> 01:02.560
DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.520
I was regaling the chat room about the time that was you, me, Chris, and Megzi staying

01:08.520 --> 01:15.240
at a hotel and we decided to wake you up with loud lesbian porn and you slept through it.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.680
What a way to start the show.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.440
Okay, here's the thing though.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.440
First off, I miss those two.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.440
I really do.

01:20.440 --> 01:21.720
They were a lot of fun to have on the show.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.600
For those that don't know, they moved far away.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.600
They moved to a far away distant land called Wisconsin.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.600
Wisconsin.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.800
So, unfortunately it's hard to get them on the show anymore, but here's the thing.

01:31.800 --> 01:35.200
I used to live right next to train tracks.

01:35.200 --> 01:39.260
When I went to school in Chico, California, I lived on this apartment complex that was

01:39.260 --> 01:40.920
right next to the railroad tracks.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.400
Was it the wrong side or the right side?

01:43.400 --> 01:44.560
One way to find out.

01:44.560 --> 01:49.000
So anyway, the train would just come roaring through and they blew the horn and everything.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.520
So I would have to sleep through that.

01:50.520 --> 01:56.600
So because of that, I sleep through a lot, but the one thing, so you can do whatever

01:56.600 --> 01:57.800
porny noises you want.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.960
It's not going to wake me up.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.240
But the one thing that does wake me up without fail, Mr. Smoosh snoring in my ear.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.240
Yeah.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.240
Go figure.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.860
And that's Mr. Smoosh is the cat if you weren't already aware.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.160
Also say hello, joining us every week to Techmaster Loki.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.160
Hello.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.160
How are you, Loki?

02:13.160 --> 02:14.160
I'm good.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.160
Good.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.160
Awesome.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.520
What'd you bring for the show tonight for dinner for the folks that like to play the

02:18.520 --> 02:19.800
OLR food betting game?

02:19.800 --> 02:28.360
Oh, I just got tacos from a place called Cafe Rio that has a Barbacoa pork tacos.

02:28.360 --> 02:33.440
So it's like kind of like flavored and stuff, but their rice like that they make on the

02:33.440 --> 02:34.440
side though.

02:34.440 --> 02:37.640
Like, I don't know if they know how to cook rice because it's just like, I don't know

02:37.640 --> 02:39.680
if it's actually cooked.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
It's very crunchy.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.680
Oh yeah.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
Oh yeah.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
I don't like no.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.680
Sounds like it's reconstituted.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.120
It's like, do you not know how to cook rice long enough?

02:47.120 --> 02:50.000
Rice is very important in the Mexican.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
It's not my dinner.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I ate it anyways.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
But yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
What?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
No.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I was like, is not my dinner equally important?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.400
You know, your dinner is important, but we were talking about lesbian porn.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
Oh yeah.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.400
That is true.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.400
I don't know.

03:02.400 --> 03:07.040
I could smell those tacos when I stepped into the room and I was like, oh my God, that smells

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
amazing.

03:08.040 --> 03:13.240
Let's go to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com where of course we do tape live every Sunday

03:13.240 --> 03:17.480
night, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:17.480 --> 03:21.920
And you live chatters are here to help us through the show and offer your commentary

03:21.920 --> 03:23.880
because it's not just about us here at OLR.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.400
It's about all the gamers, including those of you in chat and those of you on the Skype

03:27.400 --> 03:31.840
line a little later on at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.540
So I'm not alone in my loud noise stuff.

03:34.540 --> 03:39.760
Brad from pod culture in chat saying I used to live on the Ohio river, used to have loud

03:39.760 --> 03:41.800
barges go through in the wee hours.

03:41.800 --> 03:42.800
Yikes.

03:42.800 --> 03:48.240
I don't know if like a party boat came through who, uh, let's see, uh, Dr. Ken, hi Dr. Kim

03:48.240 --> 03:49.520
from starboard power coupling.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.160
Shout out says, grats OLR with a heart.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
Thank you.

03:53.160 --> 03:57.900
I don't, I didn't think anything was particularly notable about seven 20, but I guess that means

03:57.900 --> 04:00.320
we've gone around the sun twice.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.320
Right.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.320
Is that what that means?

04:02.320 --> 04:03.320
I reckon close close.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.080
No, cause three 65 and actually seven 30.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.080
Math is not my strong suit.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.880
Uh, I'm just sure on the podcast to look pretty.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.800
Uh, and this is two and a hundred, Matt says taco every day.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.800
I agree with that.

04:15.800 --> 04:16.800
You don't have to.

04:16.800 --> 04:17.800
Those are good.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.800
You don't have to wait for Tuesday for tacos.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.800
Absolutely not.

04:19.800 --> 04:25.720
I didn't have enough time to get a poke again, so, uh, that's, that's the new trendy thing,

04:25.720 --> 04:26.720
huh?

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
I don't, I don't.

04:27.720 --> 04:32.920
It's just, it's like if you want, if you want sushi, but you don't want it in sushi form,

04:32.920 --> 04:38.840
you just want to kind of just disassemble poke to me is like sushi inside out, except

04:38.840 --> 04:45.080
that there was, you can already get chirashi, which is basically sushi on top of sushi rice

04:45.080 --> 04:46.880
in a bowl.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.280
Yo dog, I heard you like sushi.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.800
It's sashimi on the rice.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
Okay.

04:51.800 --> 04:52.800
That's delicious.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.840
I don't dislike poke by any means.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.760
In fact, funny, when I had the pokey stop podcast show, like there was a pokey place

04:58.760 --> 05:02.120
that wanted to like work together and so I got to try some of their poke and it was really

05:02.120 --> 05:03.120
good.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.560
Um, but I just, you know, I don't know, like I feel like when I'm in the mood, I not a

05:07.560 --> 05:10.120
big fish person, but I will eat sushi.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.480
So if I get in the mood for sushi, I'm going to have sushi.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.640
I've never had poke.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.640
Not sushi in a bowl.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.640
I don't really like sushi.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.480
I normally will have like a, well, I guess it's sort of sushi.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.840
It's a McGrew, which is basically tuna draped over some rice.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.840
Oh sure.

05:24.840 --> 05:28.520
It's basically you just chop that up and we got poke now.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.520
It's very basic.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.520
You like your nigiri.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.520
Sashimi.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.520
Yes.

05:32.520 --> 05:33.520
Yeah.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.360
Well, because I can't eat as much rice as I used to, pretty much all I get anymore is

05:36.360 --> 05:42.000
sashimi or my new standby, which is not sushi at all, but agarashidofu.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.120
I love it.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.120
So good.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.120
It's what I ate that night.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.960
I was gonna say that night cause we went out after OLR once to go get food.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.600
I remember it was like really late and one of the, there's a sushi bar around here open

05:52.600 --> 05:54.760
till past midnight or till midnight.

05:54.760 --> 05:59.720
So we were just mad that the last two places I went to had no Saba, the mackerel, which

05:59.720 --> 06:04.760
is like my favorite cause it is the fishiest smelliest tastiest of all fishes.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.760
So bad.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.760
All right.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.760
Anyway, believe it or not, it's not a food podcast.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.360
It's a video game podcast.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.320
So let's get into some gaming discussion and I want to kick this off.

06:12.320 --> 06:16.520
Loki, I'll kick it to you if you want to, uh, with some E3 news cause believe it or

06:16.520 --> 06:22.220
not, we're staring down what, four months I think about till E3 actually probably less

06:22.220 --> 06:26.080
than that cause E3 is in like early June, so about three and a half months till E3.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.040
We know the public tickets went on sale.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.040
Yeah.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.120
Um, I don't, I hadn't heard if they sold out or not.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.200
Um, I know last time it took them a little while to sell out.

06:34.200 --> 06:41.280
But E3 in the year 2018, very different from E3 when the show first started in 2002.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.720
And I think what the first show we all went to was 2004, right?

06:44.720 --> 06:47.600
So E3 is very different now than it was then.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.440
So tell us a little bit about what's, uh, what's going to be going on at E3 this year,

06:51.440 --> 06:52.440
Loki.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.280
Well, pretty much the same thing as the last few years, EA is not going to E3.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.640
They're doing their own thing just outside of E3.

06:59.640 --> 07:05.160
Um, so they're going to have their own event where they can try out the new battlefield

07:05.160 --> 07:12.120
game that they're supposed to be showing off and of course Anthem.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.120
And yeah.

07:13.120 --> 07:17.720
And then you, you can go check that out and that's between June 9th and 11th at the Hollywood

07:17.720 --> 07:18.720
Palladium.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.200
Sports, sports, and more sports as well.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
I'm sure with EA.

07:22.200 --> 07:29.120
You can try, try the Madden's and the FIFA's and the NHL's and all the EA Sports as well,

07:29.120 --> 07:32.080
which I'm not, I'm not poo-pooing those games.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.160
They're huge moneymakers, cash cows for EA.

07:34.160 --> 07:39.740
They've probably made EA the big company that it is, but you know, um, I, I think here's

07:39.740 --> 07:40.740
the thing.

07:40.740 --> 07:45.160
I think people kind of know what to expect out of a FIFA game, out of a Madden game.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.060
Now granted, they sometimes do new modes.

07:47.060 --> 07:50.400
They do things that will kind of throw a curve ball in the formula, but generally, you know,

07:50.400 --> 07:54.560
you're going to get a football game, either British rules or American rules in those two

07:54.560 --> 07:55.560
series.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.560
Right.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.600
What you don't know what you're going to get right now is Anthem, right?

07:59.600 --> 08:01.040
Anthem's a big wild card.

08:01.040 --> 08:05.160
I know those of us that have been long-time Bioware supporters, well, I should, some of

08:05.160 --> 08:08.920
us, not all of us, but Dark Soccer and I are on the side of, we're a little salty.

08:08.920 --> 08:15.240
I'm not exactly ready to turn cartwheels for Anthem, um, because I kind of feel like EA

08:15.240 --> 08:18.920
gave the finger to the Mass Effect series in a really nasty way.

08:18.920 --> 08:24.880
And so, um, especially hearing that Anthem has been delayed, but it will come out in

08:24.880 --> 08:25.880
this fiscal year.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.560
I'm already worried for Anthem, but I suppose EA3 is the place to prove me wrong and show

08:32.560 --> 08:36.400
me what a kick-ass game Anthem might be.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.840
You know what Anthem better be?

08:37.840 --> 08:39.600
Another Mass Effect.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.600
In the Mass Effect universe.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.760
It's just Mass Effect Anthem.

08:43.760 --> 08:49.960
So you want, you want basically, was it the Volition version of, no it wasn't the Volition

08:49.960 --> 08:54.760
version, it was, um, I can't even, see, my mind has already blocked out their terrible

08:54.760 --> 08:57.560
game that they released, so I'm not even going to try to reference that.

08:57.560 --> 09:01.400
Basically, hopefully, they're not going to implement too much Mass Effect, make it its

09:01.400 --> 09:02.400
own thing.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.080
I think it's going to be more Destiny, though, than anything.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.280
I would forget, well Destiny's not EA, Destiny's Activision.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.280
I understand.

09:09.280 --> 09:14.040
I understand it's Activision, but they want a piece of that money.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.040
I get it.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.040
I get it.

09:16.040 --> 09:20.840
Um, I would, I would forgive EA quite a bit if they would just give us the fucking Mass

09:20.840 --> 09:22.680
Effect remaster already.

09:22.680 --> 09:28.440
Like, I know EA is really skittish about remastering their games, however, I'm sure

09:28.440 --> 09:32.360
some of you have heard, and we have a news story coming out later, looks like EA's changed

09:32.360 --> 09:37.640
their mind on that a little bit, so, it's possible, who knows.

09:37.640 --> 09:41.400
Well let me- Other than that, all we have are mods, which,

09:41.400 --> 09:49.000
by the way, Mass Effect 3 high-res mods look really good, so it should be fucking easy.

09:49.720 --> 09:57.240
Uh, let's see, go into our chat at live.vognetwork.com, um, let's see, uh, sg100matt says Mass Effect

09:57.240 --> 09:58.840
Kart Anthem Edition.

09:58.840 --> 10:05.240
Uh, let's see, uh, let's see- I gave two fingers up for that.

10:05.240 --> 10:09.000
Also, uh, bobbyblackwool says Anthem is just a Mass Effect game and they'll name it Mass

10:09.000 --> 10:11.560
Effect at the very end, who knows, who knows.

10:11.560 --> 10:17.560
Uh, megamanx400 suggests Mass Effect Trilogy Definitive Edition for Switch.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
Let's go.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.680
So when he's saying Anthem is the- You know why?

10:21.680 --> 10:22.720
I only play console.

10:22.720 --> 10:26.480
I want a Definitive Edition also released for- But Switch is a console.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.480
I mean not console, I mean PC.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.200
Oh, so whatever they do needs to also be on PC.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.600
And I want a Mac version, so that I can play it on my Mac.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.600
Our list of demands.

10:35.600 --> 10:40.880
So, um, so basically bobby's saying the Anthem should be like, you know, Metal Gear Solid

10:40.880 --> 10:45.280
5, the Phantom Pains, where it's gonna be, what, Mass Effect 4 Anthem?

10:45.280 --> 10:46.400
The Phantom good game.

10:46.400 --> 10:55.440
Yes, it was much better than some other shit that certain Konami companies decided to put

10:55.440 --> 10:58.320
out recently that, we can do this ourselves!

10:59.040 --> 10:59.760
No, we can't!

11:00.640 --> 11:04.640
Let me back up, let me back up a little bit, and, and, uh, MegamanX clarifying his, uh,

11:04.640 --> 11:09.440
dream statement there saying, well, it would obviously come out for all, not just Switch,

11:09.440 --> 11:10.720
but doesn't want Switch to get left out.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.600
Um, let me ask this question, a little, little bit of a different question, you know, enough

11:15.600 --> 11:20.640
about Anthem, we'll, we'll see more in the coming months at E3.

11:20.640 --> 11:25.520
But, you know, I mentioned when we started this discussion is that E3's changed a lot

11:25.520 --> 11:26.720
in the past few years.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.640
And I think the show that it's become is not the show that we remember.

11:30.640 --> 11:36.880
Now, granted, there might be a question if E3 could ever go back to the show that we

11:36.880 --> 11:37.520
remember.

11:37.520 --> 11:44.960
I mean, keep in mind, when we were going to E3 in 2004, 2005, uh, we didn't have the internet

11:44.960 --> 11:48.000
as prolific with video as it is now.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.800
I mean, when this, when this show first started on live 365, we were dial-up friendly radio,

11:54.800 --> 11:55.120
right?

11:55.760 --> 11:57.760
Anyone remember dial-up modems?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.360
They were still a thing in 2002.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.800
That was right around the, that was right around the years where that was starting to

12:02.800 --> 12:03.280
change.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.280
Like, you know, DSL, I think was a big thing a lot of people had, and then, you know, cable

12:07.280 --> 12:08.560
really came in a few years later.

12:08.560 --> 12:12.960
But anyway, I digress a little bit, but my point is, is that, you know, a lot of the

12:12.960 --> 12:17.520
experience that we were getting at E3 some time ago, you just go on to Twitch, you go

12:17.520 --> 12:22.560
on to IGN, you go on to YouTube, you're seeing a lot of the stuff that you used to have to

12:22.560 --> 12:26.000
wait in line, get a ticket, go into theater to go see.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So let me ask you guys this.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.240
If you were in charge, and I open this up to chat as well, and reasonably please, if

12:34.240 --> 12:38.400
you were in charge of E3 now, what would you do?

12:38.400 --> 12:40.960
What would be the show that you would do?

12:40.960 --> 12:45.120
Do you think that the ESA, do you think they're doing the right thing right now?

12:45.120 --> 12:47.200
Or how would you run E3?

12:47.200 --> 12:51.840
You know, and, you know, make it reasonable, but at the same time, I'm not going to draw

12:51.840 --> 12:53.120
many more boundaries on it.

12:53.120 --> 12:58.320
You know, we won't, we will assume that money is not a factor in things like that.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.200
Jamie, I'll start with you.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.360
What would you, how would you run E3 if you were the boss?

13:01.360 --> 13:04.240
I would seriously seriously want to put it back to like it was the first year I went.

13:04.800 --> 13:10.400
And I want to see more, the whole thing for me was that Cantia Hall, you know?

13:11.040 --> 13:15.440
It was seeing the indie developers, the smaller developers, and having, I loved the little

13:15.440 --> 13:16.960
video game museum that they'd have there.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.960
It was something that's like, yes, here's the future over here, but here's also where

13:20.960 --> 13:22.080
we came from.

13:22.080 --> 13:26.480
And I loved having, like, seeing the dev units for older systems.

13:27.120 --> 13:31.680
And I loved going in and trying new technology that even if it wasn't going to come out,

13:31.680 --> 13:35.120
you know, like that one sphere thing, you know, where you put your hand on it and it

13:35.120 --> 13:36.000
gave you the feedback.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.040
Like you could touch what was in the game through that thing.

13:39.040 --> 13:39.920
That was cool.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.600
And it was seeing just the innovations that were coming out there.

13:43.600 --> 13:47.440
I'd really like a lot of focus on the innovators, you know?

13:47.440 --> 13:49.360
And yeah, the swag was great.

13:49.360 --> 13:54.720
I mean, I have a few things to this day I still use, you know, but in the long run,

13:54.720 --> 14:00.560
you know, the big thing was the going and seeing and the tactile part of, you know,

14:00.560 --> 14:04.720
the experience, getting to put your hands on new, new things.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.040
And of course, sitting in a skyline wasn't that bad.

14:07.040 --> 14:11.040
That year they had the skyline there at the whatever the racing thing was.

14:11.040 --> 14:11.440
Oh, yeah.

14:12.640 --> 14:13.280
That was fun.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.360
I think that's great that you call out Kensha Hall.

14:15.360 --> 14:18.160
I mean, that was from the earlier years of E3.

14:18.160 --> 14:22.320
You know, that was a lot of the especially like foreign developers really seem to be

14:22.320 --> 14:23.040
in that area.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.920
You know, things that folks from this show might remember when we talked about dance

14:27.920 --> 14:31.760
based games, like In the Groove was shown there.

14:31.760 --> 14:37.440
Red Octane probably showed the Guitar Hero thing first in Kensha Hall before that really

14:37.440 --> 14:38.320
blew up.

14:38.320 --> 14:43.280
It's also where you could like go to the Natsume booth, you know, some of the other,

14:43.920 --> 14:47.920
I would say, like medium developers overseas, you know?

14:47.920 --> 14:50.720
But it was also, was it in Kensha Hall?

14:50.720 --> 14:52.480
No, it might have been in one of the bigger ones.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.720
They had like that dragon flying game where you have to get and flap your arms with it.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.160
I don't even know if I played that.

14:58.160 --> 15:04.000
But I liked just seeing the stuff like that, the interactivity, you know, again, technology

15:04.000 --> 15:09.840
that may not even come out anytime soon, but you get to see it sort of nascent, you know,

15:09.840 --> 15:10.560
version of it.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.920
Let me get to some comments in chat because some great discussion in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.920
Bobby Blackwolf says, the problem is I fully believe that the gaming industry needs an

15:19.920 --> 15:21.520
expo for the industry.

15:21.520 --> 15:25.200
I know consumers would be upset because they feel they are the most important part of the

15:25.200 --> 15:29.040
industry, but every other industry in the world has a trade show for just themselves.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.880
But the gaming industry is special and that the consumers feel more connected to the industry

15:32.880 --> 15:34.960
more so than you see in other industries.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.640
There are still trade shows and expos that I go to that aren't gaming, that have all

15:38.640 --> 15:41.440
the swag and the types of stuff that you saw at early E3s.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.680
But consumers of business software don't necessarily want to go to a business software trade show

15:45.680 --> 15:46.640
for industry people.

15:48.240 --> 15:52.160
JD in chat says, I would cancel E3 and make it GamerX instead.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.280
I do miss GamerX.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.880
We need GamerX to come back.

15:55.760 --> 16:03.040
MegamanX400 says, I would like to see more developers launch an online E3 on their consoles.

16:03.040 --> 16:08.000
For example, whatever games are being featured at E3, you can download a time-limited demo

16:08.000 --> 16:12.240
at home and try it out for a fee most likely, somewhat of a virtual pass.

16:12.240 --> 16:17.600
I love that idea because that's a really good idea is that embrace the online.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.720
Doesn't Blizzcon do that to an extent?

16:20.720 --> 16:21.360
To an extent.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.600
I mean, they have their DirecTV coverage that they sell.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.160
They don't really let you play demos.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.240
But I remember back in the early days of the Xbox, you could download the same demos they

16:30.240 --> 16:31.040
were doing.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.840
That was a big thing that they had online.

16:33.840 --> 16:38.320
The only thing is, though, and I think where game companies get a little cautious is that

16:38.320 --> 16:42.080
people will make up their mind on the games based on said demos.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.760
And I think that might be why you don't see it as much anymore.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.360
But maybe game companies should really consider doing that for titles that are going to be

16:49.360 --> 16:51.840
coming out in the next couple months anyway.

16:52.240 --> 16:58.400
I think that should be something they should do because we are looking at a more year-round

16:58.400 --> 16:59.520
release for games.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
It's not just the fall anymore.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.880
Is fall the most important?

17:02.880 --> 17:04.080
Sure, it still is.

17:04.080 --> 17:08.400
But you see games released in January, February, all times throughout the year that still succeed.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.640
And I think we are moving to a more global calendar.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.000
It's just like movies.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.760
Movies used to be summer, summer, summer, and the holiday break.

17:15.760 --> 17:23.040
But now Black Panther came out in March and that's what it's like the fifth highest grossing.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.960
Clearly I need a calendar.

17:26.960 --> 17:27.460
Thank you.

17:28.640 --> 17:32.880
It came out in February, which was not, you know, you don't think big block releases in

17:32.880 --> 17:33.840
February, right?

17:33.840 --> 17:34.400
And what?

17:34.400 --> 17:37.520
Fifth highest grossing opening movie of all time, right?

17:37.520 --> 17:38.880
So you don't have to.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.680
Was it fifth?

17:39.680 --> 17:41.040
But it's up there.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.200
We know that movie made a shit ton of money, right?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.320
That was the official figure actually was shit ton of money.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.680
Going to chat for some more comments at live.vognetwork.com.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.480
Oh, and great comment by Bobby.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.400
Who the hell releases a console in March?

17:55.200 --> 17:55.680
Good point.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.880
Maybe that's why I was thinking Nintendo, because they've done it a few times already.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.000
That was the tongue in cheek joke.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.000
Dungeon.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.040
Who the hell releases a console with no online support?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.080
Nintendo.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.280
Who succeeded anyway.

18:08.320 --> 18:12.720
Dungeon Buster says E3 used to be focused exclusively on industry members from retail

18:12.800 --> 18:14.080
to corporate shareholders.

18:14.080 --> 18:18.080
Now it needs to cater to a new audience to stay relevant, which is going to change that

18:18.080 --> 18:18.580
dynamic.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.160
So 200 Matt says, step one, make the holodeck.

18:22.160 --> 18:26.000
Step two, make an E3 holodeck where there are no lines and people can play what they

18:26.000 --> 18:26.480
want.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.160
Step three, charge money for it.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.440
Step four, profit.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.840
Are you sure you're not Franky?

18:32.960 --> 18:34.960
Since you said the holodeck, we may as well go there.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.560
Loki, your dream E3.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.160
What would you do if you were inside?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.920
I mean, honestly, wow.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.640
It's just it's take it out back.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.400
Well, no, it's just because it's everybody's doing their own thing anyways.

18:46.400 --> 18:51.040
And it's just, I think, easier to get access to stuff when it's split up like at different

18:51.040 --> 18:53.840
events instead of having all one thing.

18:53.840 --> 18:57.280
E3, I remember when you go there, it's very chaotic.

18:57.280 --> 19:02.320
And I feel that staying home, you actually see a lot more than you do at the show.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.480
And I know for like a lot of people have never gone.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.920
You know, it's probably pretty exciting to be like, you know, part of the public to go

19:07.920 --> 19:09.760
there and experience that.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.520
But it gets old fast.

19:12.080 --> 19:19.200
And I just can't imagine now that it would be that exciting to go to E3 and check out

19:19.200 --> 19:19.680
all that stuff.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.440
It's just I don't know.

19:22.960 --> 19:28.800
I can I can enjoy it just fine on TV or streaming and stuff and check it out.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.640
I do wish they used to do more demos and stuff like they used to do.

19:32.640 --> 19:37.840
But I understand that that's a big strain on developers to actually put out a demo that's

19:37.840 --> 19:39.680
not running on test hardware and stuff.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.600
And it's that's hard enough.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.640
So I'll just accept.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.480
Just let it let it go wherever the way it is.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.400
Honestly, you know, I don't want to reward the USA any more than I have to being that

19:52.400 --> 19:55.840
they're defending these companies with the practices that they're doing now.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.680
And they've got their backs for that.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.280
So it's not like they have the consumer in mind anyways when it comes to a lot of this

20:01.280 --> 20:01.600
stuff.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.720
They're clearly signing with developers.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.520
So just let die.

20:06.080 --> 20:10.880
Let them do whatever they think needs to make the show successful.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.440
But inevitably, it's just going to just going to die.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.520
A harsh but realistic answer from Loki.

20:15.520 --> 20:20.000
But let me let me poke you on this point, though, because Bobby said that, you know,

20:20.800 --> 20:26.240
the gaming industry needs a trade show and you've been on the very trade side of things.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.920
Some people don't remember, but you used to work in video game distribution.

20:29.920 --> 20:35.360
So you've been to E3, not as an OLR host, but in the shoes of a video game distributor.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.840
Doesn't the gaming industry still need something like that that caters to that crowd?

20:40.400 --> 20:41.280
Not necessarily.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.440
That's more of like they'll go and make deals about different things, you know, especially

20:45.440 --> 20:49.280
upcoming titles, trying to secure allocations and stuff like that.

20:49.280 --> 20:53.760
But they have other shows that they go do that at that are specifically for trade.

20:53.760 --> 20:58.720
Like, for example, they have Destination PlayStation, which is a strictly industry

20:58.720 --> 21:00.480
event that it's all Sony.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.560
They have the Xbox.

21:02.560 --> 21:07.200
I don't remember the Xbox one's called, but they have some Microsoft Xbox show that's

21:07.200 --> 21:08.560
along the lines of that as well.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.320
That's also just industry.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.840
Nintendo doesn't fucking do anything.

21:11.840 --> 21:12.320
They don't care.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.280
They play by their own rules.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.760
But those two companies do that.

21:15.760 --> 21:20.880
And a lot of the other people, because you have reps that you're talking with, they come

21:20.880 --> 21:23.040
out to your company and they make deals as well.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.280
You don't necessarily need to do that at E3.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.560
It's just it's exciting.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.600
E3, all the stuff is announcing like new consoles are announcing stuff.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.760
It's like, oh, OK, let's secure our allocations and sit down and talk with these people that

21:33.760 --> 21:38.240
we haven't met with in a while to discuss what we're going to do to make sure that we're

21:38.240 --> 21:41.120
getting enough, you know, enough product in for these things.

21:41.120 --> 21:47.040
But then again, independent stores are kind of dying anyways because these companies don't

21:47.040 --> 21:47.600
fucking care.

21:47.600 --> 21:53.120
They want to do a, you know, a preorder bonus with GameStop or Walmart or Target or Best

21:53.120 --> 21:54.880
Buy and they're going to Amazon.

21:54.880 --> 21:59.280
They're going to do deal with those companies and fuck everybody else.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.960
I mean, honestly, that's kind of the way they treat everybody.

22:02.960 --> 22:07.680
So, yeah, I don't think I don't think it's necessary.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.800
They have those events.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.360
That's what I'm saying.

22:09.360 --> 22:14.320
It's like just because you haven't heard of them because not a lot of news leaks out from

22:14.320 --> 22:16.880
them doesn't mean that they don't exist.

22:16.880 --> 22:21.840
It's just there's a lot of shows out there already available and there's this PAX.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.280
And I mean, there's plenty of shows to see games.

22:25.280 --> 22:29.360
Bobby Blackwell points out GDC is probably a better industry trade show.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.240
Where the people who make the games also get together to learn.

22:32.880 --> 22:37.040
Sia Tabiri in chat says if it's becoming more and more like a show than a trade show, why

22:37.040 --> 22:41.600
not start a new trade show and break off of E3 to be more like a convention, especially

22:41.600 --> 22:44.880
if E3 is being seen as catering increasingly to the general public.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.160
These are all good questions.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.440
Let me get into my answer to this.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.760
So how I would envision E3.

22:51.760 --> 22:57.520
First off, I just want to say I really like what Delvin Mega Man X 400 suggested in chat.

22:58.400 --> 23:03.440
The whole like online experience so that people that are playing the home game have something

23:03.440 --> 23:04.720
to do.

23:04.720 --> 23:10.800
And I think that's like getting there because you see like the press conferences or something

23:10.800 --> 23:12.320
you can kind of watch throughout the day.

23:13.040 --> 23:18.560
You see these companies like Jeff Keeley doing stuff with his online networks and IGN and

23:18.560 --> 23:21.920
so forth building these 24-7 experiences out of it.

23:21.920 --> 23:26.160
It would be nice to see something maybe of an official capacity, but maybe they don't

23:26.160 --> 23:27.600
need it because they have these other companies.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.520
But I like the idea of some of E3 being a little bit more of an online experience for

23:31.520 --> 23:32.640
people around the world.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.640
So everybody gets excited about E3.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.400
Well remember like PT?

23:36.960 --> 23:37.760
Remember when that was?

23:37.760 --> 23:39.840
Oh yeah, but that was Tokyo Game Show, wasn't it?

23:39.840 --> 23:41.040
I think that came out of Tokyo Game Show.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.160
I don't remember, but still, I mean, that's basically the E3.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.120
That's great.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.760
Anyway, okay, here's my thought.

23:48.560 --> 23:53.440
I love the idea to reopen Kensha Hall as more of like an indie showcase.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.280
Except it's a parking lot, but you know.

23:55.280 --> 24:01.520
Well, you know, okay, but downtown LA has been through a lot of changes and surely they

24:01.520 --> 24:06.560
have more parking somewhere, especially with the freaking Staples Center down there.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.840
And people just have to start taking transit or find other ways to get to, especially with

24:11.840 --> 24:14.240
Uber and Lyft being more prolific.

24:14.240 --> 24:17.760
People have to find other ways if they take a few parking spots out of E3.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.280
Okay, so anyway, I would say turn Kensha Hall back into an indie showcase.

24:21.280 --> 24:28.080
But I would like to see E3 kind of embrace gaming and gaming culture, because I think

24:28.080 --> 24:32.560
that's a lot of what's changed in the industry in the past few years is that you have more

24:32.560 --> 24:35.040
and more for gaming culture.

24:35.040 --> 24:39.440
Because so much is digital, look at where like GameStop's going is that they want to

24:39.440 --> 24:41.520
sell a lot of these things that are gaming culture.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.800
But not just that is what I mean by gaming culture and like the things that are kind

24:44.800 --> 24:47.200
of secondary to the video games.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.400
But I mean things like how Twitch TV is growing and people are watching online with streaming

24:52.400 --> 24:54.000
stuff, that is gaming culture.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
YouTube, you know, whether I love them or hate them, they are still a part of gaming

24:58.000 --> 24:58.480
culture.

24:58.480 --> 25:03.440
And a lot of these online things, esports, that's gaming culture.

25:03.440 --> 25:07.840
I would like to see E3 kind of looked at a little differently about how it's laid out

25:07.840 --> 25:13.680
strategically, have an area that really embraces and involves gaming culture.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.680
And that is the part that would really appeal to the public for some time.

25:17.680 --> 25:22.720
And I would say the part of it that then is left for the gaming, I would say maybe a similar

25:22.720 --> 25:23.840
to the Tokyo Game Show.

25:23.840 --> 25:27.200
For a day or two, it's just the trade people only.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.960
But then like on the third day or what have you, they open it up to everybody.

25:30.960 --> 25:35.280
Having been to E3, you know, even in the early years, I felt like you could get a good chunk

25:35.280 --> 25:36.640
of stuff done in the first two days.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.760
Then by the third day, it's like, okay, I'm tired.

25:39.760 --> 25:43.520
Let's go get a recap of, you know, things we enjoy to go do it again or whatever.

25:44.400 --> 25:48.800
So I kind of feel like they could still do a lot with, you know, just even a day or two

25:48.800 --> 25:50.320
if it was like trade only.

25:50.320 --> 25:55.600
But have other stuff that celebrates the culture of video games that would be something that

25:55.600 --> 25:59.120
the public has for them, if that makes sense.

25:59.120 --> 25:59.920
That's my idea.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.080
And Bobby Blackwell says they had an art gallery, Rob, an art gallery.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.000
That's a start.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.760
But that's not, that's maybe 1% of what I wanted to do there.

26:14.320 --> 26:20.160
Bobby Blackwell also bringing up E4ALL as a follow up to Sia Tabiri's comment about

26:20.160 --> 26:22.320
why don't they split it up into a public show and a trade show?

26:22.320 --> 26:24.160
Because E4ALL flopped.

26:24.160 --> 26:30.320
But I think they did not succeed in drawing the right talent into E4ALL.

26:30.320 --> 26:34.000
They had maybe one big publisher there each year they did it.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.960
Like one year they had Nintendo, one year they had Microsoft.

26:36.960 --> 26:41.040
You know, I think they've really got to draw in the talent to make something like E4ALL

26:41.040 --> 26:44.320
work, which is why, you know, it didn't end up working.

26:45.280 --> 26:49.520
Bob C. points out that downtown LA has good public transit and LA Convention Center is

26:49.520 --> 26:51.760
getting too small for even Anime Expo now.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.240
So anyway, let's see.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.120
Dungeon Buster says, yeah, first two days, rush, rush, rush.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.080
But by the third day, I just go back to play the games I wanted to spend more time with

27:00.080 --> 27:01.360
or collect more swag.

27:01.360 --> 27:08.480
So anyway, I hope the folks that put on E3 will look to change the X, whether they take

27:08.480 --> 27:13.600
these ideas or not, I hope they do look to modernize and change the expo for the year

27:13.600 --> 27:14.640
2018.

27:14.640 --> 27:19.520
You know, I'm not going to expect to see that this year, but if the attendance numbers start

27:19.520 --> 27:22.560
dipping, they're going to really have to probably look at doing something.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.600
So, yeah, we'll see.

27:24.160 --> 27:24.480
All right.

27:24.480 --> 27:29.520
Anyhow, well, let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we

27:29.520 --> 27:30.880
have been playing this week.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.400
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

27:32.400 --> 27:36.960
I didn't really play much of anything I was supposed to stream, but I was pretty sick

27:36.960 --> 27:37.840
at the beginning of the week.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.880
So I really just haven't touched anything.

27:43.200 --> 27:51.600
You know, just Animal Crossing on my phone, a little Ingress, a little Pokemon Go, still

27:51.600 --> 27:53.280
playing the wrap up of Miitomo.

27:53.280 --> 28:00.800
I've been playing the new Bust-A-Move game that's on iOS, but it's not...

28:02.560 --> 28:07.040
I hate how they're taking all of them from just the old school gameplay to the, oh, you

28:07.040 --> 28:09.840
get bombs if you pay this many points.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.520
I'm like, no, that's boring.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.120
I just want to play fucking Bust-A-Move.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.360
So I'm mad.

28:17.040 --> 28:17.680
That's it.

28:17.680 --> 28:18.800
I haven't really been playing much.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.640
All right, let's check in with Loki.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.600
How was your gaming week?

28:21.680 --> 28:22.800
I really only...

28:22.800 --> 28:23.600
One last, wow.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.960
I really didn't play too much this week, except for, of course, Dance of the Revolution

28:30.960 --> 28:34.000
Extreme, and then a little bit of mobile stuff.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.120
I did play a little bit of Ingress, a little bit of Pokemon Go when I was at places near

28:39.120 --> 28:46.560
that stuff, and then a little bit of my Office Space game, although I only played that very

28:46.560 --> 28:47.440
sparingly.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.400
So that's about it.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.200
I wanted to play more.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.280
Just, I don't know.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.160
I was working on stuff.

28:52.960 --> 28:53.920
Unfortunately, not games.

28:54.480 --> 28:54.880
All right.

28:54.880 --> 28:58.400
Learning HTML5 and CSS3.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.160
Fun stuff.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.560
Well, I feel like I played a lot this week, so get a chair.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.560
I'll take up for the time then.

29:05.360 --> 29:09.520
So I've also been playing the phone games, the Ingress, especially the Pokemon Go, since

29:09.520 --> 29:10.880
they did the community event yesterday.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.080
Yes, I got a shiny.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.760
Yeah, I got three shinies.

29:13.760 --> 29:17.200
But I didn't get enough to get a dragon.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.240
Oh, bummer.

29:18.240 --> 29:23.280
Yeah, I went out with Shane from Ranger Pride, which came back this week, by the way, you

29:23.280 --> 29:23.520
guys.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.640
So check that out at VOG Network.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.720
Shane from Ranger Pride, myself, some of our other buddies.

29:28.720 --> 29:33.600
We went over to Capitol Park here in SAC, and it was lit up with lures, as you can imagine,

29:33.600 --> 29:35.520
and we walked around the entire three hours.

29:35.520 --> 29:39.200
We walked around the park, and I probably caught easy, like 150 Dratini's.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.160
I caught three shinies, which was the minimum I wanted.

29:42.160 --> 29:46.240
So that way I could have a Dratini, Dragonite, Dragonair.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.080
I could have each one of them in a shiny form.

29:48.960 --> 29:49.920
I got that.

29:49.920 --> 29:50.800
So I'm happy with that.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.800
But yeah, lots and lots of Dratini candy and just a good time and good exercise, which

29:54.800 --> 29:55.040
is good.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.040
A good excuse to just get out, walk around.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.560
And I'm telling you guys, and I'm using my quotey finger, dead game.

30:00.560 --> 30:04.640
And I realize less people are calling it that now because they end up embarrassed, but it's

30:04.640 --> 30:05.440
not a dead game.

30:05.440 --> 30:10.080
Like looking at Capitol, there was a lot of people there, and it was to the point where

30:10.080 --> 30:13.840
the police were kind of coming around going like, what is going on?

30:13.840 --> 30:17.600
And then when somebody was like, Pokemon, there's a lot of Pokemon stuff going on.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.800
Oh, okay.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.640
Because they were showing up because they're like, what is this unpermitted event that's

30:22.640 --> 30:24.480
happening at the Capitol right now?

30:24.480 --> 30:25.840
Like, they thought it was a protest.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.520
How dare people use our parks?

30:27.520 --> 30:31.520
Which ironically, there was a protest because we walked by.

30:31.520 --> 30:37.280
There were two guys there on the state Capitol with a mega horn talking about the California

30:37.280 --> 30:38.960
seceding for the nation, that whole thing.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.440
California being the whole separate.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.400
Yeah, right.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.600
So that is what was going on.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.120
I'm sure those guys were confused, too.

30:45.120 --> 30:47.280
Like, why would these people look up for their phones?

30:47.440 --> 30:49.840
We got a great turnout here, right?

30:49.840 --> 30:50.960
We're not here for you, bitch.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.400
There's a shiny here.

30:52.400 --> 30:52.900
All right.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.680
So anyway, that's how you get us to succeed.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.680
Or you just, you know, but I'll wait now.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.400
That wouldn't work.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.320
I don't know if we can succeed and join Canada.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.040
That would be great in the nation of California.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.640
Shiny Dragon Knights for all.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.140
Yay.

31:05.680 --> 31:05.920
All right.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.160
Anyway, all that political stuff aside.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.640
So that was just a quick side note.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.760
Super multitasking is listed as one of the featured games on Steam right now.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.480
Is that just your library?

31:16.480 --> 31:17.440
Because it's tailored to you.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.800
It might be tailored to you because everybody's playing it.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.760
But it's on there.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.000
All right.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.360
Well, since you brought it up.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.520
Spoiler, Jamie.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.800
Geez, I was going to get to it.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.520
But I wasn't saying it to spoil it.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.040
I'm saying that it was.

31:31.040 --> 31:31.540
It's fine.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.480
Congrats to Aaron or YYR.

31:34.480 --> 31:39.200
His game Super Multitasking officially released on Steam on Friday, Thursday.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.080
I think it was Friday.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.880
So it's officially out there and you can buy it.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.120
It is still $4.49.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.280
It's 10% off the $5 price.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.120
And you've heard us talking about this game a lot.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.880
You know, please consider going to support Aaron.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.560
Best way I can describe the game.

31:54.560 --> 32:00.080
It's similar to WarioWare, but obviously kind of different types of games.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.960
And the fact is you play four of them all at the same time.

32:04.960 --> 32:05.520
Sometimes.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.640
Sometimes it's one, it's two.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.800
It gets harder and harder as it moves along, right?

32:08.800 --> 32:11.520
So just honestly, go look at YouTube.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.800
Go look at Twitch.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.240
Go watch somebody play it.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.880
Because it's just a lot of fun.

32:16.880 --> 32:20.320
I think the best way to sell quote unquote the game is to watch.

32:20.960 --> 32:28.320
And if you're a streamer, I would really urge you to pick up Super Multitasking or contact

32:28.320 --> 32:30.080
YYR underscore on Twitter.

32:30.080 --> 32:33.520
Because if you're a streamer, he may just straight up like, you know, help you out with

32:33.520 --> 32:34.800
getting hooked up with the product.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.120
Because I think they make for a very fun stream.

32:37.120 --> 32:41.600
Because I did a stream of Super Multitasking on Friday and people were, you know, I was

32:41.600 --> 32:44.720
getting really mad because those challenges get hard.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.120
And you know, it's just like over and over and over again, you're doing it.

32:47.120 --> 32:51.520
And then finally you get through and it feels really, really, really good.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.520
So yeah, that's great.

32:54.080 --> 32:59.040
So congrats to Aaron or YYR on his release of Super Multitasking and check that out on

32:59.040 --> 32:59.280
Steam.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.520
Other stuff I played this week.

33:01.520 --> 33:06.080
So today with my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness, we did a live stream.

33:06.080 --> 33:10.240
So I didn't do a post OLR stream because we're doing something else after OLR tonight, which

33:10.240 --> 33:11.760
I'm going to get to in a minute here in housekeeping.

33:12.320 --> 33:16.880
But I did a pre-OLR stream tonight with my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.480
And we played 20XX or as I call it 20XDX.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.800
That's the Mega Man-esque type of game.

33:22.800 --> 33:27.200
But it's more like a roguelike, I guess, where you try to gather as many items as you can

33:27.200 --> 33:28.880
and it carries over into the next game.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.440
And that was a lot of fun because you can actually play that co-op online.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.520
So that's something that you can't really do in Mega Man.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.720
So that was really fun.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.000
And then we played Mario Kart.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.120
You know, we had to have that standby game that other people could join in.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.080
And that was a lot of fun.

33:40.080 --> 33:43.200
And it was funny because Bobby kept coming in last place.

33:43.200 --> 33:48.000
And then all of a sudden, like the last ones, he whooped our butt in the 200cc.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.400
And I was like, Bobby's not going to play 200cc.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.160
And then that's the one he murders us at.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.600
So congrats to Bobby.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.120
And now he can't complain about that.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.720
But that was a lot of fun that Mario Kart stream.

33:56.720 --> 34:01.600
So you can follow me on Twitch if you want to see more of that at Rob Roberts on Twitch.

34:01.600 --> 34:06.320
And of course, a shout out as well to Delvin at VG Realness over on Twitch for doing the

34:06.320 --> 34:07.600
co-streaming with me today.

34:07.600 --> 34:12.320
And congrats, of course, to VOG's very own Bobby Blackwolf for getting affiliate this

34:12.320 --> 34:12.480
week.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.520
So you can check him out on Twitch at Bobby Blackwolf.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.400
And he just finished up Police Quest 2.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.360
He is streaming on original hardware.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.400
He is not no emulators, no good old games.

34:24.400 --> 34:24.880
No, no, no.

34:24.880 --> 34:30.960
That is the original Pentium computer with his Roland MT-32 card that he is streaming

34:30.960 --> 34:31.520
these games on.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.160
That's a lot of fun.

34:32.720 --> 34:36.640
So well, the streaming doesn't happen on that machine, but the machine is running the game.

34:37.280 --> 34:37.920
You know what I mean.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.080
One other thing I want to mention.

34:40.880 --> 34:41.440
No, I lied.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.400
Two other things I want to mention.

34:42.400 --> 34:47.680
One, I want to give a quick shout out to Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 on the Switch because I did

34:47.680 --> 34:50.240
play Bayonetta on the Switch this week for a little bit.

34:50.240 --> 34:53.680
It's a good port and just love and play in that game again.

34:53.680 --> 34:57.680
By the way, you remember the story last week about how some of the codes for Bayonetta

34:57.680 --> 35:00.880
2 for the original Bayonetta were bad.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.000
Hey, guess what?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.080
I got a bad code for Bayonetta.

35:04.080 --> 35:09.200
So I actually had to call Nintendo on Monday, I think it was, and talk to the guy about

35:09.200 --> 35:11.680
getting a replacement code, but they were very good.

35:11.680 --> 35:14.080
All I had to do was give them the code that I did have.

35:14.080 --> 35:17.840
And it sounded like they had a program on their side that was like translating the codes

35:17.840 --> 35:19.600
from the bad code to a good code.

35:19.600 --> 35:23.200
So I don't know where the screw up was, but they were able to fix it pretty quick.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.360
Waiting on hold was the hardest part.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.040
So I guess props to Nintendo for at least.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.040
Waiting is the hardest part.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.720
And then lastly, lastly, the last thing on Switch that I played this week was Pac-Man

35:34.720 --> 35:37.360
Championship Edition 2 Plus.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.480
And you're probably thinking, Rob, haven't you played this game before?

35:40.480 --> 35:46.320
Yeah, I own it on PlayStation 4 and PC and now Switch.

35:46.320 --> 35:50.960
But in my defense, I bought it on PC as like part of a bundle where it cost me like $2

35:50.960 --> 35:51.520
on PCs.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.280
Like it was nothing on PC.

35:53.280 --> 35:57.600
The reason why I got the Switch version was A, for the portability of it and B, there's

35:57.600 --> 36:01.280
actually a brand new mode now that is a two player mode.

36:01.280 --> 36:05.840
And what might not be obvious, which I think is unfortunate, but what's probably not obvious

36:05.840 --> 36:10.240
in the marketing material for the game is that you can have the computer control the

36:10.240 --> 36:11.360
second character.

36:11.360 --> 36:15.280
Now, obviously, it's going to be way more fun if you actually have a second person doing

36:15.280 --> 36:15.760
it.

36:15.760 --> 36:21.520
But it is kind of cool that you can play with your computer as the partner and you can still

36:21.520 --> 36:24.000
kind of experience the new mode because it is different.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.720
It's very different from the regular game because in the two player game, you each are

36:28.720 --> 36:32.240
eating the pellets and you can kind of help each other or you can kind of stick to your

36:32.240 --> 36:33.200
side of the maze.

36:33.200 --> 36:38.160
But once you're finished eating the dot, you don't reset to the bottom to pick up the fruit.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.840
You actually have to kiss.

36:39.840 --> 36:43.840
The two Pac-Man's have to kiss because they're each holding, they're holding the fruit and

36:43.840 --> 36:44.320
bubbles.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.520
And then when they kiss, they make the fruit and then you go to the next level.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.360
So it does add a new element to it.

36:49.360 --> 36:53.920
And then when the ghosts are on rails, when you are in the power pellet mode, it's kind

36:53.920 --> 36:57.760
of the most controversial switch in Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 is that they put the

36:57.760 --> 37:00.480
ghosts on rails during that part.

37:00.480 --> 37:05.440
But what happens is that one Pac-Man has to eat the head and the other has to eat the

37:05.440 --> 37:05.760
tail.

37:06.480 --> 37:10.560
But once one of you hits the head, it freezes for like 10 seconds.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.400
So it gives you an opportunity to grab the tail.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.680
So I mean, these little twists really kind of change it up a bit.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.280
So it almost feels like a different game.

37:17.280 --> 37:22.720
So if you're into the Pac-Man Championship game, it's worth checking out, especially if

37:22.720 --> 37:24.720
you missed it on all the other platforms.

37:24.720 --> 37:28.400
I would say the Switch version is now probably the definitive edition.

37:28.400 --> 37:33.920
However, one thing I do have to read it for, the game works really well in handheld mode.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.400
It seems like it's optimized for handheld mode.

37:36.400 --> 37:42.160
In console mode, I did notice some frame skip and some bad optimization, which considering

37:42.160 --> 37:46.320
this game is not exactly new, it's been out on PlayStation 4, it's been out on PC.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.080
That's a bit of a no-no.

37:48.640 --> 37:54.080
So I do hope Namco will look at this issue and address it because it was something I

37:54.080 --> 37:55.040
definitely noticed.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.720
And if you've seen Pac-Man Championship Edition 2, it is a little bit graphic intensive.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.000
So especially during some of the transitions, like if you notice, like with the Pac-Man

38:02.000 --> 38:06.640
floats off one board down to another board, which is a very money shot you see in the

38:06.640 --> 38:09.600
trailers, that's where I noticed the frame skip the worst.

38:09.600 --> 38:14.800
And that's kind of a bummer because that is a very cool visual flare that the game has.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.280
So yeah, there you go.

38:17.280 --> 38:22.240
But I would say check that out for those of you guys that are on the Nintendo Switch and

38:22.240 --> 38:25.360
maybe have not played Pac-Man Championship Edition yet.

38:27.520 --> 38:30.720
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

38:30.720 --> 38:34.160
Brad from Paw Culture says, got to get the Xbox version and complete the set.

38:34.720 --> 38:35.600
What do you think this is?

38:35.600 --> 38:36.320
Mass Effect?

38:36.320 --> 38:38.480
No, no, I'm done.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.240
I'm not going to buy this Pac-Man game anymore.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.720
The only reason I bought it on the Switch was for handheld and the fact that it had

38:44.720 --> 38:48.880
like this whole new sub game in it that I think is important to check out.

38:48.880 --> 38:54.080
So, um, which also, you know, not to humble brag, but I think I will a little bit, probably

38:54.080 --> 38:57.120
because not a lot of people are playing this game on Switch right now.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.760
I have a top 50 score in the base board.

38:59.760 --> 39:04.480
I have the 40th highest score, uh, out of like maybe 4,200 players.

39:04.480 --> 39:09.200
So what's cool is that if you're in the top 50, you can actually watch a replay.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.240
So if you look for Rob, I might still be, I might've got bumped off by the time you

39:12.240 --> 39:16.240
hear this, but if you look at the top 50 for just the basic beginner champion board and

39:16.240 --> 39:20.320
you see Rob, you can actually watch my replay and see that I did have some imperfections

39:20.320 --> 39:22.080
in my run, but I'm going to try to get better.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.160
Cause I, I really enjoy the game.

39:24.160 --> 39:29.360
Um, even though the ghosts on rails, you know, it's a little bit of a shortcoming.

39:29.360 --> 39:33.040
I wish they'd kind of done that a little bit differently, but I love the music too.

39:33.040 --> 39:37.440
The music just like gets, it's like the Pac-Man Championship Edition games have great soundtracks

39:37.440 --> 39:38.640
and this one's no different.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.160
So anyway, I have blabbed enough about my gaming week.

39:42.160 --> 39:42.880
Let's move on.

39:42.880 --> 39:47.120
I want to go to some housekeeping here cause I've got something big to talk about tonight.

39:47.120 --> 39:54.320
Um, over at the voice geeks network, vog network.com, we have introduced a brand new show and we

39:54.320 --> 39:58.320
want to give a warm welcome to this show has actually been existing for a little while.

39:58.320 --> 40:02.000
But they've just joined up, partnered up with the voice geeks network this week.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.560
So we want to say hello and welcome to the far away nearby, which is a new podcast on

So a big welcome to those guys and thanks for being here at the voice of geeks network.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.360
So thank you.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.440
Everybody in chats, giving them a big warm welcome.

We're going to check out their latest episode, passion, privilege, and peril tonight after

So welcome far away nearby.

41:18.800 --> 41:23.360
You can follow them on Twitter at T F N DJ.

41:23.360 --> 41:26.720
I hope I did not screw that up, but I'm doing that off the top of my head.

41:26.720 --> 41:29.520
I'm double checking myself on the website right now.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.400
I think I got it right.

41:30.400 --> 41:33.200
If I got that wrong, just holler at me and chat DJ star Sage.

41:33.200 --> 41:33.700
All right.

41:34.180 --> 41:36.660
Um, that's all I have for housekeeping.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.500
You'll follow us on Twitter at OLR.

41:38.500 --> 41:41.700
We're also on Facebook at orange lounge radio.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.460
Let's get into some gaming news.

41:45.460 --> 41:46.260
Loki.

41:46.260 --> 41:46.660
Yes.

41:46.660 --> 41:52.820
So apparently square Enix has plans for final fantasy 15 that go on through 2019 as far

41:52.820 --> 41:56.260
as the download content schedule that they have.

41:56.260 --> 41:58.500
So they're going to keep adding different things to it.

41:59.140 --> 42:05.540
Um, including actually, um, with the launch of the PC version, they have a skin that is

42:05.540 --> 42:07.700
half-life themed as well.

42:07.700 --> 42:12.820
So yes, you can actually, um, dress up like Gordon Freeman if you want.

42:12.820 --> 42:13.460
I hate this.

42:14.420 --> 42:16.260
Like I, I just, I hate it.

42:17.060 --> 42:17.460
Thanks.

42:17.460 --> 42:18.020
I hate it.

42:18.820 --> 42:26.180
But it is, it's any less, is this more ridiculous than, um, you know, the whole cup noodle stuff?

42:26.180 --> 42:27.700
I mean, come on.

42:27.700 --> 42:31.060
I guess not, but I just, I hate it for multiple reasons.

42:31.620 --> 42:38.580
For one, like really like half like, like stop shoving half-life in our face.

42:38.580 --> 42:41.460
If you're not going to fucking make half-life three, like just stop it.

42:41.460 --> 42:42.260
It's fucking rude.

42:42.900 --> 42:44.660
It sounds like a valve problem.

42:44.660 --> 42:45.300
It is.

42:45.300 --> 42:47.700
And I'm, I'm giving him, giving him shit for that.

42:47.700 --> 42:52.020
But then at the same time, it's like, you know, I just, I feel like this is such a weird

42:52.900 --> 42:56.100
out of place addition, but then at the same time, and I know somebody is going to call

42:56.100 --> 43:00.340
me out on chat on it, so I might as well just say, I know they did the Mass Effect

43:00.340 --> 43:05.460
costumes in Final Fantasy 13 too, but I was okay with that.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.620
No, they were kind of ridiculous there too.

43:07.620 --> 43:09.700
They were, they were kind of ridiculous.

43:09.700 --> 43:12.420
I'm kind of okay with them going ridiculous.

43:12.420 --> 43:14.340
Let's make it even more ridiculous.

43:14.980 --> 43:16.980
I mean, might as well, because you know what?

43:18.260 --> 43:20.820
That's, hey, there we go.

43:20.820 --> 43:22.100
It worked for Volition.

43:22.100 --> 43:22.740
Let's do that.

43:22.740 --> 43:26.740
You know, let's take Final Fantasy in the, in the direction of Saints Row.

43:27.460 --> 43:28.740
Let's put Johnny Gat in the game.

43:28.740 --> 43:29.140
Why not?

43:29.140 --> 43:31.380
Like everybody wants fucking Johnny Gat and stuff.

43:31.380 --> 43:31.860
Over the top.

43:31.860 --> 43:32.980
Throw Johnny Gat in there.

43:32.980 --> 43:35.060
He can be another member of their team.

43:35.060 --> 43:38.420
And actually I'd be fine at that actually.

43:38.420 --> 43:42.100
How do you feel about Final Fantasy 15 continuing on into 2019?

43:42.100 --> 43:46.500
Because I kind of wish they'd let it go and let the team work on some, like Final Fantasy

43:46.500 --> 43:47.940
16 or something new.

43:48.580 --> 43:57.380
Like, I just, I feel like I played and I finished Final Fantasy 15 and I'm getting irritated

43:57.380 --> 44:01.300
that it keeps saying, nope, you got to come back and play through the whole game again.

44:01.300 --> 44:05.220
Cause we changed this one little thing or we did this one, you know, new thing that's

44:05.220 --> 44:08.260
different or now there's this one character you can play as or something.

44:08.260 --> 44:13.060
It's like, okay, if you're going to like, then I'm just going to check out until you're

44:13.060 --> 44:16.180
done releasing all this shit and then I'll play the game again.

44:16.180 --> 44:16.820
You know what I mean?

44:17.700 --> 44:18.420
Yeah.

44:18.420 --> 44:19.140
It was funny.

44:19.140 --> 44:22.340
Like I was actually talking to my son about, I was like, oh yeah, I need to finish that

44:22.340 --> 44:22.500
game.

44:22.500 --> 44:25.940
Cause he was asking me, he's all, what was that game that you're playing?

44:25.940 --> 44:30.660
They had a guy at the large sword and, and you got food out of eggs.

44:30.660 --> 44:31.860
I'm like, geez, you know what?

44:31.860 --> 44:34.420
That could be like a billion different things.

44:34.420 --> 44:36.740
I like, I have no idea what you're talking about.

44:36.740 --> 44:39.780
And I still don't know what he, what game he was referring to, but I was like, Final

44:39.780 --> 44:41.140
Fantasy 15, maybe.

44:41.140 --> 44:46.020
I mean, like, I don't think I ever saw me playing that game, but, uh, but I'm like,

44:46.020 --> 44:48.180
oh yeah, I do need to go play that.

44:48.180 --> 44:52.980
I mean, I guess for the people that really enjoy Final Fantasy 15 and are really, you

44:52.980 --> 44:54.740
know, into the game and the lore.

44:54.740 --> 44:57.460
I mean, it is cool that the game is continuing on.

44:57.460 --> 45:02.020
I mean, I guess it would be similar to, you know, that continued DLC they did for the

45:02.020 --> 45:03.700
Mass Effect games for a while worse.

45:03.700 --> 45:06.580
They could make spinoff games like they did with seven.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.580
Final Fantasy 15 was a spinoff game.

45:08.580 --> 45:09.300
Remember?

45:09.300 --> 45:11.300
It started as a spinoff game.

45:11.300 --> 45:11.800
True.

45:12.660 --> 45:13.620
This is true.

45:13.620 --> 45:13.940
Yes.

45:13.940 --> 45:17.700
Now that I think it, um, but like, you know, I'm talking about like, you know, they could

45:17.700 --> 45:20.020
do a dirge of Severus or something like that.

45:20.020 --> 45:20.520
Cerberus.

45:21.380 --> 45:26.820
Uh, Jamie, I, are you, I don't think you really got into Final Fantasy 15, but how do you

45:26.820 --> 45:31.140
feel about the, the life till 2019 of this game?

45:31.140 --> 45:32.100
I don't care.

45:32.100 --> 45:33.300
I'm not going to play it.

45:33.300 --> 45:37.620
I hope they actually make that stupid VR mode that they actually were showing off originally

45:38.740 --> 45:42.020
that was going to be the VR modes instead of the fishing bullshit.

45:42.020 --> 45:43.300
Oh, so angry.

45:44.740 --> 45:47.140
I, it's just so ridiculous.

45:47.140 --> 45:48.820
I mean, I'll be honest.

45:48.820 --> 45:55.380
I haven't really enjoyed a Final Fantasy game past other than the MMOs.

45:55.380 --> 46:00.980
I mean, like the last one I played any significant amount of was eight and I don't think it was

46:00.980 --> 46:01.860
as good as seven.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.300
I barely touched nine.

46:03.940 --> 46:04.660
Ten was fun.

46:05.300 --> 46:09.620
And after that, I mean, it's just, it's just lost me.

46:09.620 --> 46:10.740
Twelve though, girl.

46:10.740 --> 46:11.780
Twelve's so good.

46:12.820 --> 46:13.700
I don't like twelve.

46:14.340 --> 46:15.300
Eleven and fourteen.

46:15.300 --> 46:16.180
I hate the draw system.

46:16.180 --> 46:17.860
She said besides MMOs.

46:17.860 --> 46:18.980
I hate the draw system.

46:18.980 --> 46:20.900
Draws not in twelve, draws in eight.

46:20.900 --> 46:23.380
Well, I mean, not eight, but the targeting system.

46:23.380 --> 46:25.060
Oh, it is a little, it is a little different.

46:25.060 --> 46:25.380
Yeah.

46:25.380 --> 46:26.500
It's annoying is what it is.

46:26.500 --> 46:30.420
Twelve wasn't, see that was the one I was supposed to play was twelve because it was

46:30.420 --> 46:36.020
similar, the combat system was similar to like look like eleven almost where you kind of

46:36.020 --> 46:36.900
get near something.

46:36.900 --> 46:41.060
Actually, that's almost like Parasite Eve even, but I don't know.

46:41.060 --> 46:44.260
I kind of, I wouldn't mind if they remastered thirteen, honestly.

46:44.260 --> 46:48.260
I know that's the one people love to hate on, but I liked thirteen well enough and I

46:48.260 --> 46:52.980
think that trilogy deserves a nice little, you know, boost into the PlayStation four

46:52.980 --> 46:54.340
and Xbox one era.

46:54.340 --> 46:56.420
But, you know, I'm not going to hold my breath.

46:56.420 --> 46:56.920
First one.

46:57.780 --> 47:00.900
I mean, cause I have this ending spoiler and I'm like, eh, what's the point now?

47:00.900 --> 47:05.540
I think Final Fantasy thirteen is one of those Final Fantasy games that actually had a

47:05.540 --> 47:07.460
good ending, I think.

47:07.460 --> 47:09.780
I mean, it was, it did not go on for a half hour.

47:09.860 --> 47:10.980
It was like a five minute.

47:10.980 --> 47:13.380
Well, it depends on what you look at as ending.

47:13.380 --> 47:19.300
If you want to look at just from when final boss dies to directed by so and so in the

47:19.300 --> 47:21.620
credits, it's like maybe five and a half minutes.

47:21.620 --> 47:24.500
You know, it's, it's pretty succinct, but it's a, it's a really good five and a half

47:24.500 --> 47:25.000
minutes.

47:25.460 --> 47:28.820
So anyway, uh, okay.

47:28.820 --> 47:30.580
I guess we'll move on other stories.

47:30.580 --> 47:35.140
I just want Final Fantasy six in Final Fantasy fifteen's engine.

47:36.420 --> 47:39.060
I could go for that, but you know, we're getting Final Fantasy seven.

47:39.460 --> 47:44.340
Yeah, I'll settle for seven, but like after we're done with this and they run out of ideas

47:44.340 --> 47:49.380
again, which will be like five minutes later, the best six, the best Final Fantasy story

47:49.380 --> 47:51.060
right now is in Final Fantasy fourteen.

47:51.060 --> 47:54.980
And it's just a bummer that so many people are going to miss it because of the multiplayer

47:54.980 --> 47:58.180
slash MMO slash monthly fee elements are getting bored with it.

47:58.180 --> 48:02.100
And I, well, I mean, what part of the game made you bored?

48:03.060 --> 48:07.860
Pretty much anything having to do with not being able to jump to the next quest because

48:07.860 --> 48:08.980
of a level cap.

48:08.980 --> 48:09.380
Okay.

48:09.380 --> 48:10.980
That's, that's fair.

48:10.980 --> 48:12.820
Um, they have an end game.

48:12.820 --> 48:16.020
They have done some reduction on the experience you need.

48:16.020 --> 48:20.100
So hopefully it would help, but I'm already paying for a while, so I'm not going to pay

48:20.100 --> 48:24.660
for another major course with 11 was the whole level cap system.

48:24.660 --> 48:26.020
Do you have to do like level breaks?

48:26.020 --> 48:28.500
Do they have that system in 14?

48:28.500 --> 48:29.540
Oh, thank God.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.220
Well, wait, I take that back.

48:31.220 --> 48:36.020
Um, well, it's nothing like it wasn't, I'd have to grind for days just because I would

48:36.100 --> 48:39.780
not have enough experience or not be a high enough level to take my next quest.

48:40.900 --> 48:41.620
Stupid.

48:41.620 --> 48:43.860
Especially in the beginning, it can be.

48:43.860 --> 48:47.380
And the story unfortunately doesn't get like really good until like level 45.

48:48.020 --> 48:52.580
Well, and I mean, I've got a higher level character already, but I mean, the thing

48:52.580 --> 48:58.340
that I really liked with what world of Warcraft did is now you've got the scaling leveling

48:58.340 --> 49:00.740
and that has been working out amazingly.

49:00.740 --> 49:02.740
Did they fix the old dungeons ever?

49:02.740 --> 49:03.460
Cause that was the part.

49:04.180 --> 49:08.420
I just walked into the one in Orgrimmar by accident and it's, it was a level 20 dungeon.

49:08.420 --> 49:11.780
So, and I, um, my character is like 35 right now.

49:11.780 --> 49:12.820
My, uh, night born.

49:13.460 --> 49:14.180
Interesting.

49:14.180 --> 49:21.700
So yeah, I think that if you did it in a dungeon finder, it would scale, but if you just walk

49:21.700 --> 49:23.940
into it, it's, it's native level.

49:25.140 --> 49:25.380
All right.

49:25.380 --> 49:28.100
Well, let's move on to some news about Nintendo.

49:28.100 --> 49:32.980
Nintendo bringing something that, you know, a lot of other companies did a long time ago,

49:33.060 --> 49:34.580
but they're finally introducing it.

49:34.580 --> 49:37.060
And it could be interesting to see how it works out for them.

49:37.060 --> 49:39.940
This has to do with user reviews.

49:39.940 --> 49:40.420
That's right.

49:40.420 --> 49:43.620
Nintendo.com now has a user review system.

49:44.340 --> 49:48.900
So if you have ever played a Nintendo switch or a Nintendo 3DS game, and this of course

49:48.900 --> 49:54.660
is all going to be noted by your play history, um, you can actually go into your, my Nintendo

49:54.660 --> 49:58.500
account and you can actually find a game that you've played either on desktop or mobile.

49:58.500 --> 50:02.580
And there should be a review this game prompt, or you can actually review the game.

50:02.580 --> 50:07.060
Now, in order to actually leave a review, you have to have played the game for at least

50:07.060 --> 50:08.340
two hours.

50:08.340 --> 50:12.100
If you've played the game for two hours, you can give the game a one to five star rating,

50:12.100 --> 50:15.060
do a headline, and then fill out a review box.

50:15.060 --> 50:20.500
And you can use some pre-made tags, including kid appropriate, challenging online play and

50:20.500 --> 50:21.300
so forth.

50:21.300 --> 50:22.740
And then there's a spoiler box.

50:23.460 --> 50:26.180
And then you also get to identify what type of gamer you are.

50:26.180 --> 50:29.700
Are you a Nintendo fan, a core gamer, a casual gamer, and a parent?

50:29.700 --> 50:32.340
That's interesting how they have both.

50:32.340 --> 50:35.140
Because parents can't just be, you know, any of them.

50:35.140 --> 50:36.420
I'm assuming you're not limited.

50:36.420 --> 50:39.540
Oh no, it says you can't pick more than one of those.

50:39.540 --> 50:43.940
So if you're a casual gaming parent, Nintendo fan, I guess you have to pick the one you

50:43.940 --> 50:44.580
are the most.

50:45.700 --> 50:51.700
Anyway, reviews will be moderated, but it will not be modified, uh, just because they

50:51.700 --> 50:54.500
give a negative evaluation of a Nintendo product.

50:54.500 --> 50:58.980
Uh, it says that reviews will go live within three to seven business days, assuming it's

50:58.980 --> 50:59.700
for all ages.

50:59.700 --> 51:03.540
So I'm assuming you can't go in there and write a review that's, fuck this fucking piece

51:03.540 --> 51:04.660
of fuck garbage.

51:04.660 --> 51:07.380
You know, you can't, sorry, Loki.

51:07.860 --> 51:13.700
Um, anyhow, this is just interesting just because Nintendo is doing this after so long.

51:13.700 --> 51:15.780
Why are they just now adopting this?

51:15.780 --> 51:21.380
My thought is, is that it's because of the Switch's library, because so much of the

51:21.380 --> 51:25.220
Switch's library is online and there's so many indie titles.

51:25.220 --> 51:30.180
And I think a lot of them get lost because, you know, for all the, we, you didn't have

51:30.180 --> 51:34.900
any software talk, there's like four or five games a week coming out on Switch.

51:34.900 --> 51:39.060
Now, granted, most of them are online indie titles, but that doesn't mean they're bad

51:39.060 --> 51:39.300
stuff.

51:39.300 --> 51:41.380
In fact, there's a lot of really good stuff in there.

51:41.380 --> 51:45.380
I see tons of people playing that Celeste right now, which I admittedly don't know much

51:45.380 --> 51:48.660
about, but I know that's something that came out on Switch, but maybe through user

51:48.660 --> 51:50.420
reviews, I would get to hear more about it.

51:51.300 --> 51:53.860
Loki, what do you think about Nintendo rolling out user reviews?

51:53.860 --> 52:01.140
This is a good thing or only worked so well in Steam and as long as they moderate it,

52:01.140 --> 52:06.580
you know, I think that's because people will try to abuse the system, but it couldn't

52:06.580 --> 52:10.580
hurt or at least, you know, even they have like something basic, like ratings, like one

52:10.580 --> 52:15.540
to five stars and stuff in the PlayStation Network, although it's hard to see what people's

52:15.540 --> 52:16.740
feedback is on that stuff.

52:16.740 --> 52:17.780
I think that's a good thing.

52:17.780 --> 52:18.180
Mm hmm.

52:19.380 --> 52:24.180
Bobby Black Wolf in chat suggests that what they're going for with the tagging is what

52:24.180 --> 52:26.340
voice are you rating that review?

52:26.340 --> 52:30.500
So you might be a casual gaming Nintendo fan parent, but they want you to focus your review

52:30.500 --> 52:33.060
on how it is for your kid since you're their parent.

52:33.060 --> 52:34.100
That's a good perspective.

52:35.940 --> 52:40.580
I hope they call that out as such in the rules, but that's a good way to figure out what tag

52:40.580 --> 52:44.180
would be most appropriate is what voice are you using to talk about it.

52:44.180 --> 52:48.740
So, um, yeah, pretty, pretty interesting to see Nintendo get on board with that.

52:48.740 --> 52:54.820
Could this be because they have closed Miiverse and maybe Miiverse was a way that you got

52:54.820 --> 52:56.500
the user experience before?

52:56.500 --> 53:01.060
I don't know, but that's one other suggestion that's out there where as to why now is the

53:01.060 --> 53:05.780
time for Nintendo reviews because Miiverse is unfortunately no more.

53:06.340 --> 53:07.540
So, all right.

53:07.540 --> 53:11.460
Well, I think we are good to move on to Dark Soccer, even though she's got Mr. Smoosh in

53:11.460 --> 53:12.020
her lap.

53:12.020 --> 53:15.460
I was giving him good scritches and he was like, oh, this is great.

53:15.460 --> 53:16.820
Yeah, he's up to no good today.

53:16.820 --> 53:20.020
He's been, now he's stepping on the Pikachu pillow over there, making his way back to

53:20.020 --> 53:20.500
the chair.

53:20.500 --> 53:22.660
Did you see my photobomb from the other day?

53:22.660 --> 53:22.900
No.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.820
I was taking a selfie and Midna's butt was in it.

53:24.820 --> 53:25.780
Oh no, I didn't see that.

53:25.780 --> 53:29.060
This cat, that's the best, you know, the best photobomb is cat butt.

53:29.060 --> 53:32.260
You didn't hear me, but Mr. Smoosh jumped up on the mixing board again.

53:32.260 --> 53:34.980
That's something he likes to do to disrupt the show.

53:34.980 --> 53:36.820
Luckily he hasn't figured out how to move the switches yet.

53:36.820 --> 53:38.900
Why are you not paying attention to the cat?

53:38.900 --> 53:39.220
Pretty much.

53:39.220 --> 53:41.140
The cat is the most important person in this room.

53:41.140 --> 53:41.860
Pretty much.

53:41.940 --> 53:42.580
Seriously.

53:43.380 --> 53:49.940
So, well, speaking of Warcraft, since I had brought up my wowing earlier, Warcraft 3,

53:49.940 --> 53:55.220
which is arguably the best of them, had gotten a patch.

53:55.220 --> 53:58.020
Patch 1.29 was released.

53:58.020 --> 54:03.540
It has some balance changes for the heroes, puts in widescreen support and updates to

54:03.540 --> 54:04.500
the map pools.

54:04.500 --> 54:09.620
I also was reading on the update that they're allowing now like a 24 player thing.

54:09.700 --> 54:18.900
But anyway, but the thing about this is that it seems like it's leading up to something.

54:18.900 --> 54:28.100
The last update that Warcraft 3 got was in 2017 when it was, you know, I guess just more

54:28.100 --> 54:28.980
fixes and everything.

54:28.980 --> 54:36.500
But the other thing too is that the thought is that when you install Warcraft 3, this

54:36.500 --> 54:43.380
time, and this is actually pointed out by r__eazy on the World of Warcraft subreddit,

54:43.380 --> 54:50.100
that when you install it, it opens a new launcher that's similar to the battle.net launcher.

54:51.780 --> 54:56.900
And it's been replicated by other places by installing Warcraft 3, the Frozen Throne.

54:58.420 --> 55:05.780
And the launcher was previously used to update the game while the installer was still legacy.

55:05.780 --> 55:10.260
So what's going on right now is the theory is that this is going to lead to a Warcraft

55:10.260 --> 55:15.220
3 remaster, kind of like how the Starcraft remaster went last year, which would be nice

55:15.220 --> 55:19.540
because I mean, Warcraft 3 is actually still a really solid game.

55:19.540 --> 55:23.300
I mean, yeah, it's kind of similar to Starcraft in the fact that people are still playing

55:23.300 --> 55:23.700
it.

55:23.700 --> 55:24.340
Yeah.

55:24.340 --> 55:30.100
Well, on top of that, too, I mean, if you're, you know, a lore whore, you know, it's basically

55:30.100 --> 55:33.700
everything that led up to the start of World of Warcraft.

55:33.700 --> 55:38.340
You know, you had the whole, you know, the Frozen Throne itself was the whole, you know,

55:38.340 --> 55:39.940
Lich King story and all that.

55:39.940 --> 55:41.540
So it's pretty, pretty crazy.

55:42.260 --> 55:53.380
But yeah, there is a Warcraft 3 Invitational Tournament also to be held on February, tomorrow.

55:54.340 --> 55:56.660
Sorry, not tomorrow, February 27th and 28th.

55:56.660 --> 55:57.860
So that's just next week.

55:59.380 --> 56:06.900
That will be hosted by the people from Back to Warcraft and it's going to be on Twitch.

56:06.900 --> 56:12.180
It includes free for all, four versus four, friendly competitions, stuff like that.

56:12.180 --> 56:14.100
So who knows?

56:14.100 --> 56:19.780
I have the theory that they're going to make the announcement at this thing, so it'll be

56:19.780 --> 56:20.260
pretty nice.

56:20.260 --> 56:23.860
But I wonder if they're, you know, if it's that they're going to charge again for a new

56:23.860 --> 56:29.140
version of Warcraft 3, or if they'll like have some deal that if you launch it through

56:29.140 --> 56:32.660
your original disc, you get like a special something or.

56:33.700 --> 56:35.780
Yeah, I'm trying to think of how they did the Starcraft remaster.

56:35.780 --> 56:38.980
Well, ultimately with the Starcraft remaster, they never got rid of the old version.

56:38.980 --> 56:41.540
So the old version, in fact, became free.

56:41.540 --> 56:44.740
And I think it was to drum up interest in the remaster, which I think they were charging

56:44.740 --> 56:45.780
15 bucks for.

56:45.780 --> 56:46.660
It's not terrible.

56:46.660 --> 56:47.300
It's not terrible.

56:47.300 --> 56:50.740
It's enough to pay the artists back, but they didn't necessarily have to reinvent the game.

56:51.540 --> 56:55.540
I would just kind of hope, though, that they'd have like some sort of legacy adoption or

56:55.540 --> 57:00.180
something like, yeah, you have the old, you know, who has discs anymore?

57:00.180 --> 57:01.220
You know, if they catch like.

57:01.220 --> 57:02.660
Was it all serial keys too?

57:02.660 --> 57:04.660
Like you have the serial key on your account?

57:04.660 --> 57:10.100
Like, so if you have like the serial for having purchased, you know, the game, then maybe

57:10.100 --> 57:15.060
you get like some bonus thing for like a legacy account or something.

57:15.060 --> 57:19.940
Let us not forget Warcraft 3 is where basically MOBAs were born, right?

57:20.020 --> 57:23.460
You know, Dota 2 was a mod of Warcraft 3.

57:23.460 --> 57:26.820
Dota is 2 because Dota was a mod of Warcraft 3.

57:26.820 --> 57:27.540
That's been often.

57:27.540 --> 57:31.300
And that's where you now you have Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends and all this

57:31.300 --> 57:34.180
really have Warcraft 3 at its core to thank.

57:34.180 --> 57:34.980
So kind of neat.

57:34.980 --> 57:38.900
And then on top of it, I mean, you know, again, great stories.

57:38.900 --> 57:44.740
And it's where I guess the for the people who play WoW today who maybe not have played

57:44.740 --> 57:47.300
that, that's where these big characters come from.

57:47.380 --> 57:48.100
I mean, sure.

57:48.900 --> 57:52.580
I would say specifically most of the big names come from Warcraft 3.

57:52.580 --> 57:53.540
A few from 2.

57:53.540 --> 57:56.180
Like I think Deathwing was the plot of 2, wasn't it?

57:56.180 --> 57:56.660
Well, yeah.

57:57.300 --> 58:00.980
But I mean, but you know, and what is old is new again.

58:00.980 --> 58:03.460
And who doesn't who doesn't want to move the peons around?

58:03.460 --> 58:04.100
Zug, zug.

58:05.140 --> 58:05.940
Jobs complete.

58:06.820 --> 58:11.220
And I love I was actually just doing because the whole thing I like about the whole level

58:11.220 --> 58:16.180
scaling right now in World of Warcraft is that I've gone back and do content from.

58:17.380 --> 58:20.900
Cataclysm that I'd never done because I didn't play Horde at the time.

58:20.900 --> 58:21.460
All right.

58:21.460 --> 58:25.940
So but I love like how it's like the same, you know, kind of peon voices.

58:25.940 --> 58:26.180
Yeah.

58:26.180 --> 58:26.660
Yeah.

58:26.660 --> 58:29.060
I think they like totally lifted it from the original game.

58:29.060 --> 58:30.340
I think it's just so funny.

58:30.340 --> 58:30.580
Yeah.

58:30.580 --> 58:31.220
Super fun.

58:31.220 --> 58:31.540
Yeah.

58:31.540 --> 58:33.140
So that's a Warcraft 3.

58:33.140 --> 58:33.620
Who knows?

58:33.620 --> 58:35.060
We'll we'll find out this week.

58:36.100 --> 58:37.540
Well, let's move on.

58:37.540 --> 58:39.060
Loki was something else.

58:39.060 --> 58:39.380
Yes.

58:40.020 --> 58:44.740
So let's talk a little bit about that brand new mode that they have in Mario Odyssey.

58:44.740 --> 58:48.900
Remember, they teased it a little bit where you hide balloons and find balloons and stuff

58:48.900 --> 58:49.400
like that.

58:50.020 --> 58:54.100
So like all good things, people have to fuck with it.

58:54.820 --> 59:01.140
And so we're getting issues where people are actually taking the balloons and hiding them

59:01.140 --> 59:08.740
in places that are very hard to get to or are out of bounds in the map, because of course

59:08.740 --> 59:09.220
they are.

59:09.860 --> 59:14.500
So there's people glitching through walls and stuff and hiding them within buildings

59:14.500 --> 59:15.700
and stuff like that.

59:17.060 --> 59:17.780
It's kind of funny.

59:20.100 --> 59:25.300
You know, hopefully Nintendo patches that out, but it's it's interesting to see that

59:25.300 --> 59:29.620
it might be a little bit frustrating to get some of these balloons because they are in

59:29.620 --> 59:31.460
places that you can't really get to.

59:31.460 --> 59:37.700
Yeah, I hear a not a lot of people are a big fan of this new patch for Mario Odyssey, but

59:37.700 --> 59:40.260
I mean, it's nice that they kind of did something new that's free.

59:40.260 --> 59:44.180
But I guess this was a little maybe a little rough around the edges, it sounds like.

59:44.180 --> 59:50.580
Yeah, especially if you're going to play with people that are going to put the balloons

59:50.580 --> 59:51.940
in not so easy places.

59:52.580 --> 59:52.980
Yeah.

59:52.980 --> 59:53.780
All right.

59:53.780 --> 59:57.060
Well, another game that I think some folks are looking forward to on the Switch is the

59:57.060 --> 59:58.900
Mega Man Legacy Collection.

59:58.900 --> 01:00:03.380
Now, Mega Man Legacy Collection, of course, this already released on PlayStation 4 and

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.380
Xbox One, I think the PC as well.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.340
But that doesn't stop people from wanting to buy it again, especially when you can have

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.460
it on the go.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.740
And maybe some people never got it the first time around because Switch is your primary

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.460
console.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:19.140
So it was confirmed that Mega Man Collection 1 plus 2 is going to be released for the Nintendo

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:19.460
Switch.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:24.820
So, yes, it is being bundled together that will have Amiibo support for the Mega Man

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.300
Amiibo.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.060
I think it just unlocks some things.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:31.940
And apparently the way it works is that you will actually be purchasing apparently Mega

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:38.820
Man Legacy Collection 1 is on the cartridge, but then you get a DLC code for Mega Man Legacy

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.860
Collection 2.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:43.940
It's very, very similar to what they just did with Bayonetta 2, having the digital code

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.860
for Bayonetta 1, except it's the other way around.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.780
So that's pretty cool.

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.060
So you can check that out.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.620
And what was the release date on this?

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.180
Release date is May 22nd.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:01:01.380
You can buy the two games together for $39.99 retail.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:08.980
Or you can get them DLC $14.99 for Mega Man Legacy Collection and $19.99 for Mega Man

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.180
Legacy Collection 2.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.860
That's interesting because it's actually cheaper to buy them digitally than to buy the

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.420
cartridge.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:20.020
But I guess that's because of, A, the cost of the cartridge and, oh, maybe that exclusive

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:24.820
Mega Man 30th anniversary cleaning cloth that comes with it.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.380
Oh, geez.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.620
That is interesting, though, that you're really seeing a direct, like, nope, going to be

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.540
cheaper to buy this one digitally.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.860
So interesting how they're kind of doing that.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.700
But, yeah, we'll see how that works out.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.180
I'm starting to have storage issues on my Switch.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:43.140
I had to archive so much stuff in order to be able to fit Bayonetta and Pac-Man.

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.660
Like, I had to go...

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.460
Now, granted, the stuff I was able to archive was really easy.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.020
Like, I archived the old Splatoon demos and stuff.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.580
But still, I mean, it was weird that I was running out of space.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.860
I think I actually did have to move, like, something I'd actually been playing a little

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.260
bit, but just hadn't touched in a few months.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.260
So I might need to buy more memory for my Switch.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.140
Yikes.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:08.500
By the way, Mega Man fans, there are some new Mega Man toys that we're showing off at

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.020
the New York Toy Fair.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:15.940
There are some new 66-action minifigures for Super Mega Man, Star Force Mega Man, Cut Man,

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:16.820
and Vile.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.100
$8 each for those.

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.580
You can actually get some Ride Armors.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.700
X and Vile Ride Armors will be $50 each.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.180
And that was all, again, being shown at the New York Toy Fair.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.540
So those of you guys that really like to collect can check that out.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.900
I like the Cut Man figure.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.100
That's kind of a deep cut, too, because not everybody remembers the bosses from the very

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:34.900
first game.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.780
But I certainly remember that stage and what a pain in the ass it was to beat.

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.740
Because that game was hard.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.340
The original Mega Man was hard.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:46.900
I mean, the other ones were hard, too, but they did kind of dumb down the second game

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.420
a little bit when they released it here, as opposed to Japan.

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:50.900
But the first game-

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.740
I didn't think the first one was that hard.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.900
It was kind of hard.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.420
Like, try to go back and play it now.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.860
Well, I have not too long ago.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.260
Like, 12-year-old you versus now you is going to be very different.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:09.060
Keep in mind, I didn't beat the first Mega Man until I was 18.

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:09.560
Huh.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.700
So, I started with Mega Man 2.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.200
Okay.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.940
So, anyway.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:16.900
Fair enough, fair enough.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.700
What do you have for us, Dark Soccer, before we get to the classic game of the week?

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.740
More Blizzard stuff.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:25.620
There is a rumor, and you know how we are about rumors.

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.460
So rumors, bolded, underlined, slow news week, salt.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.540
It's in italics.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:31.860
All of it.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.820
With quotes.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.320
Yes.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.180
That Blizzard is working on Diablo 3 for Switch.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.460
Which Diablo, who knows.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.340
It got better, didn't it?

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:45.300
It did.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.580
Diablo 3 is a lot of fun.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.380
It would be-

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:48.180
Oh, go ahead.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:52.340
Well, just that they want to implement local play with multiple Switches.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:57.300
So you could have the local co-op on-

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.780
I guess you could just play it on the handheld.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:04.420
What's kind of rad about this, I'm of two mindsets, because there's part of me that

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:09.380
says Diablo 3 is like- how old is Diablo 3 at this point?

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:09.880
At least-

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.220
Five years?

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.020
Five years old?

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:12.740
Six years old, maybe?

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:18.180
Diablo 3 was- you got it for- it was like a thing during Cataclysm.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.860
I want to say it came out almost like 2012.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.340
I think it was coming up on six years old pretty soon.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:25.060
I thought it came out right after Cataclysm.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.060
Well, anyway, regardless, it's kind of an older game.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.380
Now, to be fair, so is Skyrim, and Skyrim's been doing very well on the Switch, and people

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.660
are really excited about that.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.500
Here's what I think is neat about Diablo 3.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:40.900
What the PlayStation and the Xbox can't do is that if you're playing multiplayer in the

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:46.180
same room, you have to basically share the loot drops, and you can't run off the screen

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.500
because you only have one TV, right?

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.700
So you can't run off the screen.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:57.220
If Diablo 3 launches for the Switch, and you are not beholden to be online all the time,

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.060
which I wouldn't think you would be because the Switch is a portable system, and Diablo

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:05.220
dropped that requirement with the console games, not the PC version.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.580
PC is still always online.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:13.540
But my point is, Diablo 3 on the Switch is going to be the closest thing to the LAN experience

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:18.820
from the old Diablo days than even necessarily the PC versions which are always online.

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.460
Think about that.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:23.140
The Switch is now, if you have Diablo 3 on the Switch, it's basically going to be a LAN

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.180
game, right?

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.940
And you have your own thing going on, and so do your friends, and you don't have to

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.260
be confined in the same part of the level.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.300
That's kind of rad.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:41.140
So, but I just, I wish it was Diablo 4, or a new Diablo expansion at least for 3, because

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.140
the story kind of didn't end.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:48.020
They left it wide open for more, so I kind of wish it was a new Diablo thing.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:51.700
But I really like the idea of this game on Switch.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.260
I think it could be a very good console game.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.420
Atdeftinchat at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.540
I want Overwatch on Switch, dammit.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.740
I almost said over swatch.

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.380
Overwatch on Switch, dammit.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:12.100
I mean, it makes a lot of sense if it can handle the graphics, which, you know, Overwatch

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:16.580
can be played on a pretty, you know, a PC that's a few years old.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:19.780
I mean, it's gonna take some, you know, it's not gonna look as good as it does, you know,

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:25.380
4K on, you know, a PC and some things, but, you know, you can run it.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.340
But I think the only problem with Overwatch is that a game like that kind of always has

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:35.540
to be online, so you can't really have the portable element.

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:42.980
However, it would be pretty fucking cool if you could, like, take a Switch to a convention

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.980
and just do, like, a local area network Overwatch game that isn't ranked or anything.

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.260
You don't get points, it doesn't rank.

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.940
Just a, just a brawl that you could do offline with friends.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.300
That would be kind of rad.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.140
So, I'd like to see it.

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:56.200
We'll see.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:57.800
Anyway.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.080
All right.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.180
Anything else with the Diablo story?

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:06.260
I didn't want to miss anything, but I know it is a rumor, so there's probably not a lot

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:06.760
else to say.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.820
All right, let's move on then.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.460
Loki, just a few more stories for our classic game of the week.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.180
All right.

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:16.580
And so, this used to be a game I played quite a bit, Star Control.

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:24.340
And as you remember, there was a lawsuit between the developers and Stardock as to who has

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.260
the rights to the game and that type of thing.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.620
So, there's a little bit more to go along with this.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:37.300
So, apparently now, the developers are filing a counterclaim against Stardock, who had originally

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:46.020
filed the claim, and basically saying that, you know, they filed, Stardock had filed a

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:52.020
complaint in federal court against us, personally alleging, among other things, that we are

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.500
not actually the creators of Star Control.

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.940
This is news to us.

01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:04.420
Are we clones of the original Fred and Paul, just now learning of our squelchy vat birth?

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:07.540
Unfortunately, Stardock's complaint is not a prank.

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:13.060
So, today we took an action, filed a response in federal court, answering Stardock's false

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:13.540
claims.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:18.820
Of course, we also filed a counterclaim against Stardock as the original Fred and Paul would

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.300
have wanted.

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.180
So, I guess they're alleging that they're not the people that they say they are.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.540
What a mess this whole situation is.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:32.100
It is, and I would really like a new Star Control game, but, you know, we'll see.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:37.540
First, we have to, like, figure out copyright law and trademark law.

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.260
There's something that needs to be reformed, man.

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:41.540
It's that.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.300
All right.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:49.380
Well, something that's getting reformed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for a new generation,

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.700
I suppose, is Burnout Paradise.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:52.180
That's right.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.060
It has been confirmed.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:56.820
We had a rumor about this previously, but it was confirmed this week that a remaster

01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.140
will be arriving on March 16th.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:00.820
It will set you back 40 bucks.

01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.980
It will run in 4K.

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.260
That's pretty awesome.

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:08.180
60 frames a second, and of course, online mode is going to be there.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:15.140
When you buy the game for 40 bucks, all 150 cars, all eight expansion packs, including

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:21.140
Big Surf Island, it will run in 1080p on PlayStation 4 and Xbox hardware, and apparently,

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:26.740
4K resolution and 60 frames a second on the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.220
I don't know how they're going to do that on the PlayStation 4 Pro.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:34.260
It was really intended for gaming at 4K, but that'll be impressive if they do it.

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.020
PlayStation 4 Pro?

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:36.340
Yeah.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.140
That's what they're saying.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.820
They could do 4K in Pro.

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.740
In 60 frames a second?

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:41.220
Probably.

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:41.540
Wow.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:41.940
All right.

01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.900
That's that's great.

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.700
Old game.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.300
I mean, all right.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:46.100
Yeah, no.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.060
Hey, I'm all for it.

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.100
I'm down.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.460
That's day one for me.

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.020
Yeah.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.780
And what's also really cool about it.

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:56.100
They did confirm, even though there was a screenshot out there that had an in-game

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.060
purchases optional thing, they did confirm on Twitter.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.660
There are no microtransactions.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.580
There's no additional paid for content.

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.100
So pitchforks down.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.420
So because all of that old stuff is being included.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:11.380
Also, the game's soundtrack is returning in its entirety.

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.260
Yes.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:18.660
So any of the licenses you were worried about from before, you will get the whole welcome.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.580
No, is it Take Me Down Paradise City?

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:21.060
Has to be.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.580
Was the intro song to that game?

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:22.900
Yeah.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.780
Take me down to the paradise city.

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.820
That you're going to get all that.

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:27.860
Nice.

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.820
Excellent impression.

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.300
Thank you.

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.020
Yeah.

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:33.700
Now you just got to be more of an asshole.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.660
He's just screaming in pain.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:38.580
Honestly, for the remastering, it doesn't all it looks less bloomy.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.420
I don't know that anyone can be as big of an asshole as Axl Rose.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.220
Couldn't tell you which one is the new version or not.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.660
Yeah, I'm excited.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.860
Bobby Blackwell says people are excited that the Avril song is in it.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.900
Well, why shouldn't they be?

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.860
Which Avril song was in it?

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.340
I forget.

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.020
Is it complicated or is it one of the other ones?

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.060
Sk8r Boi?

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.260
Which girlfriend?

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:03.700
Hey, that song is so bad, but I love it.

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:04.100
All right.

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.940
So this is coming out on its PlayStation 4 and Xbox.

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:10.820
What about PC?

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.020
Are they doing a PC version?

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:12.500
I don't know.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.100
I have the original PC one.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.340
I don't know if I saw PC in the list.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.420
Let me look again at the list that I'm looking at here.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.260
They're just saying PlayStation 4 and Xbox one is where you can order it right now.

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.100
So not seeing anything on PC.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.780
I bet that comes later.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.900
I bet they're going to go.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.400
Hold on.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:30.340
Sorry.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.380
I bet they're going to go Grand Theft Auto style with it and do the PC version later.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.940
Yeah, because that'd be really nice.

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.340
Act F in chat actually confirms PC is coming.

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:42.580
But later, if I recall correctly.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.100
So those look nice.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.300
I do want it.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.260
I don't want it.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:46.660
All right.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:53.140
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.820
use the passphrase page.

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.460
Well, let's take a trip down memory lane.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.980
Let's go back even further.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.460
You know, why stop at like 10 years of Burnout Paradise?

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:06.580
And we can go back like 30 years with the classic game of the week.

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:12.980
Every week, Dark Sakura picks a classic game from the gaming vault and says, hey, hey,

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.300
hey, you, you go and play this video game.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.220
Dark Sakura on this very special episode.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.420
What did you pick as the classic game of the week?

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.940
I picked 720 degrees.

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.340
I see what you did there.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:30.260
Because of reasons.

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.700
It's episode 720.

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.020
So why not pick 720?

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.520
Right.

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.140
So it came from 1986.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.620
It's a skateboarding game done by Atari Games.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.580
It has to keep the game going.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.180
You have to keep scoring points.

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:53.060
So as a little bit of a timer on it as well.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:57.460
So that's how you get it to take more of your money.

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:57.960
Right.

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:08.260
But anyway, you are playing as a skateboarder going around a middle class neighborhood.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.620
You have to do tricks.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:14.980
You do jumps and you have to acquire enough points to go compete at a skate park.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.940
I'll read this story.

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:23.460
It's just you, your trusty skateboard and a hundred bucks as you skate, jump, slide,

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:28.820
spin and move through four levels of difficulty, picking up loose cash, earning money through

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:32.740
events and finally earning a ticket to one of the big skate parks.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:38.180
If you're lucky, you'll get to buy some rad equipment to make you the coolest skateboarder

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:38.820
alive.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:45.620
So you start off with a number of tickets that get you admission to one of four skate parks

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.700
or the events in Skate City.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:55.380
And so your ticket is used at that point and you go and you do tricks.

01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:03.780
But, you know, if you're not in an event, you see a countdown bar that starts sending

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:07.220
bees after you with the word skate or die.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.060
Fuck those fucking bees.

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.700
Right.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.500
Fucking bees.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:11.860
Why does it always have to be bees?

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:18.100
But once the bees arrive, you have a very small amount of time not to get to the park.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:18.900
Not the bees.

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:26.180
I remember watching the first X-Files movie and we wouldn't say the future is out.

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.300
They would say the bees are out there.

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:33.700
But anyway, you have to keep doing stunts and, you know, bees.

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:41.380
So you have your ramp, you have downhill, you have a slalom and you have jump.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:46.340
So those are your four events.

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:53.060
And then you have different power ups that you can buy starting from $25 going up to

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:54.260
$250.

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.540
So you get shoes for higher jumps and faster acceleration.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:02.500
You get a board for higher speed, pads for quicker recovery from wiping out and a helmet

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.980
so you can be more aggressive.

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:09.940
So you spin faster to get that famed 720 degree jump.

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:16.020
The cabinet, I always thought the cabinet was cool because the speakers were put on

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:21.700
top of it kind of like a boombox, you know, so it just kind of fit that whole theme.

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:28.020
And it was one of those large ones that they use for Paperboy, the large monitors.

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:35.380
Your joystick was a circle, a circular motion instead of just your standard, you know,

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.020
regular D-pad style.

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:43.380
And then you had two other buttons, one for kicking, you know, to push off instead.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.740
And then you're the one for jumping.

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:50.420
So it was a great popular game.

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:51.940
It did have many ports.

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.420
There was Commodore 64, got two ports of it in 1987.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.380
The Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum came out in 1988.

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:05.940
NES version came out in 1989, Game Boy Color in 1999.

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:09.140
There's an unreleased port for Atari Lynx.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.540
Unfortunately, the bees got to it.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.580
Yeah, the bees got it.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.220
It didn't skate.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:15.860
It just died.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:26.020
And there was on side two of the game cassette, I guess this one would be for one of the other

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:27.060
computer versions.

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.380
I had the soundtrack from the original game on it.

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:34.980
There are emulated versions included in Midway Arcade Treasures, Midway Arcade Origins,

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.780
and Lego Dimensions in 2015.

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:47.460
But also that phrase, Skate or Die, was used to inspire another game, EA's Skate or Die,

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.180
which spawned a sequel called Ski or Die.

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.660
And there you go.

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.340
Which is also known as Ski Free.

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:56.900
Is it really?

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:58.420
If I was skiing, it would just be die.

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:01.380
No, because, you know, the bomb little snowman would come after you.

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:02.260
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:02.820
That's right.

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:03.700
That's right.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:04.420
All right.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.100
I didn't play Ski or Die, really.

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.380
I played Skate or Die.

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:10.740
I feel like there was a Skate or Die 2 at some point.

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:11.300
There was.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.500
There was Skate or Die 2.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.780
But these games are very different.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.100
It's very important with 720 and Skate or Die.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:16.660
Very different.

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:17.700
Skate or Die was fun.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.980
I really should put it.

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:21.300
I like 720 a lot.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.220
I think I like 720 more as a game.

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.900
But the problem is you would never get more than, like, two minutes before the fucking

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.300
bees killed you and you had to put in another quarter.

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.620
Like, it's very hard to be good at that game.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.500
Even, like, the Nintendo version was very hard.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:39.300
Yeah, I was not a fan of really any of the skateboarding games.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.500
I really didn't like Skate or Die.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.620
I didn't really care.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:47.380
I mean, 720 I probably played a bit more because we had one at my arcade, but I don't know

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:47.620
why.

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.140
I mean, a lot of people would play them.

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:54.820
A lot of people would just be all into them, but it was never really my Cup of Joe.

01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:55.700
That's all right.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:56.180
It happens.

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.820
You know what game I also didn't care for?

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.100
California games.

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.140
Not very good.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:07.140
California games was a spinoff of summer games and winter games and Epics like Olympics.

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:11.220
But I played it on Lynx and it just wasn't all that great.

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.700
Well, our trip spent playing that game on Lynx.

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:17.140
I bet the Lynx port wasn't as good as it probably was.

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:20.660
It was the surfing part just I hated.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:21.860
Oh, I love the surfing.

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:23.700
I don't remember California games.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.420
And then it had the town and country gorilla.

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.380
Wasn't it the gorilla?

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.540
The mascot for the TNC?

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:31.540
Uh, that was surf and skate.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.660
I turned off 720 music because clearly we've gone tangent.

01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:38.420
Yeah, I remember like they had BMX, so that was for like downhill BMX.

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.260
And so that was cool.

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:45.140
And then they had surfing, hacky sack, TNC, surf and skate, which wasn't great.

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:51.940
I might be getting California games and TNC, surf and skate mixed up.

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:56.900
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says I have the VCR California games board game.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.340
I didn't even know they made that.

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.020
That's pretty awesome.

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:00.980
Does that even work?

01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.260
I don't think somebody took the license.

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.220
You played hacky sack.

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.980
Well, two points.

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:06.580
No, cause it's a VCR game.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.780
So you probably had to watch people playing the sports and then

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.740
you probably something to do with those VCR games.

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.820
No, the clue VCR game was bomb.

01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.460
The clue VCR game was so awesome.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.980
And I know I've talked about this on the show before because the first magfest I went to,

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:27.060
they screened some documentary about the clue VCR game.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:30.020
And like the fact that, you know, all the people, all the act, all the

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.740
bad actors and actresses in that, and they weren't really bad.

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:40.020
They were all like theater people up in the Northeast that, that just did this on a whim.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:45.780
The only mixed game like that, that I've played was a quest for the rings on the Odyssey too.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.700
And then we just never played the board game part of it.

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.220
We just played the game.

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:55.540
What was the one, what was the VCR game where like it would be silent the whole time.

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:58.740
And then all of a sudden this like monster would come up on the screen and go,

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.660
maggot, maggot.

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.980
There was, I'm not somebody who knows VCR games.

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:06.340
Bobby's got to know this game.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:10.100
It was some like scary VCR game and it was ridiculous.

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:10.900
I wouldn't play it.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.900
It was ridiculous.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.460
Is it a nightmare?

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:16.580
That sounds right.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:17.140
Nightmare.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.100
I think it might've been that.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:24.820
Oh, Bobby, Bobby has the receipts with a YouTube.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.500
That's probably, that's yucky.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.460
I think that's probably it.

01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:27.860
Let me see.

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:28.580
Wait, hold on.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.300
I've got it.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:32.500
Usually I don't click on YouTube links randomly, but I trust Bobby.

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:36.980
Which has nightmare game video.

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:38.980
Oh, let's see.

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.300
Hold on.

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:40.020
Let me see if I can.

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:41.060
Okay.

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:44.260
So here's, here's one of his little taunts coming up here.

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.060
Who's standing next?

01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:50.260
Who is just about to roll the dice?

01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:58.820
If you fail to answer.

01:20:58.820 --> 01:20:59.140
Yes.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.420
My gatekeeping time.

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:05.140
You must roll time before you can play again.

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.580
You must run a six before you can play again.

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:08.820
All right.

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:12.660
Anyway, I'm getting up.

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:17.380
We need to remake nightmare using Loki.

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:23.220
Hey, all right.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.540
We're going to take a break when we come back.

01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:27.940
Plenty more of orange launch radio to come, including rapid

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:32.100
fire news, release dates, some emails, and, uh, your calls

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.620
at orange lounge radio.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.460
All one word on Skype.

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:36.100
Don't go anywhere.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.740
We'll be back after this quick break with more of orange

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:39.700
lounge radio.

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:45.940
Welcome back, everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight,

01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:51.140
February the 25th episode number 720 of our show, a very

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:54.020
appropriate choice for our classic game of the week.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.540
Just before we took that break.

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:58.900
And now we're back to get into some rapid fire news.

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.540
Loki, why don't you start us off getting some rapid fire

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:01.940
news?

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:05.140
Yeah, we got more video game movie news.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:08.260
Yeah, we got more video game movie news.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:13.300
So they're apparently going to make Sonic the Hedgehog, the

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:18.900
movie confirmed to be in production with Paramount and

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.940
supposed to be coming out in November 2019 because the

01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:25.140
minute they heard that a Mario movie was happening, somebody

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.420
had to make a fucking Sonic movie and his shitty friends

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.620
better stay away from it.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.660
Who's making it?

01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.660
Paramount Paramount.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:33.140
Who's there?

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.340
What anime is the anime?

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.580
My friend calls them poop amount.

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.780
It better be animated.

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:42.260
I don't know who they're if it's a live action star, if it's

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:46.820
a live action Sonic movie starring David Vito as Sonic.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.380
Let's hope.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.420
Oh, my God.

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.700
Starring, you know.

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.500
Yeah, Ron Jeremy is Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.340
I'd love that.

01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:01.860
Um, yes, apparently it's going to be directed by Jake Fowler

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:06.980
who apparently had an Academy Award for his work on the

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:12.980
animated show Short Gopher Broke and Tim Miller, who was

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.260
the director of Deadpool.

01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:17.540
Another I guess he owned.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:20.980
He's the owner of an animation and CG production company

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.340
called Blur Studios.

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:23.780
I don't know if they're going to be the ones that are

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.940
actually doing it, but yes, it'll be a mix.

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:27.220
Oh, no.

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:35.460
So it's scheduled to come out November 15, 2019 is a mix of

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.220
live action in CGI.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.780
Oh, no, no.

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:48.100
Oh, yes, it's going to have Sonic in the real world alongside

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:48.900
humans.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.780
Oh, God, like Sonic Adventure.

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.460
So this is already terrible.

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:54.740
This is already terrible.

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.220
I don't know.

01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.020
It could have the whole Roger Rabbit vibe to it.

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:06.660
Because that works so well for Peter Rabbit, the Smurfs, the

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.420
Chipmunks, Sonic 2006, the next Chipmunks movie, probably

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.980
another Chipmunks movie, another Smurfs movie.

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.940
Um, Woody Woodpecker.

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:20.020
Those have all been smashing successes.

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:20.740
Hard pass.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:28.660
So look forward to that in theaters next year, you know, or

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.660
not, because, you know, what am I judging?

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:36.260
Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about games of gold.

01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:39.940
So Microsoft has announced what the next lineup for games

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.540
of gold is going to be starting March 1st on Xbox one, you're

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.340
going to get trials of the blood dragon, and that's going

01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.540
to run for the entire month.

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.300
And then for the second half of the month, you're also going

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:53.620
to get, um, or I should say from March 16th to April 15th,

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:54.180
super hot.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:59.940
And then on Xbox 360 or the compatible games with Xbox one,

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.980
you're going to get brave the video game, you know, because

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.020
that movie tie in games, totally current.

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:09.060
And then how many years ago did that movie come out and then

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.340
quantum conundrum.

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:14.180
And that'll be the second half of March, March 16th through

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:16.900
the 31st, honestly, having played super hot and super

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.460
awesome trials of the blood dragons kind of, eh, it's all

01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:19.860
right.

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:20.580
It's a trials game.

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:21.540
Trials games are all right.

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:23.540
All right.

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.180
Check this out.

01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:24.820
If you have gold.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:29.140
Well, um, you know, once something is on the internet, it

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.580
doesn't really go away.

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:35.380
That's because of an Instagram post that actress Emily O'Brien

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:39.140
made that said, quote, honored to be working aside these two

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:43.220
fine lads on Hideo Kojima's new project, death stranding.

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:44.500
I'm a lucky gal.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.140
And it was a poster that had Norman Reedus, which we already

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.260
know is in the movie, Emily O'Brien, which we didn't know

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.380
in the movie in the game.

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.180
Sorry.

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:52.820
I thought poster.

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:55.940
My head immediately went to movie Emily O'Brien, which we

01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:58.180
didn't know is in the game, but we do now.

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.100
And Troy Baker.

01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:02.420
Well, then that's an instant purchase because I buy all the

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.700
games of Troy Baker in it.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.180
What game isn't Troy Baker in these days?

01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:07.860
Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:09.700
Now, now.

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.940
So confirmed, I suppose, thanks to Instagram.

01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.620
Because, you know, even though she deleted the post, she

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.340
probably feels terrible.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:19.060
But the reality is once it's out there, it's out there.

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.500
So it's confirmed that Emily O'Brien, Troy Baker in the game

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.740
as well, of course, Mads Mikkelsen, which we know about

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:30.020
before, and Guillermo del Toro as an actor, very, very, very

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:33.860
distinctly, possibly a best director, Oscar winning actor.

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.340
And the races show him in the leads.

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:38.340
I did love shape.

01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:38.740
I see.

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.020
I want to go so good.

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.660
I know I want to go like I'm rooting for Greta Gerwig, but

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:44.180
can I be mad if he wins?

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.300
I really can't.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.460
Like that's the thing about the Oscars and why I don't like

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.060
the huge race that it turns into.

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:52.420
Like there's so many good people that, you know, and good

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.820
movies like out of the movies I've seen that have been

01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:55.220
nominated.

01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.020
None of them were bad.

01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:01.700
So yeah, I wouldn't be mad if he won because that movie was

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.060
amazing and deserves it.

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:06.980
I mean, I would love for Greta Gerwig to win for the women

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.940
power and, you know, seeing more women win those awards.

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:14.420
But, you know, he made a hell of a movie.

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:15.300
It's going to be hard.

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.300
So, but I'll be happy if either one win.

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:17.540
Yeah.

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.180
Yeah.

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:18.500
All right.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.940
Anyhow, it's a privilege just to be nominated.

01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:22.340
That's right.

01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:23.940
It's a privilege just to be nominated.

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.300
The nominations are important, I think, you know?

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:31.940
So anyway, also important is your music library, because

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.700
I know it's what gets you through the day at work and why

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:35.220
many of you listen to podcasts.

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.900
Well, if you use Spotify or of course iTunes and, you know,

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.500
other places that you can find music, you can now check out

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:47.940
over 3000 music tracks by Zuntata.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.860
That is the sound team who made Taito Games.

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:56.420
So over 3000 music tracks by Zuntata on Spotify.

01:27:56.420 --> 01:28:01.540
That would mean, you know, Bubble Bobble, Arcanoid, Darius,

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.140
Ninja Warriors.

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.100
Oh, Arcanoid, boom, boom, boom.

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:09.300
Well, there was music in some later ones, but Groove Coaster.

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:12.820
I know those games are not the rhythm-based ones, but

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:16.100
probably the ones that were on phones and stuff.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:20.020
So you can check out all those cool soundtracks all over Spotify.

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:20.660
Very, very cool.

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:22.340
Also on Amazon.

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.460
That was the store I left out.

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.500
So, all right.

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.460
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to releases?

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:31.780
Japanese Splatfest, which is, I don't know how many people are

01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.260
familiar with the phrase Hanayori Dango.

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.900
There were also anime and manga called that too.

01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:43.940
But it basically means dumplings over flowers for people who are

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.820
more practical versus people who are more aesthetic.

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:53.780
So the Japanese Splatfest coming up is Hana, which is flower,

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.020
versus Dango, which is dumplings.

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.620
And they're delicious.

01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:59.140
Yeah, Team Dango all the way.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.220
And see, as Sakura, I might have to go with Team Hana.

01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:04.340
Just because.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.500
So that is going to be...

01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:10.180
We won't get anything as classy here.

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:14.260
We're going to get like Team Fartjoke versus Team Boobs.

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:16.340
Like that's Team Boobs.

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.020
That's what we'll get here in the States.

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:22.500
We're not going to get anything as philosophical.

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:26.020
Team Jake Paul versus Team Logan Paul.

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:29.140
Fuck all the way off.

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:35.140
But the thing is, I mean, we do get things that are more specific

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.420
to our culture or show.

01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:37.300
So whatever.

01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:39.860
You know, we should have like...

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.580
Team Chicken versus Team Egg.

01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.060
But I feel like they did that before.

01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.660
Like which came first, the chicken or the egg?

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.860
That's a saying you hear in our culture.

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.020
Team Carnivore versus Team Merbivore.

01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:55.220
Oh, Carnivore is going to have such an edge.

01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:59.780
You know, Team Media...

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:03.460
Oh, oh, oh, Team Round Earth versus Flat Earth.

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.900
No, because people with intelligence wouldn't want to even be associated

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:11.780
with that type of up to stupidity.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:15.380
Team Flat Earth versus Team's vaccinations are harmful.

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:18.740
That's not even funny.

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:21.300
That is not even funny.

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:23.460
I couldn't help myself.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:23.940
I'm sorry.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:26.100
Well, if it's not funny, you better throw another story out there

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:26.980
before I think of more.

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:30.180
Team Tide Pod versus Team Differently Colored Tide Pod.

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:31.940
There we go.

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:39.620
Team Tide Pod.

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:43.940
She's laughing whether she's trying to show it or not and rubbing her head.

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:46.820
I see a smile underneath that when we said Tide Pod.

01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:49.140
Just because I can't even right now.

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:53.140
You know, we should have Team Llama versus Team Malpaca.

01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:54.900
What about that?

01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:59.940
I'm sorry, I just I just love too much the whole, you know,

01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:05.860
philosophical dumpling or flour versus Team Tide Pod versus Team Broken Glass.

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.180
This is America, land of the stupid.

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:12.340
Wasn't another like terrible eating trend thing.

01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:14.660
I mean, they've got a cinnamon challenge.

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:15.460
Cinnamon challenge.

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:17.060
Yeah, that's not deadly, though.

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:17.780
So we got it.

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:18.580
No, yes, it is.

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:19.700
Really?

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:20.500
It is.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.100
Cinnamon is very thermogenic.

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:24.180
It blocks your people have died from it.

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:24.820
Yeah.

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:25.620
Team Cinnamon Challenge.

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:31.780
What if they did like Team Cinnamon versus Team Ice Bucket?

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:35.140
But Ice Bucket was for a good cause.

01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:37.620
See, that was the whole Lou Gehrig's disease awareness.

01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.060
So that's hard dumb things.

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.900
Team Dab versus Team Plank.

01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:41.540
I don't know.

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:43.700
OK, that's that's good.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.060
Team Dab versus Team Plank.

01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.060
Anyway, still stupid.

01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:48.500
Betty White dabbed.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.060
So automatically Team Dab.

01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.260
Anyway, can we move on, please?

01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:56.260
So there's going to be another Dungeons and Dragons movie.

01:31:57.140 --> 01:32:03.540
And it is being actually the rumor as who the director is

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.620
would be Chris McKay.

01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:10.500
He is in negotiations for the Dungeons and Dragons movie,

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.780
which, first of all, Krul was originally supposed to be

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.300
a Dungeons and Dragons movie.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.380
And I saw that shit in the theater and it was great.

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.100
And then they did a Dungeons and Dragons movie.

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:22.420
And it was not great, but it was fun.

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:23.860
And it had Tom Baker in it.

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:27.060
So I love that movie because Tom Baker was in it.

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:29.220
That was the one from like the late 90s, right?

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.820
Early 2000s.

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:31.140
Was it?

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:34.820
OK, maybe mid 2000s, because but I just I just remembered

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.980
I only cared to watch it because Tom Baker was in it.

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.780
Bobby Blackwell says Team Dungeon versus Team Dragon.

01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:42.100
No, I got it.

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.060
Team Fantasy versus Team Sci-Fi.

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:47.380
I they had to have done that one.

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.980
I'm most positive they did that one.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.260
Yeah, maybe that or it was sci-fi and something.

01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:56.420
I like I know they did that team elf versus team orc.

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.100
Maybe we need no collusion versus team.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:06.020
No, too topical, too topical, too soon, too soon.

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:06.740
All right.

01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.300
Let's try.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:08.900
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:09.380
Is there more?

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:10.020
I'm sorry.

01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:13.300
It was a little bit, but I forgot.

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:14.260
So, yeah, let's go.

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.060
It's as it's a Dungeons and Dragons movie,

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:21.140
which already means we're a little afraid, which means I'll probably see it.

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:25.380
But if Tom Baker is in it points, Tom Baker, though, is getting on.

01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.100
Well, Tom Baker was just in that Dr.

01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:31.140
Who thing not that long ago, a year and a half ago.

01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:32.260
OK, it wasn't that long ago.

01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.020
Maybe two years ago.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:34.260
All right.

01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:36.260
Anyway, let's move on.

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:38.980
We're going to travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:40.340
Loki, what's coming out in the US?

01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.260
It's like what's old is new again.

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:46.740
So we've got the blob to remastered the remastered that nobody asked for.

01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:49.780
That's coming on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:54.660
We have girls and Panzer dream tank match.

01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:57.780
That sounds weird.

01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:00.420
I'm sure it involves anime girls in tanks.

01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:01.300
I can only imagine.

01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:03.060
We'll say no more.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:05.220
Is it a dating sim where I can date a tank?

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:10.100
Because let's hope that sounds like it could be team anime versus team tank.

01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:13.700
Tank Girl, the anime series.

01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.700
I would watch that.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:20.420
Gravel on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:27.700
Heroin Anthem Zero on PlayStation four and Payday two on Nintendo Switch.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.140
And we have Darkest Dungeon on Xbox one.

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:39.220
And one week from today, Death End Request on PlayStation four.

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:40.580
Well, that sounds pleasant.

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:43.220
All right.

01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:48.660
Let's hop on a plane and go to Japan and check out the releases this week in Japan.

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:50.820
Actually, I'm not seeing a lot this week in Japan.

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:57.220
The only things I see is that there is a Dragon Ball FighterZ arcade stick that's coming out.

01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:58.340
So if you want to check that out.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:03.700
Also coming out in Japan, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Advanced Edition.

01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:05.380
That is coming out in Japan this week.

01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:07.140
That's at least in on the PlayStation four.

01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:07.860
There must be something.

01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:09.940
Is there something on the Switch this week that is the reason?

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:13.540
Well, Doom gets its Japanese release this week.

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.740
That's a pretty big deal.

01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:19.140
As well as Dragon Quest Builders gets its Japanese release this week as well.

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:21.460
You know, that game came out on the Switch not that long ago over here.

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:27.940
And then on the 3DS, Doraemon Nobita no Takara Jima comes out this week.

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:29.540
So there it is.

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:31.700
That's really it for the Japanese releases this week.

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:32.900
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.060
A few things.

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:42.500
On the 27th, we have Apocalypsis, Harry at the End of the World on Mac and PC.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.300
And DeBlob 2 for Xbox One.

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:48.260
On March 1st, we have Subsurface Circular for Switch.

01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:50.100
That's kind of a cool name.

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.060
I name a band that.

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.000
All right.

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.980
I think it's now time for us to dive into the mailbag.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.740
It smells funny.

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:02.740
DarkSakura is going to get on her skateboard in 720.

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:03.700
Is this Anthrax?

01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:04.900
Right into the mailbag.

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:06.980
And find some emails.

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.340
Every week you guys can email us.

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:11.060
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:15.220
If you want to have your email read here on air or deleted on site.

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:15.860
No, I'm just kidding.

01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:16.580
We don't.

01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:20.100
The only time we've ever not read emails was either like they were just mean.

01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.540
Like they were like, not nice.

01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.260
We don't read those.

01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:26.980
Or we would just press for time, which that does happen once in a while.

01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:30.020
Like the one week, like some weeks, nobody will email us.

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:31.940
And then one week we get 10 emails.

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.180
Dear DarkSakura, I love you forever.

01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.860
Here's 50 million dollars.

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.140
Why thank you, stranger.

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:37.780
I'll take it.

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:39.160
No.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:42.260
This one's just labeled correction.

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:45.460
So I don't know what the correction's about, but it comes from Robert M.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:52.980
Harmonix beats sports, which seems to me more related to Rhythm Heaven than to Wii Sports.

01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:54.820
Is not an Apple TV exclusive.

01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:56.980
Well, not since it's released on the Switch.

01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:58.980
I really ought to check it out sometime.

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.180
And it's from Robert M.

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:03.140
Already investing this week's vog points from the podcast checking.

01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:08.980
And don't forget to check in every week to spend your points on nothing.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:11.780
But it makes you look good at vognetwork.com.

01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:13.380
You can check in if you're live.

01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:14.980
You can check in while you're listening live.

01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:19.220
Or, of course, you can use a passphrase hidden somewhere in the episode to check in that way.

01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.820
As far as the email goes, yeah, it came up last week.

01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:24.020
I don't remember the discussion.

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:26.660
We were talking about Apple TV and like the limited games that were on it.

01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:28.020
And I mentioned the harmonix game.

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:30.820
I had no idea they ported that to Switch, actually.

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:36.660
See, that's an example of a game that got lost amongst all those Switch releases is I had no idea.

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.100
Everybody's talking about when it comes to harmonix these days, everybody's talking about drop

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.220
mix, right?

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:45.540
You know who super got into drop mix is Shane.

01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.860
He has like every single card you can get.

01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:49.540
I think he might be missing one.

01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.220
But yeah, like, but that gives a lot of fun.

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:56.580
So well, also speaking of Shane and from the same email or another email.

01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:00.420
Just to add, kind of disappointing to see that Ranger Pride hasn't updated since July.

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:03.380
Unless I'm missing something, you are.

01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:06.500
I would love to hear Shane's take on the Toy Fair announcement.

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:10.740
Well, funny you should send that email in, because probably the day after you sent that,

01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:13.540
Ranger Pride came back with a brand new episode.

01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:18.580
And they actually, they really explain why they've been gone for a few months.

01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:24.500
And it's very honest and kind of brave for them to be very blunt and upfront about what's going on.

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:27.700
So check it out, Ranger fan or not, honestly.

01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:31.380
But they talk about some of the things that have been missed.

01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:36.740
Another one that came through our website from Shash OG.

01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.420
Hey, OLR.

01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:41.700
So many characters is allowed when sending you an email.

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:44.020
I typed what didn't seem to be that long of an email.

01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:46.740
A couple paragraphs at most, and it says it's too long to send.

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:49.860
I'm trying to send from orange.radio.com.

01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:50.740
Love the show, by the way.

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:53.220
Just email us directly.

01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.340
Yeah, honestly, I would say 10 times over,

01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.860
just send directly an email to participate at orange.radio.com.

01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:05.140
The website is there to try to make the process easier, but obviously it's not.

01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:10.500
Also, I am well aware our website is extremely out of date.

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:14.900
I mean, we're so thankful to Dekeman and VX JasonXV

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:17.060
without who we wouldn't even have a website.

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:19.460
And in Jason's case, we wouldn't have an intro every week.

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:25.060
But the reality is that websites get old and we know ours is growing mold.

01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:25.700
It's pretty old.

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:27.060
Hey, I rhymed.

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.780
So, yeah, we just need to give that whole stuff a kick in the butt.

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:40.340
Well, to bring a point to that, when I finish my current WordPress project, it can happen.

01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:41.620
Awesome.

01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:45.700
Just be sure to team up with Mr. Jason, because without Jason, I would...

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:52.340
Here's the thing, the podcast feed came in from an old PHP Nuke run website

01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:56.340
into the Joomla thing that is there now into whatever you're going to build.

01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:58.900
The beauty is like it still fucking works.

01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:02.420
And I almost feel like Jason like wrote it from scratch at one point.

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:06.900
So just make sure you work with him to not break the most important part of the site.

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.300
Have time to make it happen in the next couple of months because

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.740
I'm still working on one for charity I'm involved in.

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.740
But a new website would be rad.

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:15.300
I'm not gonna lie.

01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.620
So last email.

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.100
Yep.

01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:19.060
Hello, LR.

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.100
We know who this is.

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:20.820
Oh, boy.

01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.420
That sounds like a YYR email.

01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:23.060
You are correct.

01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:27.700
I come to you with a couple of rebuttals from last week's Skypline segment.

01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:28.900
Yes, rebuttals.

01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:30.580
Also, I just made you say butt.

01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:31.460
No, go away.

01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:32.660
Buy super multitasking.

01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:33.620
End of email.

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:34.420
Okay.

01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:35.060
You know what?

01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:39.220
I said cat butt at the start of the show, which is the best kind of butt that can exist.

01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:42.900
So cat butts are the best butts.

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.260
I'm just gonna leave it at that.

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:50.580
The first is for Kai Judo, who was talking about a game he felt could be the VR equivalent

01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:51.300
of Wii Sports.

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:55.860
The problem is that, in at least my opinion, there will never be a VR equivalent of Wii

01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:57.460
Sports for one simple reason.

01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:01.460
Wii Sports attracted people when they saw other people playing it and then thought,

01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:02.420
wow, that looks like fun.

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.540
I want to try it.

01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:09.460
The simple and sad fact is that there's no way to get even an approximation of what a

01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:12.820
game is actually like in VR until you physically play it.

01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:16.740
This is, I think, one of the main things holding VR back from the mainstream.

01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:21.700
I really think that the best way for VR producers to combat this is to load up Dave and Buster's

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:25.060
VR experiences, but that's another discussion for another time.

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:32.100
My second response is for Actdeft, who insisted that Super Smash Brothers Melee needs to die.

01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:37.700
Beyond the fact that it was a fantastic game when it was released in 2001, if you're looking

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:41.460
for the reason Melee was and continues to be so popular, look no further than Super

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:42.340
Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:47.700
Brawl released in 2008, it brought new character stages and items and looked better than ever,

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:53.060
but the core gameplay was changed quite a bit, mostly to appeal to casual players.

01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:56.980
Several changes were made to the physics to slow down the speed of the game, making it

01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:59.780
more accessible but lowering the intensity of the action.

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.940
Also, elements of chance were added.

01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:06.020
I'm not sure if you remember, but characters could actually trip while running, render

01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:07.940
them temporarily helpless.

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:12.980
This was actually 100% random, and most serious fighting game players would agree that the

01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:15.940
elements of luck do not belong in a skill-based game.

01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:22.420
For these concerns, Super Smash Brothers Brawl was completely rejected by the fighting game

01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:23.460
community.

01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:24.340
So what did they do?

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.860
They went back to Melee, of course.

01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:31.300
Other than the official Project M, which was a fan-made mod of Brawl to make it feel more

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:35.380
like Melee, there was no version of Super Smash Brothers that was taken seriously by

01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:38.900
the tournament scene until Smash 4 released in 2014.

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:44.180
By this point, folks had been playing Melee for 13 years, so had gotten very used to it,

01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:45.220
and guess what?

01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:50.500
While Smash 4 was a big improvement, many would argue that it still is not as faster

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:51.860
intense as Melee.

01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:56.100
With the exception of the mediocre character balance, Melee still holds up very well in

01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:00.420
2018 as a competitive game, and that is why people still want to play it, watch it, and

01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:01.540
enjoy it in general.

01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:02.820
So, um, sorry?

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.300
That's all I've got for this week.

01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:09.140
Now excuse me while I continue to look for new Twitch videos of people playing challenge

01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:12.980
mode of super multitasking so I can laugh at them when they fail.

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:15.380
BobbyBlackWolf may have been right.

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:19.940
I guess I am a bit of a sadist after all, or perhaps more than a bit, maybe.

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:21.620
Happy gaming, AaronYYR.

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:27.700
Alright, so we have rebuttals to the rebuttal in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:33.140
Kaijuto says, not correct, people can see you playing in the living room AND watch the

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.980
TV, so I call BS.

01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:39.940
It sounds like it would depend on which VR experiences, you guys might be thinking of

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:44.820
two different VR experiences, whereas something like I believe Oculus Rift does not really

01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:46.020
let you do that.

01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:46.980
PlayStation VR.

01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:47.460
You can.

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:48.180
Oh, does it?

01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:49.140
Yeah, you can do that.

01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:49.620
Oh.

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:54.180
Well, I know PlayStation VR does, like you can do the VR thing and see what's on the

01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:56.980
TV, but I don't, I didn't think every VR headset let you do that.

01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:57.540
Yeah, you can.

01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:58.660
Okay, well then I stay graphic.

01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:01.620
And they even have some where it's more advanced where you can actually set up virtual

01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:06.020
cameras, so you can actually put yourself in a green screen in the middle of the environment,

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:10.420
and you can actually see yourself interacting like you were a character there.

01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:16.340
But I do, I do understand to some extent the point that Aaron's trying to make where it's

01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:23.460
like, and because I was in the same boat, you don't get VR until you do VR, right?

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:27.300
Because I didn't get VR until Bobby was like, hi, you're in my hometown.

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:28.500
We're at a convention together.

01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:29.540
You're gonna fucking play this.

01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.620
He didn't put it that way, but that's essentially what it was.

01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:36.100
And I did it and I was like, alright, I understand why you are obsessed.com with VR.

01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:37.540
This is a lot of fun.

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:38.580
This is great.

01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:45.220
So I kind of get that to an extent, but at the same time, you could kind of say the same

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:49.060
thing about Wii Sports even is that it's one thing to watch Wii Sports, but then when you

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:51.540
kind of actually get in there and do it, it's different.

01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.820
So I don't know.

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:56.980
I'm Switzerland in this debate, but I appreciate the spirited argument.

01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:03.540
Also, we have a rebuttal to the rebuttal from Act Deft, who says that's the thing.

01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:05.300
We have Smash 4.

01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:10.500
Brawl was awful for the competitive scene, but Smash 4 fixed all the problems Brawl had.

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:13.700
So it sounds like Act Deft is kind of taking issue to the fact that we kind of glossed

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.740
over the fact that we do have the Smash 4.

01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:18.260
He brought up Smash 4, though.

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:18.500
Yeah.

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:21.940
And so the problem with Smash 4 is that it's still a little bit slower and doesn't have

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.860
the same level of intensity.

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:29.220
But to be fair, that's not quite the criticism the Brawl got in that.

01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:31.060
I think it's a little slower.

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:34.820
I mean, again, I don't want to take sides.

01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:36.100
I appreciate all you gamers.

01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:36.660
I really do.

01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:40.100
But yeah, I get both sides.

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:40.420
I do.

01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:41.560
All right.

01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:43.460
So I think that's that.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.380
I think that's it for the emails.

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:45.940
Was that it?

01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:46.660
Last one?

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:47.140
That's it.

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:47.860
All right.

01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:52.740
You can send us an email to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send

01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:56.100
us an email if you want to send that in a future week.

01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:59.060
But we have some more news to get to, starting with Loki.

01:45:59.060 --> 01:45:59.380
Yes.

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:05.700
So this is kind of a weird little game, but, you know, you may remember there was actually

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:09.700
a Mario game that came out on the system as well, the Sharp X1 computer.

01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:14.100
So it was a game that's actually published and developed by Hudson Soft.

01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:20.020
This is Donkey Kong 3, the great counter attack.

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:24.740
And it's definitely a lot different from most Donkey Kong games.

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:28.820
You actually play this character named Stanley and you're shooting.

01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:36.820
I guess a gun or something up at Donkey Kong, who is falling down, holding some parachutes

01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.660
and there's birds and stuff flying around.

01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:40.020
You have to shoot as well.

01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:43.220
And the goal is to get Donkey Kong up to the top of the stage.

01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:51.940
And apparently this recently sold for, I guess, $415 on a Yahoo Auction, which I forgot that

01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.860
even Yahoo Auctions was a thing still.

01:46:55.380 --> 01:47:00.420
But apparently now there's some actual screenshots and video of the actual game as well.

01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:06.740
But yeah, I remember there was a Mario game, too, that got released on there that was kind

01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:10.180
of different that someone then later created.

01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:14.420
And yeah, Super Mario Brothers Special was the other one that they also released.

01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:17.700
That was on the PC-ABI.

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.260
Interesting.

01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:22.740
I don't know.

01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:23.700
I watched the gameplay.

01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:30.580
It looks kind of boring, but it's neat to find these unique games that we probably didn't

01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:31.540
even know existed.

01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:37.380
Yeah, honestly, as much as I appreciate the old computer history and stuff, I totally

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.660
forgot about this whole Sharp had the license stuff.

01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.020
So I didn't even...

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:46.900
When I first heard new Donkey Kong game was unearthed, I thought they finally got that

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:48.900
music game that was originally...

01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:52.180
It's in some of the promo material for the Japanese Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:54.100
You know how there's Donkey Kong Junior Math, right?

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.940
There was a Donkey Kong music game that showed up in some ads recently.

01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.060
I've been seeing floating around Twitter.

01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:00.500
I thought that was the game they unearthed.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.900
And then when I actually kind of went into the article and read about it, I was like,

01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.340
oh shit, I didn't even realize.

01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:08.260
So they just kind of recycled Donkey Kong 3's assets in another game.

01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.660
Because Donkey Kong 3 was so different.

01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:16.980
I think it's one of the few YouTube videos I did some years ago was about...

01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.740
I don't think I've ever played Donkey Kong 3.

01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:22.980
It's just different, because whereas Donkey Kong 1 and 2 are like platformers, Donkey

01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:24.580
Kong 3 is basically a shooter.

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:25.780
Yeah, that's what this is too.

01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:28.420
So I guess I didn't realize that that was what the game was.

01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:31.940
But it keeps shooting Donkey Kong in the testicles until he flies away.

01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:32.820
That's exactly what it is.

01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:33.940
That's what you do in Donkey Kong 3.

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.140
It's basically you're shooting him up the vine to try to get rid of him because he's

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:38.900
a pest and you're trying to shoot the other bugs too.

01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:41.700
And then that guy never showed up.

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.500
Stanley, the exterminator, whatever his name is, never showed up again.

01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:46.820
You would think he'd be perfect for Brawl.

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:48.260
New Smash Brothers character.

01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:51.460
I would think, or I say Brawl, but you know Smash Brothers, you think he'd be a perfectly

01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:54.260
Smash Brothers character, like from deep from the archives.

01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:57.060
No, they need to be like Captain Rainbow before they do that shit.

01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:59.860
If they can do fucking Duck Hunt, they can do Stanley.

01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:01.860
That's my thought.

01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:06.100
Did the power pad have any sort of like mascot characters or anything?

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:12.340
Not really, because both those games, the world-class track meet and the bandai, or

01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:16.500
whoever did the power pad in the first place, like stadium events, you know, the very rare

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:17.140
power glove.

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:18.260
We'll just have the power glove.

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.660
But that also was not Nintendo.

01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:24.660
That was the third party peripheral.

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:28.260
So they have to do, well, I mean, it's not that they can't ever get third party stuff,

01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:31.300
but you know, it's harder when that comes into play.

01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:32.420
All right.

01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:37.300
Well, let's move on to talk about something that Sony has rolled out this week for those

01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:40.180
of you that enjoy sharing your PlayStation stuff online.

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:44.340
You can now share PlayStation profiles online.

01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:47.700
PlayStation has put user profiles on the web.

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:52.500
If you go to the PlayStation website and use a tab in the upper right that says My PlayStation,

01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:56.980
you can see what a classic, basically a classic PlayStation page would look like.

01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:58.900
There's a lot of white space in it.

01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:03.940
You can't really customize a lot online, but you can get a sense on your desktop or on

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:08.020
your mobile what the profiles are going to look like on a PlayStation.

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:11.620
You can only change the headers on an actual PlayStation and all of that stuff.

01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:13.780
But at least it's something.

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:17.540
It's a little more minimalist than what is on the Xbox side of things.

01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:22.420
But I think some people think the Xbox website's a little cluttered, so it works.

01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:26.820
So we'll see how this develops as it gets refined and so forth.

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.860
But I think that's kind of neat that PlayStation profiles are on the web.

01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:34.900
I don't know how many of you guys actually look at other people's profiles online on

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:38.500
these types of websites, but once in a while, I go to like a Steam profile, maybe.

01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:44.820
I leveled up on Steam today because all the 20XX streaming, I was able to make a new badge.

01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:47.140
So fun.

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:49.940
All right, let's move on to Dark Sakura.

01:50:50.740 --> 01:51:00.340
Well, one of our favorite Twitters, the Kazurai CEO, is going to discontinue the Twitter as

01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:04.100
of June 15th, so right after E3 this year.

01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:08.340
But the person doing it wants to go out with something important.

01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:10.740
And I'll just read what the quote says.

01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:15.860
Like the PlayStation Network, my Twitter account has provided a free online service to gamers

01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:16.900
for many years.

01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:20.020
But just like the PlayStation Network, I've decided to change that.

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:24.900
Kazurai's CEO is moving to a free-to-read business model with microtransactions for

01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:25.460
charity.

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:32.820
So basically, he hopes to collect 599 pounds for SpecialEffect, which is a British group

01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:39.380
that helps people with physical conditions play video games that they might not otherwise

01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:39.940
be able to.

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:47.060
So it's adaptive technology that helps people, you know, whether using customized controllers

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:49.300
or letting people use eye movement tools.

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:58.420
So, but already he's, well, at least as of what, a day ago, he's raised about 37% of

01:51:58.420 --> 01:51:58.900
that goal.

01:51:58.900 --> 01:51:59.940
Oh, that's great.

01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:05.300
So I'd say go ahead and join in, try to help out because it's for a good cause.

01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:08.180
And well, it'd be nice to see it go out with a bang.

01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:10.820
Do you think this person is going to reveal themselves on the way out?

01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.380
Who it is?

01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:17.220
I mean, I imagine the author is not somebody that is from a AAA gaming website or something.

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:19.220
I imagine it's just somebody, you know, who's...

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.540
I think it's going to be like V.

01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:23.620
Meaning?

01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:24.580
It's not the name.

01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:25.380
It's the idea.

01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:25.700
I see.

01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:28.180
All right.

01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:29.540
They're not the face or the person.

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:33.700
It will be like the masked magician who reveals all the secrets and then finally reveals who

01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:34.340
they are in the end.

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:36.740
We've already got Penn and Teller for that.

01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:38.660
All right.

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:42.980
Just a few more stories before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all

01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:44.180
one word on Skype.

01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:45.860
Let's get to it.

01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:48.020
Loki, I like this story that Loki's going to get into.

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:49.300
So yeah, this is kind of cool.

01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:57.300
So there was a 14 year old fan of the game Firewatch who was inspired after playing the

01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:01.220
game to kind of go visit some of these fire watch towers.

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:08.260
And so actually, you know, traveled quite a bit with his dad around the country.

01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:11.540
Just, you know, says travel almost 1200 miles.

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:18.580
And finally, I guess one of their last trips, he found a...

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:20.740
What was that?

01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:23.940
There was a watchtower that was in Wadley Mountain.

01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:27.620
And when they got there, they'd stay there quite late.

01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:32.740
And apparently some of the other trips they were talking about, they basically just visit

01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:34.020
all these different places.

01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:38.180
Well, there's one actually in particular, though, that is kind of run down that they're

01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:43.220
looking at, you know, actually kind of helping bring this back.

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:46.340
So I guess there's this...

01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:50.020
I didn't even realize that they had this whole associated with the FFLA.

01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:57.540
Basically, they have this several chapters across both the North America and United States

01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:07.060
and with that, they're talking about like, I guess, bringing back one of these towers,

01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:11.860
which honestly, compared to like the game, these are pretty basic.

01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:14.100
It's not like actually enclosed and nice like that.

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:17.700
It's more of just like, you know, open air tower or whatever.

01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:25.460
But yeah, basically he's been inspired to try to help restore one of these towers.

01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.220
That's pretty rad, though.

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:32.660
Even if it isn't exactly like the game, that's pretty cool that the game kind of inspired...

01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:36.180
We always hear such negativity about video games and so forth.

01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:39.620
And video games cause these horrific things to happen in the world.

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:41.620
And I'm so sick of that narrative.

01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.460
It's really nice to hear that.

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:48.420
Oh, but video games also have inspired people to get into history, which is essentially

01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:52.980
what a lot of this with the fire towers and so forth is before we had satellites to do

01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:53.780
a lot of this.

01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:56.100
Apparently, yeah, there used to be a lot more of these towers.

01:54:56.100 --> 01:55:01.700
But like a lot of them have been just run down, either have been burned by wildfires

01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:04.900
themselves or just been disassembled or whatever.

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:08.340
And so kind of looking to kind of preserve some of these things are kind of neat.

01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:09.300
Which is weird.

01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:11.620
There was more to the game, too.

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:13.780
The game wasn't really about the tower.

01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:16.500
I mean, it was because it was kind of like your base of operations.

01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:18.020
But there was obviously a whole nother layer.

01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:21.460
I mean, I guess minor spoiler alert, but it's basically...

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:23.140
I don't...

01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:25.860
It's basically a how did this person die type of mystery.

01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:28.260
Type of thing is what the game basically boils down to.

01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:37.220
But, you know, it's cool that this kind of inspired somebody to, you know, maybe save

01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:38.820
one of these somewhere else.

01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:39.140
Yeah.

01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:39.640
Neat.

01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:41.060
All right.

01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:45.300
Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com says kid needs a girlfriend bad.

01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.100
Don't be mean.

01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:49.620
Just because you have a hobby doesn't mean you don't have girlfriends.

01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:49.780
Yeah.

01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:52.660
Would you say that to every boy scout out there or whatever?

01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:56.980
You know, people get into interesting causes and so forth.

01:55:56.980 --> 01:55:58.100
So, all right.

01:55:58.100 --> 01:55:59.060
I like this.

01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:00.020
At least it's doing good.

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:01.320
Okay.

01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:06.660
One more thing before we get to the Skype line tonight at Orange Launch Radio.

01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:12.740
And that has to do with a new Pokemon Go-esque type of game coming out.

01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:16.260
And this one is based on Ghostbusters.

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:17.300
That's right.

01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:19.780
Ghostbusters World is coming.

01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:25.220
It's a collaborative effort between Sony Pictures Entertainment, Ghostcore, and publisher

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:26.820
433, Inc.

01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.820
You'll notice Niantic is not involved with this one.

01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.820
So, it's different companies.

01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:33.460
I'll try it, but like, I don't know.

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:36.180
Neither is the company behind Garfield Go.

01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.940
So, it is not out yet.

01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:39.140
They just have a teaser trailer.

01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:41.140
I see Loki getting his phone, but it's not out yet.

01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:47.380
No, my phone was starting to dig against my keys and that's how the screen gets cracked.

01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:51.060
There's a teaser trailer, but it really doesn't show any gameplay.

01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:54.980
But neither really did the Pokemon Go teaser trailer and that didn't seem to stop that.

01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:58.340
So, anyway, you're apparently in this game going to be able to catch specters, ghosts,

01:56:58.340 --> 01:56:59.700
and apparitions with your phone.

01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:01.540
It uses AR.

01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:04.500
So, you see the ghosts over, you know, your usual things.

01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:09.700
So, I'm assuming it isn't going to use like real world landmarks, which is what, you know,

01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:11.220
Pokemon Go and Ingress do.

01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:14.500
Instead, it's going to use the world around you to be able to, you know, have the ghosts

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:15.860
appear and so forth.

01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:17.300
So, let's see.

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:22.500
They don't say when it's coming out, but I guess in the next year or so.

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:27.380
Probably whenever Harry Potter Wizards Unite comes out, because we know that is coming

01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:28.900
and Niantic is involved.

01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.020
Here's the bandwagon.

01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:31.060
Let's jump on it.

01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:31.700
Might as well.

01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:32.900
Might as well.

01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:34.740
How's Draconis going these days?

01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:36.500
That was the real big knockoff.

01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:39.860
It's like the same fucking game, but with these different characters.

01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:41.140
All right.

01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:41.640
It's...

01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.100
I'll still check it out.

01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:44.820
You know what?

01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:47.780
Pretty much any like AR based game.

01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:48.580
I've checked it out.

01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:49.060
Try it out.

01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:49.540
Delete it.

01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:49.860
Whatever.

01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:50.420
Exactly.

01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:54.820
I played Garfield Go for two minutes and then I was like, garbage.

01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:56.020
It's absolute shit.

01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:56.820
All right.

01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:57.860
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:58.980
All one word on Skype.

01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:02.340
If you want to give us a call and say hello and talk about anything we've talked about

01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:06.100
tonight, or maybe there's something else you want to get into while we wait to see if any

01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:06.740
calls come in.

01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:09.460
Let me check in with the Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:09.700
Yeah.

01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:14.580
So, even though Melger Survive is a big pile of shit, you may remember that

01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:18.100
Konami has some trouble thanking Kojima for some stuff.

01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:24.420
Well, the developers of the game hid some stuff in Melger Survive to kind of pay homage

01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:29.140
to Kojima, including there is a list of some of the different combat units.

01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:34.980
And if you look at the initials of the last word in each one, it says KJP Forever or Kojima

01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:36.580
Productions Forever.

01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:42.820
And then, of course, it has Yoda and Yuji at the bottom there, which are the designers

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:47.540
of the Melger Survive game kind of, you know, paying homage to him.

01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:49.300
So good for them.

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:54.580
And I know they sort of paid homage to they said, you know, like credit to the, you know,

01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:56.340
Melger team or something like that.

01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:00.580
But yeah, it's it kind of sucks, the whole situation.

01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:03.620
But it's neat to get that hidden in there.

01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:04.980
I wonder if someone's gonna get in trouble now.

01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:08.260
I it's too late now.

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:10.100
The game's out there and people have it.

01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:14.020
I guess that would be extreme.

01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:15.860
I would be like really surprised.

01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:16.740
Be a big dick.

01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:18.180
That would be a very big dick move.

01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:21.060
But then again, so would be delisting PT completely.

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:22.180
And here we are.

01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.100
So I know it also.

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:26.260
Let's talk about why Melger Survive is shit.

01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:30.340
Ten dollars a save slot in a game.

01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:32.580
Ten dollars a save slot.

01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:33.700
You have one character slot.

01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:35.300
If you want to unlock the other three.

01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:37.060
Ten dollars each one.

01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:39.220
Oh, hey, my more inventory slots.

01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.700
Those are going to cost you three to five dollars each.

01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:42.740
Is it a cell phone game?

01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:47.220
No, it's a it's an it's an well, because it sounds like a cell phone game.

01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:48.820
And then what else do they have?

01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:52.980
They also had, of course, you can buy boost packs to do different things in the game.

01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:54.820
So they have their own microtransactions.

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:59.780
And in like additional throw it in loadouts or whatever additional loadouts, I think,

01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:01.780
cost like five bucks each as well.

02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:04.820
If you want loadout slots, throw it in the trash.

02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:05.940
Well, absolute garbage.

02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:10.980
J.D. with a counterpoint saying, to be fair, MMOs charge for character slots.

02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:15.700
I think EverQuest may have back in the day, but OFAVS11 did.

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:17.780
I know OFAVS11 did charge for character slots.

02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:18.660
Wow, doesn't.

02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.420
Yeah, well, with that, though.

02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:24.580
And I understand like, OK, you want to charge for that because of like server space or whatever,

02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:25.300
which is dumb.

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:26.100
It's an excuse.

02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:28.100
But this is a single player game.

02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:32.820
Yes, I know they force online connectivity all the time, but it's mostly a single player game.

02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:37.700
No, I appreciate the trying to find a reason why.

02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:40.660
But no, Konami is just being douches.

02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:41.880
All right.

02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:44.660
Oh, Guild Wars does this a lot.

02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:49.300
Guild Wars doesn't charge a monthly fee, so they pay for the servers in other ways, right?

02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:51.460
And do they charge for their expansions, though?

02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:53.860
They do charge their expansions, but so does any other.

02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:55.460
So does WoW, so does 14.

02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:56.180
Any of them do.

02:00:56.820 --> 02:01:02.260
So anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:07.940
Akuma JP in chat says, Loki, don't you know how hard it is to make a memory slot?

02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:12.420
I thought you would just take the first one and just kind of copy that.

02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:19.460
JD points out, is this a one time cost or recurring is a one time ten dollar cost, right?

02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:20.820
One time for each slot.

02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:21.780
One time for each slot.

02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:24.340
So thirty dollars.

02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:24.840
Wow.

02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:29.620
Dungeon Buster says the division from Ubisoft gives you four character slots for free.

02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:31.300
Destiny two gives you three.

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:35.540
Yeah, it's also it's also just kind of dirty that it's one character slot for free.

02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:36.820
One.

02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:38.740
That's a little that's a little silly.

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:42.340
Well, they're assuming that you're going to want to replay through this game more than

02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:45.940
once anyways, which no, I don't think so.

02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:48.740
I have a feeling the phone is assuming you're going to want to play through it once.

02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:52.260
I have a feeling the phones aren't going to go off tonight.

02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:57.380
I don't know if that's a Celebrity Big Brother finale or if that's the Olympic closing ceremony.

02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:59.700
I thought Celebrity Big Brother was already over.

02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:00.980
No, Big Brother ends tonight.

02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:05.300
Oh, because I was like, didn't Courtney Act already win that?

02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:05.700
Oh, no.

02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:07.140
Celebrity Big Brother US.

02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:07.460
OK.

02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:08.660
The one that who's left.

02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.340
It's I don't watch it.

02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:11.380
So it's all those.

02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:11.880
Yeah.

02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:14.180
Omarosa is not going to win the whole thing.

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:15.780
It's going to be and I haven't watched.

02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:16.500
I haven't watched.

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:17.620
I said this a week ago.

02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:20.180
I think Marissa was playing the best game out of anybody.

02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:21.860
So that's who I get.

02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:23.780
Marissa Janae Whitaker.

02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:24.280
Who?

02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:29.300
Oh, she she won the Tony for Hairspray.

02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:29.800
She was.

02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:32.660
Good morning, Baltimore.

02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:33.620
Tracy Turnblad.

02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:34.260
Is that her name?

02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:34.740
OK.

02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:35.240
Yeah.

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:36.040
Anyway.

02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:38.420
If it's the new Hairspray, I didn't see it.

02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:39.060
All right.

02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:43.220
Let's go to the Skype line where we have a call.

02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:44.260
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:44.760
Who's this?

02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:45.860
It's Ron.

02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.540
I hear you're not getting any calls tonight.

02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:48.580
Yeah, well, we do.

02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:49.220
You fixed it.

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:49.940
Thank you so much.

02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:50.660
What's up, my friend?

02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:51.700
Not much.

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:55.540
I only called because I needed to correct you on something you said on last week's episode.

02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:57.460
Oh, well, please.

02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:58.660
I live for getting corrected.

02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:00.020
This is episode rebuttal.

02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:03.320
OK.

02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:09.060
You know, just as much as you do, I love my 80s shows, my 90s shows.

02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:13.060
There are times I sit there and listen to the full theme to growing pains because it's

02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:13.940
friggin awesome.

02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:17.940
But you talked about the Hogan family last week.

02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:18.440
I did.

02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:19.640
Yes.

02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:21.620
You said that was Valerie Bertinelli.

02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:25.460
It was the other Valerie, wasn't it?

02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:26.580
Valerie Harper.

02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:27.220
God damn it.

02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:28.980
You're right.

02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:30.020
You're right.

02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:32.660
Why was I thinking that in the moment that it was Valerie Bertinelli?

02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:32.900
You're right.

02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:34.340
It was Valerie Harper.

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:36.260
Because you were talking about one day at a time.

02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.060
Drag me, expose me.

02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:43.860
I believe you denied if you deny it.

02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:45.160
What?

02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:48.580
I will only drag you if you deny it and say that you're still correct.

02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:50.820
No, I'm not going to deny it because you're absolutely right.

02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:54.900
It was Harper because the show was originally Valerie's family.

02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:56.980
But the name Harper came into it somewhere.

02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.420
I should have known better.

02:03:58.420 --> 02:03:59.940
It was called the Hogans.

02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:01.940
Then they changed it to the Hogan family.

02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:02.440
Yeah.

02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:05.940
And it was kind of a mess of how they wrote her off the show.

02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:06.900
They did.

02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:09.300
Didn't they, like, kill her in a car crash or something?

02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:11.860
Well, she died from brain cancer.

02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:12.660
Oh, that's...

02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:16.580
But so they just basically, like, killed her off screen, right?

02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:17.080
Yeah.

02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:20.740
Which is sad.

02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:22.100
Rhoda was a fun show.

02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:23.460
That's what she was also in.

02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:26.020
That's what you do to your difficult actresses, I guess.

02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:28.820
So at least back in the 80s, that's what they did.

02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:34.020
So, I mean, now if you tried to do that, how did they kill off What's Her Name on Grey's Anatomy?

02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:35.220
I'm assuming they killed her off.

02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:37.620
Maybe they just moved her, but I never watched that show.

02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:40.420
What's Her Name, that actress that everybody says is difficult to work with.

02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:42.260
The blonde girl.

02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:43.940
So her show was called Valerie.

02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:45.080
Right.

02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:47.460
Not the Harper family or anything.

02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:50.660
No, it was Valerie's family, but she did have a show called Valerie.

02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:55.460
Yeah, but that was when she had the dispute, the salary dispute with NBC.

02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.860
So she was fired from that show.

02:04:57.860 --> 02:05:00.900
I thought they had called the show Valerie's Family the whole time.

02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:01.780
No, it was called...

02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:05.780
It was renamed to Valerie's Family and then the Hogan family.

02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:06.500
Okay.

02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:09.380
So they said that they just continued the...

02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:11.220
I'm checking the thing about the page.

02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:12.500
So, yeah.

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:13.220
So that's what happened.

02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:16.740
What is the name of that actress on Grey's Anatomy?

02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:17.940
Or she was on it.

02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:21.380
And, like, everybody in Hollywood says she's difficult to work with.

02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.620
And she left Grey's Anatomy to go have a movie career.

02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:25.700
And she's made nothing but stinkers.

02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:27.780
And I think she finally came back to television.

02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:29.940
The one, the first girl that...

02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:30.820
Or she...

02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:34.180
Didn't you have cancer in the show or something like that?

02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:35.460
Apparently, this is a trope.

02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:39.220
But for the record, it was Valerie Bertinelli on One Day at a Time.

02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:40.580
Katherine Heigl.

02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:41.460
That's who I was trying to think of.

02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:42.180
Yeah.

02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:43.940
But it was Valerie Bertinelli who was on One Day at a Time.

02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:46.100
It was Valerie Bertinelli on One Day at a Time.

02:05:46.100 --> 02:05:47.700
And it was different Valeries.

02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:51.460
But in my mind, so many years had passed between the two.

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:52.980
I didn't realize they were different.

02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:54.580
So I made a mistake.

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:55.540
You corrected me.

02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:56.680
Whatever.

02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:58.980
That's because we love you.

02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:00.340
I know.

02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:00.660
I know.

02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:02.820
At least you're not coming on here screaming at me.

02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:03.860
So I appreciate it.

02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:07.780
You're having a nice, calm, rational, you know, you made a boo boo.

02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:08.500
And here's why.

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:12.900
And you need to sit down and watch One Day at a Time on Netflix.

02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:14.260
The reboot is really good.

02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:17.300
Everybody is telling me that One Day at a Time on Netflix is great.

02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:21.540
And then with the exception of Loki, everybody's telling me that the new Queer Eye is fantastic.

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.580
It's not fantastic.

02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:23.380
It's all right.

02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:23.940
I'm not gonna.

02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:28.900
But most of my other people are like, like the new Queer Eye is amazing.

02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:31.780
I'll take that word for it.

02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:32.580
All right.

02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:32.820
All right.

02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:37.620
Well, Rama and also the Joel McHale or the Joel McHale show.

02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:38.580
Oh, that's right.

02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:42.260
He kind of replaced Chelsea Handler because basically it's just the soup.

02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:43.540
It's basically the soup.

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:45.140
But that's the soup was funny.

02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:46.980
So that's yeah, it's good.

02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:49.220
Yeah, they don't have mankini anymore.

02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:52.900
It's like one piece man or so.

02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:56.260
Because, you know, it's kind of what they have to do.

02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:57.780
They get around the trademark.

02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:00.420
I really wanted to like the Chelsea Handler show.

02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:04.180
And I did in the early episodes, but it kind of became a mess.

02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:07.300
Like, was it a sit in the studio show?

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:09.220
Was it a dinner party episode?

02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:11.700
Was it this like the Chelsea show was just a mess.

02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:13.700
And I hate it when they reduced it to once a week.

02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:15.460
It didn't make sense anymore.

02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:19.140
Anyway, sorry, I'm just going on a tangent, but I hate when I get invested in shows.

02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:20.820
And then they just like they fuck up.

02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:23.220
Yep.

02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:23.780
So.

02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:24.420
All right.

02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:26.580
Uh, Rob, I'm going to let you go to see if anyone else calls in.

02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:27.620
But thank you so much.

02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:28.260
Hey, no problem.

02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:29.460
I like the plan and take care.

02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:32.660
Have a good whatever Sunday and all that and drink the rest of the wine for me.

02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.300
I will do that.

02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:34.260
Happy rebuttal.

02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:36.420
All right.

02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:37.300
Orange launch radio.

02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:38.260
All one word on Skype.

02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:40.020
Do you have any other last minute stories to get to before we?

02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:40.980
I certainly don't.

02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.900
Oh, I thought there might have been a few others.

02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:45.780
You know my favorite thing about the old Queer Eye other than Carson Kressley?

02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:48.100
The soundtrack.

02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:49.380
Yeah, the soundtrack was great.

02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:50.740
I bought that soundtrack.

02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:52.260
We used it in spin class.

02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:55.220
It was here back when we did that cage match on O.L.R.

02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:57.620
Probably every track on that CD was in the cage match at some point.

02:07:57.620 --> 02:07:57.940
Right.

02:07:57.940 --> 02:07:58.440
Yeah.

02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:00.980
Oh, so long ago.

02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:03.780
How many how many episodes ago did we finally get rid of cage match?

02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:04.580
It was a while ago.

02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:07.380
I'm not a fan.

02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:08.980
I don't keep track of this shit.

02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:11.860
It's on the wiki, so I am not one of your fans.

02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:13.780
It's on the wiki, I'm sure.

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:18.180
But it was it was we'd moved it to after birth because

02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:23.140
when we started podcasting the entire show, we had to take the cage match out of the show

02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:25.300
because it makes it you can't have that in the podcast.

02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:27.620
So we had it in the afterbirth and then we finally got rid of that.

02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:30.100
Or in the 400s, I feel like.

02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.900
Every so often, you know, I'll listen to something.

02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:34.820
I'll be like, that'll be fun in the cage match.

02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:37.460
You know, we made a Tumblr for that and we never used it.

02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:39.620
We have like a F yeah cage match or something.

02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:41.700
Yeah, because everything on Tumblr is fuck yeah this.

02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:43.380
I think there's F yeah cage match or something.

02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:44.500
We never used it.

02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.500
So you should you're the Tumblr queen.

02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:47.540
You should fire that up.

02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:50.100
And I don't think it's actually a part of my Tumblr,

02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:52.820
but I might maybe I'll remake it or something.

02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:53.220
I don't know.

02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:55.700
Ragenator in chat says Rob Roberts.

02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:58.820
Any chance the cage match will come back on your life?

02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:01.780
Never, never say never, but never.

02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:08.260
No, there's no no plans at this time.

02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:10.900
So, all right.

02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:13.860
Well, our phone lines aren't aren't ringing up.

02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:15.220
So I guess we're going to close up shop.

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:17.540
It's a little early tonight, but it was a slower news week,

02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:20.100
probably because the Olympics and, you know, other stuff going on.

02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:22.900
Just not as much games news to get into.

02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:26.580
So we'll we'll just wait until next week.

02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:29.620
But thank you guys for being here and thank you for listening to the show

02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:31.620
and spending the last two hours with us.

02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:34.500
Not quite three tonight, but thank you guys for being here.

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:35.300
Appreciate it.

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:37.140
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:39.300
a nice five star review goes a very long way.

02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:41.940
So please leave us a nice five star review.

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.620
Tell a friend or five about the show.

02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:46.980
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:52.100
But we can only spread those voices if they're here to air.

02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:55.700
And then some folks in chat talking about Twitch streams.

02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:59.940
Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says bringing back the cage match means getting rid of the post show

02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:00.820
Twitch stream.

02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:04.740
Yeah, essentially, although I'm not always the best at doing the post show Twitch streams,

02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:07.300
but somebody's been doing it lately and that's really good.

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:11.300
And then tonight we have a new podcast to play for you all right after the show,

02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:13.140
at least live on the Voicegeese network.

02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:15.940
If you're listening on the podcast, you can go to vognetwork.com

02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:19.140
and listen whenever you want to our newest show, The Far Way Nearby.

02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:20.260
Anyway, that is it.

02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:22.820
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:23.940
I'll start tonight.

02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:28.980
My final thought is I really should play some more Overwatch

02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:32.260
because I have completely missed out on that holiday event.

02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:34.900
I need to get some of my loot boxes in Overwatch.

02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:36.740
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:42.260
My final thought is I hope to play some more games this week.

02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:43.700
Yes, please do.

02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:45.460
That's your homework assignment.

02:10:45.460 --> 02:10:47.620
Play a game or make a game.

02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:48.120
You choose.

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:49.940
I do want to do that.

02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:56.100
I've been just working on stuff for work because we have to switch systems.

02:10:56.100 --> 02:11:00.660
And my old macros that I wrote for terminal stuff doesn't work anymore

02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:01.620
because they're shutting it off.

02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:03.060
Work is important.

02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:06.420
And it's not really, this isn't, this is kind of above and beyond stuff.

02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:10.580
Well, last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought?

02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:16.900
I want a banana covered in chocolate.

02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:19.220
I was going to say, I just saw Alan bring back bananas.

02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:20.340
If you want a banana.

02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:25.060
No, I want a specifically, I want a banana covered in chocolate in the middle of Pinkberry.

02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:27.780
Oh, well, I've been to Pinkberry at an age.

02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:29.860
I can help you with one of the three of those things.

02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:31.620
They have the new Pink Beast chocolate.

02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:33.060
It's made with Ghirardelli.

02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:33.620
It's all right.

02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:35.940
I haven't been to Pinkberry in a long time either.

02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:38.340
I'm actually going to be going to hang out with Becky.

02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:41.700
Now it's not Yogurtland, but now there's a new one.

02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:42.660
Meet Menchies.

02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:43.380
I think that's it.

02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:45.860
That's the one that Alan likes to go to now.

02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:46.580
And I like it too.

02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:48.180
So they have all the crazy.

02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:50.420
Isn't Menchie the dog from...

02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:53.220
I might be saying it wrong, but I feel like that's the name of the place.

02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:54.260
Call it Munchies.

02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:54.660
Munchies.

02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:54.900
All right.

02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:57.860
Anyway, that needs to be a fast food joint right there.

02:11:57.860 --> 02:11:58.340
Munchies.

02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:01.060
I think that's Jack in the Box's specialty.

02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:01.700
All right.

02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:02.500
That's it.

02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:03.700
Good night, everybody.

02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:04.420
That's a show.

02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:05.860
We'll see you in seven days.

02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:06.180
Bye.
