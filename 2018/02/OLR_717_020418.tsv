27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, February the 4th of 2018, episode number 717 of our show.
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
50000	52000	I have a problem.
52000	53000	And it needs cowbell?
53000	54000	No.
54000	55000	What's the problem?
55000	56000	I'm on a-
56000	57000	I'm on a hunt for a game.
57000	58000	Oh, what's this?
58000	59000	Robert Mondue.
59000	61000	I don't know if I know that one.
61000	62000	Also known as Jumping Flash 3.
62000	66000	Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know Jumping Flash 3. Why this game?
66000	71000	Because I love Jumping Flash, and I've had a big urge to play Jumping Flash, but I want to play one that I haven't played before.
71000	76000	So, that's why I'm hunting down Robert Mondue, but I kinda don't want to buy it on eBay.
76000	79000	And is it one of those things where it's like, emulators not gonna do it?
79000	81000	Well, it's a PlayStation game.
81000	91000	You could find- I don't know if they're still as prolific as they were when more people had PlayStation, but I remember disk images were not a problem to find back in the day.
91000	93000	Yeah, but there's- I wanna-
93000	94000	Not that I endorse that.
94000	99000	I wanna put it in the PlayStation and then flip the PlayStation upside down so it will actually not skip.
99000	101000	We had to get our Japanese DDR games somehow.
101000	103000	Or play it on my Japanese PS2.
103000	104000	Oh, yeah.
104000	109000	But I really, really super want to play Robert Mondue. That is also funny to say.
109000	114000	I wonder if my Japanese PlayStation 2 still works. It's still around here somewhere, but I don't- you know what I don't have anymore?
114000	121000	Is a CRT TV, except what's in Loki's cabinet. The main cabinet that's just kinda been sitting here for a long time.
121000	122000	That's not a CRT.
122000	125000	Oh, Hi-Tech Master Loki. That's not a CRT. I thought it was.
125000	126000	It's too flat.
126000	127000	That's a monitor.
127000	129000	Oh, wow. So, then I have no CRTs in this house.
129000	130000	I have a CRT.
130000	131000	I thought you did for, uh-
131000	133000	Don't they support HDMI out?
133000	135000	You could- well, no, I'm sorry.
135000	136000	PS2?
136000	137000	The component out.
137000	138000	Yeah.
138000	139000	Does it support component out?
139000	140000	Yeah, I think it does. I think it does.
140000	141000	So you can do that.
141000	150000	Because I remember that Final Fantasy XII, the first time it was out on PlayStation 2, when most people missed it, because the Xbox 360 had just come out.
150000	153000	It supported, like, widescreen mode and stuff, so-
153000	156000	And I also have converters to go from component to HDMI too.
156000	158000	The thing to be careful with that is lag.
158000	162000	Yeah, music games are not gonna be good with that. That's the problem.
162000	163000	Well-
163000	164000	You can adjust, but you can adjust a lot of them.
165000	174000	The one I want is not a music game, but still. But also, when we were playing Guardian Legend through our converter, it was at least two seconds off.
174000	175000	Oh, barf.
175000	176000	It was so hard to play.
176000	177000	Barf. That's unfortunate.
177000	178000	Yeah.
178000	180000	Alright, well, hi, Tech Master Loki. How are you?
180000	181000	I'm fine.
181000	187000	Yeah? How's the adventures in your new- I don't know if you heard this. Welcome back, DarkSakura. You were gone last week, I know.
187000	191000	But I don't know if you heard about- Loki got a DDR Extreme machine in his house.
191000	192000	Nice.
192000	193000	Yeah, so how's the-
193000	195000	I'm playing 30 minutes every day at least.
195000	196000	Are you really?
196000	197000	Yeah.
197000	200000	Good for you. Is it having an impact on weight? Not that it's any of my business, but-
200000	211000	I don't think yet. Not much, if anything. I've been kind of cutting back on stuff too. I haven't been drinking soda. I tried diet soda today, and I'm just gonna stick with water. Thank you very much.
211000	213000	But yeah, I've been cutting back on-
213000	214000	You should try Mio.
214000	215000	Do what?
215000	216000	Mio.
216000	217000	Mio?
217000	220000	It's like a flavor additive. It makes everything taste like delicious Kool-Aid.
220000	221000	I have some if you wanna try it.
221000	222000	Yeah.
222000	223000	It's okay.
223000	226000	Hey, it's gotten me through my 64 ounces a day.
226000	242000	Yeah, I don't mind water. So, I've been just cutting back and watching calories and stuff. So, haven't been eating health. I mean, sort of. Not really healthier, but less, I guess, if that makes sense. So, I'm sure that'll help.
242000	248000	But yeah, just even exercise. 30 minutes. That's about all I can handle now. Well, it's all I have time for, really, in the evenings.
248000	250000	Well, that'll get better. The more you do it, your stamina will increase.
250000	251000	Yeah, I've already noticed-
251000	252000	It's like running.
252000	264000	Yeah, I've already noticed that it's a little bit easier to play some things, but I'm not- I'm definitely not where I was. Like, every last song I try- Okay, let me see if I can do A on Heavy now and see if- Nope. Still can do A on Heavy.
264000	265000	Nope.
265000	273000	Like, my brain can do it, but my feet just don't listen to my brain. They're like, fuck that. No.
274000	284000	Well, let's go to our chat room, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, over at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
284000	291000	It's a little quieter in chat tonight. It's almost like there's other things going on out there in pop culture that people are paying attention to, but we appreciate-
291000	292000	That aren't worthwhile.
292000	294000	It clearly must be the new Cloverfield movie.
294000	299000	Clearly. But we do appreciate the loyal few that are in our chat room tonight.
299000	308000	S. Jonah and Matt offering some advice here, saying, I switched to flavored seltzer instead of soda. It definitely made a difference. And the DDR will help with the stamina and cardio training for sure.
308000	322000	I don't really miss, like, soda. I mean, it's good every now and then. Like, I- Yesterday, like, we went- My kids wanted me to take them to the round table pizza, so we went there, and, like, I had a coupon with- They included four drinks, so I just- I drank water most of the time.
322000	329000	I was like, I'll just take- I'll just fill a little bit of soda in here, take a sip of it, and then dump the rest out. And that was it. That's all I needed. I didn't really even need it. I was just like, eh.
329000	347000	I'm not that big on soda. Like, I'm actually- Like, I'm weird. I'm totally okay with tap water. Like, it's fine. Water is fine for me. I don't mind a little flavoring. I like, um- You know how, like, in a lot of frozen yogurt shops, they'll have the water, but they do the fruit-infused water, where they, like, cut up strawberries. I like that a lot.
347000	358000	Yeah, they do that at my work. They do the fruit-infused water that they have available. Um, I thought I'd try Coke Zero, because everybody liked Coke Zero. It's alright. I sort of have a headache now.
358000	369000	Just, I don't know if that's because, you know, I'm not drinking a ton of Red Bull during the weekend. Although, I still have a Red Bull each day, so I guess that's technically soda. Um, but whatever. That- I mean, that's the only thing I really have each day.
369000	375000	Um, but, yeah, it's alright. I really don't like the taste of diet soda, though.
375000	384000	You know, though, if you ever find one of those, like, Coke Infinity machines, or whatever they're called, um, add vanilla to it and it makes it taste a lot better.
384000	385000	Oh, Freestyle?
385000	386000	Yeah, whatever they call them.
386000	387000	Yeah.
387000	390000	I haven't had a soda in-
390000	392000	A while.
392000	393000	Two months.
393000	408000	Uh, going to chat again. Uh, Raginator with a gaming topic saying, finally got a chance to play Split Second as of yesterday. That was a, uh, kind of underrated and overlooked racing game that was on the Xbox 360, and my understanding is it just went backwards compatible on Xbox One.
408000	412000	And are they giving that one away for free? Did that end up being a gold game? I thought-
412000	413000	Might be. I don't remember.
413000	424000	I'm sure Raginator knows free games, so I'm sure he'll speak up if it is. But, um, I know- well, I have the disc. I bought that game because I played it at E3 one year, and I thought it was really good.
424000	431000	And then I remember the game- that studio kind of closed after the release of that game, right? That was a Disney game, and Disney kind of-
431000	432000	Was that the Disney one?
432000	440000	Yeah, it was. And Disney kind of backed out of gaming after that. I mean, they lent their licenses and stuff to things like Epic Mickey and obviously things like Kingdom Hearts.
440000	446000	I think they partner up with these 16 studios, but that was like an in-house Disney studio that ended up, unfortunately, folding.
446000	449000	Well, I think that was Black Rock, if I remember correctly, yeah.
449000	457000	Yeah. Uh, Tiger Claw in chat says Split Second was a great racing game. Too bad Black Wolf didn't think so at the time. I don't remember him disliking it. Maybe he did. I don't remember.
457000	463000	I tried it. I remember, um, I- I don't remember if I really got into it or not. It was alright.
463000	465000	Yeah, I think it just kind of came out when a ton of other games went out.
465000	474000	I think the gimmick was, like, the race- like, there would be all these catastrophes and stuff happening at the same time that would change the course, blah blah blah.
474000	483000	You know, if you want to play a game like that, that's kind of ridiculous and stuff, um, Metal Storm Apocalypse is a great game that's very similar.
483000	489000	Uh, Raginators confirms it is a freebie with games with gold for this month, and Crazy Taxi will be free in two weeks.
490000	500000	Well, that's- I thought I owned Crazy Taxi on Xbox 360. I wonder if it's popped up in my backwards compatibility. I haven't checked it a little bit, but, uh, I enjoy Crazy Taxi. That's a fun one.
500000	505000	I don't remember. Does the 360 version bring back the offspring music? Because you kind of have to have the-
505000	506000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
506000	508000	You don't remember if they have the same music in it.
508000	515000	I thought they replaced it. I know in one version they replaced it. I think it was because the Dreamcast had it. I know the Dreamcast had it right.
515000	518000	And that was the Dreamcast collection is where that's coming from.
518000	519000	Maybe.
519000	526000	Remember they had, like, the Dreamcast collection by this version that has, like, four of the Xbox Live arcade games, and then they, you know, had it separate as well.
527000	532000	Well, let's talk about music and games here at the top of the show with our kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.
532000	538000	Um, not- I don't know. I kind of think this is an interesting, um, thing that's happened with Discord.
538000	546000	You know, Discord has really changed, um, a lot in the past year. I think more and more people are using it, and I think part of that is Pokémon GO.
546000	556000	I think part of that is people don't want to pay for ventrilo servers. Um, another part of that is, um, uh, well, the fact that it's mobile and, uh, on the desktop too.
556000	563000	That's a pretty- pretty nice, uh, side effect with that. And I think Nintendo's lack of online has led a lot of people to using Discord.
563000	570000	You know, and I remember Discord kind of being out there going, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, we're here. If you want to- if you need a Nintendo voice chat thing, we're here.
570000	576000	So, um, anyway, the latest development with Discord is that Spotify has teamed up with Discord.
576000	585000	And, uh, yeah, the interesting thing about tying together Spotify and Discord is so that now you know how Discord will usually list what game you're playing?
585000	589000	Well, if you're not playing a game but you're listening to Spotify, if you want, you have to opt in, obviously.
589000	597000	But it'll tell you- tell people what songs you're listening to, and it actually shows where in the song you are, too, which is kind of interesting.
597000	607000	And if you have a Spotify, I guess, Plus account or whatever it's called, you can actually share and do, like, kind of party rooms with other people.
607000	615000	It's a lot like a site that I know Dark Soccer and I used to love back in the day, Turntable FM. Remember that site? This site was so awesome.
615000	623000	And then, of course, music studios ended up shutting it down because they got greedy, so it was- the party was over over there.
623000	629000	But they're trying to bring that back a little bit with this, but you have to have pro Spotify, which I know not everybody has.
629000	638000	But also the interesting thing with Spotify, you know, you can- well, they have a gaming category on Spotify, which I know is, you know, something there that they're trying to do to reach out to gamers.
638000	648000	But then, of course, the big one is that on PlayStation, you can access Spotify through PlayStation and you can kind of replace the music in a game with Spotify music if you want.
648000	657000	And usually I'm very much the type that's like, you- why would you want to take out the music in a game? You know, like, I want to listen to the music in the game.
657000	665000	But I have found for things like, let's say, Diablo, where there's a lot of grinding and you're kind of doing a lot of the same stuff over and over.
665000	670000	It's kind of like, okay, the music is kind of ambient at this point and I kind of need something else to help me with the grinding.
670000	683000	So I've used Spotify when playing, like, Diablo 3 on PlayStation 4 and I thought I'd ask, I mean, I know- I don't think anybody else- anybody in here is a Spotify premium user except for me.
683000	686000	I think, Jamie, you've used Apple Music, so there's really-
686000	687000	I only use Apple Music.
687000	690000	Yeah, there's no reason to have both, I don't think, and you don't have either one, right, Loki?
690000	692000	I'm not paying for music.
692000	694000	Dan prefers Pandora.
694000	701000	I say that and I just bought an album, you know, on Fridays. I'm not paying for a streaming music-
701000	706000	So you still buy albums as they catch your attention, basically. You're still doing it old school in that sense. That's fine.
707000	713000	And Spotify is not perfect, like, this podcast is still not on Spotify, so there's room for improvement, I have to say.
713000	720000	But anyway, in all seriousness, I'm curious what you guys do when it comes to listening to music and gaming.
720000	727000	Do you always stick with a game soundtrack and you don't listen to anything else, or do you let yourself listen to other music sometimes?
727000	730000	Jamie, I'm kind of curious about you, because you do a lot of-
730000	731000	I listen to what's in-game.
731000	733000	Really? You stick with the game only?
733000	743000	That's why I play the game, is to listen to the music in the game, and play the game, and have the experience that was created for me in the game.
743000	746000	Even stuff you played over and over, like Mass Effect.
746000	750000	Hell yeah. I love all the music in Mass Effect, fuck yeah.
750000	754000	You know, even World of Warcraft, which I'm playing again.
755000	766000	I go to certain areas in the game just to listen to certain music, and I have macros that play certain pieces of music.
766000	767000	Oh, that's interesting.
767000	776000	Like, I have a macro that does the thing that Sylvanas sings, and then the other one that plays on Mount Hyjal.
776000	782000	The one with the singing in the middle that's like, oh, doo doo, and then singing, you know.
782000	788000	My favorite in that game, and this is a deep cut for people that have played the game, but Grizzly Hills with the violins, that was my favorite.
788000	789000	I like Grizzly Hills.
789000	790000	Yeah.
790000	795000	But, I mean, I do quite literally have macros set up in World of Warcraft to listen to certain pieces of music.
795000	797000	I didn't even know you could do that with macros.
797000	798000	Yes, you can.
798000	805000	Interesting, because Final Fantasy set up this whole, like, you can't do it through macros, but you can put, like, in your house a jukebox, basically, and you can play songs.
805000	806000	I thought that was kind of interesting.
806000	815000	There's just some places I'll go that I want to hear other pieces of music, or if I'm tired of listening to a piece and want to hear something in particular, then I'll play them, and I'll give you the macro commands if you want them.
815000	822000	Well, it's interesting you bring up World of Warcraft, because with that one specifically, that is a game where I allow myself to listen to other music.
822000	831000	Just because, you're going to disagree with me here, but for the most part, I find a lot of WoW soundtrack to be a little unremarkable after the first play.
831000	843000	Don't get me wrong, there's some standouts, and the stuff that you named is all standouts, but, like, if I'm just grinding dungeons, like, if I'm leveling a character through dungeons and I'm doing Dire Maul over and over again, I listen to podcasts.
843000	848000	That's, like, the time when I actually listen to podcasts. If not in the car, I listen to podcasts a little bit in the car.
848000	856000	Or, I might listen to some Spotify. Like, I have playlists set up on Spotify, and, you know, they do a good job with some of their randomization.
856000	864000	So, I'll allow myself to listen to that, but it's mostly MMOs only for me. I don't really do it when I'm playing other stuff.
864000	869000	See, I got kind of mad on 14, because I really liked a lot of the music, especially in Uldaa.
869000	876000	And the music would just sort of cut off and go quiet for a while, and I didn't like that.
876000	877000	Oh, the day to night change?
877000	885000	No, not even that. Like, I'd run around and do my quests or whatever, my dailies, and the music just stopped, and then I'd have to change, like, particular areas.
885000	897000	So, it was really just kind of terrible. But, I mean, there's been some games that, like, the music was just really bad. I mean, really bad.
897000	904000	But I was having a fun time. Like, I kind of used to do it for Ragnarok Online, but not anymore. I love the music in Ragnarok Online.
904000	913000	That's why when I play Idle Poring, I've actually used some of my costume coins and, you know, diamonds I've picked up to get extra soundtrack.
913000	919000	I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com to see what some of our listeners think. Dungeon Buster says,
919000	926000	I always listen to the game's soundtrack in full when it comes to RPGs I like to play. Monster Hunter World has a great soundtrack, by the way.
926000	935000	But Dungeon Buster also adds, I almost forgot what the music is like in the MMO I play, because I turned it off and listened to YouTube tracks or internet radio instead while grinding.
935000	937000	So, I think you're kind of like me, where MMOs are kind of the exception.
938000	950000	Ragenator says, 99.9% of the time I prefer to listen to the game's actual music. More often than not, it's pretty good, to the point where I make an effort to buy the soundtrack if it didn't already come as a pack-in bonus with the game.
950000	958000	Oh, here's Brad from Geekspin with a good follow-up here. I'll listen to other stuff in Forza Horizon. That's a pretty good point.
958000	968000	A lot of these racing games and sports games, all their soundtracks are, are like pop music. So, would you replace the pop music with your own pop music?
968000	979000	If they have an option to do that, like I know Grand Theft Auto will allow you to have a radio station that's just playing MP3s off your computer, so as long as it integrates into the game you can do that.
979000	991000	A lot of Xbox 360 games, and I'm assuming to be the same with Xbox One, allowed you to put music on your system and be able to stream that as well, and it would integrate where the sound effects would be playing over everything.
993000	999000	The only real game that I've done that where I've actually swapped out music would be Final Fantasy XI.
1001000	1005000	I remember you actually went into the coded files and did stuff. Not so much for you, Jamie?
1005000	1006000	No.
1006000	1022000	And the other thing too, and this is just kind of, I've taken this sort of stance with movies and everything too, is that someone was paid to make that music. Especially music made for a game.
1022000	1029000	I'm not talking about pop tunes or things like that. For example, take anything done by Yuzo Koshiro.
1029000	1046000	That's his job, right? He put passion into making the music, you can tell. The people who did the music for Final Fantasy XIV put work into it, that's what they do. World of Warcraft, again, great music.
1046000	1054000	These people, I don't think should be putting all this hard work into what they do to have it ignored.
1054000	1064000	I don't ignore it, but if I've heard it literally a hundred times, it's like I wore it out. I wore the CD out, you know what I mean?
1064000	1073000	It's just part of the thing for me, especially since I'll sometimes use certain music in-game to figure out when I've crossed an area border.
1074000	1085000	Okay, I can see that. I can see that. But not so much so, but you do kind of say with the pop music, it's different because they're licensing other music anyway.
1085000	1090000	For example, I've never listened to a Justin Bieber song ever.
1090000	1094000	You've been able to avoid Despacito?
1094000	1095000	Yes.
1095000	1097000	Consider yourself lucky.
1097000	1107000	And, for the longest time, I had also never listened to... fuck, who was it that I really hated for a while and refused to listen to anything?
1107000	1108000	Taylor Swift.
1108000	1113000	I've listened to exactly two Taylor Swift songs. But yeah, Taylor Swift was the other.
1113000	1114000	Okay.
1114000	1124000	But I've made it all this time in my life without listening to a single Justin Bieber song, and if I got a game and he did stuff on the soundtrack, I would not listen to anything else in it just to avoid it.
1124000	1127000	You're going to get Justin rolled at the supermarket next time you go now.
1127000	1128000	No.
1128000	1135000	You're going to be there shopping for whatever, for drinks and stuff, and then you're going to be, baby, baby, baby.
1135000	1142000	And you're going to be like, who is this little boy on the radio?
1142000	1143000	I know.
1143000	1146000	Is this a Tegan and Sarah song? I don't know.
1146000	1147000	I like Tegan and Sarah.
1147000	1149000	I love Tegan and Sarah. Anyway.
1149000	1156000	But no. I've made it this far, and I think I can continue to make it the rest of my life.
1156000	1159000	Alright. Godspeed to you on that.
1159000	1160000	You've got to have goals.
1160000	1164000	And your goal is avoid Justin Bieber for all eternity.
1164000	1168000	My secondary goal is to see him deported back to Canada, but that ain't happening.
1168000	1172000	So, you have never heard Despacito.
1172000	1174000	No. I didn't even know it was a song he did.
1174000	1175000	I'm not going to be rude.
1175000	1178000	I don't even think I knew that was a song by that name.
1178000	1181000	I'm not going to be rude and play it now. That's a shitty thing to do.
1181000	1184000	And plus, that would mean I have to subject all of you to it. I'm not going to do that.
1184000	1189000	I'm actually genuinely surprised that she's avoided it. That's an impressive accomplishment.
1189000	1190000	I only listen-
1190000	1192000	You should put that on your resume.
1192000	1194000	I only listen right now.
1194000	1201000	Well, I mean, I listen to video games, soundtracks, but all the stuff that I listen to is stuff that either you've suggested to me or-
1201000	1202000	Because I have great taste in music.
1202000	1214000	Nicki has suggested to me, which right now I'm listening to random combinations of BTS, Monsta X, and what's that other Korean pop band I was listening to?
1214000	1216000	Oh, is that what Nicki-
1216000	1218000	Oh, G-Dragon.
1218000	1220000	Is that what Nicki listens to is K-pop?
1220000	1223000	Yeah, lots of K-pop. And Retro New Wave.
1223000	1224000	Okay.
1224000	1227000	I've really been getting into Retro New Wave. I want a whole game that's Retro New Wave.
1227000	1229000	Nicki sounds like they have good taste in music.
1229000	1230000	Nicki is Gary's sister.
1230000	1231000	Oh, okay.
1231000	1241000	Who is the complete polar opposite of Gary? Just saying. I know none of y'all know who Gary is, but Gary's one of my friends from my synagogue and his sister is 50 million times cooler.
1241000	1253000	I like K-pop. I've been here. It seems to be getting more and more of a presence here. I mean, not to go on a tangents about drag queens, but you know, hey, slower night because there's other stuff going on.
1253000	1257000	But did you see Aja doing the routine to, what is it, to anyone? Is that the K-pop band?
1257000	1258000	Yeah.
1258000	1260000	Did you see Aja doing the routine to that?
1261000	1262000	Sick Ning.
1262000	1266000	Right, but coming out in Japanese clothing to a K-pop song.
1266000	1267000	I don't think-
1267000	1268000	Wait, no, not a K-pop song.
1268000	1269000	She wasn't wearing Japanese clothes.
1269000	1271000	No, that was last episode. Sorry.
1271000	1276000	Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. She was wearing like a- I didn't think it was Japanese.
1276000	1277000	No.
1277000	1278000	Like the arrow.
1278000	1280000	Oh no, I was thinking of the last episode instead of Turn Around.
1280000	1281000	Oh.
1281000	1287000	But I am impressed with Aja, but sorry. Milk needs to go.
1287000	1288000	Okay. All right, look.
1288000	1291000	Fuck you, Milk. I'm lactose intolerant.
1291000	1299000	Loki, Loki. What's your standpoint on the soundtrack thing? Do you listen to other stuff when you game or do you stick just pure with the soundtrack?
1299000	1300000	It's mainly just whatever is in the game.
1300000	1301000	Interesting.
1301000	1302000	For the most part.
1302000	1309000	You know what's interesting though is with the Forza Horizon and stuff, I actually really like the soundtrack in Forza Horizon and there's enough variety.
1309000	1315000	Like there's three different radio stations, like I'll flip between. I'll actually- no, four because I'll actually go to the classical radio station.
1316000	1323000	Because you know all those games always have a classical radio station. Why? Because they don't have to pay for any of those songs because they're all public domain.
1323000	1324000	Because they're all dead.
1324000	1326000	They're all hundreds and hundreds of years old, right?
1326000	1338000	So I like- I get a lot of sick satisfaction out of like doing like big tricks and flying off of cliffs and all this stuff to like duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.
1338000	1339000	Like it's kind of fun.
1339000	1340000	Beethoven's fifth.
1340000	1341000	Yeah.
1341000	1349000	And plus that's the stuff I can get away if I'm streaming those games. Those are the stations I can get away with playing on my feet and not get the quiet because it's classical.
1349000	1350000	I will say one thing.
1350000	1354000	Playing a racing game to A Night on the Bald Mountain.
1361000	1362000	Yeah, exactly.
1362000	1366000	SSU 100 Matt says, I sometimes listen to different music when playing Overwatch.
1366000	1370000	But yeah, if you play a lot of Overwatch, you're probably a little tired.
1370000	1373000	Plus, Overwatch doesn't really have background music during the matches.
1373000	1380000	I mean, although the thing that Dark Soccer's talking about with audio cues, I noticed that big time in Overwatch.
1380000	1385000	Like, you know, when the game's about to be over, like the music does start buh duh duh duh duh.
1385000	1389000	Like it starts pumping because the other team's about to win or you're about to win or whatever.
1389000	1392000	And then, yeah, they use a lot of musical cues in that.
1392000	1396000	But you hear it 500 times, you've heard it before type of things. I could see that for Overwatch.
1396000	1400000	And then I used to listen to podcasts while playing Skyrim a while ago.
1400000	1406000	Well, see, Skyrim has fantastic music, but when you're out in the world...
1406000	1408000	But the game's boring as fuck?
1408000	1410000	No, it's not boring as fuck. Not for me.
1410000	1411000	For me it is.
1411000	1414000	But when you're out in the overworld and stuff, it doesn't really play anything at all.
1414000	1415000	I guess it does.
1416000	1419000	It has very ambient types of flute-y music that plays.
1419000	1422000	There's a lot of the same audio cues, too.
1422000	1428000	You know, there's a series of games that I will personally go to somebody's house and kick them with a steel-toed boot in their head.
1428000	1432000	If they listen to something else while playing the game.
1432000	1434000	You're so polite. What is that?
1434000	1435000	All Silent Hill games.
1435000	1438000	Oh, come on. You have to listen to the radio.
1438000	1442000	It's part of the game. And no, I wouldn't do that, but I'd think about it a lot.
1442000	1445000	I think about all kinds of violence these days.
1445000	1450000	Scary games, in particular, you have to have the audio there. It's such a huge part of the game.
1450000	1451000	But Silent Hill in particular.
1451000	1455000	Yeah, I know, yeah. In particular, because of Kiryamoka, but I would say all scary games.
1455000	1458000	That's when you need to pump in some Desposito.
1458000	1460000	Now that's scary.
1460000	1465000	See, I'll be honest, I didn't even know that that was a song. Until today.
1465000	1467000	I would sing it, but I'm not going to.
1467000	1471000	That could be a whole new CD soundtrack line. Now that's scary.
1471000	1475000	Rob, I would take you singing it over Bieber any day.
1475000	1478000	Oh, we should go to karaoke sometime, and I'll sing Desposito for you.
1478000	1479000	And then I'll cry.
1479000	1484000	And then that way you can say, I finally heard Desposito, but it was the Rob Roberts version.
1484000	1487000	Exactly. I wouldn't mind going to karaoke, by the way.
1487000	1494000	Yeah, karaoke would be fun. My friend keeps trying to get me to go to one that they do at one of the bars around here that has a live band backing you up.
1494000	1497000	I guess that's the new trend, is like, you are the singer of a band.
1497000	1501000	They do piano bar night at sidetracks.
1501000	1502000	Oh, okay.
1502000	1503000	And you can sing along.
1503000	1506000	I think I've been to sidetracks like once. Once.
1506000	1507000	We did.
1507000	1510000	I've been to sidetracks in Chicago as many times as I've been to sidetracks.
1510000	1511000	We did.
1511000	1513000	They're completely different places, let me tell you.
1513000	1515000	We did Sister Bingo during all that.
1515000	1519000	Alright, let's see.
1519000	1524000	SHO 100 Matt would like to clarify about Skyrim. It's certainly not boring.
1524000	1530000	I mostly used to play podcasts while playing Skyrim to catch up on my podcast listening while I played for multiple hours.
1530000	1536000	Sometimes it helped me cue, oh, I just finished blank podcast, which is two hours long. Maybe I should stop playing.
1536000	1537000	Hey, if you're listening to-
1537000	1541000	And the next line, and then I don't.
1541000	1545000	Actually, I should put that out for the listeners.
1545000	1554000	If you're listening to OLR while you're playing a game, would you please tweet us and let us know what game are you playing while you listen to OLR this week?
1554000	1562000	Because, especially because of other stuff, which we will not name tonight, I know a lot of you are catching up on this in the podcast feed this week.
1562000	1566000	So I'd be curious, what game were you playing when you listened to this?
1566000	1571000	Tweet us at OLR or, cheap plug for Discord since we've been talking about Discord,
1571000	1580000	join us on the VOG Network Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, and that'll get you the automatic invite, everything you need, and then let us know.
1580000	1583000	I want to know, like, what game soundtrack did we replace this week?
1583000	1585000	Jamie, another thought for you?
1585000	1589000	Something just occurred to me. You were talking about playing, like, classical music when you stream on Twitch.
1589000	1590000	Yeah.
1590000	1593000	Is that because your intent is to put it on YouTube later?
1593000	1600000	No, but Twitch, so, sometimes I stream so late at night that I don't know a lot of people, but I know one or two people.
1600000	1607000	Honestly, I haven't streamed in a while because I really, really wanted to do more of it this year, but then I took on two podcasts.
1607000	1610000	So I've been doing, I've been expressing myself creatively in other ways.
1610000	1612000	I thought Twitch covered the licensing.
1613000	1624000	For some of their own music, Twitch has, like, their Twitch Safe music, and Twitch covers the licensing of a, like, live radio-style thing, but the problem is playing it back on demand.
1624000	1634000	So Twitch has the on-demand thing. So, like, I have some people, because I stream late at night, they might go watch my stream the next day to see, like, oh, what did Rob do last night while I was asleep?
1634000	1639000	And the problem is, if I play licensed music, then, like, 30 minutes of video gets muted.
1639000	1641000	So that's why I stick with the classical stuff.
1641000	1654000	But, like, the video game music is never a problem. The problem is, if I play Despacito in the background, which, if you go and watch some streamers that stream a lot of content, like, they play Heroes of the Storm all day long, or they play World of Warcraft all day long,
1654000	1660000	some of them sit there listening to Spotify while they're doing it, well, those streams get muted because of the background music.
1660000	1663000	That's what I was talking about, because I don't ever have any background music.
1663000	1664000	Then you'd be fine.
1664000	1665000	Just the game.
1665000	1666000	They're not going to mute anything.
1666000	1667000	Okay.
1667000	1678000	But here's the problem. When a game like Forza Horizon uses licensed music, the system doesn't know, oh, that licensed song was for that game.
1678000	1685000	So it just has a match and says, oh, this is, you know, whatever, I can't think of any songs of Forza Horizon all of a sudden.
1685000	1689000	Lady Tron, which I actually think was in a soccer game, but whatever, it goes, oh, this is Ace of Hearts.
1689000	1691000	Oh, hey, there.
1691000	1695000	And so, yeah, so it goes up, zonk, and it mutes the audio.
1695000	1698000	So that's why I do the classic music, because that's not going to trigger it.
1698000	1699000	Does that make sense?
1699000	1700000	No, it does.
1700000	1702000	You can't play rock band on Twitch.
1702000	1703000	Yeah.
1703000	1707000	But I'm so like, if I were playing like GTA, which I wouldn't, but if I were.
1707000	1708000	If you were.
1708000	1709000	Yeah.
1709000	1711000	To make sure I'm clear, you can play rock band live.
1711000	1716000	It's just, if somebody tries to go back and watch it later, they're just going to hear silence.
1716000	1718000	That just means you're really good.
1718000	1723000	So that just means that I'm fine streaming something like Air Zonk.
1723000	1726000	Since you don't, yeah, you don't replace your music, you'd be fine.
1726000	1729000	And I don't really tend to replace mine either. I just have to be aware.
1729000	1734000	And now a lot of games these days, like I want to say Crypt of the Necro Dancer is one of them.
1734000	1738000	Correct me if I'm wrong, but some of them have a switch in the menus.
1738000	1746000	You go in and say broadcaster mode and what it'll do, it'll strip out anything that is like license that could trigger it and only keep original songs.
1746000	1748000	So like a lot of games are starting to do that now.
1748000	1749000	That's cool.
1749000	1750000	Yeah.
1750000	1761000	But, but no, I mean, I, and I mentioned it to you, Dan and I are looking at our old consoles and thinking about, you know, streaming them, the two of us together, like once a week.
1761000	1762000	That'd be fun.
1762000	1763000	So.
1763000	1768000	She Hulk in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says rock band is a fun party game.
1768000	1769000	It is a fun party game.
1769000	1773000	I wish I, well, I have some bad news about rock band tonight.
1773000	1775000	We'll get into that a little later in the show, but I don't want to, I don't want to be a downer.
1775000	1783000	I do hope, even though I personally was a little disappointed in rock band four, um, I do hope they make another game.
1783000	1785000	I do hope they're able to correct some of those things.
1785000	1791000	So the rock band five, and I also think rock band four is in a better place now than it was when it released.
1791000	1792000	Like rivals helped a lot.
1792000	1798000	Rivals is kinda, I think would have been great if the game was that when it first came out, but you know, you live, you learn, right?
1798000	1799000	So we'll see.
1799000	1801000	I hope they do another one, but it is a fun party game.
1801000	1802000	Even today.
1802000	1803000	All right.
1803000	1810000	Speaking of party games, let's talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week in a segment that we call how was your gaming week and dark soccer.
1810000	1811000	We'll start with you.
1811000	1813000	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1813000	1822000	Well, I did the whole reason that I do not have dragon ball fighter Z is because I bought battle for Azeroth.
1822000	1825000	So, oh, you did the whole pre-order the collector's edition.
1825000	1826000	Okay.
1826000	1828000	So you have, do you don't have the app?
1828000	1831000	They still have the allied races locked behind reputations, right?
1831000	1836000	But they opened up on, um, uh, the level, the skip to one 10.
1836000	1837000	Okay.
1837000	1838000	For everything except demon hunter.
1838000	1839000	Okay.
1839000	1853000	And so, um, since I'm mostly playing hoard on proud more, I figured I would use my, um, level skip just to make a brand new mage because I'm kind of tired of leveling in the blood elf area.
1853000	1854000	Sure.
1854000	1855000	Because I played nothing but blood elves.
1855000	1856000	So I started playing trolls.
1856000	1857000	Trolls are cool.
1857000	1862000	Um, I've also been playing, um, animal crossing, uh, pocket camp.
1862000	1875000	Um, they brought out new animals, including one very frightening clown creature named Pietro who, and oh my God, the new, um, the new, uh, fuck, what do they call them?
1875000	1885000	Uh, not resources, the word that wants to come to mind, but it's, uh, amenity, um, is like this big stitched up ugly clown face thing.
1885000	1892000	And I swear I'm only going to have it long enough to get rid of it so I can get the points from my, from my visitors at my camp.
1892000	1895000	But, uh, want Pietro to go away.
1895000	1897000	Pietro is the new Ed.
1897000	1899000	Actually no Ed is still terrible.
1899000	1901000	So Ed can stay away forever.
1901000	1905000	Um, I'm also still playing idle pouring.
1905000	1911000	Um, I don't really know if I'm playing much else.
1911000	1917000	So I was playing, I was actually playing Bust A Move, like Puzzle Bobble, Bust A Move and having a lot of fun.
1917000	1918000	Nice.
1918000	1929000	Um, but I'm kind of thinking that when Dan and I do our stream, we're going to start off with maybe KOF 98 or maybe start off with something on the Neo Geo like Magician Lord or something.
1929000	1932000	So we were just talking and I want ideas from people.
1932000	1935000	I don't think you see a lot of Neo Geo games stream these days.
1935000	1943000	I mean, you might see the stuff that's on Nintendo Switch from Neo Geo, but even then I don't think you see a lot of that.
1943000	1951000	The emulation on those is kind of not great anyway, but, um, there's nothing like playing like, or even just hooking up the Dreamcast and playing like Last Blade, something like that.
1951000	1960000	You know, but we're, we've been kind of doing some inventory on some stuff and you know, I, oh, we, I played, I played a non-video game game.
1960000	1961000	Okay.
1961000	1963000	I played darts. We have a dart board.
1963000	1970000	Oh yeah. Yeah. You guys have that. Well, it's not just any dartboard either. It's one of those electronic fancy pizza parlor dartboards.
1970000	1979000	And so Dan, uh, I've only played darts twice, so I played darts with Dan. He won. We played 301 and he won.
1979000	1986000	Although we were, every game was like neck and neck right toward the end, just making sure you can hit that, the one spot to close out your points.
1986000	1992000	But it was pretty fun. You know, I, I like throwing pointy objects at things with the intent to stab them.
1992000	2000000	I hit the wall once I made plastic tip, dart, go into drywall. Go me. Okay. That's it.
2000000	2002000	All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?
2002000	2006000	Um, I didn't play a whole ton of stuff. I mainly just, uh, dance dance revolution.
2006000	2013000	Um, so I've been playing that, like I said, every day about 30 minutes. Um, just, you know, easy stuff.
2013000	2022000	I usually start off with a nonstop course and then to warm up and just pick songs that I feel that I can actually accomplish.
2022000	2035000	And then also, um, kind of push it a little bit, but it's mainly just been playing on standard mode because like I said, it's been at least 10 years that I've played DDR and like a regular capacity.
2035000	2041000	So it's, it's going to take a while to get back up to that again, because it took a few years to get to that point in the first place.
2041000	2048000	So just been taking it easy. Um, and then along with that, you know, I've been also playing, um, Stardew Valley still.
2048000	2064000	It's kind of boring. Um, I don't know. It's, it reminds me a lot of like animal crossing, just with all like the fetch quests and stuff, except there's a little bit more flexibility with what you can kind of, you know, create in your house and like, you know, design your own kind of farm and everything.
2065000	2076000	But I don't know. It's all right. The story's kind of dumb, but I'm thinking I'm almost finished with it based off of what I've seen, you know, like in some of the facts and stuff.
2076000	2088000	So hopefully just get all the achievements and then I'll be done with that. So that's, that's pretty much it. Oh, a little bit Pokemon and a little bit of, um, Ingress, but yeah, not much of that.
2088000	2098000	All right. Um, my gaming week, um, honestly, I'm so disappointing lately. I haven't been playing a lot of new stuff. It's still kind of the same old standards. I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14.
2098000	2109000	I discovered how much I really enjoy playing Red Mage. Like the first time I tried doing it, I must have been doing something wrong, but now I'm like so into like how the class plays and how you like fly in and out of melee. That's a lot of fun.
2109000	2120000	Uh, I did play Wow for a hot minute cause I helped get that guild over on Proudmoore that I'm assuming you and, uh, uh, Mr. Slidekick from a game buoy are playing together. Yeah. I helped with getting that sign. So I played that for a hot minute.
2120000	2137000	Um, and, uh, let's see, which I actually think, what did he end up naming it? Did he give it the acronym VOG? I don't remember. That was something he was thinking of doing. He was going to call it something where the acronym was VOG, but it was like veil of ghouls or something.
2137000	2150000	It was something. Yeah, something like that. But, um, actually speaking of which I'm planning on talking to him about restarting Hillsbrad Blues. Yeah. I think it'd be fun if you guys like did a Wow. I know that's a comic, but if you guys did a Wow show or something, it'd be fun.
2150000	2166000	Good. Well, we got a gap. You can have the name Horde House for sale. Time to message somebody. Uh, of course I guess I'd have to get some other boys to sign off on that. Uh, but anyway, in all seriousness, uh, besides that, I've also been playing Heroes of the Storm still.
2166000	2178000	I bought Hanzo. Finally, I got enough gold to buy Hanzo, who's probably more fun to play in Heroes of the Storm than he is in Overwatch. And then, uh, I actually, okay, so here I go again, buying a game on more than one platform.
2178000	2193000	I bought Final Fantasy 12, the Zodiac Age on PC, cause it just came out a couple days ago, but hear me out y'all. The PC version runs 60 frames a second, which the PlayStation 4 one doesn't do, and it will do some higher resolutions.
2193000	2209000	So like I can't do 4K at 60 frames a second. My graphics card isn't good enough, but I can do like 1440 or I think, I think I might even be on like two, two, 2K, whatever that is, Ultra HD. Uh, and it looks so good. Like it really looks good.
2209000	2221000	Uh, it's for me, it's noticeably better than PlayStation 4. And I don't, I don't know if it's because my monitor is probably better than my TV, which is most certainly the case. I don't think that's anything about the PlayStation hardware, but yeah, it's just, it looks really good.
2221000	2234000	So I kind of don't regret making the purchase, but I only played a little bit of that just enough to do the intro to see how it ran. And then I am thinking that might be a thing that I pick up 15. Now they put up the tech demo or not the benchmark for it.
2234000	2246000	I hate to say it, but I'm giving it some thought and I kind of hate myself a little bit for doing it, but 12 looks so much better that like if 15 looks that much better too. I don't know. It's Ooh.
2247000	2250000	I have to go back and play. I haven't even played 15 really.
2250000	2252000	You want to borrow mine?
2252000	2275000	No, I haven't. I bought it. Like I bought it at launch. Like I even got like, was it the zero or whatever that was, you know, um, type zero. And I have that and I played through that a little bit, but like, I don't know. It's a combat system, man. It just really turns me off on the game. I like, I like my turn-based combat. It's kind of disappointing. I'll give it a try again someday.
2275000	2291000	I just, I just want them to hurry up and announce Final Fantasy 16 already. Although with the seven, I think the seven remake is Final Fantasy 16. I know that doesn't make any sense, but I feel like the effort and the stuff they're putting into this is like, that's what we're getting instead of Final Fantasy 16 right now.
2291000	2299000	Like we'll get Final Fantasy 16 eventually, but it's just that much longer. We're going to have to wait. So we'll see. We'll see.
2299000	2306000	Anyway, that's right. Besides the mobile gaming, I've also been playing a little bit of Ingress, a little bit of Pokemon Go, but, um, actually a lot of Pokemon Go.
2306000	2307000	Oh yeah, both of those two.
2307000	2325000	I'm halfway through level 35. Woo. So, you know, and I've only got, I think like 4 million AP to go in Ingress till I hit level 16. So I want to get to that like super sick, sad individual where I'm level 16 in Ingress and level 40 in Pokemon Go.
2325000	2335000	And I know I wouldn't be the first. I'm sure there's other people out there, but I know it's a very exclusive, sick, sad club. And then when the Harry Potter game comes out, I'll be max level in that too.
2335000	2339000	So I'll go for the whole trifecta of sadness.
2339000	2350000	Alright. That's it for our gaming weeks. So we'll do some quick housekeeping. Of course, you can always follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. I mentioned the Discord a minute ago as well.
2350000	2359000	We're on Facebook. Sadly, we've been neglecting putting a lot of content on Facebook, but maybe we'll think of what we can do over there. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to at least follow the show.
2359000	2370000	And I want to also just give a quick shout out for my side project because it's now available in iTunes and Google as of this week. And that show is called Shaking and Crying.
2370000	2388000	It's not games. It's pop culture, geek culture, and sass with myself and Aria Snark, who's a very talented cosplayer lady. So we talk about, you know, I think we talked about Celebrity Big Brother this week and how we didn't know any of the people that were on it.
2388000	2391000	Well, I knew about half the cast, but Victoria knew less than that.
2391000	2394000	Which, by the way, congrats.
2394000	2396000	Oh, to Courtney Act on the UK.
2396000	2398000	Courtney Act.
2398000	2402000	Yeah, Courtney Act. She's going to be big. I bet you she has a hosting gig.
2402000	2404000	Classy as fuck.
2404000	2417000	If there is, I mean, not to sidetrack too much, but if there is justice in this world, Courtney and Andrew will have like a road trip show in the UK. Because I don't know if you've been following their bromance, but it's one of those things where it's like, so cute.
2417000	2427000	You know what, though? I did find a gem on YouTube of Trixie Mattel and Courtney Act singing a duet.
2427000	2430000	She was on once and it was really funny.
2430000	2433000	But I think I posted it in a certain group.
2433000	2439000	Anyway, all right, let's move on. We're going to talk about some video game news.
2439000	2446000	Let's talk about everybody's, well, I should say the least favorite company, fifth least favorite company in the US from the last poll I saw.
2446000	2447000	Uh oh.
2447000	2448000	It's EA.
2448000	2449000	Uh oh.
2449000	2450000	EA.
2450000	2451000	What'd they do now?
2451000	2452000	Nothing.
2452000	2453000	Another stinky turd.
2454000	2457000	EA announced that they're delaying. Oh, I'm sorry.
2457000	2464000	They're putting out Anthem at a date that is later than when they originally specified.
2464000	2465000	Because it's not a delay.
2465000	2468000	It is not a delay, according to Blake Jorgensen.
2468000	2472000	Don't call it a delay. It's simply coming out at a later time.
2472000	2476000	How about never? How about do a good Mass Effect?
2476000	2479000	I'm sorry, I'm just cracking up in the hole.
2479000	2481000	It's not a delay.
2482000	2486000	I know we announced fall 2018. Fall 2018 is just coming out later, that's all.
2486000	2489000	The fall is delayed, not our game.
2490000	2492000	The fall has been delayed.
2492000	2496000	The Groundhog came out again and said that there was going to be more summer.
2496000	2498000	Climate change is not real.
2499000	2501000	Fall has just been delayed.
2502000	2508000	And Anthem will come out now in fall of 2019 because fall is winter.
2508000	2509000	Is everybody following me?
2509000	2514000	Follow me. No? That's okay? Just enjoy Anthem when it's fucking ready.
2514000	2521000	Well look, I will give EA credit for this despite this obvious sense of what the fuckery.
2521000	2526000	I will give them credit for knowing when to delay a highly anticipated game when they need to
2526000	2529000	because they misfired on that call last time.
2529000	2536000	My concern is that they are still going to force BioWare to put that out in the fiscal year whether it's ready or not.
2536000	2543000	And I'm maybe not as extreme as Jamie is on this, but my feathers are pretty...
2543000	2551000	I was in Anthem at E3 and the more I marinated on it, my feathers are pretty ruffled about the way EA has treated BioWare and has treated Mass Effect.
2551000	2556000	So I know it sucks because I know there's a lot of people that are working hard on Anthem, but I'm just...
2556000	2558000	I'm not inclined to support it.
2559000	2561000	They're just setting them up to fail or disappoint.
2561000	2563000	Kinda. Kinda.
2564000	2574000	But anyways, so along with that, of course, their excuse, I guess, or maybe the justification is that there's going to be a new Battlefield game coming out later this year.
2574000	2582000	So a sequel to Battlefield 1 or Battlefield 2, a new modern Battlefield game. No one knows yet.
2582000	2590000	Let's do Battlefield Medieval Times. They already have a medieval first person combat game like that, but why not? Let's just go back further.
2590000	2595000	And then, of course, there's some comments regarding, you know, the next Battlefield 3.
2595000	2605000	You know, like they haven't really said anything about Battlefield 3 yet, but of course there's going to be a new Star Wars game that's going to be coming out fiscal 2020, which ends in March 2020.
2605000	2609000	So we'll see something coming out then.
2609000	2611000	And then, of course...
2611000	2615000	Unless EA decides that the fiscal year has been delayed.
2615000	2617000	And then I know...
2617000	2624000	We actually took over all the banks and we've actually delayed the fiscal year. So it's not a delay, it's the fiscal year moved.
2624000	2632000	The fiscal year moved. And then, of course, as a shock, I mean, they made comments also about loot boxes and gambling saying,
2632000	2637000	We do not believe that loot boxes are a form of gambling and a lot of countries agree with us.
2637000	2643000	A lot of countries agree with us? Is that the quote, really?
2643000	2646000	What a dump thing to say.
2646000	2648000	That is the quote.
2648000	2653000	Which countries? There's a lot of countries. There's some countries you don't want on your side.
2653000	2656000	It's not literally gambling. It's just like...
2656000	2658000	Metaphorically gambling.
2658000	2665000	Metaphorically gambling. It uses the same predatory tactics that you use to get people to constantly gamble.
2665000	2666000	And then, of course, with that...
2666000	2670000	You know what? I want to buy EA a fucking dictionary. That's what I want to buy EA.
2671000	2673000	And then smack everybody there with a clue by four?
2673000	2680000	No, because I know people at EA that work very hard. EA executives, I would smack with a Merriam-Webster.
2680000	2681000	Well, yeah.
2681000	2683000	Obviously, right?
2683000	2687000	And I have really terrible news for you about Star Wars Battlefront II.
2687000	2688000	Uh oh.
2688000	2694000	So Battlefront II, and we really should feel so bad for EA. I mean, they are just hurting right now.
2695000	2703000	It's reported that it sold short of their 10 million copy estimate. It's only sold 9 million copies.
2704000	2706000	Only 9 million copies.
2706000	2717000	And because we feel so terrible for them, we should totally embrace in open arms the reintroduction of paid currencies for their loot boxes and microtransactions, which will be coming soon.
2717000	2725000	How do we turn 9 million into 10 million? By financially fucking the 9 million people we have and squeezing that 10 million dollars out of them.
2726000	2727000	That's how to do it.
2728000	2730000	So, yes. So there...
2732000	2733000	And, of course...
2733000	2735000	Oh, and this is great.
2735000	2736000	Gotta love...
2736000	2737000	God trust EA.
2737000	2738000	CEO Andrew Wilson.
2739000	2740000	Go quoting.
2740000	2743000	You shouldn't believe everything you read in the press.
2743000	2754000	We have tremendous relationship with Disney and we have built some amazing games together and have been very proactive with the relation in service to our other players.
2754000	2757000	That's another dump wording too.
2757000	2758000	Fake news?
2758000	2762000	Is that a quote from Chitolini? Like, wait. Say that again. Say that again.
2762000	2765000	So, okay. It says, you shouldn't believe everything you read in the press.
2765000	2769000	Fake news. Don't watch CNN. Fake news.
2769000	2774000	We have a tremendous relationship with Disney and we have built some amazing games together.
2774000	2775000	Well, I don't know why I'm putting us out there.
2775000	2777000	We have a bigly relationship.
2777000	2784000	We have a bigly relationship with Norway. We wish more people from Norway would move here.
2785000	2790000	And we have been very proactive with that relation or with that...
2790000	2792000	Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
2792000	2796000	And we have been very... I'm gonna read this as exactly as it's quoted.
2796000	2797000	Okay.
2797000	2802000	Okay. So, we read this whole last part.
2802000	2803000	You should really...
2803000	2806000	Loki's tripping up because it doesn't make any fucking sense.
2806000	2808000	Because it reads like a dump tweet?
2808000	2824000	We have had a tremendous relationship with Disney and we have built some amazing games together, and we have been very proactive with that relation in the service of our players.
2825000	2827000	I don't... I think there should be a word in there somewhere.
2827000	2831000	In relation to the... This doesn't seem like it makes sense.
2831000	2834000	Our tax cuts have been tremendous.
2834000	2838000	Walmart gave their employees $1,000. They closed all the Sam's clubs.
2838000	2840000	It gets better. Hold on.
2840000	2847000	We're at the point where when we make a decision that we have the right model for players in our community,
2847000	2851000	I have no doubt that we will get the support at Disney on that.
2852000	2857000	Discussing, of course, the microtransaction model that they were going to be putting back in the battlefront.
2857000	2863000	So, I think the EA CEO should only be allowed to speak in emojis from here on out because it would make more sense.
2863000	2867000	That's why he's having trouble making words because he only speaks emoji.
2868000	2872000	Okay. We need to take the box of crayons and the helmet away from...
2872000	2878000	Actually, there's good reason to tonight. We'll get into that a little later. The crayons are up for grabs.
2878000	2881000	Well, especially... Who did we give them to before? Kudaragi?
2881000	2883000	I thought it was Kazurai.
2883000	2887000	Yeah, it was. It was. But he's thankfully doing an okay job now.
2887000	2891000	Spoiler alert. He's retiring. It's coming up later in the show, so...
2891000	2893000	That's why I said he's doing okay right now.
2893000	2901000	So, we need to... We can take the leash and the bike helmet off of him and give it to good old Chris there.
2901000	2902000	It's like I can't keep...
2902000	2903000	Andrew, whatever.
2903000	2905000	I can't compete on that level with Andrew Joseph.
2905000	2906000	White boy name.
2907000	2909000	Anyway, all right.
2909000	2914000	So, yes, I'm sure that those microtransactions and stuff will be embraced with open arms and stuff.
2914000	2918000	And they totally haven't... I'm surprised that they sold...
2918000	2920000	Open arms or open butt cheeks.
2920000	2926000	Can we talk about this real quick? Because it's EA related. It's not on the show roll, but it was all over Twitter this week.
2926000	2930000	And if you really want to talk about fake news, I want to talk about this real quick.
2931000	2935000	This rumor that Microsoft is buying EA.
2935000	2939000	What the fuck are you all smoking in perpetuating that rumor?
2939000	2941000	Do you know where that rumor came from?
2941000	2944000	It came from a Polygon article, which should be your first warning.
2944000	2947000	Your second thing is that it was an analyst.
2947000	2955000	An analyst said it would be a good move for Microsoft to get the first party exclusives for Microsoft to buy EA.
2955000	2961000	It could happen. Monkeys might fly out of my ass. It could happen.
2961000	2967000	Party on, Wayne. Monkeys are flying out of Rob's ass and Microsoft is buying them.
2969000	2975000	Look, if the news comes out tomorrow that Microsoft bought EA, I will happily let you do the Photoshop.
2975000	2978000	Okay, if the monkeys are gonna fly out of your ass, use an enema first.
2978000	2983000	Here's the thing. It blows my mind how that rumor...
2983000	2990000	And I will give, as much shit as we're giving this EA guy here, and rightfully so, I will give him some credit.
2990000	2992000	Don't believe everything you read.
2992000	2995000	Because this Microsoft and EA thing is a perfect example of this.
2995000	2998000	Because where did this fucking analyst set...
2998000	3002000	Which, you can't spell analyst without anal, by the way.
3002000	3008000	So, if you want a fucking prediction, call Ms. Cleo, okay?
3008000	3011000	Ms. Cleo's in jail, right? No, she died.
3011000	3014000	Yeah, Ms. Cleo died. But you'd still probably get a better prediction.
3014000	3017000	Do you think she saw that coming?
3017000	3019000	Fuck right off. Anyway.
3019000	3022000	Hey, to quote Ask a Mortician, you're all gonna die.
3022000	3027000	Anyway, my point is, is that the games media, now it's this headline.
3027000	3031000	Rumor, Microsoft to buy EA. That's not even a rumor.
3031000	3036000	Somebody literally made that up. Literally made it up.
3036000	3039000	They didn't even say it was gonna happen. They said it should happen.
3039000	3041000	This is a suggestion.
3041000	3043000	Video game industry fanfic right now.
3043000	3047000	Oh, that's a perfect way to put it. Video game industry fanfic.
3047000	3049000	Oh my god, that's a perfect way to describe it.
3049000	3055000	This is someone's yaoi fanfiction, where Microsoft and EA make out and then have a corn cob.
3055000	3059000	What did everybody that was at NeoGaf, where did they all go? What's the new thing?
3059000	3063000	Era? Era? Era?
3063000	3064000	NeoGaf?
3064000	3066000	That era is fanfic. That's all it is. Not all of it.
3066000	3068000	Is there another website now?
3068000	3070000	Yeah, there is. All the NeoGaf people went to some new place.
3070000	3073000	Oh, I thought NeoGaf was just, they were still at NeoGaf.
3073000	3076000	No, I think it's still there, but now there's like two houses.
3076000	3077000	Era?
3077000	3080000	Yeah, era something. Resetting era?
3080000	3081000	Resetti?
3081000	3084000	Resetti, that's it. Resetti era. Maybe, I don't know.
3084000	3087000	No, I'm just making stuff up because that's from Animal Crossing.
3087000	3092000	Alright, anyway. Yeah, so the Microsoft and EA thing, total crap.
3092000	3097000	Seriously, watch how that is spreading around the gaming industry.
3097000	3101000	It's crazy. Like, people are writing up these articles for clicks.
3101000	3105000	Like, it's the thing that's most broken in gaming journalism right now.
3105000	3111000	I mean, I can't believe here I am talking actually about actual ethics in gaming journalism, but here we are.
3111000	3114000	Like, it's a new year, I guess. Anything's possible.
3114000	3117000	Oh my god. Let's not do the gate thing again.
3117000	3118000	Nah, it's not.
3118000	3119000	It's tied gate all over again.
3119000	3121000	Nope, nope. Them gate's been wired shut.
3121000	3124000	Let's move on to another story, shall we?
3124000	3128000	Let's talk about Mario Kart coming to smartphones.
3128000	3132000	Now, this isn't fake news. This is something that they've actually said is going to happen.
3132000	3139000	The original Mario Runner game came out, then Animal Crossing, then now Mario Kart.
3139000	3144000	Nintendo did confirm this via their Twitter, and I believe it was some type of financial announcement over in Japan.
3144000	3151000	They announced that Mario Kart Tour will be coming out at some point before March 2019.
3151000	3156000	Which is a hell of a window, but it's basically this fiscal year. Here we go again with the fiscal years.
3156000	3164000	But that's all they said. No screenshots, no nothing. Just that Mario Kart is kind of the next game on their agenda.
3164000	3169000	Although, no, it's not the next game on their agenda because they confirmed a Zelda thing was coming at some point.
3169000	3178000	So Zelda I kept, because I've played touch screen Zelda on the DS, and they have a system that works well for touch screen.
3178000	3180000	If it's Phantom Hourglass or Hyrule Warriors type of thing, you'll be fine.
3180000	3191000	Exactly. That stuff, it worked pretty well. However, there's been several Mario Kart knockoff games on mobile platforms, and they're not that great.
3191000	3194000	It's the lack of buttons thing again.
3194000	3199000	You know, we all know how it's going to be controlled. You're going to tilt your damn phone.
3199000	3202000	You're going to tilt your damn phone, that's how it's going to work.
3202000	3208000	Well yeah, it'll be just like the other mobile games that they have where you tilt the phone and they have on screen buttons for other things.
3208000	3217000	Assuming that it plays like a Mario Kart game. I don't see why it wouldn't, but there is the possibility it could be more like a football manager type of thing.
3217000	3223000	Where maybe you're getting resources and racing, maybe making tracks and watching your karts race on it.
3223000	3228000	I mean, it doesn't have to be a straight up Mario Kart game. We're kind of making that assumption.
3228000	3230000	But without a tangible controller.
3230000	3231000	I think that would be terrible.
3231000	3239000	I don't think it would be great either, but I'm just saying we are kind of making an assumption it's going to be like any other Mario Kart game.
3239000	3243000	And without a tactile control, I just think that's going to be so weird.
3243000	3251000	But the wheel thing on the Wii with kids was big. It's just going to be your phone now. That's what they're going to do.
3252000	3258000	Maybe they can have some cardboard crap that you can strap to it to make some like...
3258000	3265000	Funny, funny you mention that because Kaijuto in chat says Labo should let kids make a cardboard Mario Kart.
3265000	3267000	That would be kind of fun.
3267000	3269000	It would be, but this is smart phones.
3269000	3271000	But they should let adults do that.
3271000	3276000	It's not the Switch, it's smart phones. Unless Mario Kart 9 confirmed?
3277000	3285000	Well they technically have something like that. I mean there's that whole motorcycle racing game that they showed with Labo where you had like pedals and stuff.
3285000	3287000	Oh yeah, they showed that briefly.
3287000	3289000	They sort of already have that, but...
3289000	3291000	I mean, we're talking about mobile games.
3291000	3295000	Just because we have a Mario Kart doesn't mean we shouldn't get an F-Zero game.
3296000	3298000	Oh yeah, mobile F-Zero game. That would look like shit.
3298000	3303000	No, no, no. Not on fucking mobile. No, no, no. You stay the fuck away from mobile F-Zero.
3303000	3305000	I mean an actual Switch game.
3305000	3314000	You know, I've played some really gorgeous games on my iPhone X. They look astounding.
3314000	3321000	So I think that yeah, a top end device would have no problem with something like F-Zero.
3321000	3324000	I'm not worried about the way it'll look. I'm worried about the way it'll play.
3324000	3326000	That's the only problem.
3326000	3332000	It could look like Super Mario Kart, the first one, but it's gonna control like shit.
3332000	3339000	Yeah. Well anyway, more to come on that in the future. There's a whole year and then some for that to come out.
3339000	3343000	Anyway, it should also be mentioned as part of this same financial announcement.
3343000	3348000	Nintendo dumped a bunch of news the other night, and I think it was because they were doing a financial announcement in Japan.
3348000	3355000	They also have confirmed Nintendo Switch Online is confirmed to launch in September 2018.
3355000	3361000	That's been pushed back again, although there were rumors that it was going to be pushed back from what the Italian website had done.
3361000	3365000	Well, I don't know. But anyway, confirmed now, September 2018 is the new go-live date.
3365000	3370000	They're still saying $20 a year, and that's gonna allow you to play Switch games online.
3370000	3373000	And the classic archive will finally show up.
3373000	3377000	Super Mario Bros. 3, Balloon Fight, Dr. Mario have all been teased before.
3377000	3381000	Again, we're only going off of things that have been announced previously.
3381000	3389000	There's no guarantee Nintendo is keeping any of this the same, but we're assuming all this stuff is still in place for September of 2018.
3389000	3401000	Now, I would assume, here I go, but I'm gonna assume, if it's coming out in September, E3 is going to be a great time for them to finally explain the classic game shit, and how that's gonna work.
3401000	3406000	Well, here's the other thing to consider, too, that I just now thought about with Nintendo's system.
3406000	3416000	So, because the Switch is a portable system, most of these games that are multiplayer are available multiplayer locally, right?
3416000	3423000	So, what did they do before when they had local multiplayer games, and they wanted to get around the whole online thing?
3423000	3430000	They would tunnel. They would have warp pipe or something like that to play local area games over the internet.
3430000	3438000	So, if this service sucks, and it's not even worth the $20 they were paying for it, that's how people are gonna get around that shit.
3438000	3445000	Because most of those games, because it is a portable system, support local area play, and that's how they're gonna get around all this bullshit.
3445000	3447000	Hackers gonna hack, you mean?
3447000	3448000	Exactly.
3448000	3452000	Alright, let's move on with some more news. More pushbacks, right, Jamie?
3452000	3457000	Yep. Red Dead Redemption 2, which I know a lot of people have been super hyper about.
3457000	3459000	Maybe one in this room?
3459000	3461000	Well, I was thinking of Dan.
3461000	3462000	Okay.
3462000	3464000	Dan's really, really into that.
3464000	3479000	They were, it was supposed to be out Fall 2017. They pushed it back once to Spring 2018, and now they pushed it to October 26th, 2018.
3479000	3481000	It's also my brother's birthday, so maybe.
3481000	3486000	But anyway, but they said, and this is the quote,
3486000	3495000	We apologize to everyone disappointed by this delay. While we had hoped to have the game out sooner, we require a little extra time to polish.
3495000	3508000	I like that. I would rather, again, that a game be delayed and come out right than them just putting out some shit and then polishing a turd.
3508000	3516000	In this day and age, I think we've all learned our lesson. Let this game take the time it needs to be done.
3516000	3518000	A good wine needs to age.
3518000	3523000	I'm not worried about Rockstar Games. When it comes to polishing stuff, I'm not, they'll, it's fine.
3523000	3524000	They'll deliver.
3524000	3532000	They did the same thing with Grand Theft Auto 5, and look how that turned out. I mean, oh, that was such a terribly selling game. It only sold tens of millions of copies.
3532000	3535000	Are you worried about the online component of Red Dead Redemption 2?
3535000	3544000	No, not really, because I own, like, Grand Theft Auto 5, and I mean, nowadays, like, I really should.
3544000	3554000	It's funny, because, like, once again, I watch people play Grand Theft Auto Online, but I don't actually go and play Grand Theft Auto Online, even though I have it on multiple systems.
3554000	3563000	It, there's so many options to, like, gain experience and stuff in the game. Yeah, there's a lot of grindy things with it, but it's, now they have, like, so many options available to you.
3563000	3569000	Like, if you just wanted to, like, play online races and earn money and experience that way, you could probably do that.
3569000	3580000	And so there's a lot of stuff out there, plus all the user-generated things, which is pretty awesome. So they have, like, you know, people can make their own custom race courses in there, and a lot of people play that, and there's lots of unique game modes coming out of that.
3580000	3591000	So I am looking forward to how Red Dead does it, and yeah, I'm sure they'll have the shark cards or some equivalent to that, you know, money bags or whatever the hell it's gonna be in Red Dead, but it's not required.
3591000	3605000	I mean, granted, they'll try to push you in that direction, but yet, ultimately, you don't need to do it, and honestly, the single player is worth the price of admission anyways, so I'm honestly okay with it.
3606000	3619000	Dungeonbuster in our chat, excuse me, over at live.vognetwork.com says, delaying Witcher 3 turned out pretty good for that game. Same with taking off a year to make sure AC Origins would be good. So delays aren't bad news anymore.
3619000	3637000	The big thing about this, though, is that while they've announced PS4 and Xbox One, we still have nothing about a PC version, which, I mean, a lot of people are, you know, pretty hardcore PC gamers now, especially since you have a lot more flexibility on PC than you do on the home consoles.
3637000	3639000	I think it'll just come out later on PC.
3639000	3640000	Kind of like how GTA did.
3640000	3641000	Yeah, exactly.
3641000	3643000	That's how all of their PC versions have...
3643000	3645000	Yeah, they're worried about the piracy element of it.
3645000	3647000	I just want to see it modded.
3648000	3649000	Yeah, yeah.
3649000	3653000	Alright, well, let's move on with some more news for the people playing on PlayStation 4.
3653000	3664000	Yeah, so now there's a little bit more, you know, kind of an answer to the question, well, I won't, you know, should I get PlayStation 4 Pro? I don't own a 4K TV. What's it in for me?
3664000	3687000	Well, now they're adding system-wide super sampling to the system, so now that's going to be coming in firmware update 5.5, and it's basically going to allow games to render at a higher resolution than displayed on the screen, making the image look less aliased and also a little bit sharper, so that's kind of cool.
3688000	3702000	And, you know, still thinking about it. Haven't done it yet, but I am considering it just for the PlayStation VR stuff, and eventually a 4K TV.
3702000	3709000	Yeah, see, I'm the audience for this, because I don't have a 4K TV, but I do, yeah, super sampling stuff sounds really exciting.
3709000	3721000	Actually, I have been using, the PlayStation is now in my office, hooked up to my 4K monitor, so I have been using it here and there a little bit, but I don't really, I mean, a lot of the games don't, like, suddenly render in 4K.
3721000	3731000	It's like a lot of the interface stuff is 4K, and some things here and there might be, but usually the games themselves don't get, like, this gigantic upgrade visually. It might get, like, more frames a second.
3731000	3747000	Yeah, more performance, more details and stuff like that, but it's kind of worth it. I'm waiting for the price to come down a little bit on that, just because I do have a PlayStation 4 already, and it's fine for what I'm using it for, so I don't know.
3747000	3758000	Maybe later, maybe when they come out with that new rumored controller for VR and stuff, and then I can kind of get a more powerful system to go with a new TV that hopefully I'll have at that time.
3758000	3767000	All right. Well, you know, we play a little bit of Pokemon Go around here. I think all the hosts played that game a little bit, and I know some of you are still playing it.
3767000	3775000	Niantic, the company that makes that game, as well as Ingress, which we talked about a couple weeks ago on this show in depth, Niantic made another interesting acquisition this week.
3775000	3782000	They already acquired one company a few weeks ago that does, like, the, I think it was, like, the avatars and stuff. Now they've acquired Escher Reality.
3782000	3790000	Escher Reality focuses on the, quote, persistent cross-platform multi-user experiences, and it's through AR.
3790000	3804000	Escher's been doing AR a while, I guess, and even Escher's CEO, Ross Finman, in an interview with TechCrunch said, everyone thought we were crazy at that time, but Escher is now working on creating AR developer toolkit to work on mobile.
3805000	3815000	Apple has their AR kit. Google has AR core. They all have toolkits, but Escher specifically is focusing on the multi-platform and multi-user experiences.
3815000	3826000	So could Niantic be trying to get in on this for Pokemon Go? They've already released some AR stuff where, like, the Pokemon are in the room. I did it once.
3826000	3830000	It was, like, one of those, oh, that's kind of neat, and then that was it. I never did it again.
3830000	3835000	I like to catch a Dratini in the toilet. It was great. I wish I still had that screenshot.
3835000	3840000	It's probably better for kids, but for me, it was, like, I did that once, and I was, like, okay, I'm already over it.
3840000	3849000	But this is interesting because this makes it sound like maybe you will battle other people in the real world, but through the phones.
3849000	3858000	So I don't know if that would be, like, something that works into an existing game, like, maybe an Ingress if I see a blue agent show up.
3858000	3862000	I can start zapping them or something, but I just, that would kind of change that game significantly.
3862000	3867000	Maybe Niantic is developing something for the Harry Potter game. Maybe this is how the spells are going to work or something.
3867000	3868000	Wizarding duels.
3868000	3871000	Who knows? Yeah, maybe. So it may not be for one of their existing games.
3871000	3874000	Cast a spell. Throw your phone.
3874000	3882000	And, but you have to yell when you do it. You have to do Avada Kedavra or whatever the thing is they say to kill people. Right?
3882000	3884000	Right, Darsakha? That's what you have to do.
3884000	3888000	I wouldn't want to kill people. I would want to use the septum separa.
3888000	3890000	But you have to throw your phone when you do it.
3890000	3895000	Which would basically just rip people to shreds. They could live through that, but they'd hurt for a while.
3895000	3897000	I'm sorry, was that a little too violent?
3897000	3903000	No, that's fine. So Niantic's been buying some companies, but it's going to be a little while before we know what they do with them.
3903000	3907000	You know what? Microsoft should buy Niantic.
3907000	3908000	Why not?
3908000	3909000	No.
3909000	3917000	Since Microsoft has infinite pockets. That would be great. Yes, Niantic should really be developing games for the Xbox One. That sounds like a great idea.
3917000	3926000	It's a mobile device. Strap it to your body. Somehow have some sort of gas power generator to power the thing. It could be done.
3926000	3927000	It could be done.
3927000	3929000	It's dieselpunk at that point.
3932000	3935000	Anyway, we need to go back a few years, Darsakha.
3936000	3941000	Okay. Well, you know I love some classic games, right?
3941000	3946000	Well, and apparently I didn't realize that y'all had already talked about the Replicade X Centipede.
3946000	3950000	There is a new Kickstarter for Replicade X Tempest.
3950000	3955000	So, is it X or X? I don't know if it's supposed to be.
3955000	3962000	But it's going to be a one-sixth scale machine that is going to be Tempest in all of its beautiful vector glory.
3963000	3968000	And they've just passed their funding goal of $20,000.
3968000	3972000	And so, in fact, they've hit $100,000.
3972000	3979000	If you pledge $90 to this, you'll get the machine, but you can also do higher tiers for more machines.
3979000	3985000	But, you know, I think it's going to be interesting. It's a 3.5 inch LCD screen with LED backlighting.
3985000	3992000	And runs on micro-USB lithium-ion batteries. So, we'll see.
3992000	3996000	I think it's going to be cool. I mean, I wouldn't mind having one.
3996000	4000000	But then again, I also do have an UltraCade in my garage. Just saying.
4000000	4002000	Do you kick it regularly?
4002000	4004000	I do. I hit it with a dart.
4004000	4005000	Oh, good.
4005000	4009000	Ours is technically not like an actual UltraCade, but a Pandora's box.
4009000	4010000	Okay.
4010000	4012000	But it's in an UltraCade cabinet.
4012000	4016000	Yeah. I love the idea of this. This is perfect for me. Like an itty bitty cabinet.
4016000	4020000	I like this idea more than I do the Centipede one.
4020000	4024000	Because I was like, God, that Centipede joystick is going to be so tiny and hard to play.
4024000	4026000	Centipede's rollerball. Trekball.
4026000	4029000	Oh, that's right. It's a Trekball. But, well, maybe that will work okay.
4029000	4034000	I mean, Tempest, that I think would work pretty well with a little dial, even if it's small.
4034000	4036000	Let's be a tiny little nipple.
4036000	4041000	I think it'd be big enough. I mean, probably the screen size and everything would probably be around about,
4041000	4047000	like, what my iPad one is. What's that thing called again?
4047000	4050000	The XCade? No. Is that what it was called?
4050000	4051000	I-Cade.
4051000	4053000	I-Cade. That was it.
4053000	4054000	Oh, you have one of those?
4054000	4057000	I do have an I-Cade. I never use it, but I do have one.
4057000	4058000	It's in the garage.
4058000	4059000	No, that's what we have.
4059000	4061000	Mine is in the garage.
4064000	4070000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SEAL.
4070000	4073000	All right. Well, Loki, what do you have for us?
4073000	4086000	So, going back even further, there was a world record originally held by a guy named Todd Rogers for the game Dragster that was on the Atari.
4086000	4093000	And he also held the world record for having the longest undisputed record in a video game as well.
4093000	4097000	Well, it was undisputed for a reason. It's impossible.
4097000	4109000	So, apparently, after some research, because no one's been able to get close to this, there was a speed runner that created with Eric Omnigamer Coziel.
4109000	4115000	He created a tool assisted run, basically allowing him to create the fastest possible time.
4115000	4121000	And it can only get it down to 5.57 seconds using all the tools available to him.
4121000	4128000	And basically saying even without tools, it would be impossible to get close to that as well.
4128000	4134000	And based on the findings and people testing it, there's just no way to ever hit that time.
4134000	4136000	So, because of that, what happened?
4136000	4138000	Well, a whole bunch of backlash.
4138000	4142000	So, first, all of Todd Rogers...
4142000	4147000	And there's a little bit more drama behind it, too, because I actually did watch a video regarding this Todd Rogers guy.
4147000	4156000	So, apparently, he had a friend at Twin Galaxies who would vet his scores for him despite not really having evidence.
4156000	4158000	And sometimes they wouldn't even really have...
4158000	4159000	Ooh, ouch.
4159000	4162000	You know, it would just basically be submitting stuff without any evidence.
4162000	4166000	And then he claims that there's tapes out there, but they lost the tapes, you know?
4166000	4176000	So, anyways, so not only has he had this taken off of Twin Galaxies, he's been disqualified from the Twin Galaxies scoreboards altogether.
4176000	4179000	So, he's had all of his records removed from the database.
4179000	4189000	And the Guinness Book World Records has also removed his two records from their books or database as well.
4189000	4195000	So, he no longer holds the world record for Dragster and he no longer holds the world longest standing video game record.
4195000	4200000	Maybe he could have one, though, for the longest standing video game scam.
4201000	4204000	He's still claiming that he's innocent, but he says,
4204000	4210000	Although I disagree with their decision, I must applaud them for their strong stance on the matter of cheating.
4210000	4214000	While I do maintain that Twin Galaxies is wrong in my particular case,
4214000	4226000	if the investigation into my scores and subsequent banning can serve as a catalyst to clean the database of questionable scores and facilitate methods to catch further cheaters, this is a positive thing.
4226000	4228000	He's fucking guilty. He knows it.
4230000	4238000	Interesting. Now, did you hear, I know it's not in the show role, but there was a very, very similar thing this week that involved Billy Mitchell and Donkey Kong.
4238000	4240000	Oh, the fuck did he do this time?
4240000	4252000	That basically somebody was able to prove, and I think it's by the way the screens draw, that some of his scores, the ones that were above a million, were actually done on MAME emulators.
4252000	4256000	They were not done on an actual cabinet.
4256000	4261000	But I believe he still holds a high score. It's not like, but here's the difference.
4261000	4268000	We know Billy Mitchell is capable because one of the scores he got in front of like a live audience at a expo sort of thing.
4268000	4273000	So I think it's very different. And I don't want to necessarily lump these two stories together.
4273000	4274000	Right.
4274000	4283000	But it and for all we know, for all we know, Billy Mitchell may not have known that these machines he was playing on were emulated, but he might have known.
4283000	4286000	We should just go back to selling his sauce.
4286000	4291000	Did you know I finally got to meet him all these years? He was at Dragon Con. He's a nice guy.
4291000	4299000	I would give him the benefit of the doubt because at least it seems like he has the skills to do it. This guy, he's never like, you know, shown that he can do this again.
4299000	4306000	And that's the clear difference I wanted to make is that there is like, okay, there is another really good gaming documentary.
4306000	4312000	I know we've talked about on the show before, not the King of Kong, which we know is good, but on Netflix, it was man versus snake.
4312000	4315000	I think it was called. Have you seen that one? No, it's pretty good.
4315000	4322000	And it's another like back and forth sort of score thing. And it turns out, you know, well, I don't know if I should spoil it, but I'll just say this.
4322000	4326000	The whole emulator angle comes into play in that.
4326000	4331000	And I think there's a question of and it just kind of depends on who you want to believe and what you want to believe.
4331000	4335000	Did the guy know that or not when he was getting the score?
4335000	4342000	And so I think, you know, especially if it took, I mean, Billy Mitchell's that, that, that King of Kong is like fucking 10 years old. Right?
4342000	4351000	So like if it's gone unnoticed this long that he's been getting scores, maybe he didn't even realize that these machines were emulators.
4351000	4356000	He owned a machine. Like he's got to own a machine. I would hope so. And I would assume that.
4356000	4362000	So does the other guy. He owns his own machine and, uh, but his, I think was a reconversion.
4362000	4367000	His had been converted to one thing and he had to convert it back. Yeah. It's so hard to know these days too.
4367000	4374000	What I could go walk out by a donkey Kong machine, bring it home and come to find out it's, it's been overclocked.
4374000	4382000	It's just like, what was it? The black tiger. There was a thing with black tigers back when I was actually trying to compete in that stupid, uh, ready player one contest.
4382000	4385000	They had one of the games you had to break the record on was black tiger.
4385000	4391000	And I think it's impossible because if I remember correctly, it was, there's like a version of the game, like the Japanese game.
4391000	4395000	That's a totally different game or something like that. Um, scores differently the way it's played.
4395000	4406000	And, but it, the record was on very specific version of the game and it's not like either not possible or not easy to get that type of score on that.
4406000	4414000	Uh, Dungeon Buster in chat says the hardware arcade version of donkey Kong does a windows wipe refresh from one side of the screen to the other.
4414000	4419000	But under maim, it renders the screen in chunks from the evidence that I saw. And that's what was seen. Yeah. That's how they figured it out.
4419000	4426000	They had to slow the video way the fuck down to see how it was loading and they realized it does not load.
4426000	4434000	I mean, that is a, that's a pretty impressive thing to notice. You know what I mean? That's, you know, that, that person is very good at Where's Waldo books, I'm sure.
4434000	4436000	Or as a designer.
4436000	4445000	Perhaps, perhaps. Anyway, so anyway, two, two different classic gaming controversies, but I thought the Billy Mitchell thing was worthy of bringing up right there.
4445000	4453000	And also, you know, that, that he did, uh, perform, sorry, I guess some of these microphones on the Fritz. I don't know what that was.
4453000	4458000	Uh, I just put my down. I apologize for the loud.
4458000	4465000	Okay. Yeah. Sorry. My mic is dying. Okay. We're going to have to, sorry. I apologize for the audio, but that is, I'll just leave it on the boobs.
4465000	4471000	Yes. That is what happens. The cords coming out of it is the cord coming out. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm going to make sure you're muted.
4471000	4477000	So go ahead and do what you need to do to try to plug that back in. And. Oh, sorry.
4477000	4483000	The casing was coming off the connector, like the cover of the strain relief. Okay. So hopefully, hopefully that'll be a little better. All right.
4483000	4491000	Anyways, I was going to say he said he claims that he did this, the 5.5, one run for employees of Activision during the eighties.
4491000	4502000	Um, the people, you know, was one of the developers of the game said that they remember him doing the run, but they don't remember that score in particular, but they just remember that he was really good at the game.
4502000	4513000	So I don't know. I think if you don't, if you can't come up with evidence showing that you did this, it's just, he knows if he, he cheated or not.
4513000	4521000	I mean, I don't know. Well, what's he going to do is swear on a stack of Bibles. Like, you know, it's, you got to have the receipt. It wasn't like I'd give it to him.
4521000	4527000	Like I give him the benefit of doubt if it was just this one game, but there's a lot of other games that he has impossible scores on. Like there's a game.
4527000	4537000	He had a score that was impossible to get because it increments by fives and it was like ended with a seven. It's like, okay, that doesn't, that can't happen.
4537000	4545000	All right. Well, moving on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week here on OLR this week, it has to do with a somewhat classic game.
4545000	4561000	It's not 10 years old at this point, but it's a few years old. Rock Band Network. Rock Band Network songs on all legacy consoles, including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii are no longer going to be available for purchase via Rock Band beginning later this month.
4561000	4573000	You can continue to play previously purchased songs, but, yeah, the delisting is going to be taken down. This has to do with community released DLC and not anything that's harmonics released DLC.
4573000	4584000	So, yeah, that's, that's too bad, but I guess I'm sure this has to do with like probably some type of like five-year license window or something. We've got to be looking at the end of that right about now.
4585000	4591000	Rock Band Network was a, um, or the, the, the spinoff game for Rock Band was really cool.
4591000	4595000	Um, the like music, the rhythm game?
4595000	4597000	Yeah. The, you know, the one that was basically like frequency.
4597000	4603000	Yeah. Rock Band Live Party. I don't remember what it's called.
4604000	4613000	I wish that one would come back. So anyway, uh, get, get those songs before they start, uh, pulling them all down. It's kind of, kind of too bad. I hope that's not the beginning of the end of Rock Band though. That'd be sad.
4613000	4620000	But it's probably just a licensing thing or just some type of like the agreement that people were signing going into that or something like that.
4620000	4626000	All right. Well, let's, let's go back to a simpler time when, uh, games were on cartridges, so they lasted forever.
4626000	4628000	Yes.
4628000	4632000	Or maybe CDs. I think maybe this week's pick. Uh, Dark Soccer.
4632000	4634000	No, this one was not CD. This was cartridge.
4634000	4644000	Well, then we're going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that Jamie thinks, Hey, Bratz, blow on this cartridge and check this out. What's the classic game of the week?
4644000	4652000	In the U S it was called Sky Shark. It also was released under the name Flying Shark. Um, he shows on me.
4652000	4660000	Um, real quick. I'm sorry. Do you, do you know why I thought it was CD? Cause at first I thought it was sewer shark. Whoops.
4662000	4669000	By the way, this music to this day is one of my favorite pieces of gaming music and it was not in the arcade.
4669000	4677000	This is one of the few games that a better soundtrack on the Nintendo entertainment system than it did in the arcade.
4677000	4685000	But yes, I have a story about this game too. So Sky Shark, um, came out in 1987.
4685000	4703000	Um, it's a vertical scrolling shooter game that was developed by Toaplan. Um, and if I am right, I believe that Toaplan also did the, uh, uh, much, much, uh, lauded, um, crap, no I forgot what it was.
4703000	4712000	Trekkston. Trekkston's pretty fun, but we'll go to that. They also did like Tiger Heli, like Slap Fight, Rally Bike, Twin Cobra.
4712000	4723000	So, but anyway, um, Sky Shark also had a sequel in 1989 called Fire Shark. Um, the game was published by Taito in Japan.
4723000	4730000	By Electricoin in the U.S. I'm sorry, in the U.K. and by Romstar in North America.
4730000	4739000	So basically it's, it's almost like any, I guess, other vertical, um, scrolling shooter. Um, but I like this one because you play in a biplane.
4739000	4748000	Um, and it's, you know, very kinda war, you know, theme instead of just, oh, future shooting or pew pew with crazy stuff.
4748000	4757000	It had, like, quite a bit more realism with it, but you also did, of course, have, you know, your bonuses that you can get from shooting down planes.
4757000	4770000	You get power-ups, and, um, it starts and ends on a runway, so that's actually kinda something I think is cool, just that at each stage isn't just, okay, you float in the air for a little while, okay, next stage.
4770000	4782000	You land your plane, get your score, and you move on. Um, your bombs, um, multiply every three thousand points that you get, and, but you start off with three bombs at the start of each stage.
4782000	4796000	Um, and it has five stages and then loops back to stage two indefinitely. Um, but again, the, this just had, like, I don't know what it was about those Toaplan arcade games during this time,
4797000	4813000	but, like, the music just wasn't always great, you know, and this, though, bringing it to the home version, it had great music. It was super good, you know, and with this game, I was, like, at the time, you know, I was like, I hate war games.
4813000	4822000	I hate, I mean, my dad almost bought me MagMax, okay, and MagMax is terrible. My sister loved MagMax for some reason.
4822000	4836000	So, um, when he got me my NES, um, he got me SkyShark, and I ended up freakin' loving this game.
4836000	4851000	And, I mean, to this day, this is probably on my list of favorite shooters. Like, Guardian Legend would be up there, you know, at least in the vertical realm, this one is on my list.
4851000	4859000	You know, I'd also would add, like, even though it's not only vertical, I'd add, like, Salamander to my list of favorite verticals.
4859000	4862000	When I think of bi-playing games, I think of, like, 1942.
4862000	4869000	I love 1942. Um, but this, I have a softer spot in my heart for this game than for 1942.
4869000	4871000	I have to be honest, I've never played it.
4871000	4874000	Well, it did come out on the Commodore 64, Rob.
4874000	4876000	What? And I still missed it.
4876000	4883000	It did. It was also, I like this music, too. The game just had great music. I mean, it was awesome.
4883000	4889000	But, um, it came out on Amiga, for MS-DOS, the ZX Spectrum, so you know, it looked like crap.
4889000	4895000	Um, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, the X68000, and the FM Towns.
4895000	4907000	And, of course, the NES. Now, the NES had, um, it was actually the first music, uh, composition by Tim Follin.
4907000	4913000	And, let me see if I can find you some of the other stuff he did, because, I mean, he did some really just awesome game music.
4913000	4919000	But, um, he did, let's see...
4921000	4923000	Thanks for bearing with me.
4923000	4926000	Did a whole bunch of Mega Drive games.
4926000	4933000	Uh, did, uh, the Starsky and Hutch soundtrack for the games.
4933000	4936000	You know, so, just lots of stuff.
4936000	4942000	Uh, he did some of the retooling for Ghouls and Ghosts on the Amiga. He did Solstice.
4942000	4946000	You know, so, really, really good sound designer.
4946000	4951000	Um, but yeah, this game is seriously one of my favorites.
4951000	4958000	But one thing of note, the NES port is a North American exclusive.
4958000	4959000	Oh, interesting.
4959000	4962000	This did not come out in Japan.
4962000	4971000	Well, but they had FM Towns and MSX and Europe had ZX, so they had, none of that was stuff we were gonna get, so...
4971000	4978000	But, to this day, mostly because of the music, I would consider this one of the superior home releases.
4978000	4979000	Fair enough.
4979000	4986000	It's so funny, because I know you probably didn't listen to last week's show, but I did a sub out for Classic Game, as I usually do, when I know you're not gonna be here.
4986000	4993000	And I picked a game, and I did the Commodore 64 version based on the music, which is Bomb Jack. I don't know if you saw, but that was the game I picked last week.
4993000	4994000	Bomb Jack's a fun game.
4994000	5003000	Yeah, but the Commodore 64 version specifically had a very memorable soundtrack, because they actually took, like, an 80's synth song and, like, redid it with the Commodore 64's SID chip.
5003000	5007000	Anyway, not to derail, but I just thought it was funny that our picks have that in common.
5007000	5013000	Yeah, but I mean, you can't listen to this and say, oh, that sucks. This is good, engaging music.
5013000	5015000	Quality chip tune.
5015000	5019000	But you remember we were talking earlier about how it's part, sometimes, the music that makes the game.
5019000	5020000	Yeah.
5020000	5040000	I've played the arcade Flying Shark. In fact, at California Extreme, they had a sit-down table of the Japanese version, and I played it, but the music is what will make me play the Nintendo version over the arcade. Every time.
5040000	5041000	Alright.
5041000	5045000	I like how you brought that full circle. Let's listen to a little more of the soundtrack here to take us out.
5045000	5053000	Sky Shark, classic of the week.
5053000	5055000	I like that you brought that full circle, Dark Soccer.
5055000	5061000	Not intentionally, but it was getting, the Stage 3 music is my favorite music in the game.
5061000	5068000	Got it stuck in my head. I was like, have I done Sky Shark? I haven't done Sky Shark! This is happening.
5068000	5077000	Alright. We're going to take a quick break. We have plenty more show to come. We're going to talk about, of course, release dates. We actually have a lot of emails tonight, so Dark Soccer is going to get ready for that.
5077000	5084000	We're going to talk about movies based on video games, and we'll talk about porn. Because, you know, we always find a way to work that in.
5084000	5089000	All this and more on Orange Lounge Radio when we come back, right after this.
5089000	5107000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 717 already in progress for this February 4th of 2018. Hope you all are having a good night so far.
5107000	5113000	We got plenty more news to cover and things like that, so let's just jump right into some rapid fire news with Loki.
5114000	5131000	Alright, so this is interesting, but apparently this is canon now. Tom Hall and John Romero, they had went to Twitter, I guess, to talk about the official canon of B.J. Blackwitz.
5131000	5142000	And apparently, so here's how it goes. So, B.J. Blackwitz is Commander Keen's grandfather. And Commander Keen is, I guess, the Doomguy's father.
5142000	5152000	So, that means B.J. Blackwitz is Doomguy's great-grandfather. Interesting, I guess. It all ties together.
5153000	5160000	What a small world we live in. What a coincidence. What a bunch of games where the plot really doesn't matter.
5160000	5164000	Pretty much. Where does Duke Nukem have to fall into this?
5164000	5169000	Cousin. Godparent. Ruiner of lives.
5169000	5170000	Brother-in-law.
5170000	5172000	I don't know, brother-in-law. Wife.
5173000	5184000	Now, this is also something that we probably thought we'd never see, but what happens when you have a game that's on the Nintendo platform that's made by a Microsoft company?
5184000	5195000	Well, you get skins from Minecraft that are with Master Chief and the Gears of War folks and Halo and, you know, Banjo-Kazooie and other stuff.
5195000	5202000	So, yes, now you can play as Master Chief in the Mario-themed skinned world on the Nintendo Switch.
5202000	5209000	Okay, that is kind of neat that, you know, Nintendo and Microsoft are playing along together. That is kind of cool. I like that.
5209000	5219000	So, that's available now as a skin pack. Along with that, if you're not necessarily a fan of Microsoft stuff, you can get Moana, which is made by Disney.
5219000	5222000	Another company that Microsoft should purchase.
5222000	5224000	Why not?
5224000	5226000	And then they could just do, like, you know.
5226000	5227000	They could just make all the Marvel games.
5227000	5228000	That's right.
5228000	5229000	And all the Star Wars games.
5229000	5233000	They could do theme park rides. You know, they could do a Halo roller coaster at Disneyland.
5233000	5242000	Why not? Why not? Anyway, let's move on to some other news. Let's talk about some controversy. There's unfortunately a lot of it going on right now.
5242000	5251000	And this one has to do with the GDC and a lifetime achievement award. I guess actually it's, what do they call it? I don't think they call it the lifetime achievement award.
5251000	5264000	They call it a pioneer award. And they have actually retracted. They were going to offer it to Nolan Bushnell, who of course, you know, founded Atari and did a lot with the old school days of gaming.
5264000	5273000	But they've actually retracted the offer because essentially it came to light about some of the fraternity-like culture at Atari that was in the early days.
5273000	5280000	Which, as you know, there's a high visibility on how women are treated in a lot of different industries right now, most notably Hollywood.
5280000	5288000	But obviously there's been a lot of that that's come back on games. And so, you know, there's been a lot of questions about how women were treated in some of the early days of Atari.
5288000	5301000	So, anyhow, the official statement from the GDC said, the Game Developers Choice Awards Advisory Committee, who vote on the special award winners for each show, have made the decision not to give out a pioneer award for this year's event, following additional feedback from the community.
5301000	5310000	They believe their pick should reflect the values of today's game industry and will dedicate this year's award to honor the pioneering and unheard voices of the past.
5310000	5314000	So, you know, most probably politically correct turnaround they could do.
5314000	5327000	Nolan Bushnell, not really putting up a fight over it or anything, in a statement response on Twitter, said, I applaud the GDC for ensuring that their institution reflects what is right, specifically with regards to how people should be treated in the workplace.
5327000	5335000	If my personal actions or the actions of anyone who ever worked with me offended or caused pain to anyone at our companies, then I apologize without reservation.
5335000	5347000	So at least, you know, he's saying the right thing in this particular scenario, so hopefully we can focus on making the future better, because we can't fix what's happened in the past.
5347000	5349000	We can only take history and learn from it.
5350000	5357000	Hopefully people still aren't doing cocaine while they make games. I mean, you know, there was a lot that was going on in the old days. Anyway.
5357000	5360000	How else do you expect them to stay awake and not feel anything?
5360000	5370000	How else do you think E.T. was done in six weeks? Jesus. Anyway, not that it's right, but I'm just saying, there's definitely a different gaming culture back then and maybe one that we don't need to continue perpetuating.
5370000	5376000	Anyhow, let's talk about Monster Hunter, because I know a ton of people are playing the new one, Monster Hunter World.
5376000	5385000	None of us talked about it at the top of the show. I should say, I watched Shane play it, my buddy Shane, through the magic of PlayStation 4 SharePlay.
5385000	5388000	I watched him play a little bit of it, because I wanted to see if it was something I'd be into.
5388000	5399000	And I don't know, you guys. I wasn't super into, like, the combat and stuff, but I know people that are super into it, so cool. You know what? If you're into it, awesome.
5399000	5412000	But, if you are still playing some of the older Monster Hunter games, specifically Monster Hunter Frontier Z, the online service will be ending on the Xbox 360 and the Wii U, in Japan anyway, on August 1st.
5412000	5414000	I don't even think these games are still in.
5414000	5416000	Well, it was on the Xbox 360 in Japan.
5416000	5419000	Right? I don't even think these games were running in the U.S.
5419000	5421000	The company at Microsoft had to buy for that to happen.
5422000	5428000	So yeah, those games are going to be basically no longer online, which is going to kill a lot of the functionality of them.
5428000	5432000	But, at least there is a new Monster Hunter game I think most people have moved on to.
5432000	5437000	And yeah, like you said, Xbox 360 in Japan, and even the Wii U.
5437000	5442000	You know, we talked last week, they've now officially sold more Switches than Wii U's in Japan.
5442000	5444000	So, kind of interesting. Anyway.
5444000	5452000	So, there you go. No more Monster Hunter Frontier Z online, but I'm sure all the fans have moved on to world at this point anyway.
5452000	5454000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5454000	5455000	Some stuff.
5455000	5465000	There are, well, okay. We gave Nintendo shit over the handling of the NES Classic and the SNES Classic.
5466000	5473000	Well, the president of Nintendo confirmed that it will bring back the NES Classic this year and sell it alongside the SNES Classic.
5483000	5485000	I have yet to see these in stores.
5485000	5488000	I've seen one while someone was buying it.
5488000	5492000	I saw a Super Nintendo Classic. I don't remember where, but I've seen them on the shelf.
5492000	5494000	I love mine. It's so adorable.
5494000	5497000	I look every time I'm in a store. Not that I'm going to buy one, but I just look.
5497000	5499000	You just want to know that if you wanted one, you could.
5499000	5500000	Yeah.
5500000	5504000	I still want a Famicom Mini, because it's cute.
5504000	5509000	Well, this might be your chance. I mean, if the NES Classes are coming back, I would assume the Famicom ones are coming back.
5509000	5511000	I know it had some different games on it. I'd have to look it up again.
5511000	5521000	It did. I think it had, like, The Legend of Kage was on it, and some other games that, you know, in exchange, there's, I think, one of the other Final Fantasy games was on it instead of the first one.
5521000	5522000	Yeah.
5522000	5523000	The Final Fantasy III is on it in Japan.
5523000	5525000	Yeah, but I don't read well enough to play it, so.
5525000	5529000	Yeah. That's the problem, is that some of those games that got subbed out, I'm not going to understand.
5529000	5532000	Like, you should have seen when I was trying to play Dobutsu no Mori.
5532000	5533000	Mm-hmm.
5533000	5541000	Oh, my God. I mean, there was hardly any kanji in it, but I was still like, syntax, syntax, what word is this? I give up. So, yeah. Okay.
5541000	5544000	I'd have to use that Google picture thing that on my picture.
5544000	5547000	Well, I'd have to use it now, but that didn't exist when I was playing it.
5547000	5548000	You know when I was-
5548000	5549000	That is handy. Yeah.
5549000	5550000	Yeah, it is handy for that stuff.
5550000	5560000	So, and then this one is also sad and disgusting because I have gone on public saying, gone on public, saying publicly that pedophiles are garbage.
5560000	5563000	They're garbage. The ultimate of garbage.
5563000	5565000	Don't think you're going to find anyone that disagrees with you there.
5565000	5572000	Well, some people that may have vote for certain, was it governors or senators in certain states?
5572000	5573000	Touché.
5573000	5574000	The president.
5574000	5575000	Yeah.
5575000	5576000	Touché.
5576000	5586000	Anyway, Jess Cliffe, who is the co-creator of Counter Strike, was arrested for sexual exploitation of a child.
5586000	5601000	Yes, also, you know, designer at Valve was booked on this past Thursday for, didn't say exactly if it was a child harmed or if it was child pornography or something like that.
5601000	5612000	But he was arrested at 1 17 a.m. and has a bail hearing on, I guess it was Friday this past then after that.
5612000	5619000	But, I mean, he was arrested in Seattle for disgusting behavior.
5619000	5622000	So, I'm sure we'll find out more.
5622000	5629000	But just hearing that, it turns my stomach. It's the worst.
5629000	5636000	Let me ask a difficult question, and I don't particularly like these topics because I try to talk about how games are a good thing.
5636000	5642000	And these stories, they're not really about games, but they are about the people in the industry.
5642000	5645000	Yeah, these people contributed to gaming culture.
5645000	5650000	But let me ask this difficult question. Can you still play Counter Strike after this?
5650000	5652000	Well, I don't like Counter Strike anyway.
5652000	5656000	Let's say it was something you did like.
5657000	5662000	Let's say it was Animal Crossing. Would you still be able to play Animal Crossing?
5662000	5665000	I would for the sake of the other people that worked on it.
5665000	5667000	I think that's a fair perspective. Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at, too.
5667000	5672000	It's much more than just one guy that did this, and there's, you know, there's gonna be assholes at every company.
5672000	5677000	And I don't think it's fair to throw the company under the bus for what one person did.
5677000	5680000	Because I've been there personally, and I don't like it.
5680000	5682000	Which is not the situation, obviously.
5682000	5690000	But I mean, if it was one designer that worked on the whole game, and that designer, you know, raped a ten-year-old,
5690000	5693000	it would soil the game for me.
5693000	5700000	I mean, that's why there's just certain bands I can't listen to without just having my stomach twist a little bit,
5700000	5703000	or why I have trouble watching any of Joss Whedon's stuff anymore.
5703000	5711000	Well, speaking of movies, you know, there was a lot that came out about Uma Thurman and Quentin Tarantino over this past weekend.
5711000	5718000	And it kind of ruins Kill Bill, which is like one of the greatest movies.
5718000	5724000	But then when you hear about, like, how Quentin Tarantino really—and if you guys haven't, like, read about it,
5724000	5730000	you know, basically Tarantino kind of put Uma Thurman's life at risk driving this car in Mexico,
5730000	5737000	damn near killed her, over, you know, this shot, and was kind of—I don't know, it didn't seem like he really handled it in a tactful way.
5737000	5743000	And meanwhile, all this Weinstein garbage was going on, which just complicates the situation,
5743000	5746000	because one could argue, was Tarantino complicit in that or not?
5746000	5752000	I'm not going to get into that right now, but the point is, you know, after hearing all that, it's kind of hard to go back and watch Kill Bill,
5752000	5757000	but then you have to kind of realize, oh, but there were, like, hundreds of other people involved in the making of these movies.
5757000	5765000	But at the same time, Hollywood's celebrity culture leads us to go, but this is an Uma Thurman and Quentin Tarantino movie.
5765000	5767000	I mean, despite the fact that, you know—
5767000	5769000	I would watch it for her.
5769000	5772000	Yeah, but have you noticed the two of them never worked together again after that?
5772000	5773000	I did.
5773000	5780000	I think this puts a definitive note—you know, people always wonder, is there going to be a part three where she takes on the daughter of—
5780000	5788000	He talked about doing one, you know, he wanted to do another one with her where the little girl came back and was hunting down Beatrix.
5788000	5791000	But I don't think that's going to happen.
5791000	5793000	Not without maybe a different casting.
5793000	5797000	Or without a lot of talking.
5797000	5798000	Ass-kissing.
5798000	5802000	A lot of talking. A lot of—yeah, I don't even know what else to call it.
5802000	5805000	Anyway, I don't mean to deviate too much, but it's just one of those—
5805000	5811000	and I think maybe in some ways this makes me very glad that we don't have a celebrity culture in gaming,
5811000	5816000	because I am able to say, well, Counter-Strike, I mean, this guy sucks, period.
5816000	5818000	There's no arguing with that.
5818000	5822000	But Counter-Strike's not ruined, because there were tons of other people that pitched in with that game.
5822000	5827000	There, though, you call it celebrity culture, but really it's business culture.
5827000	5829000	And it does exist in video gaming.
5829000	5832000	What do you mean? Can you elaborate?
5832000	5840000	A lot of—well, not just in the celebrity world, but in terms of business decisions, in terms of lead programming,
5840000	5842000	has to do a lot with networking.
5843000	5851000	And there are—especially in, say, voice acting, in stage acting, in anything,
5851000	5856000	but also in the tech industry, there is a lot of it's who you fucking know.
5856000	5857000	Oh, sure.
5857000	5862000	And if someone wants to do you a favor, you have to do them a favor.
5862000	5867000	And especially—it's really difficult, especially for women.
5867000	5872000	We are—especially that's why there's a big push on STEM.
5872000	5879000	But we tend to still get kind of shafted in these things, unless there's a little bit more incentive.
5879000	5885000	I guess my point is that it's more like there's not the same name stuff that goes into video games.
5885000	5886000	Now, granted, there's some.
5886000	5892000	There's Miyamoto, there's Cliffy B, there's some developers that kind of have that.
5892000	5894000	For better or for worse, right?
5894000	5898000	There's also a guy that did Fable. Peter Molyneux.
5898000	5901000	There's also these guys too, for better or for worse.
5901000	5903000	But I feel like it's not like it is in movies.
5903000	5908000	In movies, sometimes the only reason you go to see a movie is because of who's in it.
5908000	5909000	You know what I mean?
5909000	5911000	Well, Cher, right.
5911000	5913000	Yeah, we were talking just before the show.
5913000	5917000	The only reason Mamma Mia 2 is acceptable is because Cher is going to sing for them.
5917000	5920000	I didn't even see the last one, so I'm going to see this one because of Cher.
5920000	5921000	Exactly.
5921000	5923000	Well, because she is a goddess.
5923000	5924000	Oh, bitch.
5924000	5928000	That was a little bit more Chad and a little less Cher.
5928000	5929000	I tried.
5929000	5934000	Somehow I got the picture in my head of Mr. Ed singing that.
5934000	5938000	Oh, bitch, it's just a sprain.
5938000	5940000	That's what Cher is going to sound like in retirement home.
5940000	5943000	But you know her tweets also read like her voice.
5943000	5944000	I fucking love.
5944000	5946000	Cher on Twitter is a blessing.
5946000	5947000	It is a blessing.
5947000	5951000	It is a privilege to be able to read this divine message from her.
5951000	5955000	There are two things I am so thankful for in this world, and I wouldn't be able to live without it.
5955000	5958000	Cher on Twitter and Falafel.
5958000	5960000	You went to Pita Kitchen.
5960000	5961000	I did go to Pita Kitchen.
5961000	5962000	Bitch.
5962000	5963000	No.
5963000	5965000	You also look closer than I do.
5965000	5968000	By the way, AkumaJP and Chad is yelling out Kojima.
5968000	5969000	Kojima, absolutely.
5969000	5970000	Yes, of course.
5970000	5971000	Absolutely a celebrity name.
5971000	5972000	But I mean.
5972000	5973000	Sorry.
5973000	5974000	Sorry.
5974000	5975000	I don't mean to cut you off.
5975000	5979000	But bringing that since you mentioned Kojima, bringing that celebrity culture into kind
5979000	5984000	of Death Stranding a little bit with the Norman Reedus, with the Guillermo del Toro and,
5984000	5987000	you know, Mads, Mick and Hannibal, whatever his name is.
5987000	5994000	But so you get a lot more now of that crossover in video games and in the celebrity thing.
5994000	5996000	Those names are big names.
5996000	6000000	Their likenesses are what's selling, you know.
6000000	6007000	I mean, you know, they've even said in some cases not getting licensed to, you know, someone's appearance.
6007000	6008000	Like that hurt.
6008000	6016000	From what I remember reading, it hurt the initial sales of the Back to the Future pinball table because Michael J. Fox wouldn't license his likeness to it.
6016000	6020000	You know, I mean, that's just an example.
6020000	6026000	But I mean, I think that the same sort of behind the scenes things happen in any industry.
6026000	6034000	And so people are going to talk, people are going to network amongst themselves and someone will go, oh, don't hire this person.
6034000	6038000	They did this or they're like that, you know, wink, wink.
6038000	6040000	You know, that does still happen.
6040000	6044000	You know, it is who you know and what people are saying about you.
6044000	6052000	Well, you know, we're in a very interesting shift right now in culture in general with all these movements that are going on.
6052000	6056000	So it's just going to be very interesting to see what gaming looks like five years from now.
6056000	6061000	Accountability is happening and it's past fucking time for it.
6062000	6065000	Hold them accountable. Throw out the garbage.
6065000	6067000	All right.
6067000	6070000	Let's move on. We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6070000	6073000	I didn't mean for rapid fire news to take so long, but you know what?
6073000	6076000	Sometimes sometimes you got to dive deep into a topic.
6076000	6079000	Let's go around the world and check out the U.S. Loki.
6079000	6084000	Yes. So we have a game called Marooners coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6084000	6088000	Shadow of the Colossus coming out on PlayStation 4 on PC.
6089000	6093000	We've got Civ 6 Rise and Fall that's coming out.
6093000	6095000	Octogeddon on PC.
6095000	6099000	Rust looks like it's coming out of early access on PC, Mac and Linux.
6099000	6104000	Dragon Quest Builders on Nintendo Switch.
6104000	6109000	The Seven Deadly Sins Knights of Britannia on PlayStation 4.
6109000	6115000	And finally, Under Night In-Birth EXE Late State.
6116000	6118000	What the hell is that?
6118000	6121000	Late something. It's got to be a Japanese game.
6121000	6125000	PlayStation 3, 4 and Vita. That's it.
6125000	6128000	All right. We got some Japanese releases this week. Quite a few of them.
6128000	6133000	Shin Sangoku Musou 8 comes out in Japan on PlayStation 4 this week.
6133000	6137000	As well as Wanda 2 Kyozu comes out this week.
6137000	6142000	Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet and Dragon's Crown Pro.
6142000	6145000	That's the one with the boobs.
6145000	6148000	I actually kind of want to play this on PlayStation.
6148000	6151000	Sometimes things are so over the top they're funny.
6151000	6154000	It's like a John Waters movie, right? John Waters of games.
6154000	6158000	Let's see what else we have. Under Night In-Birth EXE Late.
6158000	6159000	That whole thing is also...
6159000	6161000	Yeah, I think it's Late or Latest.
6161000	6163000	That's what it's supposed to be.
6163000	6166000	And then it's a busy week in Japan this week.
6166000	6168000	Actually, no. I think that's it on PlayStation 4.
6168000	6171000	I wanted to see what Shin Sangoku Musou was.
6171000	6172000	That's the Dynasty Warriors.
6172000	6174000	Is that Dynasty Warriors 8? Oh, it sure is.
6174000	6176000	I think it's Dynasty Warriors 9.
6176000	6180000	Wait, does...Sangoku is like Three Kingdoms?
6180000	6182000	Is there a Romance of the Three Kingdoms?
6182000	6183000	I keep forgetting that.
6183000	6185000	I only thought it was Dynasty Warriors because that's next week.
6185000	6186000	You have Dynasty Warriors 9, so...
6186000	6189000	Got it. All right. So, lots of that.
6189000	6191000	Nothing on the Vita this week.
6191000	6193000	Okay, I was right. IkumaJP said I was right.
6193000	6195000	Yay, okay.
6195000	6199000	It's nice. I'm glad you're able to listen this week, IkumaJP.
6199000	6202000	I know you've been very busy lately, so it's always nice to have you here
6202000	6207000	when we really, really badly misrepresent what's going on in Japan.
6207000	6209000	I don't mind being corrected. I want to get it right.
6209000	6213000	On Nintendo Switch in Japan this week, we have Cave Story Plus
6213000	6217000	gets its Japanese release, as well as Gal Metal comes out in Japan.
6217000	6218000	That sounds cool.
6218000	6221000	On the Switch. And then on the 3DS, nothing.
6221000	6224000	3DS, I think, is somewhat slowing down,
6224000	6228000	although we have a Radiant Historia chronology coming out in the coming week.
6228000	6230000	How about the UK, DarkSocker?
6230000	6232000	I wish we'd get an Animal Crossing on Switch.
6232000	6235000	Cross your fingers and your toes. There's a lot of people with you.
6235000	6240000	Right. On the 6th, we have Civ VI Rise and Fall for PC.
6240000	6243000	Well, I know that makes you happy.
6243000	6244000	Yay.
6244000	6247000	On the 7th, Shadow of the Colossus for PS4.
6247000	6252000	And Atomic Rungun Jumpgun on Switch. That's a fun name.
6252000	6257000	And then the 12th is Crossing Souls for PS4.
6257000	6262000	All right. We are going to get back into some news after we dive into the mailbag.
6262000	6263000	It's sticky.
6263000	6266000	Yeah, there's a lot in there tonight. I think there's like three emails from one person.
6266000	6270000	No, there's like four. Five, actually. And three of them are from the same person.
6270000	6272000	All right. Well, we're going to get into the mailbag tonight.
6272000	6275000	But you know what? I'm happy because we've gone like two or three weeks
6275000	6277000	where we had no emails. So I'm not going to go.
6277000	6279000	We're making up for it tonight, DarkSockra.
6279000	6283000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send an email
6283000	6286000	to get DarkSockra's mailbag all sticky.
6286000	6287000	Yeah.
6287000	6291000	All right. Dive into the mailbag and pull some emails out for us, Jamie.
6291000	6296000	I apologize for contributing to or failing to contribute to your recent lack of content in
6296000	6299000	AKA he said e-mailbag. It's just mailbag.
6299000	6302000	Branding. Branding is important. Mailbag.
6302000	6307000	I'll just say that I, over the Christmas slash winter holiday stale on, stale?
6307000	6312000	Sale on Steam, decided to finally check out the free-to-play Smash Brothers style
6312000	6315000	fighter brawl holla. I'm still generally enjoying it.
6315000	6320000	And rather than play than pay the $20 or 15 when on sale to unlock all 37
6320000	6323000	characters, I'm just using the in-game coins from daily logins,
6323000	6327000	daily missions to use certain characters play and leveling up to buy them
6327000	6331000	individually and we'll get more used to their relatively unique mechanics.
6331000	6335000	I might eventually support it with some cosmetics.
6335000	6339000	This is definitely not on anyone's game of the year. It's intentionally derivative.
6340000	6345000	The characters aren't as distinctly different as the actual cast of Smash Brothers.
6345000	6349000	Items are few and besides the central weapons, mechanics largely ineffective.
6349000	6355000	And some of the signature moves, some of the signature moves central, wait,
6355000	6357000	I can't. All right.
6357000	6362000	And some of the signature move collision detection leaves me shaking my head.
6362000	6365000	But overall, I'm very much having fun with the game for what it is.
6365000	6370000	I'm still useless at ranked one versus one as one would expect of me.
6370000	6374000	This comes from Robert M. I had not heard of this game.
6374000	6376000	I'm actually I have the steam app open on my phone.
6376000	6381000	I'm looking at it now to put it in my queue because I like free to play and I
6381000	6386000	like Smash Brothers. I mean, he kind of says it's not going to, you know,
6386000	6389000	change the world, but it looks it looks cute from these screenshots.
6389000	6393000	I'll check it out. Next email. Yes, please. Hey, guys.
6393000	6397000	I think it's been a while, as in a couple of years since I sent a message.
6397000	6400000	But I just heard last Sunday's classic game of the week, Bomb Jack.
6400000	6404000	Hearing the Commodore 64 soundtrack for the first time in years brought back so
6404000	6408000	many memories. I played that game to death on both the Commodore 64 and in our
6408000	6414000	local arcade. One thing about the game that was was that there was no real end.
6414000	6417000	So long as you didn't lose all of your lives, it would just keep going.
6417000	6421000	We had a few guys at the local arcade who were banned from playing the game by the
6421000	6425000	owner. They'd become so good at it that at it.
6425000	6428000	At the at the I'm sorry, there's an extra thing in here.
6428000	6434000	It becomes so good at the game and could sit at the machine for hours on one credit.
6434000	6437000	Thanks for initiating my 80s gaming flashback this evening.
6437000	6440000	It brought a smile to my face after a long day at work.
6440000	6444000	Still listening to the show every week. Wayne in. You're welcome.
6444000	6448000	I'm glad you had some good memories like I do. There's so many Commodore 64 songs,
6448000	6451000	specifically just that that SID chip just brings back so many memories.
6451000	6456000	So but you're right. A lot of those classic 80s games never ended unless it was like
6456000	6461000	Pac-Man and a malfunction, a glitch caused it to end after 256.
6461000	6465000	Most of those games wouldn't end. So that's really I like the story about the
6465000	6468000	friends getting banned because they were too damn good at it.
6468000	6473000	Love it. Robert and actually sent the same mail twice. Oh,
6473000	6476000	but there's an addendum. OK. Just to clarify, in rescinding,
6476000	6480000	I left out that the twenty dollars would be to unlock all the characters that
6480000	6485000	probably came through in context. Yes, it did. Also, of the major smash likes,
6485000	6491000	Brawlhalla appears to, appears exclusive to general PC and PS4 rivals
6491000	6496000	of Aether to Windows and Xbox One. The heck was that?
6496000	6499000	There was a big like boom type of thing outside.
6499000	6502000	So I'm just going to get up and make sure everything's OK outside.
6502000	6506000	It probably didn't come through on the microphones, but there was a scary noise outside.
6506000	6511000	I'm just going to take a look outside real quick. OK. Brawlout on Windows and Switch
6511000	6515000	and the other consoles later, although my understanding is that one is critically
6515000	6518000	third place again from Robert N.
6518000	6525000	So moving back to our last email, then, if you are already.
6525000	6530000	Hello, LR. After the mention of two games terminating service in the coming months,
6530000	6534000	I thought I'd put a different perspective on it. Perhaps when you were little,
6534000	6539000	just as I did, you went to the arcade and there was a game that you,
6539000	6541000	a game there that you just had to play with your friends.
6541000	6546000	Maybe it was one of the TMNT games, maybe X-Men or Street Fighter 2 or NBA Jam
6546000	6550000	or something else. You dumped quarters into them one after another.
6550000	6553000	You played like crazy until you beat the game. And next time you went back there,
6553000	6557000	you did it again and again and again. Sorry. And then again.
6557000	6561000	And you had a hell of a great time doing it. But then sometime later,
6561000	6564000	maybe you weren't as interested anymore. And sometime after that,
6564000	6568000	you went back one day and the game was gone or perhaps the arcade closed entirely.
6568000	6572000	Your time with that game was done and you spent quite a bit of money on it,
6572000	6576000	but you had a fantastic time playing it. So you didn't really think,
6576000	6581000	well, I guess I wasted my money. Even today you reminisce about how much fun you had playing it.
6581000	6585000	That, I think, is the mindset you need to adopt when dealing with the closing of online only games.
6585000	6589000	Think of it as your arcade getting rid of the game. True, you may have spent money on it,
6589000	6593000	but you had fun while the game was there and nothing can take that away from you.
6593000	6597000	It's a bummer that the game is gone, sure, but nothing lasts forever.
6597000	6603000	I'm going to stop one thing on that. If you pay money for a game with the intention
6603000	6608000	of having it in your home as long as you want it, that is where the problem comes in.
6608000	6614000	I'm going to continue. I'll just end by saying, why am I grabbing your Pikachu's ear?
6614000	6618000	He likes it. There you go. Squeeze, squeeze.
6618000	6623000	I'll just end by saying that I'm hoping to end Super Multitasking's beta testing phase
6623000	6628000	and begin promotion this Friday. So if you are listening, if you do any streaming,
6628000	6632000	and you want to be one of the first to play it on stream, regardless of the size of your audience,
6632000	6640000	please reach out to me on Twitter at at yyr underscore or email me at yyr at yyrgames.com.
6640000	6644000	Thanks. And that's all the time we have for this email, so just remember,
6644000	6649000	the next time you're at the checkout counter and you hear that beep, think of the fun
6649000	6651000	you could have on Super Market Sweep.
6651000	6652000	I will.
6652000	6654000	Bye bye, Aaron Yyr.
6654000	6659000	You missed the tangent on Buzzer on Twitch, and they show all the old game shows,
6659000	6663000	and the Buzzer on TV, because there's two of them, there's Twitch, there's TV,
6663000	6668000	the Buzzer on TV is getting Super Market Sweep, or just got Super Market Sweep this month.
6668000	6671000	Oh, girl, I bet you need new underwear.
6671000	6674000	YYR saw it for the first time, it sounds like, that game show.
6674000	6675000	Oh.
6675000	6676000	Anyway.
6676000	6678000	Maybe if they, is it a new one or the old episodes?
6678000	6681000	It's the old ones from the 80s, the ones that were on Lifetime all the time.
6681000	6682000	See, they should do a-
6682000	6683000	With David Ruprecht, was that his name?
6683000	6686000	They should do a new one and not have them wear those ugly sweatshirts.
6686000	6689000	Fuck yeah, they should. No, and the ugly sweatshirts are like a staple.
6689000	6691000	But they have to, but they also have to go through self-checkout.
6693000	6697000	All right. They have to go to one of those new Amazon stores and steal it all.
6697000	6703000	The one thing I wanted to say is, Jamie, I think you kind of had a similar thought to what I did with YYR's little comparison there.
6703000	6706000	And like, look, I get where you're going with that.
6706000	6709000	And, you know, I want to see eye to eye there.
6709000	6718000	But that's the thing is that when the pizza place gets rid of the video game, that video game goes to some other person's house.
6718000	6720000	The video game didn't stop working.
6720000	6723000	The pizza place chose to sell the game.
6723000	6726000	Or their distributor chose to take it to another place that it would make more money.
6726000	6732000	So, yeah, and that's kind of where the analogy kind of loses me.
6732000	6735000	I mean, I get it. Nothing lasts forever. Fine.
6735000	6739000	But, you know, you got to, you got to admit the shelf life on some of this stuff these days.
6739000	6743000	Like when they almost pulled the plug on Gravity Rush 2 and it had barely been out, right?
6743000	6745000	No, they talked their way out of that.
6745000	6748000	But, you know, some of it's crazy how short of a window it is.
6748000	6753000	But, you know, I think people just get frustrated spending all this money and then they're gone.
6753000	6757000	Especially when it's something that, you know what I think they should do with those games?
6757000	6761000	Is they should have the ability like Phantasy Star Online had.
6761000	6763000	You could run private servers.
6763000	6769000	Actually, let me just ask you directly because I'm sure what started this email and the whole talk last week, you missed it.
6769000	6774000	Miitomo is closing and you're the biggest fan of that here. How are you handling that?
6774000	6776000	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
6776000	6778000	No, no, no. Mr. Smoosh.
6778000	6780000	Okay. Mr. Smoosh hopped up on the mixing board.
6780000	6783000	Hopefully we're still coming through. I don't think he knocked any of the...
6783000	6784000	Okay, I think we're fine.
6784000	6785000	So, um...
6785000	6788000	Wow, that's pretty impressive. Sorry, anyway, Miitomo.
6789000	6791000	I just shrugged.
6791000	6792000	Yeah.
6792000	6794000	I kind of, I'm like...
6795000	6798000	I mean, I have spent a little bit on Miitomo.
6799000	6803000	And I keep up with a few people that way that I haven't talked to in a while.
6803000	6806000	And I like certainly all the characters that I've made on it.
6806000	6808000	Excuse me.
6808000	6809000	But...
6810000	6812000	I've, I'm...
6813000	6816000	I don't know. I kind of don't care.
6816000	6817000	Okay.
6817000	6820000	I was just curious because, you know, as Loki and I were talking about it last week, I was like,
6820000	6825000	it's a bummer that Jamie misses this week when it's, you know, a game that I know she plays more than us, so...
6825000	6830000	I look, I check it once a day. I make outfits. I've made Jessica Jones in it. I'm happy.
6831000	6832000	Fair enough.
6832000	6833000	I've made E. Honda.
6833000	6835000	I made Petsch and Lonk.
6835000	6836000	Uh, SSJ...
6836000	6837000	SSJ...
6837000	6839000	Oh, and I made Katya and Bianca Del Rio.
6839000	6842000	SSJ and Hunter Matt and our chat at live.vogue.com says,
6842000	6847000	Mr. Smoosh is harnessing the essence of Drunami attacking the mixing board like that.
6847000	6848000	Yes, he did.
6848000	6850000	And since other daddy just got home,
6850000	6856000	Mr. Smoosh hopped up on the mixing board while Dark Soccer was trying to talk about Miitomo.
6857000	6859000	What did you teach him how to do, Alan?
6859000	6860000	What?
6860000	6863000	All right. Anyway, he's denying responsibility for that.
6863000	6864000	All right.
6864000	6866000	Thank you YYR for the email and I am very excited.
6866000	6869000	I hope to be the first person to stream Super Multitasking.
6870000	6871000	I'm ready.
6871000	6872000	Is your body ready?
6872000	6873000	My body is totally ready.
6873000	6874000	I've still been playing the game.
6874000	6878000	I haven't really been talking about it during my gaming week because it's not out.
6879000	6881000	But I still play, I don't play it for a long, long time,
6881000	6883000	but I'll play like five games or so.
6884000	6885000	Here and there.
6885000	6887000	So, I'm still playing it.
6888000	6889000	Anyway, was that it for email?
6889000	6890000	Yeah, it was.
6890000	6891000	Okay.
6891000	6893000	If you want to send us an email for a future week,
6893000	6896000	participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6896000	6900000	Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some news, starting with Loki.
6900000	6902000	Let's talk about movies.
6902000	6907000	So, we've talked about this a while back when I think they made the announcement
6907000	6908000	that they were thinking about doing this.
6908000	6913000	So, Sleeping Dogs was a game that came out from Square Enix not too long ago
6913000	6917000	and it is still going to be a movie apparently.
6917000	6922000	So, Donnie Yen is, I guess, starring in the movie
6922000	6926000	and said that, yeah, sometimes great things take a bit of time
6926000	6930000	and Sleeping Dogs is in motion.
6930000	6932000	You guys are ready for this.
6932000	6935000	So, I guess it's still being worked on.
6935000	6937000	I'd be curious to see how it turns out.
6937000	6939000	It was an okay game.
6939000	6941000	So, look forward to that, I guess.
6941000	6947000	And then we already talked about that there was talks about Mario becoming a movie as well
6947000	6954000	and basically they're partnering now with the producers of Despicable Me to make the game.
6954000	6959000	Why did it have to be the fucking minions? Why, why, why?
6959000	6961000	Well, I know why.
6961000	6963000	Because it's an animation studio.
6963000	6965000	Well, it's Universal's animation studio.
6965000	6966000	Well, yeah, it's Illumination's.
6966000	6969000	And clearly Nintendo and Universal have a little something-something going on
6969000	6971000	because of the theme park thing.
6971000	6979000	So, it would seem to me that the theme park, if it's going to open in 2020, might just be timed with this movie.
6979000	6982000	They're an okay animation studio.
6982000	6983000	I don't think it's going to be...
6983000	6987000	It's all about who writes the story and who directs the movie.
6987000	6991000	Really, at the end, the animation studio, they're just making it come to life.
6991000	6996000	I know, I just have an admittedly irrational hatred for minions.
6996000	7002000	But do you think Nintendo, they're going to let their prized property get fucked up?
7002000	7008000	Like, you know, well, there was the Super Mario movie, I guess, that came out a long time ago.
7008000	7012000	But that was a different time when shlock like that was kind of okay.
7012000	7015000	Not so much anymore.
7015000	7017000	I am glad they're going animated with it.
7017000	7020000	It seems to be the right, you know, course for Nintendo.
7020000	7022000	I think a real live movie just...
7022000	7025000	It's not going to work with Bowser and Goombas and shit.
7025000	7029000	Yes, I know, we tried once before, we all know, we tried once before.
7029000	7033000	And like I said, it's good they're going animated with it this time.
7033000	7039000	What if they went the whole Super Mario Odyssey route where he could be just walking around the real world and it's all weird and shit?
7039000	7040000	Um...
7040000	7041000	New dog city.
7041000	7047000	Nah, I love Odyssey, but I'm curious to see what they do with the traditional...
7047000	7049000	Assuming that maybe it will be an Odyssey type thing.
7049000	7050000	Who knows?
7050000	7052000	We'll see what they do with it.
7052000	7057000	I really hope, like they're saying in chat here, S.G.O. 100 Matt says, Goombas are voiced by the minions.
7057000	7059000	Yeah, that's what I don't want to happen.
7059000	7061000	S.G.O. 100 Matt, that's why I don't want to happen.
7061000	7063000	Goombas don't need to be the new minions.
7063000	7066000	Alright, and S.G.O. 100 Matt says, it's going to be a few years out.
7066000	7069000	Illumination has projects in production until 2021.
7069000	7073000	And besides, we know that the Rabbids are the new minions.
7073000	7074000	Alright.
7074000	7078000	Well, if Mario isn't your Nintendo thing, maybe Pokemon is.
7079000	7086000	Okay, the only reason I'm bringing this up, the only reason I'm bringing this up is this ridiculous fucking headline.
7086000	7088000	Here's the headline.
7088000	7095000	Pokemon for Nintendo Switch, still scheduled for 2018 or later.
7098000	7100000	So, in other words...
7100000	7102000	Anytime!
7102000	7106000	It's not 2017, because that involved time travel.
7106000	7110000	And Nintendo hasn't figured out online and god forbid they touch time travel.
7110000	7112000	That's correct. So, seriously, that headline says,
7112000	7116000	Pokemon for Nintendo Switch has not been cancelled.
7116000	7118000	Time travel would explain why they don't have online yet.
7118000	7122000	Because they could just go back in time and fix all that shit and then it's like not a problem.
7124000	7133000	Anyway, this is all coming from, I guess there's a list out there of upcoming Nintendo titles.
7133000	7139000	And Pokemon RPG for Nintendo Switch is on it as 2018 or later.
7139000	7142000	And that's on the official release or whatever.
7142000	7144000	So, I mean, it's going to happen.
7144000	7149000	Now everybody's just hedging their bets on, will it be a holiday 2018 release?
7149000	7151000	Which I think a lot of people are hoping for.
7151000	7153000	Or are they going to end up inevitably pushing it back?
7153000	7155000	You know what?
7155000	7159000	It would be nice if it happens this year, but I just want it to be good.
7159000	7162000	So, don't take it out of the oven before it's done.
7162000	7168000	If they need to push it to March to make the fiscal year, then push it to March, for God's sake.
7168000	7170000	Let's move on. I just thought that headline was so funny.
7170000	7172000	Moving on, Darsagra.
7174000	7178000	Well, you know what they say, pirates gonna pirate?
7178000	7180000	Wait, is that how it goes?
7180000	7186000	But, yeah, pirates have said, yeah, that Assassin's Creed Origins, we got that.
7187000	7192000	The announcement came from CPY, which is an Italian hacking group
7192000	7197000	that finally cracked Assassin's Creed Origins DRM protections
7197000	7201000	and are ready to put it out there to everybody.
7201000	7205000	Because, again, pirates are going to pirate.
7206000	7208000	And pillage and burn the village down.
7208000	7211000	Does that mean that gyrates will gyrate?
7211000	7212000	Perhaps.
7212000	7214000	I don't even know if that's a word.
7214000	7216000	Well, gyrates, but anyway.
7216000	7223000	So, anyway, you know, usually it takes a few days, but this one took them a few months.
7223000	7225000	But they still did it.
7225000	7227000	So, yeah.
7227000	7230000	Not surprised, not surprised.
7231000	7245000	Yeah, the new, what is it, Denovo 4.8 DRM is supposed to be, like, the one to stop everybody.
7245000	7247000	Oh, of course, of course. They always say.
7247000	7248000	That's what they always say.
7248000	7249000	We've been doing this show 15 years.
7249000	7254000	Every year somebody puts out a game on PC and says, this, this is going to end piracy.
7254000	7262000	It was cracked with Sonic Forces, but Assassin's Creed Origins still had some unique things to bypass
7262000	7265000	because it also used VR Protect and Uplay.
7265000	7267000	So, yeah, they got it.
7268000	7271000	Good job, cheaters.
7273000	7276000	I have to go back to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
7276000	7278000	because they're still talking about this Mario movie.
7278000	7282000	And Tigerclaw in chat says there's only two good voice actors for Mario.
7282000	7287000	Charles Martinet and Captain Lou Albano, the latter no longer with us, unfortunately.
7287000	7291000	And SSG100Matt follows that up with Kristen Wiig for Princess Peach.
7291000	7293000	Kevin Hart for the voice of Luigi.
7293000	7294000	Who should voice Mario?
7294000	7297000	In my opinion, there's only one choice.
7297000	7298000	Danny DeVito.
7298000	7299000	Danny DeVito.
7299000	7301000	Clearly Danny DeVito should be voicing Mario.
7301000	7302000	Clearly.
7302000	7306000	If he's not going to voice Pikachu, then he needs to do Mario.
7307000	7308000	Would there be another choice?
7308000	7309000	Anyone?
7309000	7310000	Anyone.
7310000	7311000	Well, Charles Martinet, of course.
7311000	7312000	Oh, honey.
7312000	7313000	I just...
7314000	7317000	I'm going to say this just because it's going to piss people off,
7317000	7320000	but it is a move that this kind of studio would do.
7320000	7321000	Will Ferrell.
7322000	7323000	No.
7323000	7324000	I hate that so much.
7324000	7328000	I hate everything about that sentence that just left your mouth.
7329000	7330000	That wasn't even a sentence.
7330000	7331000	It was just two words.
7331000	7333000	So much power.
7333000	7336000	AkumaJP in chat suggests Liam Neeson.
7337000	7338000	No.
7339000	7342000	He would have to play like someone more...
7343000	7344000	Bowser.
7344000	7345000	Bowser.
7345000	7346000	Bowser, yeah.
7347000	7350000	No, he shouldn't act in anything because he's an asshole.
7350000	7353000	He's one of those garbage people that defends other garbage people.
7353000	7354000	Oh, boy.
7355000	7356000	Ryan Reynolds.
7356000	7357000	I mean, it's got to be Ryan Reynolds.
7357000	7358000	Why not just have Ryan Reynolds back?
7358000	7359000	All right, let's move on.
7359000	7360000	Let's move on.
7360000	7361000	Loki, what do you have for us?
7361000	7362000	You're going to take us to porn, right?
7362000	7363000	I'll take us to porn.
7363000	7364000	Let's go to porn.
7364000	7365000	So there's a game...
7365000	7367000	From Danny DeVito to porn.
7367000	7369000	It's a short jump.
7369000	7373000	So there's an indie game that's come out called NSFWWare,
7373000	7376000	or I guess it's NSFWare, if you will.
7376000	7379000	It's like a WarioWare game with porn in it.
7380000	7383000	I mean, granted, it's very like...
7385000	7387000	I want to say artistically done.
7387000	7388000	It's implied.
7388000	7391000	It's not like full graphic porn, although it's pretty graphic.
7391000	7396000	So like WarioWare, you have one word come up on the screen.
7396000	7398000	It kind of gives you a hint on what you need to do,
7398000	7401000	and you have to figure out how to use the arrow keys to be able to do that.
7401000	7402000	Anal.
7402000	7403000	No, it's not anal.
7403000	7406000	So like, they'll have like, for example, some of the mini games.
7406000	7414000	There is Swap, and it's basically three guys in like a daisy chain type thing, or girls.
7414000	7415000	I don't know.
7415000	7416000	You can't tell because they're just colors.
7416000	7417000	So you can't really tell what they are.
7417000	7418000	But basically, they want you to swap.
7418000	7419000	They're like iPod commercials.
7419000	7422000	Yeah, it's like an iPod commercial having sex.
7422000	7426000	So they want you to swap the colors to match the little triangle in the corner.
7426000	7428000	Or there's one that's like, you know, edge.
7428000	7434000	Or, you know, there's tickle or slap or, you know, finger.
7434000	7436000	It's like those love dice.
7436000	7437000	Yeah, sort of.
7437000	7438000	So if you...
7438000	7440000	Lick her elbow.
7440000	7442000	The game is basically available.
7442000	7444000	It's on itch.io for pay what you want or nothing.
7444000	7446000	You can pay nothing to get it.
7447000	7454000	So if you're interested in checking it out, it's at p-i-e-r-r-e-c dot itch dot i-o slash
7454000	7458000	n-s-f-w-a-r-e.
7458000	7460000	And it's hard.
7460000	7462000	I bet.
7462000	7467000	It's a challenging game, but it is very much like Mario, except if Mario had porn.
7467000	7469000	So, you know, be careful.
7469000	7472000	And then, of course, you know, to go along with that, one of the big things that's kind
7472000	7476000	of been in the Internet news lately has been deepfakes.
7476000	7479000	And it has to do with this app called Fake App.
7479000	7489000	So what Fake App is, it is a artificial intelligence machine learning way to swap faces on videos.
7489000	7495000	So, for example, people have put Nicolas Cage on, you know, Harrison Ford and stuff like
7495000	7496000	that.
7496000	7498000	It's sometimes it can be pretty convincing.
7498000	7504000	The other not so dubious things that they've been, or not so, I guess, ethical things that
7504000	7509000	they've been doing is putting pictures of actresses on, you know, non-porn actresses
7509000	7511000	on porn actresses' bodies.
7511000	7512000	Oh, boy.
7512000	7514000	And, you know, and actually it's in video form.
7514000	7516000	So what, of course, are people going to do?
7516000	7517000	Why?
7517000	7520000	They're going to take video game characters and put their faces on porn stars.
7520000	7523000	And it's kind of creepy.
7523000	7525000	Just going to put that out there.
7525000	7526000	It's kind of creepy.
7526000	7528000	But it's something that people are doing.
7528000	7533000	Fake celeb nudes have been rotating around for forever, though, as far back as Photoshop
7533000	7534000	1.0 existed.
7534000	7537000	But this is more, this is in motion, though.
7537000	7542000	This is like it maps it to like you basically take, you train it by giving it a bunch of
7542000	7546000	pictures of, you know, the celebrity you're looking for and then pictures of whatever
7546000	7548000	person you're trying to put it on there.
7548000	7552000	And then the computer does the rest and it trains itself how to map that onto the body.
7552000	7557000	When the PP tapes inevitably leak, the president's going to claim it's this.
7557000	7558000	Technology.
7560000	7561000	Well, that only does the face.
7561000	7562000	It's still good.
7564000	7565000	All right.
7565000	7568000	Anyway, one more story for us tonight.
7568000	7569000	Oh, no.
7569000	7570000	This, this website.
7570000	7574000	I need to ban this website from being used on our show because it doesn't load on this
7574000	7575000	computer for some reason.
7575000	7577000	I wouldn't suppose it works for you, Loki.
7577000	7579000	Do you want to steal this from me?
7579000	7580000	Sure.
7580000	7584000	I kind of spoiled it already about, uh, let's talk about Cas.
7584000	7589000	It's probably that it's probably that wonderful, uh, windows XP computer that you're running
7589000	7591000	off that I really need to bring you.
7591000	7592000	My Mac has loaded it right away.
7592000	7594000	Go, go, Jamie.
7594000	7601000	Well, um, the president of Sony and the CI cause will here I has stepped down.
7601000	7603000	I'm going to miss him.
7603000	7604000	I think it's effective.
7604000	7605000	April 1st it is.
7605000	7606000	And it's not a joke.
7606000	7607000	Not a joke.
7607000	7608000	Yeah.
7608000	7611000	It's that CEO Casarai also was stepping down.
7611000	7615000	You remember he made the announcement, the fake Twitter account.
7615000	7616000	Like he knew.
7616000	7617000	I know.
7617000	7618000	Right.
7618000	7619000	They're really the same guy.
7619000	7624000	Anyway, the transition in management is going to the Sony nominating committee.
7624000	7633000	Um, uh, so, uh, I'm trying to see, he will become a director and chairman of Sony corporation.
7633000	7635000	So he's still involved in the business.
7635000	7642000	Um, just not as, you know, CEO and it's been approved, so we don't know who is going to
7642000	7643000	take over from here.
7643000	7646000	I'm trying to see if it was in the article cause I'm just looking at this.
7646000	7648000	I think it was like midway through it.
7648000	7651000	There's a statement from the person that's taking a Yoshida.
7651000	7652000	That sounds right.
7652000	7653000	Yeah.
7653000	7656000	Is going to be a taking over for Cosmo here.
7656000	7659000	I, so good for him.
7659000	7660000	Good for them all.
7660000	7665000	May they continue to have success and pass on that helmet and crayons.
7665000	7667000	Sony's a giant enemy crab.
7667000	7668000	Sony's been doing all right lately.
7668000	7670000	I always forget Sony still like makes a lot of movies.
7670000	7672000	I, I went to the movies again today.
7672000	7674000	I saw another Oscar nominee.
7674000	7676000	So you took me to say this, see the shape of water.
7676000	7680000	A couple of weeks ago, by the way, while you finally see lady bird, while we talk about movies,
7680000	7683000	a Skype line is open, orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
7683000	7687000	Um, no, I saw call me by your name and yeah.
7687000	7690000	And at the very beginning it's Sony pictures classics.
7690000	7692000	So it was a Sony movie.
7692000	7694000	So here's the thing.
7694000	7697000	Everybody I know that seen it said it was like amazing.
7697000	7698000	Incredible.
7698000	7699000	I liked it.
7699000	7700000	I didn't love it.
7700000	7702000	I thought it was a little dry.
7702000	7706000	I think it's one of those things where if you read the book, which I haven't,
7706000	7713000	but I imagine there's a lot more in the book of probably like thoughts and feelings that doesn't translate the same way on screen.
7713000	7715000	And some of that might've been lost on me a little bit.
7715000	7716000	Like I didn't get the same thing out of it.
7716000	7719000	Like some of my friends are like, I'm seeing this multiple times.
7719000	7722000	This speaks to me as somebody who is like a repressed Catholic person.
7722000	7723000	I get a lot.
7723000	7728000	But for me, I was kind of like, God, it really takes an hour for this movie to go anywhere.
7728000	7730000	Let's go see Lady Bird next weekend.
7730000	7731000	I do want to see Lady Bird.
7731000	7732000	We can do that.
7732000	7733000	I found this Sunday mornings are a great time to go see movies.
7733000	7735000	I don't know if it was Super Bowl Sunday or what, but we went.
7735000	7737000	I've been, I've been seeing the sleeping movie.
7737000	7741000	We went to the 10 30 this morning and it was like 10 people in the theater.
7741000	7742000	Cool.
7742000	7743000	So anyway.
7743000	7745000	Next weekend though is by Panther.
7745000	7748000	Oh, movies are going to be packed 24 seven for that one.
7748000	7750000	I know so many people excited to see it.
7750000	7755000	I probably won't see that right away just because it's nothing against Black Panther.
7755000	7756000	I'm sure it's going to be awesome.
7756000	7758000	It's something against other humans.
7758000	7760000	Do you know how many Marvel movies I've missed?
7760000	7765000	I just haven't seen comic book movies in forever, but I'm sure that one's going to be fantastic.
7765000	7766000	Um, we'll see.
7766000	7768000	Anyway, I want to get to the phones.
7768000	7769000	It is a ringing.
7769000	7770000	So let's get to it.
7770000	7771000	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
7771000	7772000	Who's this?
7772000	7773000	Hey buddy.
7773000	7774000	It's been a while since we heard from you.
7774000	7778000	Did you hear about, we actually had some DDR content the past couple of episodes.
7778000	7779000	I don't know if you heard it.
7779000	7780000	Yeah.
7780000	7783000	Was it related to that arcade championship over in Japan?
7783000	7788000	Uh, no, there was a DDR freestyle tournament, kind of like freestyle coming back that happened
7788000	7790000	in San Jose on the 20th.
7790000	7792000	And they, I actually got to be a judge, Zaku.
7792000	7793000	It was fun.
7793000	7794000	Oh damn.
7794000	7797000	Well, if only the East coast had that.
7797000	7803000	Well, be careful what you wish for because I know they, they're not going to stop here.
7803000	7804000	I know.
7804000	7805000	Try getting that scene back up.
7805000	7806000	We'll see.
7806000	7807000	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
7807000	7808000	I didn't mean to derail you.
7808000	7809000	Oh, nothing much.
7809000	7813000	Just, uh, I'm in the midst of a move right now.
7813000	7819000	I recently got engaged to my girlfriend this past December out in Tokyo.
7819000	7820000	Congrats.
7820000	7821000	That's great news.
7821000	7822000	Yep.
7822000	7826000	All the way, all the way in Japan again, you know, as we went out there again.
7826000	7829000	Oh, so it was like your girlfriend's from Japan.
7829000	7830000	Oh no.
7830000	7831000	You guys traveled to Japan.
7831000	7832000	You proposed to her.
7832000	7833000	We traveled.
7833000	7834000	We traveled to Japan.
7834000	7836000	Is there, this was our second time.
7836000	7837000	Third time for her.
7837000	7838000	Okay.
7838000	7842000	And then we just, you know, I need you to sit down for a minute and, and, and not talk
7842000	7845000	for a minute because I need to, I need to talk with my co-host about something.
7845000	7848000	Zaku has been calling into the show for a long time.
7848000	7849000	Right.
7849000	7851000	And it's like, Oh my God, he's getting married.
7851000	7853000	How old are we?
7853000	7855000	Zaku is getting married.
7855000	7856000	All of us have gotten married.
7856000	7860000	There's going to be a baby maybe if that's what you guys want, but Oh my God.
7860000	7861000	Oh my God.
7861000	7863000	All of us have gotten married over the course of the show.
7863000	7864000	I know.
7864000	7865000	That's true.
7865000	7866000	But congratulations.
7866000	7867000	You get to be as miserable as we are.
7867000	7868000	You can talk again.
7868000	7869000	You can talk again.
7869000	7870000	Congrats.
7870000	7871000	Yep.
7871000	7876000	So yeah, we, we basically took the engagement photos in Asakusa in Tokyo.
7876000	7877000	That was fun.
7877000	7881000	You know, aside from work getting in the way, but that's another story.
7881000	7882300	How did you do it?
7882300	7883300	Where did you propose that?
7883300	7884300	Did you propose over dinner?
7885300	7887300	Was it at the temple in Asakusa?
7887300	7890300	Yeah, right there, right there with the big lantern.
7890300	7892300	Oh, that's gorgeous.
7892300	7893300	Good call, Jamie.
7893300	7897300	Well, I mean, if I was going to be proposed to, that's where I'd want to.
7897300	7902300	Either that or in front of the, um, the big theater in Kyoto.
7902300	7906300	For me, it was the castle at Disneyland, but things have a funny way of working out sometimes.
7906300	7909300	Well, I was watching Weird Al and eating spinach dip when I got engaged.
7909300	7910300	I know.
7911300	7914300	For us, it was, oh my God, Trump just got elected.
7914300	7916300	Do you think we should get married before they take the ride away?
7916300	7917300	Yeah, probably not a bad idea.
7917300	7918300	Cool.
7919300	7920300	But you were saying?
7920300	7921300	Anyway, sorry, Zaku.
7921300	7922300	Yeah.
7922300	7927300	So aside from that, just, uh, you know, now that we're getting, now that we're engaged,
7927300	7930300	you know, we have to start moving in together and whatnot.
7930300	7935300	And so I managed to, I managed to close the lease this past, uh, almost a week ago on
7935300	7939300	a place, uh, in Chappaqua condo for, you know, for a year.
7939300	7943300	But yeah, I've been in the process of, you know, not only burning through my wallet,
7943300	7948300	but also moving things from my room upward outside of the Bronx.
7948300	7951300	And I've been to Westchester, you know, north of the city.
7951300	7952300	Wow.
7952300	7953300	Moving, moving on up in a way.
7953300	7958300	So, well, what did you, I, I congratulate you on the engagement, but, uh, what did,
7958300	7961300	was there something on your mind that you called in to talk about tonight?
7961300	7965300	Uh, aside from that, like, I just want to say Cuphead is really hard.
7965300	7966300	I don't care.
7966300	7967300	Yes, it is.
7967300	7968300	Yeah.
7968300	7969300	It's a nightmare.
7969300	7970300	It's so fun though.
7970300	7976300	I know it's fun, but Jesus, it's like, it brings me back to 8-bit NES days, but with,
7976300	7981300	but with the whole, like, you know, 1930s cartoon literally right there.
7981300	7982300	And it's just ridiculous.
7982300	7988300	Like, it's deceptive because you think, oh, it's going to be a cartoon, a cutesy game.
7988300	7989300	It's Mickey Mousecapade.
7989300	7990300	No, bitch.
7990300	7992300	It's a hard game.
7992300	7997300	Makes Contra look like, uh, goddamn, they got to help me out here.
7997300	7999300	It makes Contra look like what?
7999300	8003300	Uh, something makes it look like Super Mario Brothers.
8003300	8007300	Yeah, it makes Mario Brothers 2, which I think is an insanely easy game.
8007300	8008300	Yeah.
8008300	8013300	And, you know, it's not even that, like, like the Hotline Miami series was just as bad and
8013300	8017300	I managed to get through that recently and I, I was trying to escape away from it and
8017300	8023300	then, you know, lo and behold, I buy Cuphead and now back in that whole, uh, you know,
8023300	8027300	having to deal with like dying every few minutes and like taking an hour to beat a stage.
8027300	8030300	Are you playing Cuphead on Xbox One or PC?
8030300	8032300	PC through, through my Steam link.
8032300	8033300	Yeah.
8033300	8034300	Oh, good call.
8034300	8035300	Good call.
8035300	8036300	Yeah.
8036300	8039300	Cuphead's one of those games that, uh, I think a lot of people might've overlooked last year,
8039300	8042300	maybe because there's not a lot of Xbox owners or at least comparatively to PlayStation or
8042300	8043300	what have you.
8043300	8045300	I mean, there are several people that own Xbox, but I think there's a lot of people
8045300	8046300	that overlooked it.
8046300	8051300	Um, so if you don't own an Xbox One, I would still encourage you to seek out Cuphead on
8051300	8052300	PC.
8052300	8053300	Um, check it out.
8053300	8054300	It's a good game.
8054300	8055300	Yeah.
8055300	8056300	It was, I got it on sale.
8056300	8057300	Nice.
8057300	8058300	That was, it was really worth it.
8058300	8059300	Uh, yeah.
8059300	8063300	And then just, you know, getting back into Flight Simming, but also managed to get this
8063300	8066300	little gem right here, Windows MR, uh, headset.
8066300	8067300	Oh.
8067300	8072300	So at least I have VR now on Flight Simming and, uh, you know, other random stuff.
8072300	8076300	I never thought about VR for Flight Sims, but I bet that's pretty cool.
8076300	8077300	Oh yeah, it is.
8077300	8080300	Like you, you pretty much immerse yourself in the cockpit.
8080300	8083300	Like, you know, I also play like combat flight sims.
8083300	8087300	So one of the ones I played DCS world has like full VR support.
8087300	8094300	And because Windows mixed reality works with a Steam VR, I'm able to use that very seamlessly.
8094300	8096300	So it like works right out of the box.
8096300	8097300	Nice.
8097300	8101300	Well, installing, you know, installing the software from Steam, but that's it.
8101300	8105300	You know, we have a mobile VR thing and we've used it maybe once.
8105300	8110300	Like there's just not a lot that we practically use on a regular basis, but the flight sim
8110300	8111300	stuff, I could see that.
8111300	8114300	And on one of these days I'm going to break down and get a PlayStation VR finally, but
8114300	8116300	I'm just kind of waiting for the right moment.
8116300	8118300	The must, the must must have game.
8120300	8121300	Sorry about that.
8121300	8122300	That's all right.
8122300	8123300	All right.
8123300	8124300	Well, Zaku, I'm going to let you go.
8124300	8125300	I'm going to congratulate you one more time.
8125300	8128300	Uh, and, uh, you know, good luck with the move.
8128300	8130300	Moving is a bitch, but it'll be worth it in the end.
8131300	8137300	Yeah, especially if you're moving with like, you know, someone who doesn't drive as often
8137300	8138300	almost at all.
8138300	8142300	And now I have to move to the suburbs where I definitely need a car now.
8142300	8143300	Ah, you'll make it work.
8143300	8144300	We always figure it out.
8144300	8145300	All right.
8145300	8146300	Take care of my friend.
8146300	8147300	Yep.
8147300	8148300	Have a good one.
8148300	8149300	You too.
8149300	8150300	Bye.
8150300	8151300	Bye.
8151300	8152300	All right.
8152300	8153300	We'll open up the Skype line one more time.
8153300	8154300	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8154300	8156300	Checking in for any last minute stories that we might have.
8156300	8157300	Nope.
8157300	8158300	No.
8158300	8159300	Oh boy.
8159300	8160300	All right.
8160300	8161300	We'll open it up for the Super Bowl.
8161300	8162300	Super Bowl.
8162300	8163300	All right.
8163300	8168300	Uh, you don't chat, uh, telling me that, uh, Skyrim VR is a must have job.
8168300	8171300	Sim is a must have rec room is a must have super hot VR is a must have.
8171300	8175300	So cause you're just saying there's plenty of must have games already.
8175300	8176300	I'm just sleeping.
8176300	8177300	And I forgot.
8177300	8182300	And I was reminded the other day when I booted up my PlayStation four cause my son wanted
8182300	8188300	to play like Marvel Avengers two that accounting plus is out now.
8188300	8189300	I totally have to get that.
8189300	8190300	What's that one?
8190300	8191300	I don't know.
8191300	8195300	It's, it's a VR game by the guys that did Rick and Morty and it's fucked up.
8195300	8196300	All right.
8196300	8198300	We're going to take one more call.
8198300	8199300	Hi.
8199300	8200300	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8200300	8201300	Who's this?
8201300	8202300	It's the one, the only raging here.
8202300	8203300	Hey raging here, buddy.
8203300	8204300	What's on your mind tonight?
8204300	8206300	I'm not a whole lot.
8206300	8214300	Um, you know, I, I know no one listened to the show or any of the three of you are into
8214300	8215300	sports whatsoever.
8215300	8218300	It depends on the sport.
8218300	8225300	But I only bring it up sports up cause it's kind of tangential, tangential relate to
8225300	8227300	what, you know, my point.
8227300	8235300	Um, I saw part of the Superbowl, your suit, your super owl tonight and um, call it the
8235300	8236300	Superbowl.
8236300	8237300	Call it the Superbowl.
8237300	8238300	I don't give a fuck.
8238300	8239300	Let them sue us.
8239300	8242300	We're talking, we're commenting on something that happened in the real world.
8242300	8244300	It's news.
8244300	8248300	But, uh, no, no, no.
8248300	8254300	The reason I bring it up is because, um, you know, I mainly was hoping to see some of the
8254300	8261300	commercials and they actually showed the trailer to the Han Solo movie.
8261300	8265300	Um, and it looks actually quite good.
8265300	8272300	Um, you know, I can't remember everything, uh, that w you know, was in the trailer.
8272300	8275300	I saw a little, I saw a little snippet of it on Twitter.
8275300	8278300	The only thing that looked good about that was Lando.
8278300	8279300	Mike drop.
8279300	8280300	I don't know.
8280300	8281300	What about you?
8281300	8282300	Loki?
8282300	8283300	You looked at, said you were into it, right?
8283300	8284300	It looked okay.
8284300	8285300	Yeah.
8285300	8286300	I'm going to wait and see what the critics have to say.
8286300	8290300	Not that critics always, I mean, rogue one wasn't too bad.
8290300	8291300	I was all right.
8291300	8293300	One was, I haven't seen rogue one.
8293300	8294300	I still haven't seen episode.
8294300	8296300	Rogue one was all original people.
8296300	8299300	This is dealing with a legend in the series.
8299300	8300300	Yeah.
8300300	8303300	I just, I want to see what some of the early takes are because I'm hearing that's, you
8303300	8307300	know, and it could just be all a bunch of bullshit, but I'm hearing that there's some
8307300	8310300	troubles and that like the actor apparently is not very good.
8310300	8313300	And so I just kind of want to see what some of the early hot takes are before I make a
8313300	8314300	decision.
8314300	8315300	If all the critics come out and say, Oh, it's great.
8315300	8319300	It's must see, you know, Ron Howard saved the day or whatever, then maybe I'll check
8319300	8320300	it out.
8320300	8322300	But I'm, I'm already like two star Wars movies behind.
8322300	8326300	So I'm kinda, you know, but that's nothing against star Wars.
8326300	8329300	Again, I always feel like I'm such a hater, but it's just, no, I only have so many times
8330300	8332300	so much time to do so many things.
8332300	8338300	And so I chose to go see another Oscar film today instead of seeing star Wars, whatever.
8338300	8346300	Well, well, the only thing I might be iffy about regarding the movie is that obviously,
8346300	8353300	you know, having grown up watching the original trilogy and now with, um, Harrison Ford playing,
8353300	8358300	uh, Han Solo for those, no, I kind of used to him playing the role of Han Solo.
8358300	8365300	So I see anyone else play their role just seems a little odd to me, but I will give
8365300	8367300	the movie a try.
8367300	8369300	So that's one of Jamie's takeaways.
8369300	8370300	She's not so keen on either.
8370300	8371300	I don't know.
8371300	8373300	Like it just depends.
8373300	8378300	I mean, like how many guys have played James Bond, you know, but I get it's different,
8378300	8383300	but you know, like Daniel Craig is a pretty good James Bond and Pierce Brosnan wasn't
8383300	8384300	bad.
8384300	8386300	It really depended on the movie, you know?
8386300	8388300	So it just, it just depends.
8388300	8390300	Actors can play the same role.
8390300	8391300	It could be.
8391300	8392300	Here's the one that doesn't make sense to me.
8392300	8395300	The dude from the office playing Jack Ryan.
8395300	8396300	That's the one where I'm like, what?
8396300	8397300	But he's all ripped now.
8397300	8398300	So it's fine.
8398300	8399300	Yeah, whatever.
8399300	8400300	Whatever.
8400300	8403300	I, you know, I'd be fine if him playing.
8403300	8405300	So what's his face playing?
8405300	8407300	Chris Pratt playing Star Lord.
8407300	8410300	And he was on his, on the show was kind of.
8410300	8411300	That's yeah.
8411300	8414300	When he was on parks and rec, he was kind of, you know, from not so good.
8414300	8415300	That was his character.
8415300	8416300	That was physically.
8416300	8417300	Yeah.
8417300	8418300	Yeah.
8418300	8419300	No, I get you.
8419300	8420300	I get you.
8420300	8421300	Um, it could be worse.
8421300	8426300	I mean, remember Indiana Jones son was played by none other than Sheila.
8426300	8428300	Uh, imagine, Hey, let's see.
8428300	8431300	That looks like a young, young Harrison Ford.
8431300	8434300	Let's use him as a young Harrison Ford in this movie.
8434300	8435300	Half day.
8435300	8436300	All right.
8436300	8437300	I'm sorry.
8437300	8438300	I'm sorry.
8438300	8443300	But as far as I'm concerned, that fourth Indiana Jones movie doesn't even exist.
8443300	8444300	Yeah.
8444300	8447300	I mean, no, I think I heard they were going to do another, they are doing another one.
8447300	8452300	And aren't they doing with a, with a female protagonist like Harrison Ford's in it.
8452300	8455300	But this time I thought there was a female protagonist for the last one, a daughter or
8455300	8456300	a niece or something.
8456300	8458300	That was his love interest from the first movie.
8458300	8461300	No, it was really, Oh, maybe I'm thinking of the female villain.
8461300	8463300	I thought there was a female villain.
8463300	8464300	Cate Blanchett was the villain.
8464300	8465300	Wouldn't she?
8465300	8466300	Yeah.
8466300	8469300	I might be mixing it up with Thor, but anyway, anyway.
8470300	8476300	Oh, well, uh, before I, uh, you know, uh, clear up the line so someone else can, uh,
8476300	8477300	call in.
8477300	8478300	Yep.
8478300	8486300	Uh, now it, at least in passing during, um, the classic game of the week, uh, you have
8486300	8494300	briefly meant, uh, I think, uh, Doc Sorkin had briefly mentioned, uh, 1942 or 1943.
8494300	8498300	Rob mentioned it because it had stuff in common with SkyShark by planes.
8498300	8499300	Yeah.
8499300	8500300	Yeah.
8500300	8511300	Which reminds me, I think, uh, 1942, 1943 and 1943 Chi are in, um, Capcom arcade cabinets.
8511300	8520300	Um, it technically is an older game, but it's new to me because I just recently got an Xbox
8520300	8527300	360 for the second time and I just tried, tried, uh, recently picked up, uh, uh, cap
8527300	8528300	count.
8528300	8533300	I'm also pretty sure that game is part of that infinite Microsoft library collection
8533300	8534300	thing.
8534300	8535300	I think that game is in there.
8535300	8538300	So yeah, those two games are, and correct me if I'm wrong, Jamie, there was a 1941 at
8538300	8541300	some point too, but that was like on a later system or something.
8541300	8542300	Yeah.
8542300	8543300	It wasn't like the NES.
8543300	8544300	And at a 45.
8544300	8545300	Was it 45?
8545300	8546300	I thought there was a 41.
8547300	8551300	I have to go back and look and see what's on the, um, the Capcom collection that I've
8551300	8554300	got on Saturn, but we've got like the 1940s, blah, blah.
8554300	8555300	That's true.
8555300	8559300	The one that's on Xbox, uh, Xbox 360 slash PlayStation three.
8559300	8564300	That's not the first, uh, that they've done to that, but that, uh, that makes sense.
8564300	8565300	Yeah.
8565300	8567300	So that's the first time some people are discovering it.
8567300	8568300	Yeah.
8568300	8575300	Well, uh, you know, no, like I said, well, I play some of these games, uh, during this
8575300	8577300	collection on other systems in the past.
8577300	8583300	Uh, um, I think there was collections for, uh, like PlayStation two and whatnot, but
8583300	8589300	I've just recently got this collection for, uh, the 360 and, uh, at least in my opinion,
8589300	8591300	you know, a pretty good collection.
8591300	8596300	Uh, have any of you tried this particular collection on the 360 or no?
8596300	8597300	I have.
8597300	8600300	Um, I didn't, it was all kind of piecemeal, the games.
8600300	8604300	So I didn't play all of the games, but I did play that back when it first came out.
8604300	8608300	And, um, yeah, it was a good way to revisit some of the, you know, classics that are on
8608300	8613300	ultra-cade machines and things like that, including like, I think gun dot smoke was
8613300	8614300	in there.
8614300	8619300	I seem to remember, uh, the Hijomaru, the pirate game, the old, uh, Hige Maru, that's
8619300	8620300	it.
8620300	8621300	Uh, that was there too.
8621300	8625300	And, uh, yeah, several games, by the way, I wanted to point out, I pulled this up to,
8625300	8626300	to figure this out.
8626300	8633300	So here's the complete 19XX series by Capcom, 1942, 1943, which then had 1943 cops.
8634300	8636300	1941.
8636300	8640300	And then there was straight up a 19XX, the war against destiny, which was great.
8640300	8643300	There was 1944, the loop master.
8643300	8646300	And then they came all the way back and did 1942 joint strike.
8646300	8648300	That's the last one that they did.
8648300	8653300	And 1942 joint strike was an Xbox 360 arcade game.
8653300	8656300	So it was kind of like a re envisioning of the original 1942.
8656300	8657300	Yeah.
8657300	8660300	And joint strike was also on PSN.
8660300	8661300	Um, yep.
8661300	8669300	I, I remember having that on PSN when I saw on the PlayStation three, you know, I particularly
8669300	8670300	enjoyed that one.
8670300	8672300	So it's a solid series of shooters.
8672300	8675300	I'm glad people can discover it no matter, uh, how the way.
8675300	8676300	So, all right.
8676300	8677300	Well, space, uh, rage nator.
8677300	8678300	I'm gonna let you go.
8678300	8679300	Okay.
8679300	8680300	Take care.
8680300	8681300	Sure.
8681300	8682300	Have a nice night.
8682300	8683300	You too.
8683300	8684300	All right.
8684300	8686300	Uh, we'll see if any more calls sneak through orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
8686300	8689300	I used to play 1942 at the yogurt shop.
8689300	8691300	They had the cocktail cabinet and it was 1942.
8691300	8693300	I love cocktail cabinets.
8693300	8694300	They're not appreciated enough.
8694300	8695300	We don't see them anymore.
8695300	8699300	I just had a mental flash to what was in my arcade at my college.
8699300	8701300	Right when you walk in the door, you had dark stalkers.
8701300	8702300	Yeah.
8702300	8706300	Which they upgraded to a vampire savior before I moved out.
8706300	8710300	Then we had, um, fatal fury special.
8710300	8713300	We had a favorite riding DX.
8714300	8721300	We had killer instinct, which my friend Marcy and I would just like, just hand people their asses all day.
8721300	8727300	Um, we had world cup soccer 94, which is why I own one now in my house with the color led nonetheless.
8727300	8731300	Oh, we Dan found that one of our ramps, uh, need needs work.
8731300	8733300	He's talking about getting the brass plated ramp.
8733300	8734300	Oh, fun.
8734300	8735300	Okay.
8735300	8736300	So we, we had a discussion about that.
8736300	8738300	We had cyber sled.
8738300	8739300	You remember cyber sled?
8739300	8740300	I do.
8740300	8743300	We had, um, crap.
8743300	8749300	Oh, we had a street fighter alpha last call orange launch radio, all one word on Skype.
8749300	8750300	Sorry.
8750300	8751300	I didn't mean to.
8751300	8752300	Oh, I thought you said we had a caller.
8752300	8753300	Sorry.
8753300	8754300	I was getting that last thought out there.
8754300	8755300	I'm trying to remember what else we had.
8755300	8759300	Cause Oh, we had a, um, crap.
8759300	8764300	What was the, the SNK game that had Rio and mr karate?
8764300	8765300	Was that world heroes?
8765300	8766300	Not world heroes.
8766300	8767300	Art of fighting.
8767300	8768300	Art of fighting.
8769300	8775300	Uh, I, I still do distinctly remember here at Sac state going into the arcade there in
8775300	8779300	the mid nineties when I was in like junior high and they had street fighter two and it
8779300	8780300	was always like off the hook.
8780300	8782300	I went to an arcade this week.
8782300	8787300	I went to the golf land, play all their, the, see the latest in redemption technology.
8787300	8792300	They have some really ridiculous games there, but there was a giant Tetris.
8792300	8795300	Uh, I didn't see the giant Tetris.
8795300	8800300	I saw they have like the stupid, like, like redemption machines have gotten so huge now.
8800300	8801300	Like they take up all the space.
8801300	8807300	Like they have one that like is almost, it's like at least eight feet tall and it drops
8807300	8808300	a ball into a hole.
8808300	8809300	I'm like, you don't need that.
8809300	8812300	Cause like you would literally walk around the corner and they have a smaller version
8812300	8813300	of that ground.
8813300	8814300	One of those.
8814300	8815300	Yeah.
8815300	8820300	But, um, I did see they had a star Wars arcade game that was in like a cockpit type thing.
8820300	8822300	The one that starts off on the hoth battle.
8822300	8825300	I don't know, but it's like projected onto a big sphere.
8825300	8828300	Yeah, that actually is pretty fun.
8828300	8830300	It reminds me a little bit of battle tech.
8830300	8833300	I certainly have the kids to play with anyone to the battle technique.
8833300	8839300	I did respect though that Nintendo and Namco and whoever else makes the Mario Kart GX games
8839300	8843300	is smart enough to know that, Hey, the kids that might be interested in your games can't
8843300	8845300	always reach the foot pedals.
8845300	8851300	And so if the foot pedal isn't pressed, it goes in the auto acceleration, which is fantastic.
8851300	8857300	I was like, that's an absolutely amazing feature that not anybody really thinks about.
8857300	8860300	So I wish more games did that.
8860300	8861300	All right.
8861300	8865300	Well, no more calls came in, so we're going to wrap up the show.
8865300	8868300	Thank you guys so much for listening to the show this week, especially cause I know there
8868300	8870300	was a lot else going on in the world tonight.

8874300	8875300	Don't forget to check into the show.
8875300	8878300	There was a passphrase that you would have heard at some point during the show earlier.
8878300	8882300	Don't forget to punch that in over at vognetwork.com and get yourself some points for what?
8882300	8884300	Cause cause they're points.
8884300	8886300	Don't you want to be cool and have points?
8886300	8887300	Yeah.
8887300	8888300	Anyway, all the cool kids have points.
8888300	8889300	That's right.
8889300	8890300	All the cool kids have points.
8890300	8893300	So check that out over at vognetwork.com and uh, Hey, if you liked what you heard here
8893300	8895300	at the show, uh, tell a friend or two about the show.
8895300	8896300	Help us spread the word.
8896300	8900300	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to, uh, amplify
8900300	8905300	a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google or wherever it is you found this
8905300	8907300	show is greatly appreciated.
8907300	8913300	So we will be back to do this again in seven days, which, uh, is not yet a long weekend.
8913300	8917300	We have a long weekend in two weeks, but, uh, cause president's day is coming up.
8917300	8920300	So, uh, yeah, but next weekend, next week is just any old weekend.
8920300	8924300	Uh, but we'll be here to do it again and cover whatever news comes out until then.
8924300	8926300	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
8926300	8928300	Um, I'll start with my final thought.
8928300	8932300	My final thought is I'm still finding lots of pumpkin spice stuff.
8932300	8936300	I have some pumpkin spice almonds I was eating earlier and they're not bad for almonds.
8936300	8937300	For almonds.
8937300	8938300	Anyway.
8938300	8941300	Uh, Jamie, since you have the mic, your final thought.
8941300	8944300	I miss pinkberry and I really want some.
8944300	8945300	Can you have like a little bit?
8945300	8947300	I can have a mini mini.
8947300	8948300	There you go.
8948300	8950300	And last one to get the sample and walk out.
8950300	8952300	And last but not least, Loki.
8952300	8956300	They needed like a pumpkin spice equivalent for like other seasons.
8956300	8960300	So then that way they can flood the shelves with that sorta.
8960300	8963300	They got red velvet seems to show up around this time of year.
8963300	8968300	You know what, you know, if you want kind of the pumpkin spice flavor in spring, they
8968300	8970300	should do carrot cake.
8970300	8973300	I've seen that around Easter that remember the carrot cake M&M's.
8973300	8974300	You know, that was an Easter thing.
8974300	8977300	Well, I mean, you know, carrot cake is like my favorite cake in the universe as long as
8977300	8982300	there's no fucking raisins in it because raisins are liars and terrible things.
8982300	8983300	Okay.
8983300	8985300	I feel about raisins the way you feel about mayonnaise.
8985300	8986300	That's fine.
8986300	8987300	That's a harsh statement.
8987300	8990300	Actually I feel about ketchup and mustard the same way, but I will say there's been
8990300	8995300	one dish I've enjoyed raisins in and that is the salad that they serve at strings.
8995300	8996300	The garbage.
8996300	8997300	Well, okay.
8997300	8999300	It's good in the garbage too.
8999300	9000300	Raisin bran.
9000300	9002300	But no, raisin bran is disgusting.
9002300	9004300	I only eat the cereal out of the raisin bran.
9004300	9008300	I would pick out all the raisins, throw them away and just eat the cereal.
9008300	9009300	Interesting.
9009300	9012300	But keep in mind when I was a kid, I ate grape nuts and total.
9012300	9014300	Grape nuts are fucking good.
9014300	9015300	Total is gross.
9015300	9016300	I love me some total.
9016300	9017300	But you know, you know.
9017300	9018300	Okay.
9018300	9019300	Delicious winter time.
9019300	9020300	Wonderfulness.
9020300	9021300	And I miss eating it.
9021300	9025300	Total makes me think of colon blow from early Saturday night live.
9025300	9028300	I also like crackling oat bran.
9028300	9035300	But, um, you take, you take your, um, your grape nuts and do maybe half as much milk
9035300	9041300	and you add, um, cinnamon icing after you heat it, after you heat it up.
9042300	9047300	My favorite old people breakfast cereal is like, it's not frosted mini wheats.
9047300	9049300	It's just the fucking giant wheat.
9049300	9051300	Like the one giant square.
9051300	9052300	The biscuit.
9052300	9053300	Yeah.
9053300	9054300	It's like this ain't a mini wheat.
9054300	9055300	This is the wheat.
9055300	9056300	And it ain't frosted.
9056300	9059300	You can get, you can get wheat a bit cause it's almost the same thing.
9059300	9060300	Oh, okay.
9060300	9061300	The British thing.
9061300	9065300	But I mean, frosted mini wheats though are probably my favorite ever cereal.
9065300	9066300	Uh, Crispix.
9066300	9068300	So if I have to eat like a normal cereal.
9068300	9069300	Kids love that shit.
9069300	9070300	That's not sugar coated.
9070300	9072300	It has life cereal while I can't eat it.
9072300	9073300	And I'm mad.
9073300	9074300	What an asshole.
9074300	9075300	I know, right?
9075300	9076300	Why did I marry an ass?
9076300	9078300	Not because, I mean, probably because he is an asshole.
9078300	9080300	Love you, Dan.
9080300	9083300	Anyway, enjoy your breakfast cereal this week and we will be-
9083300	9084300	Did you do a final thought?
9084300	9086300	I thought so.
9086300	9087300	I will just say we did.
9087300	9088300	Okay.
9088300	9089300	Okay.
9089300	9090300	Then that's it.
9090300	9091300	Let's go get some cereal, Rob.
9091300	9092300	We're out.
9092300	9093300	Yes.
