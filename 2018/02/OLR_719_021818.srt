This week it's a potpourri of topics in gaming news, fighting games, imminent releases, lootboxes, acquisitions, cryptocurrency and more! There's something for almost everyone in the lineup of tonight's news, so let's waste no more time and get right to the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 719 for this February the 18th of 2018.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts, including DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Moaning and moaning.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm so full.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, I see. I was like, that's not usually a reference to full noises.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Moaning. Pain.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How are you? Thanks for the movie date today. That was fun.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Thank you as well.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, well you're welcome.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We saw Lady Bird today.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, we finally saw the Lady Bird.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I kind of want to see it again, but I might have, it wasn't quite ugly crying but it couldn't stop.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, not that we're a movie podcast, but I really love that movie a lot. Well, I mean, this show, as you probably know, is based in Sacramento, California.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And so certainly there's a certain something, I mean, obviously, like, for example, there's a lot that resonated with you, even though you grew up in Mobile.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You said you had a lot of similar, without kind of giving away the entire plot, you had a lot of similar feelings as the plot progressed.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Especially dealing with my mother.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Although I didn't have, you know, a stable male influence in my life like that. I didn't have a dad I could rely on like that.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But I still have that kind of relationship with my mother.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And, of course, she left and I stayed with Grandmom.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But, you know, just the whole, I need to get out of the place that you still know very well.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then when you're gone from there, you have the shock, you know.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And it's like, what do I do now?

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There was definitely pieces of it. I mean, the fact that I have lived in Sacramento my whole life, there are still like pieces that really resonated with me.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Like the whole, like, the first time you're driving around in your town, you know, it feels so different even though you lived here your whole life.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It was very big for me.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And then all the places were so different, you know, when I moved out here.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I kept going back to the, there were several scenes that show the Rose Garden downtown.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, McKinley Park, yeah.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah. And the thing is, is that I used to work over on C Street at the Cannery Building.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And so I used to walk all the way around that park every day.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, it is kind of awesome that there's like legit, like local landmarks.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Like when they do the, when, again, I don't want to spoil something, but there's a very distinct thing that happens and she's with her friend at the Tower Bridge.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And I'm like, I know exactly how they shot that and where that is at because that's on a walking path that I've played Pokemon Go on.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Several times. There's lots of PokeStops up there.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But it just, it makes the whole place, you know, it kind of lets you see the town in a different, through a different lens.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah. So anyway, anyway, not to be too movie chat, but maybe there'll be a Lady Bird game someday.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Just kidding. I think that's one of those games where they can't really make a game out of it.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But then again, they somehow made a game out of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and they made a game out of the room at some point.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So anything's possible, I suppose.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Anyway, say hello to somebody who one of these days will ride a game.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's Tagmaster Loki.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hello.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm doing fine.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, good. Is your mic even on over there?

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're just really quiet for some reason. Sorry.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Not hearing you back.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm not quiet.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm very loud. I can see myself on the waveform.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes, it is on. For some reason, I'm not hearing the same. Maybe I'm just a futz with these speakers.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's just you're getting older. You're going to need to turn up a hearing aid.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay. Here's the other problem.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So it is February 18th and you may or may not know, it is National Wine Day, everybody.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, that explains my children.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What the hell does that even? Oh, not that kind of wine, Loki. Not that kind of wine.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You got me good, bitch.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, the problem is where I'm going with this and you can probably already figure it out.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've already had about a glass and a half of one of our favorite sweet wines here locally.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, yeah, it's National Wine Day.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I can't really drink wine because I don't enjoy it because it makes me feel like I have a really bad.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It goes to my face.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's what I'm feeling right now.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Like it feels like I have a really bad sunburn.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like that's not a pleasant.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I feel you, bro.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's what I'm feeling right now is that sunburn feeling.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But here I am doing a three hour podcast about games.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So good times.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But yeah.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So it's Wine Day.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But of course, everybody, if you do drink, drink responsibly.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Tomorrow is a three day weekend.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Tomorrow is a holiday.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's President's Day.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So it's a three day weekend for me.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So that's why it really works out to have Wine Day be today.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So I can actually indulge in a little bit of wine.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So there you go.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So I don't know.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is anyone drinking along in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Excuse me.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hiccups plus wine equals bad.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, I guess.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're just going to jump right into it and talk a little bit about

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Kickstarter's gone really, really wrong.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Loki, would you lead us a little bit on our kickoff topic tonight?

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So I don't know if this is really wrong.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But basically, the System Shock remake that was kickstarted a couple years ago

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
for 1.3 million is on hiatus.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thanks to, they say they had problems with development.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And so the company Night Drive Studios, they're an indie game developer.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And they were, of course, going to basically remake that whole thing.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That was kind of back when a lot of the games coming out were remakes.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Like you'd have the BioShock remakes and that kind of stuff.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Now, of course, as our concept grew and our team changed,

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
so the scope of what we were doing and with the budget for the game,

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
as the budget grew, we began a long series of conversations

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
with potential publishing partners.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The more that we worked on the game, the more we wanted to do.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And the further we got from the original concept that made System Shock so great.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I guess right now they're just taking time to work on it longer

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
or reassess what they need to do to bring the project back to their original scope.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And here's why I shade all the Kickstarter stuff.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And look, I understand the whole if you have to delay a game

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
to make it the game that you need to make, then fine.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But it's a tricky balance with Kickstarter.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Because in Kickstarter, you're asking for people's money up front.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And usually, almost always, it's the full cost of the game,

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
maybe with a small discount because you're showing your faith in the game early on.

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And yet this is just another in a long line of games that has either been delayed

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
or in some cases disappeared.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And there's a part of me that hears, oh, such and such game has gone on hiatus.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And I kind of go, well, some bands go on hiatus.

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The Spice Girls are on hiatus.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You have to recognize, though, that Kickstarter is not a pre-order.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's just you're investing money in a company for a product,

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and that may not work out.

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And so we've already told people enough to stop pre-ordering games.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So this is even worse.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You pre-order a game before it's even made, like two years before it's even made.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I don't know.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says,

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
where I was going to go with the system's shock story

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is that it was put on Kickstarter as a remake,

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but now it's just a different game in the same universe.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Everyone on Kickstarter backed a remaster.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's another good point is that things have kind of changed

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
from what it was originally supposed to be.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
MXC says, I'm very nervous about Night Drive Studios.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They mostly get the licenses of old PC games and then remake them,

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
so they run on Windows 10.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But do they have the skill to fully remake a game even with the money?

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can see why they're having trouble.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And JD points out the Spice Girls are coming back.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Technically nothing official has been confirmed.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is all through TMZ.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So there's still that part of me that says,

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
until I hold those concert tickets in my hand, I don't believe anything.

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And don't believe those dates that are on Facebook either.

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Read the descriptions of that stuff

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and look who's actually inviting you to that stuff.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Because all that shit that's like Spice Girls tour in this city,

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
that's some frickin' lame-o concert promoter locally

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
trying to farm the likes to then push out a bunch of crap to you.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Just basically get your name on a mailing list, essentially is what that is.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Another reason why Facebook sucks, but I won't get into that right now.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But how are you feeling overall, Loki, about Kickstarter at this point?

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Do you still back projects on Kickstarter?

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Not really.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's been a while for me. It's been a very long time.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I know one project I backed, We Happy Few,

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
spams the fuck out of their updates.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I get so many stupid updates from them.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sure there's a way to turn that off, but it's fucking annoying.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't get me wrong, I like backing stuff,

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but dude, I don't need a million fucking updates about that.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I think the last one I backed was one of the guys we had on the show.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We had the guy who made Tangledeep that was on the show.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But what I liked about the way he was doing it

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is that that game was pretty much already done,

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and was going to be done,

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
is that he was looking for this money to put the extra coat of paint on it.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You remember that? It was bringing in guest composers,

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
help with some of the publishing and stuff like that,

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and I was like, okay, that's the way to do it,

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
because he already essentially had a game done.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He was just looking for the money to kind of elevate it into

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
this is the commercial release, or whatever you want to call it,

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that I want it to be. I kind of liked that.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It wasn't something that had to be built from the ground up,

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
because hell, even Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night,

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that game is still not out, and how long ago was that Kickstarter?

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Now, again, take the time to get it right, I suppose,

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but there's still that part that's like,

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
dang, I gave them money four years ago,

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
when this game was supposed to be on the Nintendo Wii?

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No, I'm just kidding. There's a lot of games.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The problem is, we always focus on the games that this stuff is happening in.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We forget half the stuff that goes through it,

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and it's just fine.

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think Stardew Valley was a Kickstarter game, wasn't it?

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Was it? I don't remember,

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
but there's been games like that that have gone through the process

199
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
with Kickstarter and stuff, and have come out just fine.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We always focus on the ones that do bad,

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
because that's all you ever remember.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Fifth Dream in Chat says,

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I back Patreons more than Kickstarters nowadays.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Have I ever talked in depth about why I really don't care for Patreon?

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Maybe I'm only willing to do it tonight, because I've had a little bit to drink.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But here's my problem with Patreon, full stop.

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Patreon feels very pyramid scheme-y to me,

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
because Patreon shows what you're contributing to other people,

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
as well as what they're contributing to you.

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I kind of feel like, okay, if I go on to Patreon,

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and I've had plenty of other podcasters say,

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
why don't you have OLR on Patreon, why don't you do this on Patreon?

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Because, okay, cool, then we would be getting money on Patreon,

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
but I would also kind of feel this sense,

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
because I want to promote other podcasts,

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I would feel like, in turn, shouldn't OLR be showing the support

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
by backing other people's Patreons?

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And then what happens?

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You give us a dollar, now we give you a dollar,

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
so it's not even, except for the fact that Patreon has taken a percentage cut of both sides.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So that's the part, and I know not everybody's going to understand that

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and think I'm being weird, but that's the part that never really sat well with me,

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
is that I feel like Patreon is this never-ending,

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I give you a dollar, you give me a dollar,

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and Patreon still gets a percentage of the cut off the top the whole way.

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And that's not even getting into the other part of it,

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
which I know I've talked about before,

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
which is all still very relevant about the whole,

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I like to do OLR because it's fun, I get to see you all,

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and once I feel a little more like,

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I feel like if you're giving us money,

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and then we have to go and, let's say, cancel a show,

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and last year we had to cancel a lot of shows,

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
because there was just a lot going on.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Even though I know 99.9% of the listeners were more than understanding those scenarios,

236
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and I thank you for that,

237
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I would still feel that kind of sense of,

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
you paid us for something we didn't deliver on,

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
now I've become one of these Kickstarters.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now you're part of the whole network.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes, now I'm part of that whole problem.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And whether it's true or not, I'm just telling you that's where my brain goes.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Whether I'm being rational or not, that's what happens with my brain.

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So that's kind of a big reason why I've never gone to Patreon.

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And I have nothing against other shows that go to Patreon to do this stuff.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That is something you have to figure out for yourself,

247
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and you have to do for your show, and that's totally cool,

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and I am definitely a supporter of independent podcasting,

249
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
whether that's through finance, whether that's through word of mouth, whatever.

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, I think a lot of the shows that I've seen that use Patreon,

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
they kind of put it this way.

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's like, we're doing this show, if you want to back us, that's cool,

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
but if you can't find it, if this is going to be a financial burden for you, please don't.

254
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Or just, only if you want to, type of thing.

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And so kind of making it, listen, this show's going to be what it is,

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
whether you back it or not, type of thing.

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Getting some comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
SG100Matt says, I stopped backing gaming Kickstarters.

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Too much nonsense happens in development where I will just purchase the game when it comes out.

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, I'm not helping the cause, but there have been many gaming Kickstarters

261
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that have gone wrong during development.

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Dungeon Buster says, Pillars of Eternity boasts Divinity Original Sin games,

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Wasteland 2, the Shadowrun series.

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's a lot of success stories, but it only takes a few to sour people on the process.

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And some people are also bringing up other games.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Shovel Knight was another success, and so forth.

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Also, Bobby Blackwolf points out Mutant Football League,

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
which I know he's been streaming more and more of lately,

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
cheap plug for Bobby Blackwolf,

270
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
was a failed Kickstarter, but what came out of it was a much better game, in my opinion.

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That could be.

272
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't really say yes or no, because I haven't played the game myself,

273
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
but it looked interesting.

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
JD in chat says, I can't find the Kickstarter for Stardew Valley.

275
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I think it might not have been one.

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Ok.

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And AkumaJP says, Sky will not do well in business.

278
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He is too nice.

279
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can be a dick when I need to be, but it's a fair criticism,

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
but I don't want OLR necessarily to pay the bills.

281
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I have a day job that's cool.

282
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I want it to pay my meth habit.

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh wait, I don't have a meth habit, so I guess I don't need it.

284
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I need it to pay for my cookie habit.

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I could develop a meth habit, and then I wouldn't have to worry about the cost of it.

286
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I wouldn't have to worry about having a job.

287
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm just thinking about this animated short that plays before Rocky Horror every time,

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
where the little dancing popcorn and that stuff,

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but it's a death metal band with the pretzel and stuff,

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and they go, don't stop, watch, and then they go,

291
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
we have all your fucking money and we're going to spend it on drugs.

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's pretty awesome.

293
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But that's just what you said kind of reminded me of that.

294
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm going to start streaming more, just basically,

295
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
the whole thing is going to be going back into whatever I happen to make on it.

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We'll be going back into doing stuff for VOG.

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, sorry. I was going to say, ironically,

298
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
there was a game today that I saw that I was like, ooh, I want to back that.

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What's that?

300
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It was What the Golf.

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This already sounds like a Loki game.

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's basically, yeah, it's kind of, you know, it's like,

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
this is what, you know, it's time the car should have been,

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but it's basically this golf game by people that hate golf,

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and it's just the most ridiculous thing.

306
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's basically the whole thing is kind of the golf controls,

307
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
where you point a direction and you pull back and click and stuff like that,

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and you try to get to the hole, but they're not really counting strokes.

309
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's more of like trying to avoid obstacles and stuff, and it's really silly.

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But yeah, look up What the Golf, everybody. It's awesome.

311
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay.

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I will get right on that.

313
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm right on top of that, Rose.

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I was going to say, though, before somebody points it out

315
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and accuses me of being a total hypocrite, which may or may not be true,

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I do stream on Twitch occasionally.

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I haven't been doing it as much as I'd like,

318
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
but I'm very proud of the fact that I'm juggling three podcasts a week right now.

319
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So a pro over here, a con over here.

320
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But when I do stream on Twitch, I do take the tips and I take the subscription,

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and I'm totally fine with that.

322
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But I also feel like a tip in that sense is a tip.

323
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's a one-time thanks, hi, how you doing, here's some money to support it,

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and I'm literally offering you nothing for that.

325
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Now believe me, I appreciate it deeply,

326
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and we do pay money to have the capture card

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and have the cable running.

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But even deeper than that, for stuff like OLR,

329
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
obviously we need to buy new microphones probably.

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
We're getting to that point where these lovely microphones

331
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
that Brad used to use for Pod Culture,

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
some of them are seeing their last day

333
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
because they get through a lot of use around here,

334
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
so we could probably stand to have some more microphones.

335
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We do pay a pretty good chunk of, about a video game's worth of money a month

336
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
to keep the stream up and running, and that's just what I'm paying.

337
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Bobby's paying for the website.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So your money does get used for good stuff,

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
but I'm okay with that because, in a sense,

340
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you're giving me money for nothing on paper.

341
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And the rent's for free?

342
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But your money is being turned around.

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Brain went to dire straits, sorry.

344
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No, no, it's all good. I understand.

345
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's see.

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Dungeon Buster says, Steam Greenlight.

348
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
According to the wiki, Stardew Valley went to Steam Greenlight,

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and then went into early access for funding.

350
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I thought it was kickstarted at 1.2, though.

351
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Whatever, it's still a great game.

352
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
ActDeftInChat says, It's not my money, it's Amazon or Twitch's Prime.

353
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Well, but that's still, in a way, it is still your money,

354
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
because you're paying for Prime, but I get it.

355
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I mean, it's like you get all this stuff with Prime,

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and you really should, like, if you guys do have Amazon Prime,

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
you should be giving that free Prime a month to somebody.

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like, obviously, I'd love it if it were me,

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
but if it's not, like, give it to, like, I know Flaco does streaming.

360
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Bobby's trying to get affiliate status.

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Jamie did get affiliate status.

362
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Like, give your, and even if it's not one of us,

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
just a streamer that you like that's working hard,

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
please remember to use your sub,

365
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
because they don't do a good job about reminding you, like,

366
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
oh, you have a sub to give away.

367
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's been 30 days. You have a new sub.

368
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So, you know, trust me.

369
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The people really, really appreciate it when you do use your sub.

370
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
If you're using Prime anyway for the shipping stuff

371
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
or the TV service or whatever, like, just don't forget to give those away.

372
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If I end up getting that Visual Novel Maker,

373
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I might stream using the Visual Novel Maker.

374
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Why not? Why not stream making a game?

375
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's what I'm kind of thinking about doing,

376
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
except I still need to get the rest of my story.

377
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And I'm actually planning on streaming doing my webcomic

378
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
when I do the existential crisis in Animal Crossing.

379
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
One more comment on the Twitch stuff.

380
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, you may not accept our money,

381
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
but you accept our love, appreciation, and occasional meals or drinks

382
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
when we see you in person.

383
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

384
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I love all that stuff, especially drinks in moderation,

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
as I'm doing tonight here on OLR.

386
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Jamie, I didn't really pick your brain on the Kickstarter stuff,

387
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
but have you backed anything in a while, and if so, why or why not?

388
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The last thing I backed was my Hataful Boyfriend plushies,

389
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and I got them, and they're great, and that's it.

390
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Dan backed Bloodstained, and I don't think he regrets it.

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We both kind of agree that...

392
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Actually, I think I did put that as well so I could get a copy too,

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
but I think we both agreed that it would, you know,

394
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
we'd rather wait for a good finished game.

395
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Sure. That's fair.

396
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah. I don't mind. That money's already gone.

397
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What's it going to do us now, right?

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Well, but at least we still have a game coming,

399
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
but, you know, if you donated to this,

400
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
A, you're not even going to get the game you thought you were getting.

401
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
B, now it's on hiatus.

402
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I mean, we're just hoping at this point it's still going to happen.

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know, and I'm not trying to be overly negative,

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
but it's just the reality is a lot of stuff that gets put on hiatus

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
gets put on hiatus for a long time.

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah.

407
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Guys on a show technically is on hiatus.

408
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I would love that for that show to come back,

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
but it just, you know, extras going through a lot.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm going through a lot, so I just don't know when it's going to be right

411
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
for that show to come back.

412
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

413
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So that show's also free.

414
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, speaking of money and things,

415
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I would like to take a moment just to thank everyone who donated to my mom.

416
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes.

417
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
She now has rent for another month,

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and the GoFundMe is still open.

419
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
If anyone wants to contribute, I'll link it in the chat.

420
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But I really do appreciate it,

421
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and listening to my mom cry on the phone instead with happy tears

422
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
was definitely more what I wanted to hear

423
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
as opposed to, you know, when she called me after Michael died.

424
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
She just got his ashes.

425
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So, but yeah, she wanted me to pass on to all of you

426
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and how grateful she is to everyone that's contributed to

427
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and continues to contribute to her GoFundMe.

428
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So thanks, everyone, for keeping a roof over my mom's head

429
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
until the government assistance comes through.

430
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Awesome.

431
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Thank you.

432
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I also want to give a quick shout-out here

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
since we're talking about really good fundraisers.

434
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So this is one that I actually picked up through my Ingress circles,

435
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
which, you know, was a game we talked about about a month ago here on the show.

436
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But this is really funny because I actually met this guy

437
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
from playing Ingress, but he's actually, like,

438
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
a fairly well-known classic game developer,

439
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and it was one of those things where I was like,

440
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
oh, I had no idea that is, like, what you did and what you were known for.

441
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But anyway, his name's Chuck, and he was actually the creator

442
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and developer of a game called Chip's Challenge,

443
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and it was on the Atari Lynx.

444
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Another game.

445
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So here's the deal.

446
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There's another Ingress player who,

447
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
she's a single mom raising her kid right now,

448
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and she found that she had an Atari Lynx, like, sitting around,

449
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and she said in one of the Ingress hangouts,

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
does anyone want, like, an Atari Lynx?

451
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And that kind of started, like, a whole conversation about it,

452
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and Chuck was like, well, wait a minute.

453
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's, you know, I'll try to, you know, give my little endorsement

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
or whatever to this, and let's try to, like, you know,

455
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
get you some extra money to help out here.

456
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So they actually put up on eBay.

457
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's an Atari Lynx, and it has California games and Chip's Challenge,

458
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and Chuck is going to autograph the Lynx

459
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and autograph Chip's Challenge for you,

460
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and you can see more information about that.

461
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It is on eBay.

462
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll have to post the link in chat.

463
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It was recently on my Twitter earlier today.

464
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Maybe somebody can dig that up for me.

465
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Do you know what generation of Lynx it is?

466
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The old one.

467
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Is it?

468
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's the original.

469
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay, because I can't tell from the picture.

470
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I know because I have an original.

471
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
PAG 0201, tested with two games.

472
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, we have the newer one.

473
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay.

474
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah, but we already have all those games.

475
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So, anyway, I will definitely,

476
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm going to work to get Chuck on the show at some point, absolutely.

477
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Cool.

478
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You know, I wonder if he's been to Atari Party

479
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
because the name sounds really familiar.

480
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't see how he hasn't been.

481
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I mean, if they know he's in Folsom,

482
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
they know that, you know, they probably invited him.

483
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I should have him sign my Lynx.

484
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I need to sell it anyways because I don't play it.

485
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah, but this is for a good cause, Loki.

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's a good cause, too, for me.

487
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Well, I'd have him sign our cartridge, but we play our Lynx sometimes.

488
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Well, I'll ask him next time I see him if he knows about Atari Party.

489
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So, I see him at least once a month or so for various Ingress events.

490
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So, I'll ask him if he knows about Atari Party,

491
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and we'll get him on the show at some point, if he's willing, which I don't...

492
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I used to play a crap...

493
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I think he did say he would.

494
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I used to play a crap ton of Chip's Challenge in the,

495
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
was it the Windows Game Pack order they used to have on Windows 3.1?

496
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, a lot of people kind of talking about that.

497
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
They kind of know the Windows version almost a little bit better,

498
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but it was, I guess, a Lynx thing because he had a lot to do with Lynx.

499
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So, anyway, check that out and help out with my books.

500
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's Windows Air Team Impact. Thank you.

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
All right. Thank you, Azette.

502
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Please approve the Lynx that's in our chat.

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Thank you, Azette.

504
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
She actually put that in there because Azette is also one of these Ingress folks

505
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
that knows all of these people involved.

506
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Anyhow, cool, cool.

507
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So, we got the fundraisers out there,

508
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and we've got our kickoff topic all finished,

509
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
so I think it's time to get into our gaming week.

510
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

511
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

512
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Just Animal Crossing and Miitomo,

513
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and I actually didn't play hardly any Ingress,

514
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
or actually I played Ingress today in the bathroom of the movie theater.

515
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I had things to your portal at the movie theater.

516
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I was going to say, what did you do, bump the portal?

517
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah, bump the portal.

518
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I didn't even notice.

519
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
A euphemism.

520
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
No, no.

521
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No. No bumping the portals that way.

522
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But really, it's been kind of a weird week for me,

523
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
so I haven't really gotten to play much.

524
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Although, I installed Secret of Mana because I wanted to stream it,

525
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
but now that 50 million other people are streaming it,

526
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I might stream something else.

527
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Sorry about it.

528
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Let you know you're not.

529
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So, I'm actually thinking of playing the original Secret of Mana

530
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
either on our cartridge, so we'd have to get up to the CRT

531
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
to keep it with no delay, or just doing it through the SNES Classic.

532
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So, Hubby and I are talking about it, but he'd have to be my player two.

533
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm the player one around these parts.

534
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
All right.

535
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So, if that's it for your gaming week,

536
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
we'll go to Loki with your gaming week.

537
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I mainly played...

538
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Well, I played a little bit of Stardew Valley.

539
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Not as much as I have been.

540
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
A little bit more of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes,

541
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
just trying to grind out the last 100% on there

542
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
so that I can finally stop playing the game

543
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
because I'm not really enjoying it anymore.

544
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And then lots of Dance Dance Revolution.

545
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I've been playing at least 30 minutes a day, an hour yesterday,

546
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
because I have time to do that.

547
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And then a little bit of Pokémon GO,

548
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
a little bit of Ingress when I'm out.

549
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's pretty much it.

550
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
All right.

551
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Well, I don't usually talk about the Ingress stuff,

552
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
but I did go on about a two-hour bender last night

553
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
just because we did Rocky Horror on Friday this weekend,

554
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
which isn't the usual night.

555
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We usually do Saturday.

556
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So, I was up until 2 a.m. on Fridays,

557
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
so I was kind of up late last night.

558
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So, I was just like, you know, I'm bored,

559
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and I don't feel like playing Final Fantasy XIV again.

560
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So, vroom, vroom. Let's go make green things.

561
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So, I did that for a little bit.

562
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But otherwise, I've, of course, been playing Final Fantasy XIV.

563
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I got my Red Mage up to level 60.

564
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I've really enjoyed playing that class in the game.

565
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I really like how the kind of like ping-pong mechanic

566
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
works in that game.

567
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You want to jump in here?

568
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, I just remembered I've been playing WoW.

569
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh.

570
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Me talking about MMOs reminded you of MMOs.

571
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Well, yeah, I've been playing A Night Born.

572
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So.

573
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay. Awesome.

574
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I have also been playing a shit ton of Pokémon GO.

575
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, my God.

576
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Like, just having the gacha, like, I'm able to play a lot.

577
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And Community Day is coming up this weekend.

578
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'll probably play even more then.

579
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So, yeah.

580
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What is Community Day?

581
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So, that's where, that's kind of like what they're trying to do

582
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
instead of the whole, like, we do a big event in Chicago

583
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and it melts down everything.

584
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So, what they did last month is that they set like a three-hour window

585
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and they're like, okay, for these three hours,

586
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
what they did last month is Pikachu is going to spawn everywhere.

587
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's going to be like a Pikachu day.

588
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And for these three hours, it's double XP.

589
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And I don't remember if they did double Stardust.

590
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't remember.

591
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But it was something that, it was at least double XP.

592
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And the amount of shiny Pikachus went way up.

593
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Like, it was more like a 1 in 64 or a 1 in 128.

594
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I caught four shiny Pikachus in the three-hour window of Community Day last time.

595
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So, anyway, the Community Day they're going to do this month is Dratini,

596
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
which is kind of a harder to find one.

597
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You know, most people in these parts, you know,

598
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
even though we had the Anatolia farm the first two weeks of the game,

599
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
that's long gone.

600
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So, anybody getting into the game now,

601
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
usually the only place to go is like Pier 39

602
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
or you might luck out once in a while in Cameron Lake.

603
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But otherwise, you have to hatch them, right?

604
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Like, you don't really get Dratini.

605
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So, this is going to be great for people around the world.

606
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Dratinis are going to spawn everywhere.

607
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We don't know if shiny Dratini is going to happen,

608
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
but it seems like lately in Pokemon Go with all the events,

609
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
they've been introducing a new shiny.

610
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Like, they did the Valentine's event where Love Disc was everywhere.

611
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Well, shiny Love Disc was a part of that.

612
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
They rolled out shiny Love Disc with that.

613
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
They just did, they just wrapped up Chinese New Year.

614
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's the year of the dog, right?

615
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Oh, that's why those dogs were everywhere.

616
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah, so Puchina, I think is the name from Gen 3, the gray dog.

617
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well, the shiny tan dog started showing up.

618
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So, they've been releasing new shinies with events.

619
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So, everybody expects that shiny Pink, I think it is Dratini,

620
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
will start showing up, which means Dragonite and Dragonair,

621
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I think is the middle evolution for that.

622
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So, all those shinies are going to start.

623
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
People are assuming that part, though.

624
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Niantic has not confirmed that.

625
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But that's kind of neat if they're rolling out shinies very slowly

626
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to correspond with events, because my understanding is that

627
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the shinies don't go away just because the event did.

628
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So, we'll see. We'll see what happens.

629
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Anyway, other stuff I've been playing.

630
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I have also been playing a lot of Heroes of the Storm,

631
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
which has been my every week lately,

632
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
but I'm still just trying to get my gold so I can buy my new characters.

633
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Been working on that.

634
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And then this week, I did get that Secret of Mana remake,

635
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
and I did stream it, Jamie, I did stream it on Friday,

636
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
about the first hour, maybe hour and a half of the game.

637
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I at least got up to the point where you get the girl character

638
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
to join your party, because I got to name her Jamie.

639
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Because, well, you know, it just makes it,

640
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
if you look at the dialogue, she kind of,

641
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
she's kind of a little bit, she's kind of mean to the guy,

642
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and I was like, oh, it's Jamie to me.

643
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm not mean.

644
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
No, you're not mean.

645
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Always.

646
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's that very, she's just an independent woman

647
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
who isn't here for your shit.

648
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah.

649
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So, and that's, that's Jamie.

650
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So I named Jamie.

651
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And, of course, of course, when the Sprite joins the party,

652
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm going to name the Sprite Loki,

653
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
although I'd like to do Loki as Tingle, but that might be too long,

654
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
so Dark Soccer has suggested on the Bobby Black Wolf call tonight,

655
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I do Lingle, and I'm kind of liking that, so.

656
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That's so much like Linkle, which is the character now.

657
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Or you could do Logel.

658
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Logel.

659
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I like Lingle.

660
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I like Lingle.

661
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I think I'm going to go with that, so.

662
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Makes me think of Lincoln Berries.

663
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Lincoln Berries are delicious.

664
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
All right.

665
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Anyway, so that was otherwise pretty much my gaming week.

666
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm enjoying the Secret of Mana so far.

667
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I think the redone music is actually fine.

668
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think a lot of the problems I've been reading on the game is that,

669
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
you know, it's just different from the original,

670
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and I don't know, like, I'm liking it.

671
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I get how you can kind of screw up the original when you do a remake.

672
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Like, look at Final Fantasy VI on tablets.

673
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Like, it's bad, right?

674
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But...

675
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Oh, that's too bad they have a bad version of Final Fantasy VI.

676
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Why is that even a thing?

677
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't know.

678
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's because they, I think they probably just got the art done really cheap,

679
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and it shows.

680
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I do feel like the Secret of Mana thing kind of looks like it might have been designed with tablets in mind.

681
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I would not be surprised if this game shows up on tablets eventually,

682
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
which would be funny, because the original Secret of Mana is already on iOS, at least.

683
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's got to be on Android, too, if I'm not mistaken.

684
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up there, too, eventually.

685
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
My only complaint is that there's some really weird things that happen with loading.

686
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Like, every time there's, like, a new texture or something happens,

687
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
like, there's this little pause, and you could see it on my stream when I was streaming.

688
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's like the game would kind of skip a little bit, and that was annoying.

689
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Granted, this is on PC.

690
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I have been playing the game on PC just because I thought,

691
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
well, I can probably play in a higher resolution than I can on PlayStation 4,

692
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and it turns out you can play in a better resolution.

693
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So I was like, all right, I'll get it on PC.

694
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
How much RAM does your video card have?

695
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I don't know. A lot. I need to get a new video card, but my video card's not...

696
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Remember, I totally redid my computer.

697
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It doesn't matter. You know what? I should be able to run it anyway.

698
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I redid my computer, like, two years ago, and it was top of the line then, so...

699
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's just... What it is is it's Square Enix, and they're shitty ports, is what it is.

700
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But I don't think this is shitty. It's just that's one little hiccup with it.

701
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Okay. Unoptimized ports.

702
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay, I'll agree with that. Unoptimized. Good.

703
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
All right. I think we're going to get into some of the news.

704
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Usually I would talk about housekeeping here.

705
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I don't have a whole lot to say besides you follow us on Twitter.

706
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook.

707
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

708
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And we will not be here. The last weekend in March will be gone that week.

709
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So... But otherwise, we should be here.

710
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Even though it's killing us, because Dark Soccer and I just found out

711
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
that Trixie Mattel is going to be here in SAC two weeks from tonight.

712
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yep.

713
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But we love y'all so much, we're going to do O-L-R anyway.

714
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But it's Sunday, March 25th. I'm not going to be here.

715
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We all need to go to Ready Player One.

716
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
We need to do O-L-R at the movies.

717
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We haven't done O-L-R at the movies in a while.

718
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We need to go see Ready Player One.

719
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I want to see it.

720
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
We all went on a Thruple date to Avatar.

721
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah.

722
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So let's go see Ready Player One. Let's do it.

723
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Opening night. Yes, let's do it.

724
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
When's opening night?

725
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I hate seeing movies opening night.

726
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I hate opening night.

727
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But I'll do it.

728
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Whatever, I'm going to go see opening night.

729
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's the one reason I haven't gone to see Black Panther.

730
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah, we're waiting a couple of weeks to go see it.

731
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's like, I just saw Lady Bird today.

732
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That movie's been out for like three months.

733
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'll see Black Panther in May.

734
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
For opening nights, I have to get off work.

735
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh, yeah.

736
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Because I work late.

737
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We'll try to make something work.

738
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

739
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah.

740
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Alright, anyways.

741
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Alright.

742
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah, let's do it.

743
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Let's get into the news.

744
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Start us off with some gaming news, Logie.

745
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THQ Nordic announced today that they had purchased Koch Media.

746
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,600
So, if you may not know, Koch owned the rights to Saints Row, Metro, and Dead Island, which

747
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,000
were previously owned by the old THQ, which went bankrupt and sold off all their assets.

748
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So it's like THQ buying old THQ stuff.

749
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So now it's back under THQ Nordic again.

750
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So it's like they went back to the pawn shop and bought their ring that they had pawned

751
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
a few weeks ago.

752
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Sort of, yes.

753
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay.

754
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah, so it's like it's back now.

755
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But, I mean, technically it's kind of new people, but it's just kind of interesting

756
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
how it's kind of moved in that.

757
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah.

758
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It is interesting.

759
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I watched a little video today about Saints Row and this guy's essay about why the franchise

760
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
just kind of died, and I completely agree with all of it.

761
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's basically just, especially like they're talking about, see, I can't even remember

762
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
their stupid game that they had.

763
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Not Saints Row game.

764
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's whatever.

765
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's so, so good.

766
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Agents of Mayhem.

767
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Agents of Mayhem.

768
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Thank you.

769
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yes.

770
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It was so good that the name just really stuck in my brain.

771
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yes.

772
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Agents of Mayhem was supposed to be this thing that was completely a brand new IP.

773
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah, they couldn't get away from Saints Row.

774
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And really, with Saints Row, it's always been kind of like a copycat game where originally

775
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
it's like, okay, yeah, it's this game that's going to be kind of like Grand Theft Auto

776
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
San Andreas, and then it kind of went over the top.

777
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And it's like, well, now Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5 are out.

778
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And it's like, well, shit, what are we going to do?

779
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Let's just go more over the top.

780
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And it just didn't work.

781
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It just, it kind of lost sight of what it was supposed to be.

782
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And now that he tried to do this spinoff.

783
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I did love the over-the-topness of Saints Row, but to be fair, I don't even remember

784
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
if I started four.

785
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I mean, I love three.

786
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I laughed so fucking hard at three.

787
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
No, three was good.

788
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Three was all right.

789
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
There was some room for improvement, but it was okay.

790
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I liked that game.

791
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That was fine.

792
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
That skydiving sequence.

793
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I cried.

794
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah.

795
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I cried from laughing so hard.

796
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Four, though, was just like, they basically slapped it.

797
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It was the time that basically they were getting, from what I hear, it was they were getting

798
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
pressured because originally four was supposed to be DLC for three.

799
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And it's very obvious that it was.

800
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And they're like, well, instead of putting out DLC, you need to flush it out into a full

801
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
game and make that its own game.

802
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And that was kind of a problem.

803
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
PJ Technomage in our chat at live.vognetware.com says, I've never finished a single Saints

804
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Row game.

805
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah, you and me both.

806
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But I have this problem inherently with all games.

807
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Like if I finish a video game, that is really a testament because I am definitely the type

808
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
of person that's like, I'm going to play this game.

809
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm going to play this game.

810
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Ooh, shiny!

811
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Something new is out.

812
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Have you played Grand Theft Auto 5 yet?

813
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I did, but I didn't beat it.

814
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That's for sure.

815
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I should play it more.

816
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But I at least started it.

817
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

818
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That's something.

819
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
That's something.

820
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I have actually finished all of the Saints Row games, so I can say that.

821
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But then my problem is fucking MMOs.

822
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's weird because I'll keep playing MMOs forever and ever, even though you can't beat

823
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
it.

824
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But it's something about that social element.

825
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Like, that's the thing.

826
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The social element can't be beat.

827
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And I think when I have played more console games, like, oh, here's a great example.

828
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Mass Effect 3, right?

829
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I beat that entire fucking trilogy, and that's a great testament to how good those games

830
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
were, right?

831
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
But then Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, I still played for a very long time, but that's because

832
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I had a lot of friends that were playing it.

833
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It was a social thing.

834
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I remember a problem with Saints Row 3.

835
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
That's right.

836
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Saints Row 3, I thought, was a spoiler, but it's been out forever.

837
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They kill off the big bad guy in the beginning pretty fast.

838
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Like he's just knocked out.

839
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And just in a really shitty way, it's just like, and now he's dead.

840
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And then this other guy that's not quite as good as the main bad guy becomes the big bad

841
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
guy, and then you fight him a bunch of times, and it was just kind of, eh, it's lame.

842
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But then they tried to do too much, too.

843
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
They just threw everything together that didn't necessarily fit.

844
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It was like, now there's zombies for no reason.

845
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Now there's this.

846
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Now there's this.

847
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It's just, it didn't quite work.

848
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Interesting conversation in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

849
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Vidpower says, we all have those comfort games that we keep playing despite new games coming

850
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
out.

851
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And PJ Technomage says, civilization for me.

852
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's another one, though, that can be very social.

853
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Like the easiest way to pull me back into civilization is some of my Bay Area friends

854
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
going, we randomly decided to play Civilization 4 tonight.

855
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
We did.

856
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Cool.

857
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And then now I'm up until 3 a.m. playing Civilization.

858
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Those games, you know, they don't end.

859
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I haven't gotten into Civilization yet.

860
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh, they're so good.

861
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
That's probably a good thing.

862
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Isn't Civ 4 free on Twitch Prime, question mark?

863
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I have them in my library.

864
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Okay.

865
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Here in my Steam library.

866
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I've got, I may have Civ 5.

867
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I bought the Civilization Humble Bundle a while back.

868
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Chatters, where's Civ 4 free right now?

869
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I swear I saw something on that.

870
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Is Rageinator here?

871
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
He knows where the free games are.

872
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I swear I saw Civ 4 free somewhere.

873
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It wasn't GOG.

874
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I know GOG's been giving away a lot of free stuff lately, but it was somewhere else that

875
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
was giving it away.

876
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I think it was Twitch Prime.

877
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I really feel like it was that.

878
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But I hope, you know, I know the new Metro game's coming out.

879
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Thank you.

880
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Act F confirmed it.

881
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Thank you.

882
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Thanks, Chatters.

883
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,720
The new Metro game looks pretty nice, so that's going to be something that's coming out.

884
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,720
And I really do hope that there is a new Saints Row someday.

885
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,520
Just stop it with the Agents of Mayhem thing.

886
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,040
That just did not work at all.

887
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,000
But I would like a new Saints Row game.

888
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Well, another game that maybe folks will be looking forward to.

889
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,080
How about a non-EA Star Wars game?

890
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:44,720
So this is some pretty big fallout from the loot box controversy that kind of shot Battlefront

891
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
in the foot.

892
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,400
Now, I do want to stress this is a rumor.

893
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,240
I will tend to cover these a little more on a slower news week, which this week has been.

894
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,480
So again, take it with a grain of salt.

895
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,760
But the word going around is that EA is, or excuse me, I'm sorry, Disney is rumored to

896
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,480
be speaking with two other developers besides EA.

897
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,440
These developers are Ubisoft and Activision.

898
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,480
What I also found interesting about this is that the outlet that I saw this on that's

899
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,520
reporting this is My Nintendo News.

900
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,140
And one interesting thing they're saying about the Ubisoft and Activision partnership is

901
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,680
that if one of these two were to go through, we'd be likely to get the Star Wars games

902
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,200
on the Nintendo Switch, which I thought was a very interesting kind of tongue in cheek

903
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,680
little thing there because we all know that EA kind of left Nintendo at the altar with

904
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,180
the Wii U, right?

905
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,660
They got up on stage at that E3 and they're like, fuck yeah, we're going to support the

906
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,660
Wii U.

907
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,260
And then they put out, you know, some pretty shoddy ports of year old games and they were

908
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,660
like, wow, none of these things are selling.

909
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,820
We don't know why they're not.

910
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,940
The Wii U is a disaster, everybody.

911
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,020
What's going on?

912
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,420
And then EA just left Nintendo at the altar and EA hasn't really supported the Switch

913
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
with the same intensity.

914
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,460
I realize they're kind of throwing the Switch a bone here and there with like FIFA ports

915
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,140
and stuff, but they're not as invested in the Switch as say Ubisoft is right now.

916
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:19,140
So isn't that interesting that perhaps Disney wants to let Ubisoft make a Star Wars game

917
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,020
because that would mean a Star Wars game on the Nintendo Switch, which is kind of the

918
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,340
hot console right now.

919
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,240
I realize there's a lot of love out there for PlayStation 4 and some for the Xbox One

920
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,640
X and PC stuff as well, but certainly the Switch is growing and growing.

921
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,020
It's already outsold the Wii U completely.

922
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,700
And I think there's a lot of people that would like to see a Star Wars game on the Switch.

923
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,260
Nintendo doesn't have the online system to support loot boxes very well.

924
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,140
They want to tap that younger audience so that they can be involved in all Star Wars

925
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
things.

926
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,140
Sure.

927
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,140
So, uh, yeah, I, I'd be very interested to see what happens with all this.

928
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:01,260
And it's also kind of fascinating that EA might lose their exclusive hold on Star Wars

929
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,780
over what happened in Battlefront.

930
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,660
Like we're starting to see the results of all that bad press.

931
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,340
So as they should, it's been mismanaged for two games now.

932
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
Yeah.

933
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
So ouch.

934
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:19,220
Jamie, would you, would you be interested in a Star Wars game from Ubisoft on the Switch?

935
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,580
I haven't been interested in a Star Wars game in a very long time, Rob.

936
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,740
Since 1981 in vector graphics.

937
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,740
Not even then.

938
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,740
What?

939
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,740
I love that game.

940
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,740
Oh my God.

941
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,100
Did you know, and I didn't even know this tangent time, slow news week.

942
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,940
I'm talking about like super return of the Jedi tangent train pulling into the station.

943
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,940
Choo choo.

944
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,940
Okay.

945
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,780
Um, I didn't even know this in old town sack because, um, some friends were visiting from

946
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
out of town.

947
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,700
So I did the tourist thing and I went to old town sack with them this weekend, right there.

948
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,700
They have a classic game arcade in this toy shop.

949
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,820
I didn't even know.

950
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,380
Was there a, I didn't even know there was a toy shop in old town now be there's a classic

951
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,380
arcade in the back.

952
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,580
I remember in toy shop being there, but I didn't know they had a, it's small.

953
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:04,020
It's like one tiny little room, but the reason why I bring it up, they had a star Wars machine,

954
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,620
original vectors, graphics, right?

955
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,580
50 cents a play.

956
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,540
And tiger claws entirely wrong says that I'm more of a star Trek fan than a star Wars fan.

957
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,540
You are wrong.

958
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:20,080
They have a classic arcade down in, uh, I am a doctor who fan and that's classic doctor

959
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,080
who.

960
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,660
And also for the record, star Wars was the first movie I had ever been taken to.

961
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,860
I was nine months old.

962
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,700
So you cannot say that star Trek is bigger in my heart than star Wars.

963
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,060
You can say that about me.

964
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,260
I like, I prefer Star Trek assumptions when you know nothing Jon Snow, but I don't, I

965
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,820
don't hate star Wars by any means.

966
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,820
I like star Wars a lot.

967
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,620
I still need to see episode eight, but again, I just saw lady bird today.

968
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,620
So maybe we'll go see episode eight next week.

969
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,660
Lady bird was great.

970
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,200
Is episode eight still playing anywhere?

971
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,200
It's gotta be somewhere.

972
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:58,260
Um, sunrise mall, sunrise doesn't have a really, I don't think, you know, I looked there.

973
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,780
I honestly looked at the movies playing there calling it by those numbers.

974
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,780
All right.

975
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,220
Well, anyway, uh, so, but I like star Trek a lot.

976
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,420
In fact, what am I going to do tonight?

977
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,020
There's no discovery to watch tonight.

978
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,820
I'm a little, what do I do with myself?

979
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,700
You can watch the new episodes of queer eye, which are all right.

980
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:22,860
But there's one that more, um, mortified is really good on, um, I forget that you and

981
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,660
the wife like super dig queer eye for the straight guy.

982
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,100
I don't like the new series.

983
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,100
Okay.

984
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,100
Really?

985
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,100
You're the first person I've heard say that they don't like the new one.

986
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:37,180
Well, yes, that that's one, but two it's, they're like in the original queer eye, it

987
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:42,260
was really kind of Carson was kind of the only one that was like annoying, I guess sometimes

988
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,420
like he was just kind of would play up stuff and it'd be ridiculous and all that.

989
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,980
But in the new series, all of them do it and it's, it's so irritating and annoying that

990
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:57,780
they just waste so much time and it's just like go on these tangent things in the show.

991
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,820
It's like, okay dude, tone it down as a smidge.

992
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,700
It's just a little much, man.

993
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:09,660
I hate it when my favorite shows go on tangents anyway.

994
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,340
Let's get next to go to our next, at least I'm not sitting, you know, here simulating

995
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,660
childbirth like they did in the show.

996
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,620
That was something that they did in the show while this guy's Lee next to them going, dude,

997
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,020
what the fuck did I sign up for?

998
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,220
Like seriously, what the fuck is going on here?

999
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,380
To register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry radio at vog network.com

1000
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,060
use the pass phrase father.

1001
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,020
All right, let's go to our next story.

1002
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,820
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1003
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,460
Oh God.

1004
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:45,180
So sorry people who got certain copies of Bayonetta two on switch because the download

1005
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,380
codes were mis-parented.

1006
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,740
Oopsies.

1007
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:57,760
It was a download code to get Bayonetta one and some of these codes were printed incorrectly.

1008
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,240
So if it happened to you and you're listening and you hear this, go to support.nintendo.com

1009
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,040
and report it so that you can get your proper code.

1010
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:17,240
Um, it also said that you can call the Nintendo contact center at 800-255-3700, which when

1011
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,840
I was a kid, it was long distance and you had to talk to a game counselor, dude.

1012
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
They were fun though.

1013
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,680
I talked to all kinds of cool people who was some temp with a giant binder.

1014
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,200
My grandma was like, why are you calling, uh, why are you, why are you calling Washington?

1015
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:38,800
Um, reasons, but yeah, and it didn't have the internet back then and it's not particular

1016
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,800
batches of it.

1017
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,800
They went to certain retailers, they are multiple batches.

1018
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
So it's just a odd misprint.

1019
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,080
So if it happened to you, you're not alone.

1020
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,860
Well I need to try my ice, my Bayonetta is still in the box cause I'm kind of waiting

1021
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,920
on it until I have had my fill of secret of mana streaming and then I'm going to go over

1022
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,000
to Bayonetta.

1023
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,640
So I haven't, I should try to cash in my code.

1024
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,520
I wouldn't want to get left out in the cold.

1025
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,000
Thou shalt do such a thing.

1026
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,720
I would be very sad if I got shut out of drinking my shot of wine now.

1027
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,720
That's right.

1028
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,820
If you're just joining us, uh, it is national wine day, uh, the 18th here.

1029
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,960
So we're, if I seem a little out of it tonight, it's because I'm now two glasses in.

1030
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,960
Cheers.

1031
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,160
Three sheets to the wind, three sheets to the wind.

1032
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,400
No, my wine does not come in a box.

1033
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,920
No, it's, it's frivolous.

1034
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,920
It's delicious.

1035
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,920
No judgment.

1036
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,480
If you change their bottles, Robin, that makes me sad in my heart.

1037
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,480
Why did they change the bottles?

1038
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,100
But I don't know.

1039
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,340
This is delicious and I miss being able to drink.

1040
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,340
We fear change.

1041
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,340
All right.

1042
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Loki.

1043
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,340
Next story.

1044
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:47,440
So kind of the topic of Star Wars Battlefront and the whole loot box controversy, Senator

1045
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,360
Maggie Hassan, the New Hampshire Democrat Senator.

1046
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:59,160
She wrote an open letter to the ESRB, urging them to review the completeness of the board's

1047
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:04,600
rating process and policies as they relate to loot boxes and then taking into account

1048
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,500
the potential harm these microtransactions may have on children.

1049
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:15,080
Of course, you know, the ESRB has made comment regarding, um, loot boxes in the past being

1050
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,980
that they don't really see the harm in it, but then again, you know, this is funded by

1051
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,300
the ESA, which is backing the games industry.

1052
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,100
And of course, you know, the games industry is making several billions of dollars off

1053
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,860
of these types of loot boxes and stuff.

1054
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,860
And so they don't want to see that cash cow go away.

1055
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,860
So it's going to be interesting.

1056
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:43,640
I see this as more of like, Hey, maybe you should take a look at this and consider regulating

1057
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,580
it because if you don't, yeah, we're going to, no, I, and that's really fascinating to

1058
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:53,700
me that, you know, now we have a, uh, say Senator or, or representative Senator.

1059
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,700
Okay.

1060
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,900
So that you have this Senator basically going with the ESRB saying, you might want to read

1061
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,820
about that thing you said about loot boxes not being a problem yet.

1062
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,060
You might want to reevaluate that.

1063
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,940
And that is definitely the equivalent of like a verbal warning.

1064
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,300
So I mean, that, that really says to me that the ESRB is under a lot of pressure to self

1065
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,260
regulate this because certainly she is not the first Senator to know.

1066
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,260
She's not.

1067
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,100
In fact, a lot of this has been on the state level.

1068
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,940
Is this, is she a state Senator or is she a national Senator thinks she's a state Senator.

1069
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,940
Okay.

1070
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,420
So still a lot of it's only been on the state level, but it's really just a matter of time

1071
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,420
before that buzz.

1072
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,900
Of course that would require our Congress to actually do something, but that's a whole

1073
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,140
nother tangent for another day.

1074
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:40,420
You could be done on the state levels if they have regulations on the state levels and how

1075
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,940
are you going to, I mean, that's still going to affect something if, if they go through.

1076
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,620
Because remember California passed something and that ended up getting overturned by the

1077
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,980
Supreme court in the end.

1078
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,820
Although I would say the whole loot box thing is all violent video was about the violent

1079
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,820
video game.

1080
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:02,300
And the fact that the standard was very nebulous when there already is an ESRB, which I am

1081
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,040
pretty sure was called out in the Supreme court decision that there was an ESRB, which

1082
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,420
is even more of the reason why, you know, a lot of these, you know, political folks

1083
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,980
look to the ESRB to regulate and fucking handle this stuff.

1084
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,380
Like it's your job to fix this.

1085
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,660
It's essentially what's being said.

1086
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,860
Well, at the same time, you know, like aside from, you know, government stepping in all

1087
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:29,060
this, it's just people that are consumers of these games have to consider that if you

1088
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,960
don't want this kind of stuff in these games, you know, bite the bullet and just don't buy

1089
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,020
the game.

1090
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,380
Like I was interested in Star Wars Battlefront because I wanted to try the single player

1091
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:42,300
campaign, which apparently was not very good.

1092
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,060
And then the whole loot box thing on top of that, I was like, well shit, I'm just not

1093
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,540
going to buy it.

1094
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:53,220
So I spoke with my wallet, but you know, like if there's say Grand Theft Auto six comes

1095
00:51:53,220 --> 00:52:00,280
out and it's just loot box shit, like all it's just loot boxes, just integrated entirely

1096
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
in the game.

1097
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,940
It's just obstructive, just like it is with Battlefront.

1098
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,340
Then maybe I'll have to pass.

1099
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,700
Well hopefully something they don't throw into loot boxes in the future is better graphics,

1100
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,740
but I think it's only a matter of time, right?

1101
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,940
You unlocked HD textures!

1102
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,860
They have textures, you unlocked skins, so.

1103
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,420
There's a big difference though, Loki, with that.

1104
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,100
The cosmetics are one thing.

1105
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,380
But anyway, the whole reason I make a silly transition like that is because over on the

1106
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:35,860
Xbox One X and the Xbox One S, 1440p support is coming in the near future.

1107
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:40,780
This is from Kevin Gamill, who's the program manager for Microsoft's Xbox platform partner

1108
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:47,240
group, and a tweet said, many questions recently around the timing of our 1440p support.

1109
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,540
Those of you in our early preview ring should be pleasantly surprised very soon if you have

1110
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,780
an Xbox One S or an Xbox One X, meaning that that support is coming very soon.

1111
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,760
Now you might be thinking, well what's the big deal because the Xbox One X does 4K gaming,

1112
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,580
so who gives a shit about 1440p?

1113
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:09,300
Well, you may notice I included the Xbox One S in that, which right now doesn't really

1114
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,580
support 1440p, but it sounds like it will, however, I do need to stress, and this is

1115
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:21,700
a big however, the 1440p for gaming is not going to be something for Xbox One S. I'm

1116
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,900
assuming that is the interface, so we'll look a little crisper, and maybe some of the, maybe

1117
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:31,380
like video playback and things like that, if you have a video that supports it.

1118
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,300
Are there TVs out there that support 1440p?

1119
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,660
I thought it was like computer monitors.

1120
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:40,580
Yeah, I think it's more computer monitors that support it, but the only 4K device in

1121
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,700
my house is a computer monitor, so I'm sure there's some people out there that do have...

1122
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:49,180
I just thought, like, you know, if it's a 4K TV, why would you want to output the 1440p?

1123
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,740
Well, maybe you have a 4K TV, but you only have an Xbox One S.

1124
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:58,340
I have a 4K TV and I don't have anything to utilize it other than the regular high def.

1125
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,940
So if, hypothetically, you have an Xbox One S, which is weird that the older Xboxes won't

1126
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,940
support it.

1127
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,340
Well, I look forward to those online advertisements and extra clarity.

1128
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:14,000
The only thing that I'm going to get 4K right now is when I get my 4K Apple TV, which, by

1129
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,540
the way, you can play Sonic CD on it.

1130
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,180
I keep forgetting there's games on Apple TV.

1131
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,180
And they're fun.

1132
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:26,220
I bought a controller, the SteelSeries controller to use on my Apple TV, and we freaking played

1133
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,420
through Sonic CD together on the Apple TV.

1134
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,660
Is there a lot of stuff on that?

1135
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,380
I haven't looked lately, but I just cared because I already owned Sonic CD, so I just

1136
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,380
installed it.

1137
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,340
I know there was that random harmonics game that was, like, only on Apple TV.

1138
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,340
Yeah.

1139
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,340
I never saw it anywhere else.

1140
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,340
That we immediately forgot about.

1141
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:45,140
Yeah, well, I personally just don't have an Apple TV, but for me...

1142
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,860
I'd sell you mine when I buy my new one.

1143
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,940
Well, my game consoles do everything.

1144
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,860
What's my Apple TV going to do?

1145
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,300
Drag Race.

1146
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,340
Actually, I may...

1147
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,820
Is there a VH1 app or something?

1148
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,140
No, I just have bought the season.

1149
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,820
Oh, I use...

1150
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:03,780
It's the one thing that I can actually use the Xfinity on demand for, is I can watch

1151
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,860
All Stars 3 at five o'clock, because you can get it as soon as it hits the East Coast.

1152
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,260
I just usually watch it the next day after everyone spoiled it for me.

1153
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,260
Annoying.

1154
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,140
All right, let's move on to another story.

1155
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,940
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1156
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,460
Well, I was disappointed that I had no Bitcoin.

1157
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,460
I thought I had one.

1158
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,460
Yeah, I was going to ask whatever happened with that.

1159
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,460
I thought I had it.

1160
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:29,540
I thought you had like 25 Bitcoin, and I was like, bitch, you're a millionaire.

1161
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,740
Well, I thought that I did.

1162
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,740
That was an error.

1163
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,740
Of course.

1164
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,740
And it was...

1165
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,740
You would have needed it.

1166
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,740
Yeah.

1167
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,740
If she didn't sell it that week, I told her, then now she'd be a thousandaire.

1168
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,340
And then it was like, it ended up, I had like a Dogecoin.

1169
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:44,260
Oh, you had the Dogecoin.

1170
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,620
That's so worth something, isn't it?

1171
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,100
They gave away a ton of Dogecoin at Gamers.

1172
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,260
I think the value of Dogecoin went way up.

1173
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,300
Like it was worth like next to nothing.

1174
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,380
And now maybe it's a nickel.

1175
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,380
No.

1176
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,380
At any rate...

1177
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,380
You have a fucking Litecoin.

1178
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,940
Well, and it took me like an hour to get back into my old wallet because it was the old

1179
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,500
style wallet.

1180
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,780
Even I think I have Dogecoin too.

1181
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,460
Well, I'm not worried.

1182
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,340
Fuck if I know how to get in my wallet.

1183
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,980
Well, I figured out how to get back into my Bitcoin wallet.

1184
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,980
And that was interesting.

1185
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,980
Oh, I don't have Bitcoin.

1186
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,980
Because you had to...

1187
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,980
Thankfully, I don't.

1188
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,620
You had to do like these words and they had to be perfect.

1189
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,620
Oh, wow.

1190
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:30,060
But anyway, if anyone is regretting their lack of Bitcoin right now, there is a game

1191
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:37,300
that is offering a shot at winning one Bitcoin, which is about 10 grand.

1192
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,380
The game is on Steam for $1.99.

1193
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,460
And actually it's on sale on the release date for 40% off.

1194
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,460
You can get it for $1.19.

1195
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,620
But it's called Monte Crypto, the Bitcoin Enigma.

1196
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,980
It looks like it's first person and has 24 puzzles.

1197
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:56,420
But the first person to beat it will win one Bitcoin.

1198
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,300
So hey, you want 10 grand?

1199
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,380
Play this game that they're trying to bribe you to play.

1200
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,660
I don't think Bitcoin is still worth 10 grand.

1201
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,500
I think Bitcoin came down a bit.

1202
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,660
But maybe it'll go back up.

1203
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,660
I don't know.

1204
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:12,220
Like, it's so hard to fucking know these days what's going to happen with the cryptocurrency.

1205
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,860
It's been pretty volatile.

1206
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,860
Yeah.

1207
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:15,860
Who cares?

1208
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,460
It's more than the price of the game.

1209
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,580
You still end up in positive.

1210
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,580
Yeah, fair enough.

1211
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:23,420
But they'd have to sell, even at that rate, because this is at the time the article was

1212
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,820
printed, they'd have to sell 5,000 copies of the game.

1213
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,540
So good luck.

1214
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,820
It has a fun name.

1215
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,260
I like Monte Cristo sandwiches.

1216
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,420
Oh, Bobby tells me I'm wrong.

1217
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,420
There's a big surprise.

1218
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,140
And that Bitcoin is $10,566 right now.

1219
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:44,220
I swear I saw just in the last week it had dropped to like $600 or something like that.

1220
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,140
No, maybe $6,000 or something.

1221
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,660
I thought it dropped a lot.

1222
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,660
Yes, girl.

1223
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
Okay.

1224
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,660
It's that volatile.

1225
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,660
Okay.

1226
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,660
So I'm not crazy.

1227
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,660
It has been going up and down like a lot.

1228
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,660
Okay.

1229
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,660
All right.

1230
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,660
Okay.

1231
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,660
Thank you.

1232
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,660
Chatters.

1233
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,660
Chatters are meeting me halfway.

1234
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,220
Yes, it did go down, but it went back up.

1235
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:06,460
You know, though, if I had had Bitcoin and I sold it when the whole thing was going down

1236
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,100
and I had a million bucks, do you know that you can technically live off the interest

1237
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,300
of a million dollars and not have to work?

1238
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,300
You have to live frugal frugally.

1239
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,300
Yeah.

1240
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,580
I was gonna say, can you still do it in today's standards?

1241
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:23,020
Like I know that's something you used to be able to do, but like it takes more to live

1242
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:27,060
on in this day and age than it used to, but what I would do is I would actually pay off

1243
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:33,460
my house and then I would find a part time job and write a book.

1244
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,540
I don't know if I could ever not work.

1245
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,540
Okay.

1246
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,540
You ready?

1247
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,540
You ready for another tangent train?

1248
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,340
Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, slow news week tangent train, choo choo.

1249
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:45,340
And this story literally involves trains.

1250
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,380
Oh, that's cause you went to the train museum.

1251
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,380
I did.

1252
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,840
Again, I had friends from out of town.

1253
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
Is PJ still listening?

1254
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
Hello.

1255
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Hiya.

1256
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
If Kevin's out there too.

1257
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
Hi.

1258
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
Hello.

1259
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
Hello.

1260
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
Uh, so they were visiting from out of town.

1261
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,820
So we went to old town and we went to the train museum because PJ is a fan of trains.

1262
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,260
You know, the train museum is the first time I ever saw a midnight person in person.

1263
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,260
No.

1264
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,260
True story.

1265
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,260
Anyway.

1266
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:11,860
So anyway, I went, I went to the train museum and one thing I forgot like about the train

1267
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,820
museum is that, you know, you can actually like, well, I didn't forget that you could

1268
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:18,500
walk into the trains, but as you do walk into the trains, there's actually people sitting

1269
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,820
there that work for the museum in the trains just to make sure you're not horsing around

1270
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,420
or trying to ruin anything, you know, protecting the integrity of the exhibits or like one

1271
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:32,020
of the ladies that was policing the dining car, she would actually play the dining chimes

1272
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,020
every few minutes.

1273
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,020
Cool.

1274
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,500
And she'd be like, and look what else you can play with the chimes.

1275
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,820
And she'd go, she played the NBC theme with the chimes.

1276
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:41,820
Funny.

1277
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,820
So anyway.

1278
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:43,820
Who remembers that?

1279
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,820
Silly stuff.

1280
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,780
But the reason why I say that and how it relates to what you were just saying is I was thinking,

1281
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,660
you know what?

1282
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,940
That's going to be me when I'm like 75, not that I'm literally going to work at the train

1283
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:58,820
museum, but I would bet I'm going to end up at some museum, like part time, like teaching

1284
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:03,160
people about that, doing like that volunteer stuff, because I don't ever see myself like

1285
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,580
not working either.

1286
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,580
Like not working is fun for probably a few weeks, maybe even a few months.

1287
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,520
But then I would think like, oh my God, I'm going to go crazy.

1288
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,160
You'll just add more podcasts.

1289
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,760
That's still working in a way.

1290
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:25,180
I actually super enjoyed my fun employment because at the time I was living rent free

1291
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:31,160
and I went to Disneyland a bunch and I pretty much just still did kind of whatever I wanted

1292
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,160
to.

1293
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,800
But what I should have done was started my book and I'm going to write that book.

1294
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,640
It's going to get started this year.

1295
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,640
Okay.

1296
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,680
I'm laughing hard over here because Tiger Claw may have got something wrong with you

1297
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,680
a minute ago, but he just got this very, very right.

1298
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,920
Tiger Claw says Rob will be at a podcast museum.

1299
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,300
That's pretty, pretty true.

1300
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,720
Back in my day, my friends and I sat around and we talked about video games.

1301
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,220
You know what a video game is Timmy?

1302
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,220
Get off my lawn.

1303
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,660
Get off my God damn lawn.

1304
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,380
Get off my hollow lawn.

1305
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:11,180
You would have holographic lawns that simulate the feeling of grass.

1306
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,340
What's a video grandpa?

1307
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:18,860
Like it would just be, everything's implanted in the chip in our brain now.

1308
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:24,700
I was talking about that with somebody today that we should have like our ability to use

1309
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,300
our driver's license like Apple pay.

1310
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:32,020
And then I was like, no, it's just going to be a little tattoo on our skin that has

1311
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,580
a QR code that you scan.

1312
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,620
In the words of Sasha Velour, don't joke about that.

1313
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,460
But it's already happening.

1314
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,460
They're already working on that technology.

1315
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,740
Did I tell you about the one tattoo I was thinking about getting?

1316
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,300
No.

1317
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:52,460
So they have this type of tattoo where you actually get a tattoo of a sound wave, a sound

1318
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,820
form tattooed on your body.

1319
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:59,340
And then you have an app on the phone that you can scan the sound form and it plays it.

1320
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:04,340
So I was thinking about, since I'm fortunate that I have a lot of audio of my mom from

1321
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:10,660
her appearances on this program, when she was around, I have considered getting something

1322
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,660
of hers tattooed.

1323
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,980
Here's the trick though, just so you know, because somebody in chat will correct me on

1324
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:15,980
it.

1325
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:19,660
Because you might be wondering like, wait a minute, how do you get the sound to be that

1326
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,660
crisp?

1327
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:26,020
It's all kind of an illusion, because it's not really, you are getting an accurate representation

1328
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,500
of the sound form.

1329
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,580
But all the app is doing is it's reading the kind of like the close, what it looks like,

1330
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:34,640
and then looking it up in the database and playing the sound.

1331
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,640
So it is kind of...

1332
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,940
It works kind of like a QR.

1333
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,900
It's yeah, you got it.

1334
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,360
It's what it is instead of a QR code.

1335
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,660
But I still kind of like the idea.

1336
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:47,740
I mean, even if it's not 100% accurate, I just love that idea.

1337
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,980
Because I am into sound, I do do podcasting.

1338
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,060
I think that's one of those things where I can't possibly see how I would regret that

1339
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,060
decision.

1340
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:00,500
See, I'm planning on having a medical QR code where, you know what I'm talking about?

1341
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,060
Where it used, it scanned.

1342
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,540
Oh, instead of life alert.

1343
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,540
Exactly.

1344
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,540
Yeah.

1345
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,340
Because I mean, by all rights, due to...

1346
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:12,500
So I'm sorry, life alert is I've fallen and I can't get up.

1347
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,500
Medic alert.

1348
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,500
Yeah, medic alert.

1349
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Is it working?

1350
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,500
Like the bracelets.

1351
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,500
It's not working.

1352
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,500
Like the bracelets.

1353
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:22,380
It would actually have a little label that says medical ID and a QR code on it that would

1354
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:27,800
bring up a page that you can update that lists your allergies, your surgeries, all the things

1355
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,860
like that without having them to invasively go into your phone for this information.

1356
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:36,100
And I recommend to everyone right now, I know we're going way off topic, but if you have

1357
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,500
a health app on your phone, keep it up the fuck to date because they do look at that

1358
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,500
information.

1359
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,500
Yeah.

1360
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
Mine is actually up to date too.

1361
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,700
So, um, that's a good advice if you ever are in an issue or what have you.

1362
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,700
Yeah.

1363
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,700
Yes, we are off topic tonight, but I warned them in the first five minutes it was national

1364
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,700
wine day.

1365
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,700
So you know what?

1366
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,900
Hey, I had my ounce of wine and I'm already, I've already lost it now, but I was pretty

1367
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,700
tipsy for about a good minute.

1368
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,380
We do have two hours.

1369
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,900
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio everybody.

1370
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,900
Uh, I can't.

1371
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,900
All right.

1372
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,900
So how about another story, Loki?

1373
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,000
All right.

1374
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,440
So I don't know what Atari is doing nowadays.

1375
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,400
I mean, it seems like that they're just trying to jump on all of the terrible bandwagons

1376
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,000
at the same time.

1377
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So you may remember that they have their Atari console coming out that we have still no fucking

1378
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,840
clue what the hell that is.

1379
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:32,000
Then they have their Kickstarter theme that they did crowdfunding for the roller coaster

1380
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,600
tycoon game that's probably going to suck for the switch.

1381
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:42,520
And now, now they're announcing that the Atari token is going to be their new cryptocurrency

1382
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,440
that they're going to offer people to buy cause that's the road to the future.

1383
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,000
Well maybe my doge coin will be worth something more than this.

1384
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah.

1385
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,880
So the Atari tokens.

1386
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,440
So you know, basically they announced, you know, share it was, they said, um, Oh my God,

1387
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,760
can I play yards revenge with the token?

1388
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,800
Is that, is that the joke?

1389
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:10,420
That like you buy this fake currency and you can play games online with it?

1390
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,600
I don't think so.

1391
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,680
I think that they're hoping that they're going to become rich from this.

1392
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,960
Why, why doesn't Atari just do the fucking obvious?

1393
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,240
Like what I just said, like why not really give that cryptocurrency some value right

1394
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,240
off the bat?

1395
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,160
Like, look, I'm not, I'm not trying to shade on cryptocurrency.

1396
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:31,400
I understand it's a, it's a thing that a lot of people are into and I even, even my, to

1397
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,340
an extent I'm like, okay, Bitcoin is making more and more sense to me, especially when

1398
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:39,800
you explained it a few weeks ago, Jamie, um, and made the whole analogy with like, uh,

1399
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,360
X-Box points or whatever they were called.

1400
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:45,600
Like, you know, I think that makes a lot of sense, but Bitcoin is only worth what Bitcoin's

1401
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,120
worth because more and more places are accepting Bitcoin.

1402
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:55,120
But like if Atari right off the bat said, you can use this Atari coin for our rich catalog

1403
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,980
of Atari products, then it kind of has some inherent inherent value right off the bat.

1404
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,820
Even if it's small, even some value.

1405
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,760
Let's just assume that, you know, people are going to want to hold on to these Atari tokens

1406
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:11,240
because they're not sure that it's going to become, remember there's ways you could pay

1407
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,900
for pizzas and stuff with Bitcoin at one time.

1408
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,560
I bet the person that paid for pizza with that Bitcoin's probably regretting that quite

1409
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,560
a bit nowadays.

1410
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:27,160
Like I just fucking use cash and said, I spent $30,000 on that pizza.

1411
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:32,940
The same could be said that I didn't invest in my 401k enough money.

1412
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,080
I went to Disneyland instead.

1413
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,280
Um, and am I going to regret that when I'm 65?

1414
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,700
I might, but at the same time I got to go to fucking Disneyland.

1415
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:49,040
So Loki, what I'm trying to tell you is that that pizza was fucking good.

1416
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,040
Hope it was.

1417
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,040
Anyways.

1418
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,040
Yeah.

1419
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:56,880
So they're saying with that, um, you know, blocked blockchain technology is poised to

1420
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,480
take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize the

1421
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,160
current economic ecosystem, especially in areas of video game industry and online transactions.

1422
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,920
So because I don't understand enough about blockchain and ship, how is it that we're

1423
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,560
just creating money from nothing?

1424
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,760
I mean, it's what I want to know.

1425
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,320
Cause like if we can just create money from nothing, then I guess I should just come out

1426
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,600
my coin and sell that and stuff.

1427
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,600
I know.

1428
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,600
Oh, a VoG coin.

1429
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,920
Is that what you, you want a VoG coin?

1430
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,920
I don't know.

1431
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,920
I mean, what's Bobby.

1432
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,400
Maybe if Atari VoG coin, can we get a book?

1433
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:38,040
If Atari can do it and Atari is just like, I can already see it's just like, I can already

1434
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,120
see the disapproving look on Bobby's face and the art style.

1435
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:45,560
The thing is, is that I don't think that Bitcoin was created from nothing technically.

1436
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:51,520
I think that it was created with a pool of real funds into creating this currency.

1437
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,880
Cause I mean, think about it.

1438
01:07:52,880 --> 01:08:00,440
The origins of coinage anyway, were a result of having something for a barter system.

1439
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:07,040
It was a unit of, instead of having physical goods to change, people would then use these

1440
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,680
as a token to exchange for other goods.

1441
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,640
So it's basically adding another layer into the barter system.

1442
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:20,840
And then from there, now all society will, unless you are extremely, extremely communist,

1443
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,600
you know, works on this now system of currency.

1444
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,440
They've just taken that system of currency to work the way, almost like our credit cards

1445
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,440
do.

1446
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:37,700
Except our credit cards work on debt, whereas Bitcoin is, it's not, while it may not have

1447
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:42,440
physical substance, it's as substantial in currency as having coinage.

1448
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,440
Makes sense.

1449
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,440
Yeah.

1450
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:49,400
Akuma JP kind of adds to your thought saying money was just a paper, if not for banks.

1451
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,400
So kind of a...

1452
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,880
Well, what happened?

1453
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:57,120
Jamie just did the actual Oprah gif that you may have seen where Oprah just kind of goes,

1454
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,120
there you go.

1455
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,120
There you go.

1456
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:04,480
But the other thing too is, I mean, if you want to have another prime example of this,

1457
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,080
let's just use American history here for a second.

1458
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,800
Confederate money.

1459
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,600
They created the money for the Confederacy when the Confederacy died, the money became

1460
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:22,200
worthless except as, you know, to collectors or after World War One, the Deutschmark because

1461
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:28,320
the company, the country was so impoverished, their money was nothing.

1462
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:33,440
People were using Deutschmarks to actually use as kindling because they were worth nothing.

1463
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,920
So I mean, there you go.

1464
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:40,740
It only has the value ascribed to it by whatever financial institution is behind it and the

1465
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,760
power of the country it's in.

1466
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,760
So...

1467
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,200
Or commemorative plates.

1468
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,160
Bobby Blackwolf in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm trying to figure out if I really

1469
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:55,860
want to take my old tokens from Electronica, the experience at Disney California venture,

1470
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:00,080
and put the VOG logo on it and give them to you as a VOG coin.

1471
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,840
You know, there's kind of a, there's a double meaning there though, because remember when

1472
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,520
VOG was born, when the idea came out that this is a thing that should be happening.

1473
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,640
It was at Disneyland at Electronica.

1474
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,640
So...

1475
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,020
Well, and I do agree with JD that's either collector's items or racist tokens as back

1476
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:22,840
to the Confederate money, but there also are historians who collect.

1477
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:28,200
There is historic value in it, even though that history is not a pleasant one to always

1478
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,200
confront.

1479
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:37,520
I also do know people who collect defunct coinage and you know, have like old Roman coins, old,

1480
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,560
you know, even the, you know, little stone coins, you know, from other cultures.

1481
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,160
One man's trash is another's treasure.

1482
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,160
Right?

1483
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,160
Yeah.

1484
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:54,060
Anyway, let's move on to, it's not cryptocurrency, something completely different.

1485
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,200
It's VR.

1486
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,280
And this is the interesting headline out there.

1487
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,880
Nintendo president is interested in VR, but says nothing interesting has been done yet

1488
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,880
with the tech.

1489
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,280
Well, that, that comment's just leading itself over to, what do you mean nothing interesting

1490
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,280
has been done?

1491
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,280
No, no, no, no, no.

1492
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,860
Well, hold on.

1493
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:15,400
So here's the quote from Tatsumi Kimishima, who of course is the president of Nintendo

1494
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,900
right now.

1495
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:22,680
He said in this tweet, I guess that came from Japanese Nintendo, was this in an interview

1496
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,680
or something?

1497
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,600
I'm not sure where the interview was or what have you.

1498
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,800
But the quote was, I understand that VR is interesting as a technology, and I am very

1499
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,040
interested in it.

1500
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,720
I will use it if I can make interesting things with it.

1501
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,720
We have not done anything interesting yet.

1502
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:43,760
So I'll give them that with, with the technology.

1503
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,760
Here's the thing.

1504
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,320
And this is what it really boils down to.

1505
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,760
And, and, you know, I'm going to take his words in another fashion and agree with it.

1506
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,720
And that is that VR does not yet have its Wii Sports.

1507
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,640
And that's what Nintendo, you know, really does.

1508
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,320
Well, A, they didn't invent the VR technology.

1509
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,360
They like to do this stuff with the new ways to game that they invent.

1510
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,000
But if Nintendo can kind of find that must have way to incorporate VR, that must have

1511
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,920
game or kind of see that must have game out there, then they're going to jump on board

1512
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,920
with it.

1513
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,520
Are you telling me that VR chat isn't the Wii Sports of VR?

1514
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:25,840
Regretfully, Loki, I'm sorry to inform you, don't think it is.

1515
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,840
I don't know.

1516
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,880
I think there's been plenty done with VR, but yeah, there's not like been any really

1517
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,720
killer apps have sold the platform.

1518
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,720
I think.

1519
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,880
I mean, there's been a lot of good games, but nothing like, you know, is the finding

1520
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,840
is like Mario Odyssey or something like that for VR.

1521
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,840
You don't, when you think of VR, you don't really think of like a particular game.

1522
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,600
It's more of just kind of an experience or platform.

1523
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,920
So I get it there, but also at the same time, it almost seems like that they're just defending

1524
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,920
themselves of the fact that they're not entering that market as like, Oh, nothing, nothing

1525
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,420
significant has been done yet.

1526
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,360
That's why we're doing what we're doing, you know, kind of thing.

1527
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,500
Cause they did the same thing or like other companies are the same thing with like motion

1528
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:09,960
controls or rumble or like HD and all that stuff.

1529
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:14,300
And they've made that argument like before where it's like, eh, here's the thing.

1530
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,880
Nintendo is in this position now that they don't have to defend their fucking choices.

1531
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,180
Four years ago, they needed to defend their fucking choices because the Wii U is not performing.

1532
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,720
The switch on the other hand is exceeding expectations in many ways.

1533
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,480
So whether we like it or not, Loki, and we've had this conversation a thousand times, even

1534
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,420
though you and I go back and forth all the time on Nintendo and things, they ought to

1535
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,520
be doing better.

1536
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,940
The reality is they're selling shit, tons of switches.

1537
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,140
They've got enough on it.

1538
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,300
That's fun to play.

1539
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,020
So VR be damned for them.

1540
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,940
They'll incorporate VR when it suits their narrative.

1541
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,260
That's what it boils down to.

1542
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:59,140
In the meantime, cardboard folded into interesting shapes to do crazy things.

1543
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:02,060
That is what Nintendo sees a market in instead.

1544
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:08,340
And it's like, and I'm not shading that because like a lot of people are like, wow, that's

1545
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,460
fucking neat.

1546
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:14,100
And even I'm like, I don't know if that's for me, but that is kind of fucking neat.

1547
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,220
And the more and more stuff I see them doing with it, like I did see that little like light

1548
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,400
gun thing they were doing.

1549
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,060
So I guess there's a new one they're doing with Labo is like a light gun.

1550
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,020
And I'm like, okay, that is kind of neat.

1551
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:27,740
It's just, I know it's a gimmick.

1552
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,780
It's a gimmick.

1553
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,900
It's a gimmick to sell a tech demo game.

1554
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:34,900
And honestly, I hope the games are good because that's where it's going to come down to.

1555
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:39,300
But it's like, no, it's an interesting concept, but no.

1556
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,780
I think the whole thing with Labo though, is that it has to have been in development

1557
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:49,180
for quite some time because, um, does anyone remember, um, when Nintendo for Wii U was

1558
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,300
talking about Project Giant Robot?

1559
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,300
Yeah.

1560
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,300
Yeah.

1561
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:58,500
And that game actually ended up, uh, looks like it's what got turned in to the Toy-Con

1562
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,500
2, the robot kit.

1563
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,500
Yeah.

1564
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,580
But at the same time, I think Nintendo just didn't want to maybe waste those resources

1565
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:07,360
when they saw the writing on the wall for the Wii U, it was just kind of like, well,

1566
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,720
how do we not lose what we've done here so far?

1567
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,720
And they, it was repurposed.

1568
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,320
I don't think it was like designed with Labo in mind or anything like that.

1569
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,640
And I think that kind of shit happens in the game industry all the time.

1570
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,800
Well shit, Overwatch, right?

1571
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,320
That game is fucking insane what that game's doing, right?

1572
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:29,640
Overwatch came from Project Titan, which got axed, you know, and we'll never know really.

1573
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,240
I mean, we, we've heard rumors and things of what Project Titan was, but all we know

1574
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,520
is that a lot of this stuff for Overwatch, like some of these maps and things were supposed

1575
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,080
to be like a part of Titan.

1576
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:45,000
And I think the, the game in Overwatch was like one element of Titan, but they instead

1577
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,200
put it into this like full flesh game.

1578
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:52,920
So anyway, long story short, sometimes these games are born from canceled things, you know,

1579
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,440
or they just, they, they evolve.

1580
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:01,080
So anyhow, uh, let's, let's, let's travel to a simpler time, shall we?

1581
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,540
There was, there was no virtual reality or anything like that.

1582
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:06,540
You know what there was?

1583
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,540
They tried.

1584
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:14,400
There was a power glove, which is a great transition into the classic peripheral of

1585
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,400
the month.

1586
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:20,040
Because usually every week on this show, uh, Dark Soccer's Steps into the Gaming Vault

1587
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:23,840
finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brat should be checking this game out.

1588
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,300
But in a 2017 twist, no one should use this.

1589
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,780
She did systems every month.

1590
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:33,800
And this year, 2018, she's doing one peripheral a month.

1591
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,800
So Dark Soccer.

1592
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,800
No one should use this one though.

1593
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,800
Okay.

1594
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,800
This is a bad peripheral.

1595
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
It is.

1596
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
And what I'm gonna-

1597
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,800
So wait, hold on.

1598
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,120
Bobby, see, sometimes we pick bad things, but I didn't pick that game.

1599
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,860
So that was a week you weren't here.

1600
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:46,860
All right.

1601
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:50,260
But, um, but I've decided that because it's kind of hard to find music to go with some

1602
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:56,340
of these, that I'm trying to pick like, I guess, music from the system, like Bios music

1603
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,380
or something.

1604
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,380
Uh-huh.

1605
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:03,340
So I picked the Sega CD Bios 2 because honestly it's awesome.

1606
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,540
But that's not the peripheral.

1607
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,540
The Sega CD is not the peripheral.

1608
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,540
But it worked on it.

1609
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,540
Okay.

1610
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,580
Well, what is the classic peripheral of the month?

1611
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:14,160
It is the Activator by Sega.

1612
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:23,420
And when I moved out here, we bought an Activator with Eternal Champions for $10 at Virgin.

1613
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,660
If you remember the old Virgin store that we had here.

1614
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:36,380
It was released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993, also known in the U.S. as the Genesis.

1615
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:44,140
And the technology was used in- similar technology was used in the Sega System 32 fighting game

1616
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:47,780
Dragon Ball Z VR versus.

1617
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:54,020
So it used your motion sensors to play the game.

1618
01:17:54,020 --> 01:18:00,060
But anyway, it was when a lot of companies were investing in virtual reality or I would

1619
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:05,220
more put this as augmented reality, but not the type of AR that we're used to using our

1620
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:11,820
phones, but as a way to immerse the movement of the player with the game, you know.

1621
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:17,900
And so the Activator was developed by a company called Interactive Light for Sega.

1622
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:23,300
And then it was- for those in Brazil, it was brought there by Tech Toy, but it was based

1623
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:29,140
off of a musical interest called the Light Harp that was conceived of by a person named

1624
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,140
Asaf Gerner.

1625
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:31,140
Did we know that?

1626
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,500
No, we did not.

1627
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:38,820
It had eight segments that put it together, made an octagonal ring that you place on the

1628
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:43,460
floor and then it fires beams of light upwards where-

1629
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,300
Just like a Para Para machine.

1630
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,140
Yes, I was getting to that.

1631
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,140
Sorry.

1632
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:52,860
It seems to me like also one of the influences for Para Para, at least the game versions.

1633
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:56,540
Para Para is by itself special.

1634
01:18:56,540 --> 01:19:02,860
So you would break the light beams by kicking or punching to send signals to the Mega Drive

1635
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:06,940
console and then it's supposed to, you know, repeat it in game.

1636
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:15,980
It's basically a giant control pad with your left, up, right, down, A, B, C, and start

1637
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:19,220
buttons mapped to those segments.

1638
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:25,820
They were marketing it as a martial arts simulator that it was supposed to work specifically

1639
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:32,300
with the fighting games, but a lot of games just did not work very well with it.

1640
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,980
And you could also distort those light beams by not having a flat ceiling.

1641
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:41,180
And we tried it in my house that had a vaulted ceiling at the time.

1642
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:46,100
I mean, we've still got vaulted ceilings now, but it really didn't work very well.

1643
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:51,940
And then, like I said, they revamped the activator for Dragon Ball Z VR versus and it had extra

1644
01:19:51,940 --> 01:20:00,940
sensors so that it could better, I guess, better read, you know, what was going on.

1645
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:03,820
And it was really popular.

1646
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:07,780
And it was also one of the first full body motion games because, you know, we've had

1647
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:14,500
several since then, like, well, we have Police 9-1-1 and wasn't there like a firefighting

1648
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,500
game or something?

1649
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Anyway.

1650
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:24,500
But there were some games that were designed for the activator and they were called Activated

1651
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:30,500
so there was best of the best championship karate, Eternal Champions, Greatest Heavyweights

1652
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,820
and Streets of Rage 3.

1653
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:37,500
It had support for Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter II, Special Champion Edition and Streets of

1654
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,280
Rage 2.

1655
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,180
And the Sega 32X versions of Mortal Kombat 2 also mentioned the activator by game but

1656
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,760
it didn't work very well.

1657
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:51,380
There were also a couple of unreleased games that were meant to be specifically used by

1658
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:56,980
the activator but were canceled called Air Drums and Bounty Hunter.

1659
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:59,480
And that's it.

1660
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,660
That was the activator.

1661
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:09,460
It came in this big red box that had all the, you know, 90s looking text that, you know,

1662
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,380
it glowed and had, you know, drop shadows and shit.

1663
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,580
So there you go.

1664
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,540
The activator.

1665
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:17,860
The flop of the week.

1666
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:24,540
Yeah, it was kind of shitty but an important, you know, peripheral nonetheless.

1667
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,220
Not all peripherals were great.

1668
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,820
Well, it's only slightly better than the U-Force.

1669
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,620
Hey, don't spoil what might be an upcoming.

1670
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,220
I did the U-Force last month.

1671
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,820
Oh, why did I...

1672
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:35,820
Girl.

1673
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:39,460
I thought for some reason you did the Power Glove the first month.

1674
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:40,460
I don't remember why.

1675
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:42,820
No, I haven't done the Power Glove yet because it's so bad.

1676
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:43,980
We talk about it so often.

1677
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,620
I'm trying not to do anything too terribly obvious.

1678
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:47,620
That's fair.

1679
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,620
But...

1680
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:49,620
That's fair.

1681
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,620
Because I can't...

1682
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:53,580
Because Para Para Biscuits, yeah, they're a peripheral but they were part of the arcade

1683
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,580
game.

1684
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:55,580
Yeah.

1685
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:56,940
I don't know.

1686
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:00,420
I'd like to have some suggestions from people like what is so shitty it deserves to be mentioned.

1687
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:05,140
I'm gonna say go to our Discord to shout those out.

1688
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:07,020
I kind of pay attention to the Discord.

1689
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,020
I pay close attention to it.

1690
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,020
It took me, what, three months to join it?

1691
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,020
Good job.

1692
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,020
You're finally on board.

1693
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,020
Yeah.

1694
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,020
Vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1695
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:18,740
I also, though, have my own channel in there too but I don't do anything with it.

1696
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:19,940
JD has a great question.

1697
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,540
Is it terrible peripherals only?

1698
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,540
No.

1699
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,540
No.

1700
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:26,100
This is gonna probably be a two-year segment.

1701
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,020
Oh, you're gonna stretch this into 2019.

1702
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,020
Because there's so many things.

1703
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:30,020
There are a lot.

1704
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:31,020
And I've run out of ideas.

1705
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,020
All right.

1706
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,020
OLR confirmed through 2019.

1707
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,020
We'll see.

1708
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,020
All right.

1709
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,380
Anyhow, we're gonna take a quick break, you guys.

1710
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:44,340
In 2020, I'm probably gonna do like video game-related endorsement of the month.

1711
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,580
Like Mario cereal or something.

1712
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,580
Video game commercial.

1713
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,580
Put them on.

1714
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,580
Now I'm gonna do endorsement.

1715
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:52,500
So that means I can also talk about Doki Doki Panic.

1716
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,500
And Wrecka.

1717
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,500
Sure.

1718
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,380
And we can talk about Cool Spot on the NES.

1719
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:57,380
I'd rather not.

1720
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,380
All right.

1721
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,380
We're gonna take a quick break, you guys.

1722
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:04,220
When we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio coming up, including we'll

1723
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:08,180
talk about some rapid-fire news, including some updates on Stardew Valley and Dragon

1724
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,500
Ball FighterZ.

1725
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,660
And then we'll talk a little bit about Overwatch.

1726
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:13,660
Why not?

1727
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,100
We already brought it up earlier in the show, so we'll talk about it a little more.

1728
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:21,100
All this and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1729
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:31,340
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.

1730
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:37,260
Episode number 719 of our show for this February the 18th of 2018.

1731
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,260
Already in progress.

1732
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:43,760
Let's get into, before we get into rapid-fire news, actually, I gotta ask Loki about this

1733
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,940
because I'm sure you've been following some of this news and it's been coming up on the

1734
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:47,940
Discord.

1735
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:52,580
We're talking about Discord before the break and definitely some folks talking about movies

1736
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:53,580
coming up.

1737
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,980
Ready Player One, of course, all those character posters are showing up and there's a lot more

1738
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:57,980
news about that.

1739
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:58,980
Yeah.

1740
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:02,300
Darsakha and I even saw the Ready Player One poster today at the theater, so it was like,

1741
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,780
that movie's getting closer.

1742
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:04,780
Getting hype.

1743
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,780
Excited for that?

1744
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:06,780
Yes, I'm very excited for it.

1745
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:07,780
So, here's another movie.

1746
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:11,300
I didn't even know this was happening, but apparently they're doing another Kung Fury

1747
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,300
movie?

1748
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,300
Yeah.

1749
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:17,100
So, is this just a remake of the short as a movie or is it a sequel?

1750
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:21,020
I think they're doing a full-length movie, but as a sequel.

1751
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,020
Okay.

1752
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:27,300
And apparently, and what I'm reading online, Michael Fassbender is in it.

1753
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,300
Is in it.

1754
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,300
We don't know what he's...

1755
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:30,300
Yes, he was in Shame.

1756
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,300
Yes, we all know that movie.

1757
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:37,980
I just want the soundtrack to still be done by Mitch Marder because it was, well, thanks

1758
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:44,340
to my friend Nikki, I've, I guess, discovered Retro New Wave, which is all that 80s style

1759
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,340
synth pop.

1760
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,540
And I've listened to some of his other stuff and it's amazing.

1761
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,100
Have you ever played Hotline Miami?

1762
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,100
Yeah.

1763
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,100
Okay, I was gonna say.

1764
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:57,500
Because, I mean, they have him or Future Cop or Droid Bishop on that soundtrack, or even

1765
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,300
pull Stan Bush out of retirement, you know.

1766
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,500
Is Hasselhoff confirmed for this one?

1767
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,500
Yes, he is.

1768
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,500
Yes.

1769
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:11,860
And then I saw a good old Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of this state that kind

1770
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:16,780
of had a disgraceful exit, but he's back doing movies again, so he's gonna be doing Kung

1771
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,780
Fury.

1772
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:18,780
Yeah.

1773
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,900
I'm gonna take Andrew Kossing's role, the Thor God.

1774
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,420
I hope Schwarzenegger is not there to take that role.

1775
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,180
No, I think he's supposed to play someone else.

1776
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:32,860
I hear you might, I think he might even be the villain or something like that.

1777
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,860
Oh shit, okay.

1778
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:34,860
Maybe.

1779
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:35,860
Nice.

1780
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:40,980
So, I don't know, but yeah, he's not, no, he's not gonna take Thor's role or anything.

1781
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,900
As long as that arcade machine comes back.

1782
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:48,140
Well, he got killed in the first one, didn't he?

1783
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:52,140
There's always a chance that more of them will come back, but yeah, it, it, I'm excited

1784
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,140
about it.

1785
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:57,460
Um, of course that's so far off, you know, um, we'll have to see when that comes out,

1786
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:02,180
but I hope they don't replace the guy that plays Kung Fury because I understand Fastbenders

1787
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:06,380
into, but like at what they didn't say, he is Kung Fury.

1788
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,380
So I don't know.

1789
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,780
No, I don't know.

1790
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:12,380
I guess we still have some time to find out, but I just, I'm kind of shocked that they're

1791
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,280
getting like all this big talent very suddenly.

1792
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:21,040
So because it's a cheat, it, it's more of like, it's a fun project.

1793
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,880
I think at this point when you've done so many big things, when you've made Assassin's

1794
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,440
Creed, what else is left to like, look at like almost forcing your perfect example or

1795
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,600
his words to nigger and Jackie Chan or in like some Chinese film or something when he

1796
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,960
plays like this general guy in that as well.

1797
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,520
It's just kind of like fun projects.

1798
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,120
It's not necessarily like they've made their money.

1799
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:44,040
I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger at this point kind of has to make fun of himself.

1800
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,760
Like there's really nothing left for him.

1801
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,520
I think, yeah, I mean, you take some roles for money and you take some roles because

1802
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,520
they're just fun.

1803
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,240
They're just stupid, weird or something.

1804
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,240
I don't know.

1805
01:26:54,240 --> 01:27:01,240
So, um, but yes, I am incredibly excited about, um, Ready Player One.

1806
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,240
All right.

1807
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,840
So lots of stuff going on in gaming.

1808
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:07,840
And then we saw also a poster for Tomb Raider cause that's just, I didn't realize how close

1809
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,840
that movie.

1810
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:09,840
I didn't even know it was coming out.

1811
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,840
Yeah.

1812
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,800
And if you saw, well, I don't know if you've seen the new trailer for Ready Player One.

1813
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:19,240
They have that play in front of, um, Black Panther right now as well, Linzels online.

1814
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:23,280
But uh, there is a cameo from Hello Kitty and Batsmaru in there.

1815
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,280
Woo.

1816
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,280
No, I haven't seen the new trailer.

1817
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,480
No, there is a small cameo.

1818
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:33,560
I saw every, we, every single trailer we saw today were the exact same trailer except for

1819
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,560
one.

1820
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,560
There was one, the one about the Quantum Leap.

1821
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,040
It was Quantum Leap for teenagers.

1822
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,040
That's what it was.

1823
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,480
It was the, what was it called?

1824
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,480
Everyday.

1825
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,480
Was that the name of the movie?

1826
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,480
With the pink song in the trailer.

1827
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,480
What?

1828
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,080
It was like, every day I'm waking up in a different body and I'm falling in love with

1829
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,080
you.

1830
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,940
It looked like some teenage movie, but like the main character was all these different

1831
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:55,240
people that was, yeah, it actually was the most interesting out of all the trailers.

1832
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:59,440
I liked the one about, but I also fucking love pink and I love that song.

1833
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,440
Like the song is so good.

1834
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,440
Yeah.

1835
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,440
I want to see that one.

1836
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,880
I kind of want to see the black comedy though.

1837
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:04,880
The yeah.

1838
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,320
And then we, we see all these other trailers and what's, what's the other one we saw twice

1839
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,340
now with the, it's like Charlie and the horse or something.

1840
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:15,220
And I leaned over and I was pick up Pete, pick up here.

1841
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:21,340
I leaned over and I whispered in Jamie's ear, you know, he's going to fuck that horse because

1842
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:24,740
the whole trailer is like, I'm going to take my horse.

1843
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:25,740
I love you.

1844
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:26,740
I'm going to take this horse.

1845
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:27,740
I'm going to leave.

1846
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:28,740
Yeah.

1847
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:29,740
But you know what my reply was?

1848
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,480
Steve Buscemi is randomly in it too.

1849
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,480
Catherine the Great.

1850
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,480
He ain't.

1851
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,480
No.

1852
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,820
Unfortunately it's not the horse.

1853
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,060
The horse is not, it's not a Mr. Ed thing going on.

1854
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:42,260
It's supposed to be like a legit movie that I suppose maybe we'll give some people feel

1855
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:48,540
like, was it like I go on a Netflix now and the turn, the first two things that, um, greet

1856
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:54,180
me as, as we enter into the kids section is two abominations to the cinema.

1857
01:28:54,180 --> 01:29:00,740
Number one, the emoji movie and number two, the who the fuck asked for this fucking remake.

1858
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:08,740
But Woody Woodpecker, the CG animated CG live action, Woody Woodpecker movie.

1859
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:11,780
I'm like, no, God, no, no.

1860
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,300
Why?

1861
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:14,300
No.

1862
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,980
Thankfully my kids are smart and do not want to watch either one of those.

1863
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:17,980
All right.

1864
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:21,180
Anyway, it's, that's the second time we've become a movie podcast tonight.

1865
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:24,980
We're starting to creep on critical myths turf here at the Lucy keeps network.

1866
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:25,980
All right.

1867
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:28,940
Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news back in these games.

1868
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:29,940
Loki.

1869
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:32,780
So, uh, this is kind of cool cause I've been playing a little bit of Stardew Valley, but

1870
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:37,380
they are going to be adding multiplayer soon and they announced that they're going to be

1871
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:41,460
doing a beta for said multiplayer in the spring.

1872
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:46,340
So, um, basically it'll give us more details as it gets closer to that, but it is something

1873
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,340
that's coming.

1874
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:53,540
Uh, but he did post the picture of, you know, kind of some of the screenshots from that

1875
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:56,340
multiplayer add on expansion or whatever.

1876
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:01,540
And of course it shows two houses or as opposed to the one house.

1877
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:03,220
Um, so that's kind of cool.

1878
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:08,940
I'm be kind of interested to see how that plays out or if it's going to be like, you

1879
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:13,140
have to play at the same time or is it like, you know, you can keep visiting like Animal

1880
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:16,700
Crossing where you can keep visiting back to the same world type thing.

1881
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,500
That'll do wonders for streaming too.

1882
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,140
I think that's going to be a lot of fun to watch.

1883
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:21,740
Like people kind of doing that together.

1884
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:26,180
So yeah, I mean, I don't know how much that's going to really add to the game, but I'm hopefully

1885
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:30,000
they're going to add more content to the game along with the multiplayer.

1886
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
So we'll see.

1887
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,620
Um, and then of course this is exciting news regarding dance rush.

1888
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:41,060
Round one is basically said that they're going to be bringing it to the US in their locations.

1889
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,860
So that's pretty awesome.

1890
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:43,860
Starting this summer.

1891
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,380
We'll have to drive all the way to Concord to play that.

1892
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,380
Although soon, did you guys hear this?

1893
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:53,420
They have announced the upcoming round one openings, uh, later this year, they're going

1894
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:56,580
to be opening one in Hayward, uh, at the mall there.

1895
01:30:56,580 --> 01:31:01,200
And uh, I don't know if you guys have heard this in the fourth quarter of 2019, Roseville

1896
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,520
is getting around one that was confirmed.

1897
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,960
So pretty, pretty cool.

1898
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,280
There'll be one in our neighborhood.

1899
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,280
So where's the Concord one?

1900
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,280
Is that the mall there?

1901
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,480
The Concord one is at Sun Valley mall.

1902
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,480
Oh yeah.

1903
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,200
I don't know what store it used to be cause I don't, that's not my own.

1904
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:18,160
And they say this new one is going into the Galleria, but the Galleria doesn't have any

1905
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:23,280
open space that I know of in the mall, uh, unless some big store closed there that I

1906
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,280
can't think of.

1907
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,400
But I don't think the Galleria has like, like there's no like Sears there that went under

1908
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:28,400
it.

1909
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,400
Like the Sears there is still open.

1910
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,400
Yeah, it's still open.

1911
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,400
Yeah.

1912
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:35,400
But across the street from the Galleria, there's that big open lot that used to be the furniture

1913
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,000
store that they do the haunted houses in every October.

1914
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,800
I bet that's it.

1915
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:45,240
That's big enough to be around one, but that's kind of a long time for that to sit empty.

1916
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:49,320
I mean, you know, that I would be surprised if they're going to have to do, if they're

1917
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:52,940
going to have to do make makeovers on the building to make it work, put a bowling alley

1918
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:57,280
in there and you know, maybe there's already an agreement for Halloween of this year that

1919
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,600
they have to see through or something.

1920
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,600
Who knows?

1921
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,920
But yeah, so they'll be coming out, um, starting this summer.

1922
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,840
So that's going to be pretty exciting.

1923
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,420
And just real quick, I'm sorry, JD is put the list in chat.

1924
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:12,080
There are more round ones opening besides just in our neighborhood.

1925
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,740
Like I saw like there's a new one in Ohio somewhere and there's, there's, there's others

1926
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,960
opening across the country.

1927
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,120
So, um, you should check and see if you're on the list because you know, again, they're

1928
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:26,160
not paying us to make this plug, but I mean, round one is bringing like old school arcades

1929
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,800
back and especially with the types of games that flat out interest me, you know, the Japanese

1930
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,800
imports.

1931
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,160
So I support it.

1932
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,160
Yeah.

1933
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,400
And I'm just going to be excited because by the time it does get in our neighborhood,

1934
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:42,720
I'll be actually in shape enough to be able to play them again.

1935
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:43,720
Maybe I will be too.

1936
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,720
We'll see.

1937
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:47,680
Of course, as I say here, as I down my third glass of wine.

1938
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:53,680
Um, but yeah, so like the final name of the game now is Dance Rush Stardom is the full

1939
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,660
title that they have now.

1940
01:32:55,660 --> 01:33:01,800
And um, so there's some additional information regarding dangerous stardom, including talking

1941
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:02,800
about that.

1942
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,960
They have now language selection in there as well.

1943
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:10,340
So they have Japanese, English, Korean, traditional Chinese, or simplified Chinese, um, or options

1944
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:15,260
you can choose for the menu, which is kind of nice so that they can put it out, you know,

1945
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,260
internationally.

1946
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,900
And then they have, of course, the, uh, the different modes you can do.

1947
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:23,220
So you have your basic mode and your premium mode, the premium mode, of course, if you've

1948
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:28,060
seen it online, there's some YouTube videos out there will basically record you playing

1949
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,220
the game.

1950
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:33,900
So you can actually upload that as well to the internet for all to enjoy.

1951
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:34,900
So there's that.

1952
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:39,760
They show a little bit of the lesson mode that's available in the game as well.

1953
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,040
And um, talking about songs that are in the game.

1954
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,780
So there's quite a few songs.

1955
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:52,500
They said there's gonna be 50 at the North American launch, but, um, you know, some of

1956
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:59,340
the ones I've heard so far, they had Wicked, um, from, uh, from our Jew, I guess.

1957
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,660
And let's see without you a press.

1958
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:04,980
I know that there's, uh, give me a big beat by Korskay.

1959
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:10,600
That's one I've been listening to my car, um, sacrosanorized by Rio star.

1960
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,860
They also have a remix of butterfly in there as well.

1961
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:14,860
I've heard that one.

1962
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:15,860
That was pretty cool.

1963
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:21,740
Um, I watched, uh, like a double, the group before the play in the butterfly remix.

1964
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:22,740
That was pretty cool.

1965
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:23,740
I saw that too.

1966
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:24,740
Yeah.

1967
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:29,500
A revolution by Broadio and, um, I dunno, it looks like just a really fun game.

1968
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:34,060
Um, so they did once again, uh, 50 songs at launch, four songs added every month after

1969
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,060
that.

1970
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:39,260
And it's scheduled for at least in March in Japan.

1971
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:41,940
So the U S will receive it in the summer.

1972
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:45,880
I have to say, like, honestly, with all the like music games that come out, this one has

1973
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,100
me kind of the most excited since like DDR, you know, like I really want to try it.

1974
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,100
Looks like a lot of fun.

1975
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:52,100
So yeah.

1976
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:58,300
Um, I am very excited to see how this, how this looks when we come out because right

1977
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:02,140
now I'm assuming, cause this isn't obviously 50 songs that they're listing on here.

1978
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:06,740
So I'm wondering if between the now and then is where we're going to get the additional

1979
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,660
songs because yeah, this is probably just the test test version list.

1980
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,660
They'll probably be more, we'll see.

1981
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:13,580
So maybe some old classics coming back.

1982
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:14,580
Who knows?

1983
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,580
Anyhow.

1984
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:21,700
Well, if you are a user of GOG or good old games, uh, good news, uh, and you use steam,

1985
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:26,980
I should say, if you use both, some good news is that some more games got added to GOG connect.

1986
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:31,300
If you don't remember what that is, that is where as long as your steam profile is public

1987
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:36,580
and you link the two together, you can import your steam owned games into your good old

1988
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:37,900
games library.

1989
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:43,240
So they just added 11 more games, including mountain blade or well, tropical for a Y

1990
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:50,520
AI war collection, Hunie pop, Kim pirates, gold plus tempest, the sexy brutal, Hunie

1991
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,520
pop.

1992
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,520
I think is what it is.

1993
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:53,520
A Hunie pop.

1994
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,520
That was just one in.

1995
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,520
Okay.

1996
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,520
Sorry about that.

1997
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:00,960
Then a Hunie pop, uh, tempest, uh, torchlight, which is the one that I had that I was able

1998
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,760
to import and unreal tournament game of the year, which I know a lot of people own that

1999
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:05,760
one.

2000
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,760
So pretty cool.

2001
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:10,200
So if you haven't checked out that feature, uh, and you use GOG, uh, you should get on

2002
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,200
that.

2003
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,800
Uh, in other news, how about mega man legacy collection for the Nintendo switch?

2004
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,340
We knew it was coming because Capcom did announce they are going to make it happen when they

2005
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:24,760
finally finally put out that trailer for mega man 11, right?

2006
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:29,000
They announced that mega man legacy would come to the switch, but this is what's interesting.

2007
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:35,940
Apparently the ESRB rated a game called mega man legacy collection one and two.

2008
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:40,160
So it sounds like the games are simply being bundled together, which is great.

2009
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,220
I hope they just did one cart with both games.

2010
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:43,220
Why not?

2011
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,220
Yeah.

2012
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:48,680
And give the switch owners a little something for having to wait or what'll probably really

2013
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,680
happen.

2014
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:54,820
I think weren't these games like 20 bucks a pop when they were, uh, on the PS four marketplace

2015
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:55,820
and the Xbox marketplace.

2016
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:56,820
Yeah.

2017
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:58,400
It'll probably just be a $40 cartridge.

2018
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,400
Gotcha.

2019
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,400
Yeah.

2020
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,400
Maybe let's hope not.

2021
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,360
Let's hope they maybe change that a little bit.

2022
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,360
We'll see though.

2023
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,360
Uh, dark soccer.

2024
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,360
What do you have for us?

2025
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:10,080
Oh, we have some stuff about dragon ball fighter Z, which I haven't gotten because I went ahead

2026
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:15,720
and bought, you know, the battle for Azeroth for world of Warcraft and I'm being frugal,

2027
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:20,360
but we do have the announcement of two DLC characters and one of them is Bardock and

2028
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:29,200
Bururi, um, going in for a even more fighting, but you can get them through the season pass

2029
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:33,840
that unlocks eight additional characters for $34.99.

2030
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:43,800
Um, and then in other news, uh, there is a rumor about a, uh, a kart racing that's going

2031
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:49,940
to be Sonic and friends, more, more Sonic karting from Sumo digital.

2032
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:53,580
Somebody out there is playing a cruel joke on orange lounge radio where we have a long

2033
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:58,060
running gag of saying Sonic and all of his shitty friends.

2034
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:02,240
So somebody is actually making a karting title for Sonic and all of his shitty friends.

2035
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,240
Yeah.

2036
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,640
I don't know.

2037
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:05,640
He's got some good friends.

2038
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,640
Really just knuckles.

2039
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,640
Hmm.

2040
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,640
Yeah.

2041
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,040
The ones that weren't starring in the game, they're all pretty shitty.

2042
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:17,040
Now if Sonic's shitty friends include Ooh, la la and you know, other Sega characters

2043
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:21,480
like the last Sonic racing game that was actually pretty decent, you know, considering how long

2044
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,760
we had to wait for Mario kart eight, like was actually pretty decent that, that, uh,

2045
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,760
what is it called?

2046
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,960
Sonic and friend, no Sonic and Sega all-stars, Sonic and Sega all-stars racing.

2047
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:32,960
That was rad.

2048
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,800
Sonic's friends are the same.

2049
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:35,800
And Danica Patrick.

2050
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,800
Yeah.

2051
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,800
And Danica.

2052
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:38,800
Yes.

2053
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,840
If, if Danica Patrick and Sonic are still tight, if they're still BFFs, then I'm okay

2054
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,840
with that.

2055
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:43,840
You know what I want them to do?

2056
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,840
I forgot Danica Patrick.

2057
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:48,200
You know what I want them to do with one of these games?

2058
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:52,920
We haven't had the OPA OPA in one of the racing games and it should just be the OPA OPA in

2059
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,500
all of those modes.

2060
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:58,360
You know, instead of having little wheels, it's running around on its tiny little feet.

2061
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:02,000
And then when it says aerial scenes, the little wings come out or it's the big wing.

2062
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,560
OPA OPA should be a special unlock, just saying.

2063
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:10,720
And when I was playing Phantasy Star Online, you better believe I had an OPA OPA mag.

2064
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:15,900
Tiger Claw in chat says, Amy isn't one of Sonic's shitty friends since she was the part

2065
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,600
of Sonic CD.

2066
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:22,760
Well, in the words of Britney Spears, if you seek Amy.

2067
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,880
And then they're also like, she's also Sonic Adventure and in the comics, so whatever.

2068
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,060
And then I know, yeah, they keep adding new, new friends in the comics too.

2069
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:34,340
Like I saw one today, it was like Rough and Tumble or something like that.

2070
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,340
But yes.

2071
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,340
All right.

2072
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:40,880
We're going to travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.

2073
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,860
That's not rumor, that's fact until it gets delayed.

2074
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:46,260
Loki, what's coming out this week, hopefully?

2075
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:53,880
All right, so this week, let's see, we've got Age of Empires Definitive Edition.

2076
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,060
That's on PC.

2077
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:58,180
Armored Warfare on PlayStation 4.

2078
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:02,480
We have Little Witch Academia Chamber of Time.

2079
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,140
That's on PC and PlayStation 4.

2080
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:07,340
Oh, goodie!

2081
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:12,140
Mel Gear Survive, the non-Kojima Metal Gear game.

2082
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:14,620
I thought that game came out a fucking long time ago.

2083
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:22,620
No, Mel Gear Survive is coming out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2084
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:28,860
Okuto Gotoku on PlayStation 4.

2085
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:34,300
Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 Plus on Nintendo Switch.

2086
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,300
This is awesome.

2087
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,660
Them's Fighting Herds on PC.

2088
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:39,940
Remember the game that was going to be in fighting?

2089
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,540
Oh, yeah, didn't that come up last week on the show?

2090
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:42,540
I thought it did.

2091
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:43,540
I don't remember.

2092
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:46,660
I've been hearing about it on Twitter or something this week, so that's cool.

2093
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:47,660
Yep.

2094
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:55,780
Then we've also got Pass Cure on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and Sword Art Online Fatal

2095
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:59,340
Bullet on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2096
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:00,340
That's it.

2097
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:06,340
Alright, traveling over to Japan, the I'm sure incredible title of Metal Gear Survive

2098
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:09,340
is also coming out in Japan on February 21st.

2099
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:13,700
It's kind of a little bit earlier than the rest of the releases on the 22nd, including

2100
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:23,460
Senran Kagura Burst, Girls und Panzer Dream Tank Match, Kimi no Hitomi ni Hitmi in regular

2101
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:33,140
and limited edition, and then let's see, Azayaka na Irudori no Naka de Kimi Rashiku comes out

2102
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,580
as well.

2103
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:39,740
And then there's another game called Summer Lesson, which is like a three-in-one basic

2104
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:40,740
game.

2105
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:42,980
Yeah, that is all coming out as well.

2106
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:47,780
All that in Japan on the PlayStation 4 this week, the Vita seeing some of those releases

2107
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:55,340
too, including Vitamin X Destination, Tokimeki Restaurant, Project Tri-Stars in all sorts

2108
01:41:55,340 --> 01:42:01,220
of different configurations, including a fifth anniversary box, and Harukanaro Toki no Naka

2109
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:06,500
de Ultimate in like three different configurations of limited editions and so forth.

2110
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:10,860
I don't think the Switch, oh no, the Switch has one pretty big game this week, Rayman

2111
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:13,780
Legends gets a Japanese Switch release this week.

2112
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:14,780
That's pretty cool.

2113
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:18,700
So you can check that out and let's see if the 3DS has anything.

2114
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,900
No, I think things are slowing down over there.

2115
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:23,980
So we'll go over to Europe with Dark Sakura.

2116
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:29,480
On the 20th, we have The Station for Mac, PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

2117
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:37,180
On the 21st, Rad Rogers for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Steam World Dig 2 for 3DS.

2118
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:44,140
On the 22nd, Metal Gear Survive on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Past Cure for Xbox One.

2119
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:50,660
All right, well, it's time to dive into the mailbag because every week you guys send us

2120
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:57,140
emails or sometimes you don't, but you send them to participate at orangelauntradio.com

2121
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:58,660
and Dark Sakura dives in the mailbag.

2122
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,940
Who left the sticky stuff everywhere?

2123
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:05,900
Finds an email, sorry, I spilled the wine, and finds an email worth reading on the air.

2124
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,340
We have one email.

2125
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:08,340
One email!

2126
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:09,340
All right, let's do it.

2127
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,500
Participate at orangelauntradio.com.

2128
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:14,540
Sorry again about the double mailbag submission two weeks ago.

2129
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:18,480
As I said in the second, I didn't see my first and my second items.

2130
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:23,080
Just a quick thought here, I see the Nedroid toy line is adding mercy to their Overwatch

2131
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:26,020
collection to go with Tracer and Mei.

2132
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:31,700
I wonder if they'll do more of these and if so, what the hell would a Roadhog Nedroid

2133
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:32,920
look like?

2134
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:38,000
I sort of wish there were Animal Crossing figures in the line besides just Isabelle,

2135
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:45,460
Robert M. I would actually pay for one if I had a crazy red, which by the way, I'm wearing

2136
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:47,040
my crazy red shirt tonight.

2137
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:52,360
It says, looks legit, or seems legit, sorry.

2138
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:53,360
What's a Nedroid?

2139
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,560
The little cute figures, the kind of chibi figures.

2140
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,640
Not pop vinyls.

2141
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:58,640
Not pops.

2142
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,640
This is something new.

2143
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:02,840
They're expensive, number one.

2144
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,800
Where pops are like 12 bucks, these are like 60 bucks.

2145
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,320
I'll find you one, because there's a Nedroid link that I kind of have on.

2146
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:13,720
There's a Kirby as well, but I'll find you one and link it to you so you can see what

2147
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:14,720
they are.

2148
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:19,440
Y'all will be happy to know I bought two more pop vinyls over the weekend, by the way.

2149
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:24,360
I already finished my Drag Race collection, that's been there for a while, but I found

2150
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:30,840
in a store a Liam and a Sarah Ryder so that Allen could finish off his Mass Effect Andromeda

2151
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:31,840
collection.

2152
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,440
So now he has all of them.

2153
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:37,920
So I did buy some pop vinyls, because y'all know I love pop vinyls.

2154
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:41,160
I need to get a Vetra, because she's space waifu.

2155
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:46,200
Seriously, the playthrough I'm doing now on Andromeda, if I ever get back to it, is a

2156
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:50,700
Vetra romance, because Turians, meow.

2157
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:55,640
Overwatch is huge, and if Blizzard license it, it doesn't matter what the toy company

2158
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:58,320
is, as long as they're putting out quality products, you'll probably see every Overwatch

2159
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,600
character at some point.

2160
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:05,080
They're doing a Mr. Rogers pop vinyl.

2161
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,080
Yeah.

2162
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,080
Yeah.

2163
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,080
I want it.

2164
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:11,160
And they're also doing, and I thought I linked it to you, I don't remember.

2165
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,480
The Coming to America dolls?

2166
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,480
PeeWee's Playhouse.

2167
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,480
Oh god.

2168
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:15,480
They're doing everything.

2169
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:18,280
I just, you know how I feel about it.

2170
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:21,320
I think the pop dolls, it's too much.

2171
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:22,320
We have too much.

2172
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,080
There's too many of them.

2173
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:30,760
I say that, and yet I have my Drag Race dolls and my Golden Girls dolls, so even I get sucked

2174
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:34,240
into it once in a while.

2175
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,720
JD says, are they not Funko Pops anymore?

2176
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,880
Oh, I keep calling them Pops, because that's what it says on the box.

2177
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:40,880
You're right.

2178
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,880
They are Funko Pops.

2179
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:42,880
I don't know.

2180
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:43,880
I'm three glasses in, y'all.

2181
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:44,880
Leave me alone.

2182
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,880
All right.

2183
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,880
Is that it for emails?

2184
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:47,880
Yes.

2185
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:52,280
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2186
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:55,080
In the meantime, let's go into some more news.

2187
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,080
Loki.

2188
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:00,380
Everything old is new again, so guess what's coming back?

2189
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:01,380
That's right.

2190
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,380
Twitch plays Pokemon.

2191
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:03,380
Pet rocks.

2192
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,380
Oh.

2193
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:05,380
What?

2194
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:06,800
No pet rocks.

2195
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,320
We said everything old is new again.

2196
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,840
I guess maybe not everything.

2197
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,160
Most things.

2198
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:15,080
So Twitch playing Pokemon, that's right.

2199
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:17,760
This time, there's a twist.

2200
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,720
Not only are they playing one Pokemon game, but they're playing another Pokemon game at

2201
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:22,720
the same time.

2202
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:26,680
So Pokemon Red and Blue are going on at the same time.

2203
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:31,680
On top of that, there is even a ... I don't even know what exactly this is, but there's

2204
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:37,720
a game of Pokemon Pinball being played at the very bottom of the screen as well.

2205
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:42,720
I guess somehow you bet on that, and you can earn tokens to do things.

2206
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,880
So that's kind of neat.

2207
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:51,680
Like the other games, this is mainly ... looks like they do incorporate a democracy mode

2208
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:57,040
every once in a while, but for the most part, it's just whatever the other mode is, the

2209
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:01,960
direct controlling of everything.

2210
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:09,760
And I guess as of right now, looks like I think Pokemon Red is ahead a little bit.

2211
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,080
But yeah, looks chaotic.

2212
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:15,040
So meaning they've gotten a little further in Red than they have in Blue.

2213
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:25,280
Yes, Red right now is stuck in the bushes, and Blue is in a fight right now with Slowbro.

2214
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,280
Thank you for the play-by-play.

2215
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,280
Good stuff.

2216
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,520
Oh, they got out of the bushes, woo-hoo!

2217
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:34,680
All right, so yes, exciting stuff.

2218
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,120
I'll take your word for it.

2219
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:40,280
All right, hey, this is a follow-up to something we talked about a couple weeks ago, and it

2220
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,520
has to do with the Overwatch League.

2221
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:47,120
The Overwatch League is kind of between ... I don't know, I call it seasons right now, but

2222
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,400
it's not like a whole new year.

2223
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:49,760
I don't know what you describe it.

2224
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:52,680
I guess they're saying stage, so there's stage one and stage two.

2225
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:56,460
So the Overwatch League is on a little break for a couple weeks, and then they're going

2226
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:57,800
to come back with some more watches.

2227
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:04,040
Well, during these breaks, the teams in the league have a chance to draft some new players,

2228
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:13,440
and the Overwatch League did draft Kim Guiguri Se-yeon as part of a four-player edition,

2229
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:17,300
and that's the Shanghai Dragons that drafted her to their team.

2230
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:23,840
So it is official the Overwatch League now does have one out of its 100-plus players

2231
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,840
is a woman.

2232
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,800
So, okay, I mean, I know we talked about this a few weeks ago.

2233
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,800
It's a start.

2234
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,800
Thanks for the token.

2235
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,120
Yeah, it's a start.

2236
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,500
And I said when they do that, I would applaud it.

2237
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:39,600
So I will applaud the Shanghai Dragons for taking this move.

2238
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:43,980
I'm doing orchestra applause, snap, snap, snap.

2239
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:44,980
It's a start.

2240
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:49,480
But you know, and I actually got into a Twitter dialogue with somebody on this because I wrote

2241
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:54,060
a tweet about it, which got picked up in the moments thing on Twitter.

2242
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,340
So I started getting some random replies on this stuff.

2243
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:04,420
And usually I try not to engage trolls, but I kind of felt like this response was mature

2244
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:06,220
enough where I could engage in a dialogue.

2245
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:09,100
So I went in a little bit of a back and forth with somebody.

2246
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:13,460
And this person kind of got to a point where it's like, well, how many would make you happy?

2247
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:14,460
Half?

2248
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:15,460
30%?

2249
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:18,520
I'm like, it's not about a target number.

2250
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:27,920
But the reality is, is that when one out of hundreds is female, are you saying that 1%

2251
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,920
of the people that play Overwatch is female?

2252
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,920
Is that an accurate representation?

2253
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,000
You know what I mean?

2254
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,800
So just, I'm not saying they have to be like a target number, but as I said the first time

2255
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:42,500
we did this, it should be at least like 10%.

2256
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:46,040
Is that asking too much when half the population of the planet is female?

2257
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,040
It should be 50%.

2258
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:52,520
But at what level though are the female players?

2259
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:55,000
And it goes with male players too.

2260
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,880
What percentages of those are playing at that tournament level?

2261
01:49:58,880 --> 01:49:59,880
That's what I want to know.

2262
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,640
Because you may have half the bases playing that, but maybe they're playing more casually

2263
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,640
than other people.

2264
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,120
And that could be male or female.

2265
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:08,680
I don't even play competitively.

2266
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,240
Here's my little point.

2267
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:15,520
I understand that the first thing people come back with is that, well, I only want the people

2268
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:18,680
that are the most talented and to do this and this.

2269
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:21,880
Who's being given that opportunity though?

2270
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:26,460
That's the question we really have to challenge ourselves with is, well, if we don't have

2271
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:32,160
women playing at that entry level that leads into the Overwatch League, then I think the

2272
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:36,320
real question we need to be asking ourselves is, why?

2273
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:41,400
Why aren't there more women in the entry level when we know there's more women playing the

2274
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,400
game?

2275
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,160
Anyway, I don't want to repeat myself too much from a couple of weeks ago.

2276
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:49,600
I do want to try to leave this on a net positive because, okay, yes, it's progress.

2277
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:54,680
Sure, I'd like to see progress happen overnight, but you know what?

2278
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:57,400
And Jamie, I think about something we saw today.

2279
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:02,320
We were at the movie theater and there was a poster for some movie coming out and it

2280
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:06,920
said something like, love isn't always a straight path or something like that.

2281
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:10,480
I don't remember what the term on it was, but remember I turned to you and I said, look

2282
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,480
at that.

2283
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:12,480
I pointed at the poster.

2284
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,480
I said, look at that.

2285
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:17,200
A 17 year old me would have never thought something like that would ever be in a movie

2286
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:21,120
theater in Sacramento and here we are.

2287
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:29,160
So I can be critical, but at the same time be a bit of a realist and say, okay, this

2288
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:31,920
is a good step in the right direction.

2289
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,200
I hope we get there a little faster than 20 years, especially if we want esports to be

2290
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,660
taken seriously by everybody.

2291
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:40,480
But this is a good start and I do think that should be acknowledged.

2292
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:46,100
I just hope, you know, we get there in a few years where you don't notice that there's

2293
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:50,520
way less women than men because it accurately reflects who's playing the game.

2294
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:53,560
Or we get to the same thing with other minority groups too.

2295
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:57,760
I'm spotlighting the women and men thing, but you know, we're, we're challenged in all

2296
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,760
these areas.

2297
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:05,540
What I would like to get to a point is where the, where the heart and minds of people have

2298
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:11,700
changed to the point that it won't matter if there's an inequality in something because

2299
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:17,800
it is truly based on merit, if that makes sense, where it won't matter, but right now

2300
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:22,980
we need the representation because it's not, I mean, that's where we're getting all these

2301
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:30,660
angry, you know, straight white boys from, you know, is that the, and I'm going to use

2302
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:33,860
the word patriarchy, is being threatened.

2303
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:39,500
The status quo, their privilege is being threatened and it needs to get to the point where they

2304
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,620
need to just accept this is the world.

2305
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:47,020
And when we get to that point of acceptance, none of this representation is going to be

2306
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:51,100
necessary because our hearts will already be in the right place.

2307
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:52,100
That makes sense.

2308
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,100
Yeah.

2309
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:57,060
And throughout this whole dialogue, I've never said, fire the white dudes.

2310
01:52:57,060 --> 01:53:00,180
I want Overwatch League to be successful.

2311
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,680
And if it's successful, guess what that means?

2312
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:08,380
More teams, more space for diverse and more addition and more, you know, representation,

2313
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:09,380
all that stuff.

2314
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:14,340
So I didn't, you don't have to fire the dudes that are already there to make this happen

2315
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:20,060
except maybe the dudes that talk a little mouthy on their Twitch, but those are exceptions

2316
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:21,140
to the rule.

2317
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:24,560
Many of the people in the Overwatch League are fabulous and you know, there's nothing,

2318
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,680
you know, nothing negative to say.

2319
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:30,960
But anyway, long story short, I am officially a Shanghai Dragons fan.

2320
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:31,960
Woo hoo.

2321
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:32,960
You know what?

2322
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,120
I don't care that they didn't win a match because you know, their record is like zero.

2323
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,800
It's like no wins and all losses.

2324
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:41,160
And this is part of the reason why they're shifting their roster around a little bit.

2325
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:42,480
But you know what?

2326
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:48,860
If I live in the town of the Sacramento Kings, I'm used to cheering for the losing team.

2327
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:51,560
So I am now officially a Shanghai Dragons fan.

2328
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:52,560
Go dragons.

2329
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,560
All right.

2330
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,120
Jamie, any interest in watching a Shanghai Dragons match at some point?

2331
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,120
Maybe.

2332
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:00,120
Maybe.

2333
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,120
Yeah, it might be fine.

2334
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:02,120
I don't know.

2335
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:03,120
Keep in mind how, how motion sick I get on Overwatch.

2336
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:06,440
Well, the good news is when you're watching the league, they're changing things so fast

2337
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:09,920
that you're looking at like overhead maps, you're looking at the arena, like you don't,

2338
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:14,920
I don't think you have enough time to really be immersed in the first person stuff.

2339
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,920
So anyhow.

2340
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:18,840
I felt so sick playing Overwatch.

2341
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:19,840
Yeah.

2342
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:20,840
Oh my God.

2343
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:23,840
DarkTetsuya with a great comment and I think we'll close on this and we'll move on to some

2344
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,240
other Overwatch stuff.

2345
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:29,560
DarkTetsuya says, I mean, look at the cast of characters in Overwatch anyway.

2346
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:32,880
I'd hope that the pro leagues would reflect that as well.

2347
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:33,880
Yeah.

2348
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:38,960
Blizzard, Blizzard, like the best part of Overwatch is the characters.

2349
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,960
And like, it's not, and the thing is, it's not just that they are diverse.

2350
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:48,440
It's that they are diverse with awesome fucking stories.

2351
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:53,640
Like there's like all the characters are awesome in Overwatch.

2352
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:57,680
Everybody has written a fanfic of all of those characters having sex.

2353
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:08,320
That's how beloved those characters are probably animated, drawn and performed in some circles.

2354
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,760
I just, some anime convention.

2355
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:14,320
I just wish that there were more punitive steps that could be taken against, you know,

2356
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:21,380
these really toxic little boys because I can't think of them as men cause they're just toxic

2357
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:26,460
little boys who have to shit on a girl who's playing better than them, right?

2358
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:30,880
Or make it hard for women to go in because it's their little boys club.

2359
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,000
Fuck your boys club.

2360
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Fuck you.

2361
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,460
Your tongue should be cut out.

2362
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:39,100
SS here, when her mat and chat says, I know plenty of women who play Overwatch to get

2363
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:42,460
heckled in competitive mode by immature shits.

2364
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:48,620
That that is the problem at the lowest level cause they're the lowest type of people.

2365
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:49,620
No, no, it's not that.

2366
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:55,740
That is the most entry level problem that has to be solved to fix what's happening here

2367
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:56,920
at the top.

2368
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:01,880
The answer to where are all the other women that are awesome at Overwatch?

2369
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:06,340
The answer to that question starts with addressing that comment.

2370
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:09,020
And that's what this all boils down to.

2371
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:10,740
Anyway.

2372
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:14,860
That's what, well that was actually what spawned my phrase about needing more punitive measures

2373
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:17,460
just cause they're not going to learn on their own.

2374
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:21,460
And clearly their parents didn't teach them how to respect women or else they wouldn't

2375
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:23,960
be, you know, little shits like this.

2376
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:26,000
They need to be held accountable.

2377
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,620
There needs to be at least a way that you can block a channel from somebody or something

2378
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:31,620
like that.

2379
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:35,080
Cause I mean, that's half the reason why I don't play in group chats.

2380
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:41,120
I play on my own and rely on, on text chat in, in game.

2381
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:43,820
Because if it's not my friends, I don't trust what they're going to say.

2382
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:46,940
And I honestly don't give a shit.

2383
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:51,140
Backdeft in chat says, what if I want to beat that woman in the game, but because I want

2384
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:52,580
to be better in the game?

2385
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:53,580
Great.

2386
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:55,260
You know, but there's, you'll have to talk down to her.

2387
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:56,260
Yeah.

2388
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:57,260
There's a difference between that.

2389
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:00,020
That's the difference between sportsman like conduct and unsportsmanlike conduct.

2390
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:03,860
Here's an example that I can think of to kind of relate this to things that I do on a regular

2391
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:04,860
basis.

2392
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:05,860
Ingress, right?

2393
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:06,860
I play that a lot.

2394
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:11,260
My frenemy here in the neighborhood is, you know, that plays on the other team is a woman,

2395
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:12,260
you know?

2396
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:17,540
I have no problem tearing down her fields and breaking her shit just before checkpoint

2397
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:21,720
to, you know, make the score hurt or whatever, or make sure that, you know, her team's color

2398
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:26,500
isn't over my house and stuff like that, because that at the end of the day is the game.

2399
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:31,220
But I respect that she's playing the game and I don't send her nasty messages like,

2400
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:34,620
you know, stupid lady, get back in the kitchen and all this.

2401
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:37,180
I don't, I don't, I don't talk to her like that.

2402
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:40,020
You know, that's, that's unsportsmanlike.

2403
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:44,980
Whereas sportsmanlike is a little more like, you know, close but no cigar, you know, type

2404
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:50,820
of things like, you know, or, you know, sometimes she gets a field off because I'm not paying

2405
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:55,340
attention and, you know, oh, good job if you weren't in the kitchen, we're out here blocking

2406
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:56,340
your.

2407
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,340
Yeah.

2408
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:58,340
Good job.

2409
01:57:58,340 --> 01:57:59,340
Wrong color.

2410
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,340
LOL.

2411
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:04,180
You know, it's, it's, well, it just makes me think of, and I had to go look up the name

2412
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:05,180
of it again.

2413
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:11,640
In the Olympics, you know, they have the Pierre de Colbertin medal, you know, that is right.

2414
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:14,500
Like the, the Miss Congeniality medal.

2415
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:15,500
Not quite.

2416
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,860
It's for good sportsmanship.

2417
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:20,500
So like, for one example,

2418
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:23,260
Yay fan favorite.

2419
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:31,060
Well, here's an example that like in 1964, there was a team whose bobsled missed a bolt.

2420
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:36,060
So after they had their run, this other team loaned a bolt to their bobsled and the other

2421
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,060
team won.

2422
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:41,140
But, and he flat out said they didn't win because they gave them the bolt, they won

2423
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:45,700
because they were faster, but that team still won, though that, that, the leader of that

2424
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:49,380
team still won the, the de Colbertin award.

2425
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:51,200
So you know, and it's the same thing.

2426
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:55,180
We should be lifting each other up.

2427
01:58:55,180 --> 01:59:00,420
We should be encouraging each other and, and being a team and it makes the whole game more

2428
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:01,420
fun.

2429
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:05,420
And I'm not saying don't talk a little smack in the game, you know, like, Oh, I got you

2430
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:08,380
now, you know, but don't be a shit.

2431
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:10,020
Just don't be a shit.

2432
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:11,420
Yeah.

2433
01:59:11,420 --> 01:59:13,620
And recognize when you're crossing the line.

2434
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:14,620
You know what I mean?

2435
01:59:14,620 --> 01:59:15,620
Anyway.

2436
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:16,620
Okay.

2437
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:17,620
We've talked.

2438
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:18,860
I ended this segment like three times already.

2439
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:23,620
We are really moving on to the next story, but it is also about Overwatch kinda, right,

2440
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:24,620
Jamie?

2441
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:25,620
Yeah.

2442
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:31,460
So this is about a fan project that has made some adjustments to Overwatch.

2443
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:41,940
So basically, they've turned Overwatch into a fighting game and, I mean, complete with,

2444
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:45,220
with finishers and all kinds of things like that.

2445
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:49,980
It was, I'm trying to see who did it.

2446
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:50,980
Hold on just a second.

2447
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:53,700
It looks like it, TGN.

2448
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:59,420
They looks like they made a video of Overwatch as a fighting game.

2449
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:01,140
And so it's, it's pretty neat.

2450
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:05,480
I mean, honestly, if Overwatch was a fighting game, I'd play it, but yeah, it's this Overwatch

2451
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:09,180
fighter and I'll send the link into the chat.

2452
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:11,220
It's on YouTube, but just look up.

2453
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:13,320
What if Overwatch was a fighter?

2454
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:14,320
It's pretty fun.

2455
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,740
And that's it really.

2456
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:19,020
All right.

2457
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:22,300
Just a couple more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the Skype line at orange

2458
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:28,180
lounge radio, all one word on Skype, but first Loki, you know what the Sims was missing

2459
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:29,180
drugs.

2460
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:30,180
No, it's not.

2461
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:35,060
You can mod it in exactly my point.

2462
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:36,060
You can mod it in.

2463
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:37,060
Thank you.

2464
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:38,060
I don't think I like Jamie's comment.

2465
02:00:38,060 --> 02:00:39,060
Got on the mic.

2466
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:40,060
I don't know.

2467
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:42,640
But I said, yeah, you can mod it in.

2468
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:44,780
There's all sorts of stuff already modded into the Sims.

2469
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:45,780
Yes.

2470
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:50,300
And one of those mods is a mod by the name of base mental.

2471
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:52,900
And it's a drug theme on for Sims four.

2472
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:59,120
You can do different drugs, including cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines, and weed.

2473
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:03,020
And you can also buy and sell and use different drugs.

2474
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:08,020
And they have like even a drug dealer that's in your neighborhood that's at ABC.

2475
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:13,020
And then of course, if you also are using another mod by a modern name, wicked whims,

2476
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:20,220
which is a comprehensive sex mod for Sims four, you can exchange sex for drugs.

2477
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:25,820
Suddenly the Sims became a lot more interesting suddenly, but this guy, the guy that actually

2478
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:31,940
makes this, um, he has a Patreon and he's actually being funded almost a $6,000 a month

2479
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:33,720
to work on this.

2480
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:38,580
So people are interested in maybe I need to reconsider my thoughts on Patreon because

2481
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:41,300
clearly I'm missing it.

2482
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:46,700
I clearly, um, they had mods like this even in the first Sims, I actually still have some

2483
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:48,260
mods and Sims do.

2484
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:49,820
They came with their own animations.

2485
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:52,860
Remember the Sims online, everybody?

2486
02:01:52,860 --> 02:01:57,700
I have to say based on the screenshots that I'm seeing here, that sex mod is quite comprehensive

2487
02:01:57,700 --> 02:02:00,940
in an almost disturbing faction.

2488
02:02:00,940 --> 02:02:04,500
Um, yeah, I think physic, what?

2489
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,300
I don't even know what I'm seeing here.

2490
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:07,300
This is just weird.

2491
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:08,300
Okay.

2492
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:11,260
Anyways, I don't know for that, but yes, the Sims four, it's a silly place.

2493
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:13,140
It is a silly place.

2494
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:14,140
It is a silly place.

2495
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:15,140
Let's not go back there.

2496
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:16,140
All right.

2497
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:17,140
It's only a model.

2498
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:18,460
All right.

2499
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:24,220
Uh, and lastly, but certainly not leastly tonight, uh, valve has actually banned a developer

2500
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:25,220
off of steam.

2501
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,660
And why did they do it?

2502
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:30,660
Because of, uh, essentially forced reviews that were, you know, you could view this as

2503
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:33,900
fake, uh, in cell games was the name of the developer.

2504
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:37,340
They are from Malta, uh, developing various online multiplayer titles.

2505
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:39,380
Uh, they had been banned from steam.

2506
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:45,060
This story comes from a Redditor, uh, who posted a leaked email, uh, from in cell game

2507
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:50,500
CEO, encouraging employees to buy copies of the reimbursed wild Buster.

2508
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:54,020
I think it was the game, uh, to leave a steam review.

2509
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:58,180
And the email said in part quote, of course I cannot force you to write a review, let

2510
02:02:58,180 --> 02:03:02,720
alone tell you what to write, but I should not have to neglecting the importance of reviews

2511
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:05,400
will ultimately cost jobs.

2512
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:10,980
If this game fails in cell fails, and then we will all have no jobs next year.

2513
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:12,660
Get what you reap what you sow.

2514
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:19,660
So, well, I feel bad for all the other employees who aren't the CEO because now they're fucked

2515
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:22,740
and it's their CEO, you know, was a dumb fuck.

2516
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:28,720
But anyway, um, valve said it investigated the claims that were put on Reddit and identified

2517
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:32,780
unacceptable behavior involving multiple steam accounts controlled by the publisher of the

2518
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:33,780
game.

2519
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:37,500
The publisher appears to have used multiple steam accounts to post positive reviews to

2520
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:38,500
their own games.

2521
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:44,580
This is a clear violation of our review policy and something we take very seriously, obviously

2522
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:51,220
in cell games is not like this huge, you know, developer, but, uh, you know, it still is

2523
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:55,540
certainly a precedent of sorts and hopefully other companies won't make the same mistake

2524
02:03:55,540 --> 02:04:00,440
in cell games did release a statement, uh, talking about this, uh, saying at the day

2525
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:04,600
of launch in December, an email was sent to everyone in the company telling staff about

2526
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:09,220
20 people, including freelancers, how important reviews are in the steam ecosystem.

2527
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,360
It was meant to rally support.

2528
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:15,120
It was never intended to threaten anyone, but just state the importance of reviews for

2529
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:16,360
the whole company.

2530
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:19,440
No staff has received penalties for not buying the game.

2531
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:23,160
We apologize for the misleading wording, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2532
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:24,640
I'm skipping ahead here.

2533
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:29,200
Um, we hope to regain the trust of players and are in further discussion with steam about

2534
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:33,480
the incident until then current steam owners or those in possession of a steam key can

2535
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:38,460
continue to play normally, but it's just no longer available on the store.

2536
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:39,640
What do you guys think about that?

2537
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:43,740
Is that a good thing that valve smack that down or is just kind of one of those, it really

2538
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:44,740
doesn't matter anyway.

2539
02:04:44,740 --> 02:04:45,740
Yes.

2540
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:47,080
It is a good thing that they smacked it down.

2541
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:53,560
I don't care what their excuses so, and it's, it is one of those things where it's like,

2542
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:57,120
if it's obvious how important the reviews are, then you don't really need to say anything

2543
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,120
at all.

2544
02:04:58,120 --> 02:04:59,120
Right.

2545
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:06,440
Or, you know, don't go leaving all these fakie fake reviews.

2546
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:09,680
So I said you reap what you sow.

2547
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,680
All right.

2548
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:15,120
Anyhow, uh, we're going to open up the Skype line, orange lounge radio, all one word on

2549
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:16,120
Skype.

2550
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:18,720
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe

2551
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:23,120
something else is on your mind, the Skype line is open now while we wait for a call.

2552
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:25,360
I'm going to check in to see if there's any last minute stories.

2553
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:27,640
Um, I don't really have anything too much.

2554
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:31,920
I mean, I've, there's a new Barbie doll that's based off tomb Raider.

2555
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:32,920
Okay.

2556
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:33,920
That's kind of interesting.

2557
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:34,920
Probably for the movie.

2558
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:35,920
Yeah.

2559
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,680
So tomb Raider Barbie is going to be 30 bucks.

2560
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:44,600
Um, actually you can preorder now and yeah, she's not having a terrible day just yet,

2561
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:48,320
but if in the wrong hands, she might, she could.

2562
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:49,320
Yeah.

2563
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:50,320
Right.

2564
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,320
We got a call coming in, so let's get to it.

2565
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,320
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

2566
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:53,320
Who's this?

2567
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:56,400
I want everyone gather around, gather around, have a drink, have a shot.

2568
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:57,400
Cause it's Ron, man.

2569
02:05:57,400 --> 02:05:58,400
You know it.

2570
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,480
I've already had a few drinks, but it's always a pleasure to talk to you.

2571
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:01,480
Rama.

2572
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:02,480
How are you?

2573
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,480
I'm doing good.

2574
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:06,160
I just finished making dinner in my amazing instant pie.

2575
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:09,720
I love that little thing.

2576
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:10,720
Sounds delish.

2577
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:14,760
I can't wait for dinner around here, but we got to get through this show first.

2578
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:15,760
What's on your mind tonight?

2579
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:16,760
All right.

2580
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:22,160
I want to talk about crowd funding, Patreon, all of that.

2581
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:26,520
Now I've already called in about this a couple of months ago.

2582
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:30,120
Y'all know how I feel about this.

2583
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:37,600
And lately people have been coming to me for advice on podcasting, streaming, and so forth.

2584
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:44,520
And the main piece of advice I tell people is unless you have major financial backing

2585
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:48,440
behind you, just do it for the fun of it.

2586
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:49,440
Just roll with it.

2587
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,160
You'll have one listener, one streamer.

2588
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:54,640
You can have tens, hundreds of streamers.

2589
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,060
It's going to fluctuate up and down.

2590
02:06:56,060 --> 02:07:02,480
As long as you get out there, roll with it, have fun with it, it's going to be okay.

2591
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:06,440
And then it goes to what about all the equipment that you get?

2592
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:12,040
And I say, I pay out of pocket for it because this is something I want to do.

2593
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:14,240
This is something that's fun.

2594
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:18,680
And then it goes to what about putting yourself out there for sponsorship and stuff.

2595
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:24,620
And I'm like, truthfully, most people are not going to pay to hear me foam at the mouth

2596
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:32,520
about what's wrong with the cosplay and anime communities and the fandom in a whole.

2597
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,520
You're right.

2598
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:34,800
You have to have an angle.

2599
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:39,000
You got to think about, and I say this a lot to people that are, I don't want to discourage

2600
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:45,840
anyone from podcasting, but people that want to be successful with a podcast, think of

2601
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:50,040
what is that quick 30-second elevator pitch about your show?

2602
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:53,520
Can you condense that into one tagline like they do with a movie?

2603
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:56,080
What's the tagline to kind of sell your show?

2604
02:07:56,080 --> 02:08:00,160
That's one big thing I really stress people to do with their show.

2605
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:08,160
And don't, and here's my, the truth hurts, but a real friend's going to tell you this.

2606
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:14,360
If your podcast tagline is, just some friends sitting around talking shit about games, cancel

2607
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:16,640
your podcast immediately.

2608
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:21,520
Well, I will say that there are probably a couple of people who are running with that

2609
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:25,960
tagline and probably because how they're doing their show, they can get away with it.

2610
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:29,420
But just because they're doing it, that doesn't mean you have to.

2611
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:33,960
And also just because there are a bunch of people talking about this particular fandom

2612
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:36,600
or this or that, that's not stopping you.

2613
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:38,200
You can go ahead and talk about it.

2614
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:42,200
Yes, there are multiple podcasts out there about anime, cosplay, whatever, but we talk

2615
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,160
about it from a different point of view.

2616
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:48,520
We're local to a particular area, so how we talk and discuss how things are could be

2617
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,280
different from a bunch of fans doing it from California.

2618
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:55,720
We have sort of like a sister podcast called Zero Hour, similar to us, but they're based

2619
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,720
out of California.

2620
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:59,960
Their experiences are different from ours and we're out of New York.

2621
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:03,640
And they don't do the Patreon, they pay out of pocket like we do.

2622
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:09,040
Now they have this thing called Ko-Fi, you know, if you like us, buy us a cup of coffee.

2623
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,280
That I can get with.

2624
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:13,120
You don't have to make promises or anything like that.

2625
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:14,400
It's a tip jar.

2626
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,240
You like us, buy us a cup of coffee.

2627
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:19,400
I kind of like that, you know, because that's similar to the Twitch model.

2628
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:20,540
Show me your biddies.

2629
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:23,720
If you like, you know, me playing the game, show me, show me your biddies.

2630
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:24,720
Exactly.

2631
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:25,720
Yeah.

2632
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:28,040
Oh, and the only thing and the thing I want to, you know, make sure I'm clarified with

2633
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:31,320
my statement, because I would never tell anyone not to podcast.

2634
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:35,320
But the reason why I say if your tagline is four people talking shit about video games

2635
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:39,320
or whatever it is and why just don't fucking do that show is because in part of what you

2636
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:42,520
said is that there's already a bunch of shows that are doing that angle.

2637
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:47,960
But at the same time, like if your podcast is a fan podcast, then sitting around talking

2638
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:51,480
shit is does not make you that great of a fan.

2639
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:57,000
There's a difference between being critical and talking shit.

2640
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:03,080
That's why I don't give the podcast critical myth any blowback, because there's nothing

2641
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:05,960
wrong with taking a critical eye to fan them.

2642
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:08,760
But that's very, very different than talking shit.

2643
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:10,000
Does that make sense?

2644
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Exactly.

2645
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Yeah.

2646
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,760
So if that's I mean, that that's why I think a tagline like sitting around talking shit

2647
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:19,960
is kind of a lazy tagline.

2648
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:24,540
And then the other one that I'm just again, honest truth.

2649
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:32,960
It's like the view, but with gay guys don't don't be only because that one isn't so bad

2650
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:38,360
in the fact of like, wait, but it's just that that that's like every show with several gay

2651
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:40,800
co if it's the view with gay guy.

2652
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:42,240
No, I'm going to need some.

2653
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:45,480
I'm going to need a more specific answer.

2654
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:46,480
See that.

2655
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,480
I'm sorry.

2656
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:48,480
What was that wrong?

2657
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:49,840
You got cut out there?

2658
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:50,840
Sorry.

2659
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:52,840
That reminds me of a question.

2660
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:54,400
Yeah.

2661
02:10:54,400 --> 02:11:00,560
I need to know is shaking and crying the spiritual successor to guys on the show?

2662
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:01,560
No it is not.

2663
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:02,560
OK.

2664
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:03,840
It is not that.

2665
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:06,580
No, because guys on the show is on hiatus.

2666
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:08,960
It is not over.

2667
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:12,840
And you know, just Extfer and Victoria are two different people.

2668
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:16,080
And I've just really tried to kind of give the show sort of a different flow to it.

2669
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:22,600
I think it kind of feels like a successor because, oh, it's Rob's non gaming show.

2670
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:27,040
But there's room for both in the world if it ever works out that Extfer and I can do

2671
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:28,040
a show again.

2672
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:34,200
Fair enough, because I'm looking forward to that, too.

2673
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:38,720
And then Bobby, Bobby's disagreeing with me in chat saying, no, Rob, I was told that negativity

2674
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:40,000
is funny.

2675
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,680
People who are positive are boring.

2676
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:44,400
You have to be negative to be entertaining and funny.

2677
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:47,080
I got this lecture last year.

2678
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:50,100
And then and why everyone loves Loki rants.

2679
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:51,100
They're funny.

2680
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:52,100
OK.

2681
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:55,440
But and I'm almost positive I said this to you then.

2682
02:11:55,440 --> 02:12:01,380
The thing with the Loki rants is, again, I go back to my Tyra Banks top model things.

2683
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:03,600
Do you like Nintendo games, Loki?

2684
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:04,600
Sure.

2685
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:08,680
See, that's the difference there is that, you know, at the end of the day, Loki gets

2686
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:13,200
frustrated because he sees Nintendo is like should be kind of grabbing on all the latest

2687
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:14,200
and greatest technologies.

2688
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:15,800
And I see all these other companies do these things.

2689
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,800
And why not?

2690
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:20,800
And that's kind of different than like I fucking hate Nintendo and Nintendo.

2691
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,480
Everybody there is, you know, sucking 20 dicks and like all this stupid stuff.

2692
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:27,480
Well, that would explain why they're too busy to get networking working.

2693
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:29,320
Some people do like sucking that much dick.

2694
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:30,320
I'm just saying.

2695
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:31,760
But anyway, that's that's the difference.

2696
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,420
And I, I realize there's other people out there saying something different.

2697
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:37,300
I disagree.

2698
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:40,620
And those negative shows are things I don't want to watch.

2699
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:44,540
And I don't watch that YouTube channel you cited.

2700
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:46,540
But you know, what do I know?

2701
02:12:46,540 --> 02:12:50,680
I've had this podcast for 15 years and we don't have squatty potty advertisements.

2702
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:52,860
So maybe I've got it all wrong.

2703
02:12:52,860 --> 02:12:55,180
But I like to think at the end of the day, I'm doing a good thing.

2704
02:12:55,180 --> 02:12:58,300
Well, I think you do because it was for your show.

2705
02:12:58,300 --> 02:13:02,740
I wouldn't have my podcast and I wouldn't have like two other spin off shows I've been

2706
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:03,740
working on.

2707
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:09,180
One of the podcasts we do, we talk about, yeah, we kind of go into a negative aspect

2708
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:13,940
because we feel our opinions or whatever it is, no one hears it.

2709
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:19,980
So we just go out there is like, well, if 85 percent of people say this is great and

2710
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:24,580
we're at 50 percent says, no, this is trash, we're going to tell you why.

2711
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:29,020
It's like, OK, now you're going to kind of listen and be like, OK, here you go.

2712
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:30,020
Yeah.

2713
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:32,980
And to be fair, Bobby points out in chat.

2714
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:34,260
I was setting you up.

2715
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:35,260
This is the set up.

2716
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:36,680
And then Rob hits it over the net.

2717
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:40,740
You did tell me this in person that, Bobby, I'm three drinks in.

2718
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:44,300
I'm a little slow tonight, sorry.

2719
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:48,840
But thank you for the set up anyway.

2720
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:52,700
And I agree with that Akuma JP is saying, I think you say it very succinctly here.

2721
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:55,780
If you do it just because negative, then no.

2722
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:56,900
And that and that's the difference.

2723
02:13:56,900 --> 02:14:01,980
If you're doing a show to be negative, no, don't do it.

2724
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:04,660
Or do a show about something you do like.

2725
02:14:04,660 --> 02:14:05,660
That's all.

2726
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:06,660
Anyway.

2727
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:09,300
Good times with soap boxes, Rama.

2728
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:10,580
Well, I try.

2729
02:14:10,580 --> 02:14:11,580
All right.

2730
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:13,900
I'm going to let you go so we try to squeeze in some more calls.

2731
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:14,900
But take care.

2732
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:19,940
And of course, support indie radio such as anime jam session Tuesday nights here at Vogue.

2733
02:14:19,940 --> 02:14:20,940
That's right.

2734
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:21,940
All right.

2735
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:22,940
Take care.

2736
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:23,940
Remember, pre shows 915.

2737
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:24,940
We go live at 930.

2738
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:25,940
OK.

2739
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:26,940
Fair enough.

2740
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:27,940
Take care, my friend.

2741
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:28,940
Take care, bro.

2742
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:30,940
Bye bye.

2743
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:31,940
Phones are lighting up tonight.

2744
02:14:31,940 --> 02:14:32,940
Let's get to it.

2745
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:33,940
Hi.

2746
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:34,940
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2747
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:35,940
Who's this?

2748
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:36,940
Hey, what's up, guys?

2749
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:37,940
It's Kajuno.

2750
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:38,940
You can hear me?

2751
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:39,940
Yeah.

2752
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:40,940
We can hear you.

2753
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:41,940
Long time.

2754
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:42,940
What's up, Kajuno?

2755
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:43,940
Thank you.

2756
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:44,940
Thank you so much.

2757
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:45,940
I'm using this little microphone, so I'm sure you can hear me.

2758
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:46,940
Yeah.

2759
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:47,940
I just wanted to point something out real quickly, and then I'll let you guys get to

2760
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:48,940
some more calls.

2761
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:54,460
You mentioned that Nintendo is looking for a Wii Sports for VR.

2762
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:57,940
And I just want to tell you, Wreck Room is like the Wii Sports for VR.

2763
02:14:57,940 --> 02:14:59,620
That thing is so much fun.

2764
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:00,620
It's a free game.

2765
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:04,740
So maybe that's why people aren't really taking that much notice to it.

2766
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:06,900
But I mean, this thing is fun.

2767
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:11,900
You're playing laser tag in there, you're playing paintball, they have a room for charades,

2768
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:13,740
which is freaking hilarious.

2769
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:17,460
When you play charades, you're actually using, I don't know what you would call this, this

2770
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:21,020
type of gun that you have that squirts out this foam.

2771
02:15:21,020 --> 02:15:26,580
So you're drawing things in the third dimension, which is really hilarious.

2772
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:30,620
And the only game I would say that doesn't work in it is that they have some type of

2773
02:15:30,620 --> 02:15:36,060
soccer game that, I don't know what the hell I'm doing in that game, but they have dodgeball.

2774
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:39,700
They also have some little RPG stuff you can go through in there, where they have a thing

2775
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:47,700
where it's like a four-man RP group, and you're going through this room, and somebody has

2776
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:51,460
a sword, somebody has a bow and arrow, and you're fighting these monsters.

2777
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:55,700
They have a pirate ship thing coming up, where it's going to have a pirate theme.

2778
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:59,380
I mean, they're just knocking out the park with this game, I mean, there's so much in

2779
02:15:59,380 --> 02:16:00,380
this game.

2780
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:01,380
A lot.

2781
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:05,780
It's a community game, so it's social, everyone's talking, everyone's having fun.

2782
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:10,140
I appreciate what you're doing here with the recommendation, and it does sound like it's

2783
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:14,740
an awesome game, but to go back with the whole thing about why I brought up Wii Sports in

2784
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:21,820
particular, it's not quite that literal, where it's the collection of mini games and so forth.

2785
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:29,060
It's more that the Wii Sports was the app, it was the thing that really showed off why

2786
02:16:29,060 --> 02:16:35,060
you would swing around and flail in your own home, and why you needed specifically the

2787
02:16:35,060 --> 02:16:39,180
Wii, and not PlayStation 3 and not Xbox 360.

2788
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:42,940
You needed a Wii, because that was the only way you were going to actually swing that

2789
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:49,020
tennis racket into your hand, and so many people who bought the Wii, they weren't buying

2790
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:52,620
the Wii as much as they were buying Wii Sports.

2791
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:58,340
In a very similar way, in some ways, that many people who bought the Switch weren't

2792
02:16:58,340 --> 02:17:01,580
just buying the Switch, they were buying Breath of the Wild.

2793
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:11,660
And I completely understand that Breath of the Wild was also on Wii U, but for so many

2794
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:16,500
people that skipped the Wii U and kind of never really understood that it was separate

2795
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:22,900
from the Wii and all that stuff, Breath of the Wild was really a breath of fresh air

2796
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:27,460
in many ways for Zelda fans, and the fact that you could do it portable and everything,

2797
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:29,160
that's what people were buying.

2798
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:32,820
So what VR needs, is it needs whatever it is.

2799
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:39,380
Yeah, I didn't mean to cut you off, but I do have another point to make there.

2800
02:17:39,380 --> 02:17:44,580
But yeah, I totally get what you're saying about why it's not necessarily the sports

2801
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:48,420
aspect of the game that brought people into it, it's just that it kind of demonstrated

2802
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:52,460
like all the things you can do on the Wii, and that's exactly what Rec Room does.

2803
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:57,900
Like it's not so much that it's comparison with the Wii Sports because they have sports

2804
02:17:57,900 --> 02:18:04,580
games in it, it's just that it kind of demos all the possibilities you can have in VR,

2805
02:18:04,580 --> 02:18:08,100
the social, being in a room where like, I guess I think it's like maybe 10 people can

2806
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:09,100
fit in a room.

2807
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:13,100
So it's like 10 of you inside of Rec Room, they also have like a private room that you

2808
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:16,620
can create your own room, they have some type of new logic system that they just created

2809
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:23,140
where it's kind of like a take on the Labo thing from Nintendo, where you can make things

2810
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:26,860
within the world now and just kind of make your own little mini games and little robots

2811
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:27,860
and crap.

2812
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:33,540
And I mean, it's just so much, like I said, it kind of just demonstrates every possible

2813
02:18:33,540 --> 02:18:38,980
thing you can do in VR and you just have a good old time with it, so I still think it

2814
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:43,500
is that app that everyone's looking for to make them buy VR.

2815
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:47,100
Only thing is, you know, if somebody's like a graphic junkie, you know, they may run away

2816
02:18:47,100 --> 02:18:51,660
from it because it's not the prettiest game in the world, but if you can overlook that,

2817
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:55,020
I mean, you're in for a treat because this one is the best game I ever played.

2818
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:59,460
Alright, so fair enough, maybe it's not the mascot game now, but maybe people should give

2819
02:18:59,460 --> 02:19:00,820
it another look and it should be.

2820
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:02,460
I can respect that angle.

2821
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:03,460
Yeah, definitely good.

2822
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:04,460
Alright.

2823
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:07,580
So I'll let you get to some calls, and great show as always.

2824
02:19:07,580 --> 02:19:08,580
Thank you.

2825
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:13,820
Alright, I'm trying to cut myself off for the evening just in case I need to go out

2826
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:14,820
later.

2827
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:15,820
I'm cut off for now.

2828
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:16,820
So thank you, my friend.

2829
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:17,820
Take care.

2830
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:18,820
Alright.

2831
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:19,820
Bye.

2832
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:20,820
Alright.

2833
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:22,940
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

2834
02:19:22,940 --> 02:19:27,700
I saw some other calls trying to get in, so go ahead and try to give us a call.

2835
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:29,860
There it is, lighting up again.

2836
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:32,740
Some weeks I'm begging for phone calls, some weeks it's ringing off the hook.

2837
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:33,740
Excuse me.

2838
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:34,740
Hello.

2839
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:35,740
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2840
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:36,740
Who's this?

2841
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:37,740
Hey, this is Akdeft.

2842
02:19:37,900 --> 02:19:38,900
Hey, Akdeft.

2843
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:39,900
What's up, buddy?

2844
02:19:39,900 --> 02:19:46,420
Well, I wanted to call last week, but I couldn't, it was kind of late.

2845
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:52,860
And I forgot to make an email about this, but about the evil lineup that was announced

2846
02:19:52,860 --> 02:19:53,860
last week.

2847
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:58,820
Oh yeah, we got to that in rapid fire news, and there was a lot of people, well I don't

2848
02:19:58,820 --> 02:20:04,500
know about a lot, but certainly people noticed that Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite was not there.

2849
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:11,140
Yeah, but that was kind of expected, because the game isn't doing that great, even the

2850
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:17,540
community isn't playing that much, and the competition for that is kind of dead.

2851
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:23,140
But I don't want to talk about, necessarily, Marvel, but the Smash Bros. in L.A.

2852
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:24,140
Oh, okay.

2853
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:25,740
What's on your mind?

2854
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:30,540
That game needs to die.

2855
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:33,440
Like seriously, needs to die.

2856
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:40,060
So you're not a fan of the game still showing up, even though we're now on what Smash Bros.

2857
02:20:40,060 --> 02:20:46,520
for 3DS and Wii U, and probably, honestly, there's a real good chance at E3 this year,

2858
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:49,800
we're going to see something about Smash Bros. on the Switch, and they'll still be playing

2859
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:51,240
it on the GameCube.

2860
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:58,360
Yeah, I don't know, I moved on from L.A. like really, really long time ago, especially because

2861
02:20:58,360 --> 02:21:05,400
the Smash for Wii U and 3DS, it's like really good, it's like the best Smash up to date.

2862
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:11,960
But the thing with Smash Melee is, I don't know how the competitive scenes managed to

2863
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:20,480
keep even growing, because it has grown in the last few years, and managed to get that

2864
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:28,560
tons of views, even despite the game getting really boring, really stale, because you see

2865
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:40,560
the same characters, basically, aside from someone like Hungrybox, or other people like,

2866
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:46,840
I'm trying to remember someone, but someone that uses Ice Climbers, or even Armada that

2867
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:51,000
switches from Fox to Peach.

2868
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:55,880
I think the fact that Twitch is around now, and it wasn't around when the GameCube was

2869
02:21:55,880 --> 02:22:01,960
first out, like maybe that is kind of lending itself to why what's old is new again, in

2870
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:05,680
a way, but who knows how long that wave's going to last.

2871
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:09,080
But you know, at Def, there's many people that just suspect that whatever we're going

2872
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:13,560
to get on the Switch is just going to be the Wii U Smash Bros. with some tweaks, but what

2873
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:19,560
if the joke is, at Def, that it's Super Smash Bros. Melee for Switch?

2874
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:20,560
Shut up.

2875
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:27,900
That's okay, they'll never do backwards compatibility.

2876
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:30,040
Thank god for that.

2877
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:32,360
I love when the listeners tell me to shut up.

2878
02:22:32,360 --> 02:22:33,760
Oh, Rob.

2879
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:36,400
Well then what's the point of me talking?

2880
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:41,000
No, but that would be, I'm sorry, I can't help myself, I can't help myself.

2881
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:47,440
But seriously, even with Twitch, or without it, you see in the local competitive scenes

2882
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:55,800
in many places that Melee is the one that pretty much has the people.

2883
02:22:55,800 --> 02:23:02,640
And again, despite the game getting really boring, seriously, if you have paid attention

2884
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:11,960
to the latest or the last few tournaments, like really big tournaments, for that game,

2885
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:17,240
it's like almost every single people uses the same character, which is Fox, because

2886
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:21,620
it is obviously the best character because it's really broken.

2887
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:28,680
But that makes the game really boring to see through Watch, which is kind of what happened

2888
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:35,080
to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, because the game was also getting really boring.

2889
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:41,120
And last year even, the game wasn't even supposed to be on Evo, but because of donations

2890
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:53,160
and something, they did the donations thing for like nine games, and the one who, or the

2891
02:23:53,160 --> 02:24:01,040
community who donated the most, had their game on Evo.

2892
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:07,040
And only because of that, because even like, it was close to losing to Pokken last year,

2893
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:10,160
like $1,000 short.

2894
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:16,440
But with Melee, the only thing that justifies it is because it gets the views.

2895
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:24,000
Even more than Street Fighter V, which is the main tournament at Evo, it gets more viewers.

2896
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:29,440
And again, I don't know why, I even pretty much promised myself that I wouldn't watch

2897
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:34,480
the Melee tournament, even the top eight, because I really don't want to support that

2898
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:36,000
game anymore.

2899
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:42,760
I want to, for the community as a whole, the Smash Bros. community, not Melee, not Smash

2900
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:47,960
War, Brawl, whatever, I want the community as a whole to grow.

2901
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:55,200
And that's the thing, Smash War is getting stale too, because many people are dropping

2902
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:59,480
it or are moving to other stuff.

2903
02:24:59,480 --> 02:25:05,640
So I would rather for the people to, for the community to, okay, let's move to this game,

2904
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:10,680
which is the most recent, and just wait for Nintendo to announce the Switch one.

2905
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:16,040
So that's probably going to come, at least an announcement this year, like you said.

2906
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:26,560
But again, I really want this year to be the last one I see Melee on Evo's roster, because

2907
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:28,360
it really, really needs to die.

2908
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:33,320
At the end of the day, Akdeft, at the end of the day, honestly, some things just can't

2909
02:25:33,320 --> 02:25:39,120
be explained, and it may also be part of that same phenomenon as to, why did we bring back

2910
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:45,600
Will and Grace, and The X-Files, and Roseanne, and all these shows of the 90s are all of

2911
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:47,120
a sudden coming back.

2912
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:51,880
And some are just as good as they were, like Twin Peaks I thought was just as good as it

2913
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:53,040
ever was.

2914
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:57,400
Some are not quite as good as they were, you know what I mean?

2915
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:02,180
Maybe it's something to do when it comes to Melee about, this is the game I grew up on,

2916
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:06,440
this is my comfort zone, and I don't like new, I don't like change.

2917
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:13,620
And so maybe some people just have a hard time letting that go.

2918
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:24,800
And I know that, because it's Nintendo, and they also pretty much use nostalgia for it.

2919
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:33,920
And again, while I get mad at a Melee HD remake, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo does something

2920
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:35,180
like that.

2921
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:42,720
I wouldn't mind it either, if they actually balanced it, and make it actually better.

2922
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:47,600
But if they make the same game, if it stays the same, why bother?

2923
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,560
Like really, why bother?

2924
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:54,000
Well maybe there's some, and S2100Matt in chat says, let's see if ACT gets hate mail

2925
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,640
in the mailbag.

2926
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:57,480
Let's see, let's see.

2927
02:26:57,480 --> 02:27:01,780
If you are still a fond fan of Melee, tell us about why this game still deserves its

2928
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:03,560
time in the spotlight.

2929
02:27:03,560 --> 02:27:05,620
Send us an email, we'd love to read it on air.

2930
02:27:05,620 --> 02:27:10,500
So we'll act deaf for now, I'm gonna let you go, but I appreciate your passionate opinions.

2931
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:12,940
Hey, thanks for having me, like always.

2932
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:16,820
Thank you, take care buddy.

2933
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:20,580
Kaijuto in chat says, it's not official 90s until they bring back Martin.

2934
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:22,220
I heard they were.

2935
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:24,680
I heard Martin was coming back.

2936
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:25,980
Wasn't that supposed to be like a thing?

2937
02:27:25,980 --> 02:27:27,020
I haven't heard that.

2938
02:27:27,020 --> 02:27:28,980
I thought for sure I heard somewhere that Martin-

2939
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:31,140
I know, I'm sure as hell not watching Roseanne.

2940
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:33,320
Yeah, Roseanne kind of-

2941
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:34,320
Unfortunately-

2942
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:36,460
Although God and Jackie was so good in that movie.

2943
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:40,580
I'm gonna have to watch it because my wife adores Roseanne and so, you know.

2944
02:27:40,580 --> 02:27:45,780
Yeah, but she knows Roseanne's gone a little, you know, cuckoo in the past few years, right?

2945
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:46,780
No.

2946
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:49,260
Having her as a dump supporter.

2947
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:51,740
So it's just, yeah, anyway.

2948
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:54,300
Yeah, Ramas in chat says it is coming back.

2949
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:57,220
That's when I thought I heard that Martin was coming back, can you believe that?

2950
02:27:57,220 --> 02:28:00,620
Now I say it isn't the 90s until In Living Color comes back.

2951
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:03,600
I was just gonna say, why don't we bring back In Living Color?

2952
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:06,720
If you want to talk about the definitive Fox television program-

2953
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:07,720
That shit was awesome.

2954
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:09,240
From the 90s, it was In Living Color.

2955
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:13,120
But then would it be all this, oh my God, can you imagine if they could get like Jim

2956
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:18,120
Carrey and all the Wayans family and like all of them back?

2957
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:20,920
Not so much Jim Carrey, but like what the hell are the Wayans doing?

2958
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:22,320
Why not get Jim Carrey?

2959
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:29,120
Like if it is a super limited like four episode, six episode thing, why the fuck not get Jim

2960
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,120
Carrey?

2961
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:33,340
He's like, he's eccentric now and just like, I don't think, yeah.

2962
02:28:33,340 --> 02:28:35,220
He could do like, he could do like one sketch.

2963
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:37,100
I would love to see that, but-

2964
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:38,660
We just need him to bring back Vera.

2965
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:43,560
Have him do Fire Marshal, Bill, or Vera like one time and that's all you need.

2966
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:45,580
Like and then they put his name on it and at least he's a part of it.

2967
02:28:45,580 --> 02:28:49,620
But like they couldn't do like half the sketches that they did before because they're so like

2968
02:28:49,620 --> 02:28:52,060
quote unquote offensive nowadays, like handy man.

2969
02:28:52,060 --> 02:28:54,060
I would still laugh at men on film.

2970
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:55,060
That shit was funny.

2971
02:28:55,060 --> 02:28:56,060
I'm sorry.

2972
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:57,220
I would still laugh.

2973
02:28:57,220 --> 02:28:59,940
But you're right, like humor has changed a bit.

2974
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:03,600
So they might have to write the show a different way, but I bet it would still be funny.

2975
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:04,600
I don't know.

2976
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:05,600
Maybe not.

2977
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:07,360
Maybe some things are best left in the past.

2978
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:10,440
Bring back mad TV while we're at it, I guess.

2979
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:13,640
Oh, Kaishudo in chat says Wayans brothers were pushed out.

2980
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:16,600
I'm sure they can't bring it back cause someone else owns it.

2981
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:17,600
That's right.

2982
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:20,620
Cause what wasn't like the last season of In Living Color was like kind of a shadow

2983
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:22,000
of its former self.

2984
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,600
Like didn't it kind of, I don't know.

2985
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:24,600
Yeah.

2986
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:28,540
I think there were some problems towards the end, but most of us don't remember that cause

2987
02:29:28,540 --> 02:29:33,000
we stopped watching In Living Color after like four, four years or so.

2988
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:37,800
So uh, Tiger Claw in chat says Jamie Foxx as Wanda.

2989
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:38,800
Remember those skits?

2990
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:39,800
Oh yeah.

2991
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:40,800
I'm gonna rock your world.

2992
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:46,040
Uh, and Homie the Clown, Hamon, God, that was some classic television.

2993
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:47,040
Of course.

2994
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:52,040
I also have a lot of love for Saturday Night Live, you know, especially in those same years

2995
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:56,840
were like, like, you know, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, like all those, you know, 1994 era.

2996
02:29:56,840 --> 02:29:57,840
Oh yeah.

2997
02:29:57,840 --> 02:29:59,660
Phil Hartman, rest in peace.

2998
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:03,060
Like, you know, just some of the most amazing performers.

2999
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:08,940
So the nineties were a great time for comedy, but, but who knows, maybe there's a caller

3000
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:12,660
into some comedy podcasts out there that's like, get over the nineties comedy.

3001
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:14,020
It wasn't that funny.

3002
02:30:14,020 --> 02:30:15,500
Who knows?

3003
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:16,500
I don't know.

3004
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:17,500
I don't know.

3005
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:21,180
Uh, I'll put out one more shout out for the call in line, Orange Lounge Radio, all one

3006
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:22,780
word on Skype.

3007
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:25,140
If you want to call in and say hello to us.

3008
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:29,520
Uh, JD in chat says, I remember Full House, but that's already come back.

3009
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:30,520
Yeah.

3010
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:33,880
God, they're on like fourth or fifth season of that Fuller House.

3011
02:30:33,880 --> 02:30:36,920
Netflix sure changed the game, didn't it?

3012
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:39,740
Still don't know if I want to watch it.

3013
02:30:39,740 --> 02:30:42,180
It's Fuller House.

3014
02:30:42,180 --> 02:30:44,800
Just cause Candace Cameron.

3015
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:49,200
If you could just kind of like, you know, like realize she's already been paid for it

3016
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:51,480
and it's, it's not going to change anything.

3017
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:56,180
It's one of those things where it's like, if you know exactly what you're signing up

3018
02:30:56,180 --> 02:31:04,140
to watch and that is a cheesy fucking TGIF comedy, cause those shows were so stupid.

3019
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:05,140
They were.

3020
02:31:05,140 --> 02:31:07,300
But like they were so stupid, they were funny.

3021
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:11,020
And that's exactly what like Fuller House is, is it kind of maintains that same level

3022
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:12,460
of comedy.

3023
02:31:12,460 --> 02:31:19,220
So um, now the, the one Netflix show I hear is really good that I had no interest in watching

3024
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:21,920
because I was like, why do you reboot this show?

3025
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:25,840
But apparently one day at a time, everybody tells me is amazing on Netflix.

3026
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:26,840
Oh, huh.

3027
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:27,840
I didn't even know they did.

3028
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:28,840
They were doing that one.

3029
02:31:28,840 --> 02:31:29,840
Yeah, they did.

3030
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:33,120
Except they reimagined it as a, I believe it's an all Latino family this time.

3031
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,120
Huh?

3032
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:38,920
So, um, but yeah, and that was a show that was on like, I remember it on like Nickelodeon

3033
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:44,000
at night because, or, or one of those like maybe syndicated on channel 58 or one of those

3034
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,320
networks before they were the WB and that stuff like during the day because like those

3035
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:49,860
shows were on like the early seventies.

3036
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:50,860
Right.

3037
02:31:50,860 --> 02:31:51,860
One day at a time.

3038
02:31:51,860 --> 02:31:52,860
Huh.

3039
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:53,860
Interesting.

3040
02:31:53,860 --> 02:31:54,860
Yeah.

3041
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:55,860
Yeah.

3042
02:31:55,860 --> 02:32:00,300
Now that original one was like on in 1975 and it had, um, Valerie Bertinelli in it.

3043
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:01,300
That's right.

3044
02:32:01,300 --> 02:32:02,300
It was a Valerie Bertinelli show.

3045
02:32:02,300 --> 02:32:03,300
Yeah.

3046
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:07,860
Cause then Valerie Bertinelli went on to do Valerie's family, right?

3047
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:10,060
She got her own show with Valerie's family.

3048
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:13,740
And then there was like a fight between her and the producers and they fucking killed

3049
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:14,740
her character.

3050
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:15,740
Mackenzie Phillips.

3051
02:32:15,740 --> 02:32:17,900
And renamed the show, the Hogan family.

3052
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:18,900
I remember.

3053
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:19,900
Yeah.

3054
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:20,900
It was Sandy Duncan.

3055
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:21,900
And then the show kind of really took off.

3056
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:25,440
Most people remember that show as the Hogan family, not as Valerie's family.

3057
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:28,640
But I had forgotten that Mackenzie Phillips was also in it too.

3058
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:29,640
Yeah.

3059
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:30,640
Oh yeah.

3060
02:32:30,640 --> 02:32:31,640
Oh yeah.

3061
02:32:31,640 --> 02:32:32,640
One day at a time.

3062
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:33,640
Wasn't that a, uh, what's his name?

3063
02:32:33,640 --> 02:32:34,920
Bonnie Franklin was the mom and she's dead.

3064
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:42,280
That ultra famous producer of all those fucking shows like, uh, uh, uh, oh my God.

3065
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:43,280
Those were the days.

3066
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:44,280
All in the family.

3067
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:45,280
All in the family.

3068
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:48,540
Done by, uh, crap.

3069
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:49,740
I just had Norman Lear.

3070
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:50,740
Norman Lear.

3071
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:51,740
Thank God.

3072
02:32:51,740 --> 02:32:52,740
I'm like, you're killing me Smalls.

3073
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:53,740
No, I couldn't remember either.

3074
02:32:53,740 --> 02:32:55,540
Norman Lear did one day at a time, right?

3075
02:32:55,540 --> 02:32:56,540
Yeah.

3076
02:32:56,540 --> 02:32:58,300
I think he's doing this new one too.

3077
02:32:58,300 --> 02:32:59,500
Oh, interesting.

3078
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:03,500
Because I think he was on another podcast promoting it and that's how I heard that it

3079
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:04,500
was happening.

3080
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:05,500
Yeah.

3081
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:08,740
But one thing I've always liked about Norman Lear shows is that he tackled massive social

3082
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:11,940
issues and was really progressive.

3083
02:33:11,940 --> 02:33:16,240
But you want to talk about something, Loki, that would be really offensive by today's

3084
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:17,240
terms.

3085
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:18,240
Go back and look at all in the family.

3086
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:19,240
Yes.

3087
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:20,240
Holy shit.

3088
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:21,240
Like, but that-

3089
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:26,840
But a lot of the show was challenging Archie's, you know, uh, prejudices.

3090
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:27,840
Yeah.

3091
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:28,840
Yeah.

3092
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:30,800
With, without all in the family, we wouldn't have had Maude.

3093
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:31,800
Yeah.

3094
02:33:31,800 --> 02:33:39,120
Well, Bea Arthur is a, well, I know she's literally a goddess now ascended to the heavens.

3095
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:41,280
I hope Bea Arthur is watching over us now.

3096
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:44,820
And I'm sorry, I'm on my wine break.

3097
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:46,840
All right.

3098
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:50,660
We know what movie that's from, right?

3099
02:33:50,660 --> 02:33:51,660
History of the World.

3100
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:52,660
Oh, of course.

3101
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:53,660
Of course.

3102
02:33:53,660 --> 02:33:56,460
Cause she played the unemployment lady.

3103
02:33:56,460 --> 02:34:02,020
I'm trying to remember if it was that or one of the other Mel Brooks movies.

3104
02:34:02,020 --> 02:34:03,020
I'm three glasses in.

3105
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:04,020
It's all a blur.

3106
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:05,020
All right.

3107
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:07,860
Anyway, nobody else is calling in on Skype, so I think that's going to wrap it up for

3108
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:13,520
all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, uh, tonight.

3109
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:16,880
But we, of course, we can't end the show until we get everybody's final thoughts.

3110
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:19,000
So we're going to go around the room and get the final thoughts.

3111
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Of course, I'm going to say to you guys, as I do every week, thank you so much for tuning

3112
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:27,520
in and getting through this episode of Orange Lounge Radio, which was full of wine and tangents.

3113
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:28,520
And uh-

3114
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:29,520
I didn't have a lot of wine myself.

3115
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:30,520
Well, I sure did.

3116
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:34,080
Uh, but I want to thank you guys, of course, for tuning in and listening and supporting

3117
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:35,080
the show.

3118
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:37,680
You know, as we ask here at Orange Lounge Radio every week, if you enjoyed the show,

3119
02:34:37,700 --> 02:34:39,560
please tell a friend or two about the show.

3120
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:42,860
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only

3121
02:34:42,860 --> 02:34:44,860
if the voices are here to air.

3122
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:48,140
So please tell the friend about the show.

3123
02:34:48,140 --> 02:34:53,260
You can also leave a five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play Podcast.

3124
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:59,460
Those reviews help a lot, let me tell you, so podcasts really value that stuff.

3125
02:34:59,460 --> 02:35:03,300
I think that's all I can think of, so let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3126
02:35:03,300 --> 02:35:04,820
I'll start tonight.

3127
02:35:04,820 --> 02:35:09,500
My final thought is, I didn't mention during my gaming week that I was still playing Pokemon

3128
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:13,160
Red or no, I'm sorry, Pokemon Yellow.

3129
02:35:13,160 --> 02:35:18,700
And I'm going to play some more Pokemon Yellow, I think, because I'm going to get those Pokemon

3130
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:25,320
in the Pokemon bank for hopefully Gen 8 so I can play Gen 8 with Gen 1 Pokemon because

3131
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:26,320
that's me.

3132
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:28,840
Uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought?

3133
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:35,620
If I'm not super exhausted after work, I plan on streaming, so, um, it's, uh, I think my

3134
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:41,560
channel is DarkSakura underscore O-L-R, so I think you're right.

3135
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:45,280
So just hang out or something and subscribe, please.

3136
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,280
Awesome.

3137
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:47,840
Because I said so.

3138
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:50,320
And last but certainly not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

3139
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:52,040
I should probably stream something someday.

3140
02:35:52,040 --> 02:35:54,840
I have so many things I could stream.

3141
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:57,600
Why don't you point a camera at your cabinet?

3142
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:02,200
Um, because I don't really have a camera that I can point at the cabinet.

3143
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:03,720
I have my old USB.

3144
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:10,520
I have like, I have like an old like, um, Sony Handycam that does HD, but like, I don't

3145
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:14,960
know about getting that to like actual video and who would want to watch me play?

3146
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:19,600
It's the lighting's not good because I only have one light, one fluorescent light in there

3147
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:29,720
and no one wants to see me out of shape trying to play, you know, standard difficulty songs.

3148
02:36:29,720 --> 02:36:30,960
No one wants to watch that.

3149
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:31,960
Bobby Blackwolf in chat.

3150
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:33,600
I'm hearing excuses.

3151
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:34,600
Me too.

3152
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:41,520
No, I meant like a non like DDR, you know, like I, like I could play like you could stream

3153
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:46,100
yourself programming a game.

3154
02:36:46,100 --> 02:36:49,300
That's also not real fun to watch right now, but yes.

3155
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:51,020
I could do that.

3156
02:36:51,020 --> 02:36:55,500
Like if I was actually talented, I could do that.

3157
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,500
Yes.

3158
02:36:56,500 --> 02:36:57,500
You are talented.

3159
02:36:57,500 --> 02:36:58,940
Everybody's talented in their own way.

3160
02:36:58,940 --> 02:36:59,940
All right.

3161
02:36:59,940 --> 02:37:03,020
Uh, that's going to do it for another night here at orange lounge radio.

3162
02:37:03,020 --> 02:37:04,860
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show.

3163
02:37:04,860 --> 02:37:08,580
I appreciate it and we will see you in seven days to do it all over again.

3164
02:37:08,580 --> 02:37:09,580
Sound good.

3165
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:10,580
Awesome.

3166
02:37:10,580 --> 02:37:11,580
