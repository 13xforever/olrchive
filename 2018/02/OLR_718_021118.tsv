0	27000	This week, as each new game in the shooty-crafty genre welcomes a new pool of players, Fortnite claims the record concurrent player's crown from player-announced Battlegrounds. This is just one new battle for the gaming ages, stay tuned for the rest of the week's news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week at the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 718 for this, February the 11th of 2018.
44000	57000	My name is Rob Roberts, and sadly not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but she will be joining us by phone a little later in the show. Here in studio we have, as he usually is, Techmaster Loki.
57000	58000	Hello.
58000	59000	Hi Loki, how are you?
59000	60000	I'm fine.
60000	62000	Good to see you, good for you to be here.
62000	63000	Yes.
63000	65000	What's new with you? How's life?
65000	67000	Nothing really new.
67000	69000	How's the DDR machine?
69000	70000	It's still DDR-ing.
70000	72000	Yeah, are you actually still using it?
72000	73000	Yeah, for at least 30 minutes a day.
73000	78000	Nice. Is it like, is it like weight? You didn't notice an effect on that? Like getting that extra exercise?
78000	83000	No, I'm still working on the diet part of that. But I've been pretty good about like eating, what's that for?
83000	85000	Well I was going to say, bringing 12 breadsticks to OLR.
85000	89000	I did not eat all 12 breadsticks. I didn't have like six of them.
89000	92000	You did very good. I was supposed to start a diet today and I still ate a breadstick.
93000	100000	And to be fair, I mean, yeah it's not the best way to do a diet, but like I'm still well within my calories even though I ate those six breadsticks.
100000	106000	Because I really didn't eat it. I had like, this is like a small thing of cereal in the morning. Like very small.
106000	110000	And then like nothing the rest of the day. Which is not the way you're supposed to do it.
110000	112000	No, you don't want to starve yourself. That's not the way to do it.
112000	119000	But weekends for me like throw off my rhythm anyway. Like if I have to diet, I have to fix my weekday routine.
120000	125000	Like I have to eat a better breakfast. I have to not buy candy bars from the vending machine at work.
125000	131000	I have to, you know, not eat out all the time at lunch. Or if I do eat out, you know, make better choices.
131000	135000	That's where I can really make changes. The weekend is always weird, you know.
135000	141000	And I, often times I find that I'm traveling a lot on the weekend and that screws up stuff too, you know.
141000	147000	Yeah, so I mean I've been good for the most part. I've been pretty good. So we'll see how it works out.
147000	155000	Alright. Well I want to introduce our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night.
155000	159000	At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
159000	162000	So if you are joining us in chat, a big hello to you guys.
162000	168000	Which I think we have some faces who I haven't seen in a while. We have some new faces as well.
168000	172000	So we've got a whole lot of kind of a different mixture of folks tonight.
172000	177000	I see the Rob D, who I haven't seen in a long, long time, is listening to the show again tonight.
177000	182000	How are you doing? Hope you're doing good, Rob. We missed this day in gaming. Or was that the name of the show?
182000	184000	I don't know, but he had a great radio voice on that show.
184000	188000	And then PJ Reno, who I think is newer to the show, is listening saying,
188000	194000	I'm going to play Civ 6 while I listen. Civilization 6 got a new expansion just this past week.
194000	198000	I need to check it out still. I've barely scratched the surface on Civ 6.
198000	201000	I mean, I played a couple games right when it first came out.
201000	206000	And of course I love the new Christopher Ten song that's in the introduction, because those songs set the mood.
206000	209000	Right? Baba Yetu for Civ 4 set the mood.
209000	214000	He didn't do the song for Civ 5, but the music in Civ 5 wasn't bad. It just wasn't the same.
214000	222000	It kind of sets the mood of, those songs really say to me, like Baba Yetu, or the meaning of flight,
222000	226000	or whatever it translates to, the dream of flight. It's translated in Italian.
226000	231000	Those songs really say to me, like, prepare to lose your entire evening to this bullshit.
231000	237000	It really sets that mood of, you know, kiss your evening goodbye.
237000	240000	You're going to be up until 3am tonight because you don't know when to quit.
240000	244000	That's what those very epic Grammy-winning and nominated songs say to me.
244000	247000	Are there a lot of Civilization streamers?
247000	250000	Oh sure, over on Twitch. I've seen a few.
250000	254000	Yeah, I mean, it's an intensely strategical game, so there's some people that will, you know, yeah.
254000	261000	And especially for the people that really like to find that mix between IRL streaming and Civ 6,
261000	268000	you don't have to think a lot while you're playing Civ 6, but it's not action-oriented.
268000	273000	If you sit there and take a long time taking your turn, you're not really going to get penalized for that.
273000	280000	So people that like to interact with their audience a little more probably actually favor a game like Civilization,
280000	284000	where you're not, you know, when I'm playing something like Overwatch, I'm going to have to focus on the match the whole time,
284000	287000	because you don't really get a chance to stop and catch your breath. You know what I mean?
287000	288000	Yeah.
288000	291000	So I think that's why Civ does pretty well over there.
291000	296000	It's not, I mean, it's not in the top 25 games, but there's an audience for it. There sure is.
296000	303000	Let's see, over in our chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm looking at some other comments.
303000	306000	Oh, Rob D. corrects me on the name. This Day in Gaming. I apologize.
306000	309000	It was a long, long, long time ago. TDig.
309000	316000	Let's see, also in chat, PJ Reno saying, my hubby's playing Monster Hunting World.
316000	318000	He rented it from a red box.
318000	325000	I wanted to play Monster Hunter World, but I don't, I watched, we did the SharePlay thing.
325000	328000	I did the SharePlay thing with Shane, because he has it and he's really into it right now.
328000	335000	And I wasn't, I wasn't feeling it. Like I remember playing the demo on the Wii U, and I thought it was awful.
335000	339000	Like I just wasn't into it. And then I was kind of watching Shane play it.
339000	343000	And I was like, I don't know, these battles don't look like my kind of thing.
343000	347000	Like I kind of see the Phantasy Star Online element of it that looks really fun.
347000	350000	You know, you know, I love me some Phantasy Star Online, Phantasy Star Universe,
350000	355000	but I didn't like the whole, like, you know, you're, you're whacking on the monster over and over and over again.
355000	359000	And then it kind of runs off. And I don't know, maybe, maybe if I explored more of the classes,
359000	362000	you could play in it and found something I like, I'd probably be into it more.
362000	370000	I like the Final Fantasy ripoff Monster Hunter game they did on 3DS, Final Fantasy Explorers, I think it was called.
370000	373000	I like that one, but I could be like a black mage and stuff.
373000	378000	And, you know, I didn't necessarily have to like actually like chase monsters in melee range or any of that.
378000	383000	So, but I know Monster Hunter World has its fans, so I'm not, I'm not dogging your game.
383000	387000	It's just, you know, not everything's for everyone. I couldn't really get into it at first.
387000	391000	I don't want to drop 60 bucks on a game that I don't feel really, really good about.
391000	392000	If that makes sense.
392000	393000	Yeah.
393000	400000	Let's see, also looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, see the bestest man in chat says,
400000	404000	civilization is the closest I get to referring to a game as crack.
404000	410000	Yep, pretty much. Those games are, you know, there's a reason why the just one turn quote,
410000	416000	one more turn quote is pretty infamous out there because it's very easy to think,
416000	420000	oh, the next turn is when I'm going to get some big science discovery that's going to change the game
420000	425000	or, oh, one more turn until I invade that capital city and it's just, you know, one more
425000	429000	and then suddenly it's 4 a.m. and we're, look at your life, look at your choices.
429000	434000	All right, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about another video game franchise.
434000	440000	I know we are really into, so a lot of news coming out this weekend about Loki.
440000	445000	Kingdom Hearts 3. So the epic guest, I didn't know that they had an expo in Japan for D23.
445000	446000	I didn't either.
446000	448000	So apparently that's a thing.
448000	454000	It makes sense though. I mean, Disney's huge in Japan. The D23 expo does very well here in the States.
454000	457000	So it makes sense that Japan gets their own version of it.
457000	466000	Yeah, so they had, you know, a new trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 and they even still says it's 2018.
466000	472000	So I'm hoping that that stays true. But the big thing that they showed off, of course, was one new world
472000	479000	and it's Monsters, Inc. world. So they have, you know, Sora, Donald, and what the fuck, Goofy.
479000	481000	Goofy looks fucking nuts.
481000	486000	Well, they're all monsters basically, but cute Pixar-ified monsters.
486000	494000	Right, exactly. So it's cute. Like the trailer, they have, one of the gameplay trailers I saw was, you know,
494000	500000	Boo calling Donald Mike Wazowski because healing has one eye in that world as well.
500000	502000	I was like, no, but I'm Mike Wazowski.
502000	509000	So it looks like Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be a lot of Pixar-influenced stuff, right?
509000	513000	Because we have, what, Big Hero 6, we have Toy Story, we have Monsters, Inc.
513000	514000	There's a lot of the Pixar-
514000	516000	I think Hero 6 is in Pixar though.
516000	517000	Oh, I thought it was.
517000	521000	No, that was just Disney animation. And same with Tangle, that's also Disney animation.
521000	524000	It's just now all the Disney animation is not social.
524000	529000	That's right. Princess and the Frog was their last traditionally animated movie, right?
529000	532000	Yeah, that's exactly the best way to go out, but yeah, that was.
532000	540000	I like that movie, come on. Tiana's one of my faves. I like Tiana because she wasn't just born into the princess-dom.
540000	541000	She worked her way there.
541000	544000	Yeah, I give it that. It's just the story's kinda meh. I don't know.
544000	545000	Yeah, I get it, I get it.
545000	553000	It was alright. But yeah, I mean, it looks good. See, the problem is, like, for me, like, I never really played a lot of the Kingdom Hearts games.
553000	560000	I played a little bit of one, and, like, I'm so lost in what the story is right now.
560000	565000	Well, yeah, it blows me away that the story is intended for, I guess, children. I'm using my quotey fingers.
565000	568000	God, God, my children would never be able to follow this.
568000	574000	Yeah, right? I was like, maybe it's not really for kids. I guess maybe it would. But even adults have a hard time understanding it.
574000	581000	So, sometimes it's just not about the plot, but it's about, ooh, it's pretty, and ooh, I'm in Tron World, yay!
581000	589000	You know, it's just kinda the little throwbacks to your youth. Although, I mean, I would go for some real deep cuts.
589000	594000	Like, I wanna see, like, Muppet Baby's world, where we have to dodge Nanny.
594000	596000	I'm still waiting since now.
596000	599000	And then Skeeter just disappears halfway through.
599000	608000	Now with, you know, everything, we're gonna have Star Wars World and Avengers World. I mean, that's gonna be pretty amazing at some point.
608000	610000	Hmm.
610000	614000	And you were talking before the show, maybe Bad Movie World would be a lot of fun.
614000	619000	Yes, I would love to see a whole new game. It's not necessarily Kingdom Hearts, but it's just like going through terrible movies.
619000	628000	So instead of, you know, having the classics like, you know, I don't know, Cinderella and stuff, it's just like The Room or Manos Hands of Fate.
628000	629000	Showgirls.
629000	630000	Showgirls.
630000	634000	Yes. Keeping an E for everyone rated game. That would be a really good time.
634000	635000	The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
635000	636000	The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
636000	640000	Yeah, like Goofy's like, why am I wearing fishnets and heels?
640000	641000	Plan 9.
641000	642000	Yeah.
642000	645000	Eraserhead, I don't know.
645000	650000	That'd be fun. I don't know if that would be a Kingdom Hearts game, but maybe that's another game somebody could make someday.
650000	658000	Somebody did make a game based on The Room, actually. There was, like, some Newgrounds, one of those types of games.
658000	660000	Was there like a point and click adventure game?
660000	664000	Yeah, one of those types of things. But it had like the Super Nintendo looking graphics and stuff.
664000	672000	So there was a game based on The Room, but it wasn't Kingdom Hearts style. It was more 90s PC game, I suppose.
672000	673000	Ah.
673000	679000	So something else I guess we learned about Kingdom Hearts was that there is a new Utada Hikaru song.
679000	683000	Well, we knew she was gonna do one, but now we got more details on it, right?
683000	688000	Yeah, they actually have clips of both the English and the Japanese versions of the song.
688000	692000	Well, I'm sure many of you ran out to find those clips as soon as it was announced they were out there.
692000	700000	But just in case you haven't heard yet, here's the song in Japanese, which is called Chikai, which is like oath or vow.
712000	719000	I like the scene that they're showing in the trailer here, which I don't know the character's name because, like I said, I don't play a lot of these Kingdom Hearts games.
719000	728000	But he's there with Mickey and he's talking about how he's gonna leave his keyblade behind and Mickey's just like, huh? What? I'm not paying attention, what?
728000	732000	That's all the dialogue that Mickey has, like, huh?
732000	733000	King Mickey.
733000	734000	Huh? Yeah.
734000	739000	It's like, are you fucking paying attention? You're standing right here. Are you not listening to anything that I'm saying?
739000	741000	Here's the English version.
749000	755000	I don't wanna know, baby. I don't wanna know everything. It's just fine.
755000	768000	So it sounds a lot like, you know, her other works. It doesn't have that same kind of intensity of something like Simple and Clean, at least the Planet B remix or whatever that was that they used in the opening of the game.
768000	769000	Yeah.
769000	775000	I feel like the original Simple and Clean was a little bit more of a ballad and then, you know, so her songs have been ballad-y for those games.
775000	782000	So it'll be interesting to see, though, maybe if that song gets remixed and maybe they use that for an intense intro or whatever they choose to do.
782000	784000	But Utada's sounding great.
784000	788000	Well, they have all those collections now on PlayStation 4, so I guess I gotta get those.
788000	794000	Yeah, if you wanna catch up, there's like an Uber, Ultimate, all the things collection on PlayStation 4.
794000	799000	What I like that they do is that they take some of the side games and they just made them movies, basically.
799000	802000	They just did a bunch of the cutscenes, they made them movies.
802000	810000	I think it would be worth it before Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out to do like a movie that just catches you up on the freaking story.
810000	819000	I don't know, maybe it'd have to be a mini-series or something, or an entire Netflix binge season of 22 episodes or something.
819000	821000	Last time on Kingdom Hearts!
821000	825000	Well, I mean, honestly, there's enough story there, they could do it.
825000	833000	But obviously that would take a lot of work. It's not just as easy as recording all the cutscenes and putting it on television.
833000	835000	If you want that, go to YouTube.
835000	843000	I'm so surprised, though, that something that they would dedicate a lot of time to at a D23 event still doesn't have a big presence in Disneyland somewhere.
843000	847000	You know, it's just kind of... I don't know.
847000	854000	No, it is surprising. Well, I think it's because at the end of the day it's still Square Enix's thing, even though it has the Disney characters in it.
854000	861000	But in Japan, I know it's a little more mainstream, but it's not like you have a Sora Blacklight ride or anything like that.
861000	865000	But I think you see some of the stuff for sale in the shops and things like that.
865000	873000	I think I said it to this day, the one thing I absolutely regret was the one time I ever saw something Kingdom Hearts-related at Disneyland, I didn't buy it.
873000	878000	And that was that store at California Adventure, the Off the Page, that has more of the art-based things.
878000	884000	You can actually buy art that's on the wall, and they have sculptures, and they had a Sora sculpture.
884000	889000	And so at the time it was a little bit out of my price range, but looking back I'm like,
889000	895000	I should have tried to make it work, because I've never seen anything Kingdom Hearts in the parks again since then.
895000	897000	Yeah, that's too bad.
897000	901000	Except kids dressing up as Sora. I did see that.
901000	910000	So I'm totally gonna dig when people are gonna be cosplaying, you know, Monsters Inc. Sora, so that'll be interesting.
910000	915000	Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com with some of the comments, Fantaz in chat says,
915000	919000	I'd be down for a Kingdom Hearts movie. In Act F degrees, I'd be down for that.
919000	924000	TheRobD says, Kingdom Hearts' big flaw is that it tried to make its own continuity.
924000	927000	The villains of Kingdom Hearts should be Disney villains.
927000	932000	They kind of are, but I get that it's more complicated than that. There's a lot going on.
932000	939000	Because the Organization XIII is not a thing in the Disney universe.
939000	944000	But when you're first playing the game, it sure feels like Maleficent and Hades and all that.
944000	948000	But yeah, it did try to establish its own continuity and its own characters,
948000	952000	but that was probably a little bit for Square Enix's benefit too.
953000	958000	So, and Bobby Blackwell says, I think they reference it more in Tokyo Disneyland.
958000	965000	And also bringing up this was done at D3, or D23 Japan. So Disney did acknowledge it over there.
965000	972000	And to be fair, I seem to recall last year was when we got the announcement Toy Story would be in the game,
972000	977000	was at D23 America. So Disney hasn't completely ignored it.
977000	983000	It just sometimes feels like Frozen gets a fuck of a lot more attention. Right?
983000	990000	Um, yeah. Yes, Disney's grip on that movie. They need to let it go, let it go.
990000	995000	Tiger Claw says, if they did a Kingdom Hearts movie, you know it won't be exactly like the game.
995000	999000	They would probably change things around to make it work for the average audience.
999000	1003000	I'm strangely okay with that, because I feel when it comes to the Kingdom Hearts story,
1003000	1009000	I may need it dumbed down for the average audience. So, anyway.
1009000	1013000	So are you going to pick up Kingdom Hearts 3 when it comes out?
1013000	1018000	I mean, it looks interesting. The trailer is kind of like, it's like, yeah, this looks kind of cool.
1018000	1024000	But it's just, I don't know. I'm not versed in Kingdom Hearts, unfortunately.
1024000	1029000	I used to play, I played the original game when it first came out, because I was like, oh man, this is awesome.
1030000	1033000	I was like, way back in 2002 now.
1033000	1038000	Right, yeah, I kind of just like, ehhh, and I never really finished it. My sister is more into it than I was.
1038000	1043000	But, um, yeah, I never finished the original game, so I don't know.
1043000	1048000	Bobby Black Wolf and Chad also following up, I do not believe the 2018 part of the trailer.
1048000	1051000	I'm guessing it gets delayed to March or April 2019.
1051000	1054000	Right, and it's just more wishful thinking. It'd be nice.
1054000	1060000	I think Square's going to need a tentpole this holiday, and if it's not this, then it's going to be the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
1060000	1064000	And I would see this coming out before the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
1064000	1068000	Although, the Final Fantasy 7 remake is supposed to be in episodes.
1068000	1073000	But, if they push it back because it's not done, then, you know, fine, I support that.
1073000	1076000	I don't want them putting out a half-assed product.
1076000	1083000	I'm going to try really hard to never be that guy again that gets pissed off at a delay ever since what happened to Mass Effect Andromeda.
1083000	1090000	So, um, yeah, I mean, if they have to push it back for quality reasons, then fine, let it get pushed back.
1090000	1094000	It would be nice if it was fourth quarter this year, but if it's not, you know, whatever.
1094000	1098000	There'll be plenty of other stuff to play. Whatever Nintendo's going to put out fourth quarter.
1098000	1102000	Oh darn, I'll just have to spend more time in Red Dead Redemption 2. That would be so tragic.
1102000	1104000	Which got pushed back to fourth quarter, right?
1104000	1106000	Yes, well, for now.
1106000	1107000	For now.
1107000	1110000	I mean, that game looks like it's almost done.
1110000	1112000	Kingdom Hearts. Kingdom Hearts is what they showed.
1112000	1114000	It really has work in progress.
1114000	1116000	It looks pretty complete to me.
1116000	1119000	Yeah. Well, they've been working on it, god, how long?
1119000	1120000	A very long time.
1120000	1122000	They've been working on that game a very long time.
1122000	1125000	So, I think we're all ready for it, but it's got to be done right.
1125000	1127000	That's the important thing.
1127000	1129000	Let's get into our gaming weeks.
1129000	1132000	So, usually at the top of the show, we like to talk about a little bit of our gaming weeks.
1132000	1134000	And how was your gaming week?
1134000	1136000	What types of games have you been playing this week, Loki?
1136000	1139000	I wish I played new things, but it's been basically the same stuff.
1139000	1143000	So, a little bit of Stardew Valley.
1143000	1146000	I did play a little bit more Pokemon this week.
1146000	1148000	Have you romanced anyone in Stardew Valley yet?
1148000	1150000	No, I haven't.
1150000	1153000	But, because all the characters kind of irritate me.
1153000	1155000	Like a lot of them do.
1155000	1157000	It's honestly fair.
1157000	1162000	Shane's back, or he's kicked his alcohol problem, so way to go, Shane.
1162000	1164000	Congrats.
1164000	1168000	But, like, I forgot to mention this last week, actually.
1168000	1171000	So, because I've gotten...
1171000	1175000	You know me, I like to cheat in games.
1175000	1181000	And so, I, of course, am playing with a trainer just to stop some of the...
1181000	1184000	Because you have limited energy and stuff, and it's just a pain.
1184000	1189000	I have to keep running back to the house every few minutes just because you're out of energy.
1189000	1191000	I'm young and invincible. I have limitless energy.
1191000	1195000	Exactly. So, with that, I bumped all the relationships up to max and stuff.
1195000	1203000	So, the only downside to that, though, is that I get cutscenes all the fucking time.
1203000	1206000	Like, every time I go near a house, it's like four cutscenes.
1206000	1209000	Or go into another place that's like four more cutscenes.
1209000	1211000	So, finally, that's kind of died down a bit.
1211000	1214000	But, one of the cutscenes I got to when I went to the beach was one of the...
1214000	1218000	I don't remember the guy's name, but he has this long, blonde hair or something like that.
1218000	1221000	Kind of looks like a Fabio type guy. He's a writer.
1221000	1225000	Anyways, and so, he's like, hey, you want to go rowing on my boat?
1225000	1227000	I'm like, uh, okay.
1227000	1231000	And so, the dude tries kissing me on there. I'm like, dude, what the hell?
1231000	1234000	It's like fucking Dennis because of the implication.
1234000	1237000	You can't say no because what are they going to do?
1237000	1239000	They're going to dump you off the side of the boat.
1239000	1242000	They have to say yes because of the implication.
1242000	1247000	So, it's just weird. All these characters trying to romance me. I'm like, dude, okay.
1247000	1250000	Well, maybe next time you'll set the boundaries with Fabio before you do.
1250000	1252000	Dude, Fabio, listen.
1252000	1253000	It ain't like that.
1253000	1256000	I understand you're living in your shack on the beach, writing.
1256000	1258000	I don't fucking care.
1258000	1260000	It's like, whatever.
1260000	1262000	But, no, it's a silly game.
1262000	1266000	And actually reading up on it, there's actually a lot more to it.
1266000	1270000	Once I've finished some of the stuff, there's more questing stuff in there that you can do.
1270000	1272000	It's alright.
1272000	1274000	So, I've been playing that a bit.
1274000	1279000	And then, of course, I've been doing my routine of Dance Dance Revolution every day.
1279000	1284000	So, it's been slowly getting easier to do stuff.
1284000	1287000	I still can't do the things I used to be able to do.
1287000	1295000	Every now and then I'll try to, hey, let's play Aeon Heavy and see how well we can do that.
1295000	1297000	Nope, can't do that still.
1297000	1303000	Or my kids, God bless them, will decide, hey, I'm going to pick this song.
1303000	1306000	And so, I'll just leave it on whatever.
1306000	1308000	And they hit random.
1308000	1310000	And I didn't get a chance to play it.
1310000	1318000	So, it's like I'm playing Orion 78, the 2MB remix or whatever, Civilization remix.
1318000	1320000	I'm like, dude, what the hell?
1320000	1322000	And they're playing on beginner.
1322000	1324000	And they're like, okay, this is easy.
1324000	1326000	Keeping you in the game.
1326000	1331000	Esther 200, Matt in Chat says, do you still remember the step charts for most of the songs?
1331000	1333000	No, because I used to play doubles.
1333000	1335000	So, now I'm playing singles.
1335000	1338000	And so, I don't remember most of the step charts for the songs.
1338000	1342000	Now I'm starting to recognize them more because I'm playing some of the same songs over and over.
1342000	1344000	But I don't.
1344000	1346000	I don't remember any of them.
1346000	1348000	Like, Dynamite Rave, I even went and played basic on that.
1348000	1351000	Just like, I don't remember this anymore.
1351000	1354000	So, it's alright.
1354000	1356000	Yeah, so I've been doing that.
1356000	1360000	And then, what else?
1360000	1367000	I played a little bit of Lego Marvel's Super Heroes 2, just on the grind, unlocking everything to 100% the game.
1367000	1370000	But that's what it feels like right now. It's just a grind.
1370000	1373000	It's kind of not really entertaining anymore.
1373000	1376000	It wasn't really that much of an entertaining game to begin with.
1376000	1378000	The earlier games are much better.
1378000	1382000	And then, a little bit of Ingress.
1382000	1386000	Just normally when I'm playing Pokemon Go or whatever, it's both Ingress and Pokemon Go at the same time.
1386000	1388000	I've done that, yeah.
1388000	1393000	So, that's what I did today. I was down at the Arcade Creek Park, which has a ton of portals there.
1393000	1398000	So, I was able to do both and stock up on Pokeballs because I was getting low.
1398000	1400000	That's about it.
1400000	1402000	I feel like I've barely played any Ingress this week, actually.
1402000	1405000	I know, I just was throwing really long links to things.
1405000	1408000	Whenever I had keys available, I'm like, eh, who's gonna yell at me?
1408000	1410000	If it throws, it goes.
1410000	1414000	Exactly. What are you gonna do? Yell at me? I don't have the app on.
1414000	1416000	I don't have notifications on. I don't care.
1416000	1421000	I honestly think in your part of town, garbage links are encouraged, I think, over where you're at.
1421000	1423000	So, it's all good.
1423000	1426000	Anyway, let's see, my gaming week. Well, then I'll piggyback off that.
1426000	1432000	So, even though I haven't been playing a lot of Ingress, I played a shit ton of Pokemon Go, like, yesterday.
1432000	1439000	And that was because the reason why I was playing a lot of Pokemon Go is because I'm able to use my Bluetooth, you know, catching device to catch stuff.
1439000	1445000	Because yesterday, I had a friend from out of town who was visiting and he didn't know a lot about Sacramento because he's just recently moved here from back east.
1445000	1451000	So, we were going to the Capitol, we were going to Midtown, we were going to Old Town, we were going to the Art Museum.
1451000	1456000	We walked, like, everywhere. I probably walked several miles yesterday.
1456000	1460000	But the nice thing about having the Bluetooth is I was catching Pokemon, like, everywhere I went.
1460000	1465000	And because they're doing that Gen 3 event right now, I'm catching nothing but the Gen 3 stuff.
1465000	1471000	Which, you know, like the Trapinch, there's a lot of those downtown because Capitol Park's the nest for Trapinch right now.
1471000	1474000	And then, you know, just a variety of different stuff.
1474000	1481000	So, that's cool because I don't know what's going to happen when it goes back to, you know, Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3.
1481000	1485000	How much these newer Gen 3 things are going to show up because there's only so many limited spawn points.
1485000	1490000	I have to admit, I really like this whole, like, one Gen at a time type of thing.
1490000	1493000	And I hope Niantic kind of does this stuff a little more often.
1493000	1498000	And they should feel free to do it even with just Gen 1 and Gen 2, like, go back to old school.
1498000	1500000	Don't do it forever, but just for a couple days.
1500000	1504000	Or even just mix it up where stuff normally spawns, like, you know, hey, let's put water.
1504000	1508000	I like the water Pokemon event they did because we don't really live near a lot of water.
1508000	1513000	So, it was nice to be able to, you know, catch Dratini's and all sorts of things everywhere.
1513000	1517000	Well, and I always thought one thing they could do, and they have a model for it from Ingress,
1517000	1521000	is because Ingress divides the world into different cells, you know.
1521000	1526000	So, for example, Sacramento is in one cell. It's like a scoring cell in Ingress.
1526000	1533000	And you start to move west, and somewhere between Sacramento and Davis, which a lot of people know from the university there,
1533000	1539000	there's a line that separates. So, Davis is in a different cell that it's shared with San Francisco.
1539000	1543000	So, my point with all that is that, you know, it would be cool if maybe monsters,
1543000	1547000	because I'm sick of this, like, region-locked shit, as I think a lot of us are, where it's like,
1547000	1551000	now there's a new one that's only in Africa, you know, and it's like...
1551000	1552000	Oh, right, let me hop on a plane.
1552000	1553000	Hop on a plane.
1553000	1556000	You know, I understand the desire to do region exclusives.
1556000	1560000	I understand that as a mobile game that needs to have years and years long longevity,
1560000	1563000	they need to make some of these things really hard to catch.
1563000	1567000	But at the same time, like, why not, you know, mix it up?
1567000	1574000	I think the one they're doing the best is the Mongoose, Zangoose, and Seviper. Is that it?
1574000	1578000	Where they were exclusive in some places for a little bit, and then they switched.
1578000	1583000	And then during this event right now, they have the minus one that's usually in Asia.
1583000	1586000	Little Pikachus that are plus and minus. Plus hole and...
1586000	1587000	Yeah, I got the minus one.
1587000	1593000	Yeah, because you weren't supposed to get that in Quiddifingers because that was exclusive to Asia,
1593000	1597000	but during this Gen 3 event, they are having minion everywhere.
1597000	1603000	And I like stuff like that. Like, that makes it cool and that gives you incentive to go out, like, every day and do stuff.
1603000	1611000	And they still have four more generations of Pokemon to catch up on before they're current, you know.
1611000	1616000	And then even after that, then they'll be Gen 8 at some point, you know what I mean?
1616000	1621000	So, I still feel like there's a lot of ways Niantic can kind of better divvy this up.
1621000	1626000	But for the time being, I really like the Gen 3 exclusive event and I hope they do more stuff like that in the future.
1626000	1629000	I talked a lot more about Pokemon Go than I planned to.
1629000	1632000	Other stuff I've been playing is a lot of the same old samples.
1632000	1639000	Probably because of Pokemon Go, I was like, I should go find my copy of Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and I'm going to play that again.
1639000	1644000	So, in my rush to clear out my file in Alpha Sapphire, I was like, oh, wait.
1644000	1648000	But I have, like, legendaries that I got through codes or through the download thing.
1648000	1650000	I don't want to get rid of those. I don't want to delete them off my file.
1650000	1652000	So, I'm going to transfer them into the Pokemon bank.
1652000	1655000	So, I had to download the Pokemon bank and get that up and running.
1655000	1658000	So, I did that and then I was like, oh, but the Pokemon bank, oh, that's right.
1658000	1665000	That's how you get the stuff from Pokemon Crystal or Silver, well, and Crystal, and Pokemon Yellow and stuff on virtual consoles.
1665000	1672000	I was like, I want to go back and play Pokemon Yellow on virtual consoles so I can bring, like, Pikachu and shit into my new Alpha Sapphire game.
1672000	1679000	And now it's, here I go again where I'm never going to have the attention span to just play one fucking Pokemon game from start to finish.
1679000	1684000	I never do. I even, like, I, you know, Shane's a good friend of mine and plays a lot of Pokemon.
1684000	1689000	So, I even sent him a picture of my save file in Alpha Sapphire where I have six badges.
1689000	1696000	And I was like, Shane, I don't know if I should start over because I have six badges. I'm, like, this close to the end of the game.
1696000	1698000	He's like, just start over. You'll catch up.
1698000	1701000	So, I guess I'm going to start over. We'll see.
1703000	1708000	Let's see, I'm looking for comments over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1708000	1711000	It looks like they're talking about DDR tournaments in the chat room.
1711000	1712000	I guess there was a couple of those this weekend.
1712000	1714000	Yeah, there was the international one, I think.
1714000	1715000	Yeah.
1715000	1718000	Didn't they, like, debut a new song or something like that?
1718000	1720000	Oh, probably. I'm so out of the loop on that stuff.
1720000	1725000	But you know what I did like was the, what's the new name of the game? The Dance Rush.
1725000	1727000	As some, Dancing Stage Rush.
1727000	1728000	Dance Rush, yeah.
1728000	1732000	Remix, the third, Lupin, I don't, what, whatever that game is called.
1732000	1733000	Dance Rush.
1733000	1734000	Dance, well, no, it has a new name now.
1735000	1740000	It has dance, no, it has dance and rush in it, but it's, like, dancing over rush.
1740000	1744000	I thought that was just a specific version that was, like, because it was linked together.
1744000	1745000	Oh, is it?
1746000	1748000	I thought that's what it was. That's how I interpreted it.
1748000	1753000	I don't know. Well, whatever that game is, where now it's, like, the whole floor is, you know, like, what you dance on.
1753000	1757000	That game looks really cool and I want to check that out when it inevitably comes over here.
1757000	1763000	Yes, and it'll be nice because by the time it eventually gets out over here, hopefully I'll be back in shape enough to where I can actually play it.
1763000	1764000	Yay!
1764000	1765000	That's the spirit.
1765000	1774000	As far as other games I've been playing, I'm still playing an unhealthy amount of Final Fantasy XIV, but that game just got a patch a week ago, so there's, like, more things to do in that.
1774000	1779000	I just did the primal, the new primal fight, the Jade Stoa, or what's the monster's name, Byako.
1779000	1782000	I did that for the first time and that was cool.
1782000	1784000	And then I've been playing Heroes of the Storm.
1784000	1793000	I ended up getting a stim pack and one of my loot chests, which will double the amount of experience you earn, so it just makes you want to play more Heroes of the Storm, so I've been doing that.
1793000	1802000	And I find that I'm really, my favorite character to play, I think, right now in that game is Lieutenant Morales, who's kind of a healer, but the other players really love you when you play Morales.
1802000	1806000	And Morales is the one that has one of the skins that's totally Samus.
1806000	1814000	They can't say it's Samus, they have to say it's Space Explorer or something Morales, which, she's from fucking StarCraft, of course she's a Space Explorer.
1814000	1822000	But, you know, they have to do a wink and a nod that it's not really Samus, but it's an orange and yellow suit with the green vibe, like it's fucking Samus.
1822000	1824000	Just not in name.
1824000	1825000	Not Samus.
1825000	1827000	Yeah, not dash Samus.
1827000	1835000	Alright, so yeah, that's been my gaming week. A lot more MMOs and Heroes of the Storm and a little bit of Pokemon.
1835000	1842000	Some housekeeping, so follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio.
1842000	1846000	And no shows that we're canceling in the near future.
1846000	1850000	Next week is President's Day weekend, which is a three day weekend for me, but I don't think it is for everybody.
1850000	1851000	Not for me.
1851000	1858000	Yeah, so, but we will be here on Sunday night, so I'm looking at maybe taking a quick trip, but we should be back by Sunday night in order to do the show.
1858000	1864000	Maybe have some guests, if it works out the way it's supposed to. Some of my pals in the Bay Area were supposed to go on a trip with me.
1864000	1867000	So we'll see, I don't know. We might have some guests next week. That would be fun.
1867000	1878000	And then, what else? Oh, at the end of March, though, we will be missing a show, but I'll remind you guys about that as it gets closer, because I am going way out of town in March.
1879000	1884000	So, meanwhile, let's get into what else is going on in gaming. So, some more gaming news. Loki.
1884000	1892000	So, Twitch has added some new policies for sexual content and harassment on its platform to try to clean things up.
1892000	1902000	Mainly because there's been quite the, quite the trend in what some people call titty streamers.
1902000	1910000	Where they basically are dressed very provocatively and kind of using that to get, you know, bits and other donations.
1910000	1915000	Kind of, you know, oh, I'm gonna bend over and stretch or do yoga or whatever the hell it is.
1915000	1925000	You know, playing my game with my top. I mean, that's fine. You can dress like that all you want, but you know what? There are, y'all are gonna pay it and they're not.
1925000	1934000	I don't see the quote unquote problem with that, but I get, I mean, but I get that Twitch doesn't want their reputation to be that that is what they are.
1934000	1942000	There's a difference between, it's just that it keeps getting pushed, I think, more and more. Like, who's gonna argue? Well, you can't wear that. No one's gonna make that argument.
1942000	1956000	But until it keeps getting pushed further and further. So, they now have, you know, a little bit more policy, including, you know, that attire is, that you cannot wear an attire that tended to be sexually suggestive.
1956000	1963000	Oh, darn it. That's what I was gonna wear tonight. No fishnet top for me tonight.
1963000	1970000	Undergarments, intimate apparel or exposing slash focusing on male or female genitals, buttocks or nipples.
1970000	1978000	Wait, I thought they banned a lot of this stuff a long time ago. I thought you weren't, like, there were a lot of dudes who streamed shirtless, and I thought you weren't supposed to do that anymore.
1978000	1980000	I thought they did that a long time ago.
1980000	1995000	I thought that what was happening was that these streamers that were doing this were actually being treated more kindly than, you know, by the Twitch staff than other streamers because they were getting away with more of this stuff.
1995000	2008000	Because, you know, they thought they could gain favor with them or some nonsense. But whatever, that it's, it makes sense. This is like, you know, this is a platform where I don't know if they have really age gating in this stuff.
2008000	2012000	So, I mean, kids are gonna be exposed to this. You know, we gotta think of everybody. Think of the children.
2012000	2026000	Also, they're saying that, you know, attire in gaming streams and most at home streams and all profile slash channel imagery should be appropriate for public street, mall or restaurant.
2026000	2033000	As a reminder, we will not tolerate using this policy as a basis to harass streamers on or off Twitch.
2033000	2047000	Sorry, sorry. Have you all been to Kentucky Fried Chicken? Sometimes, like, some of the things, I mean, I'll never forget. It was before going to Rocky Horror, which, yeah, it again is a whole lingerie clothing thing of its own.
2047000	2061000	My pal Victoria from Shaking Your Crying, when she lived up here, and I, we went to a KFC in South San Francisco, and we saw some choices in the outfit department there. Some real choices.
2062000	2068000	And then, of course, you know, along with that, they're saying that in addition to these, they also mentioned...
2068000	2076000	I'm sorry, I have to cut you off. Bobby Blackwell says, have you been to Walmart? Thank you. You're right. There's a whole website, thepeopleofwalmart.com. That's a mall in Walmart Mall.
2076000	2078000	It's not a mall. It's a shopping...
2078000	2082000	Yeah, but they have subways and vision centers. It's a mall.
2082000	2086000	Okay, sorry, I won't cut you off again.
2087000	2098000	Anyways, then they were saying that, you know, we're also looking at Twitch list emotes, stream titles, camera angles, as contextual elements as well they'll be monitoring.
2098000	2103000	So, you know, if you have a crotch cam, maybe not the best thing to be, you know, putting on Twitch.
2103000	2115000	You know, of course, along with that, they're saying that with that, you know, the camera angles, emotes, panels, attires, overlays, chat moderation, offering access to prohibited sexual content,
2115000	2120000	such as ludes on Twitch also remains prohibited.
2120000	2131000	And basically saying if someone gets reported for breaking our community guidelines based on sexual content, we will take a holistic look at the channel.
2131000	2134000	So meaning that...
2134000	2136000	We're gonna bookmark all of those channels.
2136000	2140000	I think that means that they have to take... they're really trying to figure out what's the intent.
2140000	2144000	If your intent is to sell sex, they don't want that on Twitch.
2144000	2161000	If your intent is to show off the game and you just happen to be a very attractive person who wears very attractive clothing and maybe incidentally had a camera shot that you didn't realize was pointed at your chest or at your crotch or something, then, you know, they're not gonna... they're not gonna question that.
2161000	2172000	Don't get me wrong. Like, I watched a lot of Twitch during... I had a thing for work that we were studying esports and streaming and Twitch and stuff like that.
2172000	2183000	But we watched a lot of Twitch streams and stuff and we did encounter quite a few Twitch streamers that, you know, they're women and they're using their looks to, you know, get more people interested in the channel.
2183000	2191000	And that's not a terrible thing, but there are some people that take that too far and to the point where they know that's bringing people in, getting people to donate.
2191000	2201000	And it's kind of like, hey, where are you across the line between this being, you know, Twitch and Chatterbait or, you know, just... you have to draw the line.
2201000	2210000	I think that's what it is. I see in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Harry Chestman, who I guess is streaming and is fishing at top right now, says Twitch is for gaming.
2210000	2218000	Twitch is blurring a little bit. I mean, Twitch is for cooking and competitive eating and Twitch is for IRL streams.
2218000	2227000	But I get it. Like, Twitch is... I think it would be more accurate to say Twitch is not for sex. And so that's why Twitch is trying to have to draw a line here.
2228000	2236000	Right. Yeah. So why? And so if your intent is to be a titty streamer or, you know, and there's dudes that do the same.
2236000	2243000	You know, go to some of the, you know, like gay oriented or even straight oriented. There's enough women that watch Twitch.
2243000	2251000	There's some dudes out there that are selling it just the same, although it may not be, you know, they don't have titties in the same way.
2251000	2254000	They sit there shirtless or they do other stuff.
2254000	2256000	No one wants to see me sit shirtless and play a game.
2256000	2258000	No. I don't want to see me do that.
2258000	2262000	Even though that may be a way, I do play games a lot, but no one's going to want to watch it.
2262000	2269000	That's a private thing. When the cameras aren't on, when I'm not doing OLR podcasts or I'm not doing...
2269000	2274000	I'm probably on the couch without pants playing a particular game, you know?
2274000	2281000	And I will say this. I do remember doing one livestream where I wasn't wearing pants.
2281000	2288000	I was wearing like a snuggie, a blanket over my legs, but you can't see that part.
2288000	2294000	And I made sure the whole time I kept reminding myself, don't stand up to get to the restroom or anything like that.
2294000	2297000	Like if you do, turn the camera off to someone like that, but you can only see...
2297000	2299000	Oh, and now Rob's on stream fails.
2299000	2305000	Yeah, right. No, I don't know that. Well, I mean, I'd be wearing something so you wouldn't see everything, but you know what I mean.
2305000	2313000	You fill in the blanks. But that's actually a trick that they use in regular television too, at least.
2313000	2319000	I don't think it works as well in the age of HD, but I know back in the day when I interned for a TV station,
2319000	2326000	like the weatherman, when he would do his report and stuff, he was wearing a nice suit top and all that stuff,
2326000	2331000	and tie and stuff, and then jeans, because you didn't see anything below the waist.
2331000	2335000	So you couldn't tell that he wasn't wearing slacks or a full suit outfit or nice shoes.
2335000	2338000	It was like they had a nice top and then jeans and sneakers.
2338000	2343000	I can't trust that man. He doesn't have floral pants on. He doesn't know anything about weather.
2343000	2346000	But I think now in this day and age, it doesn't matter.
2346000	2353000	That's kind of like the thing though. That's pretty common to wear kind of like a formal top and jeans.
2353000	2358000	Yeah, but on the nightly news, you're supposed to look totally formal for whatever reason.
2359000	2364000	On the nightly news, anyway, if you're on one of those talk shows, Ellen doesn't really dress up for her show.
2364000	2368000	She doesn't have to, so it just depends on what you're doing.
2371000	2377000	I thought there were other Twitch guidelines about if you got reported, they were going to look at some of the things.
2377000	2379000	I know this was the really controversial thing.
2379000	2383000	They were going to look at some of the things you weren't necessarily just doing on your channel.
2383000	2388000	They were going to look at what you were doing on your social media and what you were going to be doing outside of that.
2388000	2398000	I think the intent is that if you are bullying people on social media or you're being a real asshole outside of Twitch,
2398000	2402000	if you're an affiliate or partner, you're still kind of representing Twitch.
2402000	2406000	They said that they are not monitoring other platforms.
2406000	2411000	It means when finally a report, users can provide documentation that illustrates harassment.
2412000	2414000	Oh, we'll not be monitoring those platforms.
2414000	2419000	So, yeah, if they're finally a report, they can include stuff from other platforms.
2422000	2424000	I guess, I don't know.
2424000	2428000	Looking in chat at live.vognetwork.com, the Rob D says,
2428000	2431000	It very much sounds like they're trying to avoid specifics.
2431000	2433000	I kind of agree.
2433000	2437000	I really do think they're trying to keep it vague from a legal perspective.
2437000	2440000	They probably kind of have to, especially if somebody gets really mad.
2440000	2445000	Somebody who does make a lot, a lot of money suddenly gets shut down by Twitch.
2445000	2447000	I'd imagine there's going to be a little bit of pushback there.
2447000	2451000	But look at what's going on right now with that guy.
2451000	2453000	I don't even remember his name and I don't even want to say it.
2453000	2455000	Logan Paul.
2455000	2459000	But the guy who went to the forest, and we all know that was terrible what he did there.
2459000	2467000	But now, in the past week, YouTube has pretty much, they haven't banned him, but they kicked him off the ad network.
2468000	2471000	He fucking liked animal cruelty on a mouse or something.
2471000	2473000	He tased a dead rat.
2473000	2477000	I heard he gave mouth to mouth to a fish or something like that.
2477000	2479000	I cannot.
2479000	2482000	He's a douchebag. What are you going to say?
2482000	2487000	I can't fucking believe after what he went through in Japan and with all that,
2487000	2490000	and he comes out this boohoo, I should have learned my lesson.
2490000	2496000	I cannot believe, cannot believe after all that he thought it would be a good idea or a funny idea.
2496000	2498000	To fucking taser rat.
2498000	2502000	Here's why. Because that controversy got him more followers.
2502000	2506000	He ended up in the positive on the whole thing with that.
2506000	2512000	And he probably, I mean, he's making money off YouTube, but he's making, he, if you watch any of his videos,
2512000	2516000	and I don't, I watch other people that talk about his videos.
2516000	2519000	They, he just pimps out merchandise.
2519000	2522000	They're selling merchandise and that's where they're making their money is off merchandise.
2522000	2524000	He just bought a seven million dollar mansion.
2525000	2532000	You know, and so he's doing well off and he figured any controversy gets him more views
2532000	2535000	because the people that follow him don't give a shit.
2535000	2539000	It's the people that are, you know, in an outrage aren't watching him in the first place.
2539000	2545000	I don't want to hear stop stupid people from being famous ever again at the Kardashians
2545000	2547000	when there's guys like this in the world.
2547000	2549000	The Kardashians are nothing.
2549000	2552000	At least the Kardashians know how to make a movie.
2552000	2556000	It's like you look, you look at, but you look at like what the Kardashians do
2556000	2559000	and it's not as irritating as fucking Logan Paul.
2559000	2562000	It's just in their whole family is like that.
2562000	2566000	Like their dad came out defending Logan Paul and he's a douchebag as well.
2566000	2568000	Like he was in one of their videos.
2568000	2574000	He was making out with some like teenage girl or something like that is super, super cringy.
2574000	2579000	It's terrible, but like it, the whole family is like that.
2579000	2585000	And it just, the sooner they like get wiped off of, you know, the internet, the better.
2585000	2588000	Bobby, Bobby just reminds me of an important fact here.
2588000	2591000	Yet YouTube kicked us off their network.
2591000	2596000	Well, you know, to be fair, Bobby, we were, we're producing a ton of videos for, you know, VOG,
2596000	2598000	but I totally get the point.
2598000	2602000	Like it does feel like kind of like a whole, like how the fuck are guys like that successful
2602000	2605000	and other hard, so many other hard working people are.
2606000	2610000	So like, okay, so the Logan Paul thing, he was basically taking a break from YouTube for a while
2610000	2613000	because they let the heat die down or whatever.
2613000	2619000	So by accident, YouTube somehow sends out notifications to people
2619000	2622000	that aren't even subscribed to his channel or following him
2622000	2626000	that, hey, Logan Paul's back, go check out his videos.
2626000	2629000	And then people are like, what the fuck is this shit?
2629000	2632000	And they're all, Oh yeah, sorry. It was a setting.
2632000	2634000	It was a glitch setting thing.
2634000	2636000	Why is YouTube playing into that hype?
2636000	2639000	I don't know because it makes them money, I guess.
2639000	2642000	They're making money off of it because of the views and ads.
2642000	2646000	I, you know, I am getting to this point where I'm more and more like,
2646000	2649000	fuck YouTube with a capital F and a capital Y.
2649000	2652000	I just want to like strip all my videos off their site.
2652000	2654000	I was looking at trying to put shaking and crying up on YouTube
2654000	2656000	so that more people could find it to download it.
2656000	2659000	And I'm at, give me this point where I'm like, no,
2659000	2662000	I mean, I'm just going to tell those other people they need to find a better other way
2662000	2667000	and stop supporting YouTube because YouTube is so much garbage all over the place.
2667000	2669000	So much. And it's not even just like this Logan Paul,
2669000	2672000	but clearly when they send out emails like this, it's like, Logan Paul's back.
2672000	2676000	Like, you know, that just shows they're working with him and they want.
2676000	2679000	It's just, it is, seriously.
2679000	2682000	And the hard part about this is you have this douchebag
2682000	2686000	that's causing all these site-wide changes because of the shit he's doing
2686000	2689000	and it's affecting other YouTubers that are doing this stuff.
2689000	2693000	There'll be guys, there was a guy that did an experiment just for sillies.
2693000	2698000	He took, he took his pee, I guess, and he let it like dry out
2698000	2701000	and got the nitrates from it and made black powder from it,
2701000	2705000	which it took like, I think like 18 months or something to do that.
2705000	2709000	And he put the video on the, oh, because he's making explosives,
2709000	2712000	you know, that's a strike against him or something.
2712000	2714000	It was just like a science thing.
2714000	2717000	It's not like anyone would actually use that to create a bomb.
2717000	2720000	I'm going to store all my pee from like several years
2720000	2722000	and make bombs out of that.
2722000	2724000	It's just, it's silly.
2724000	2728000	Uh, yeah, we need a decent competitor to YouTube, we really do.
2728000	2730000	And the Rob D points out a good point,
2730000	2732000	is that Twitch isn't trying to do the same thing
2732000	2735000	and Dailymotion and Vimeo don't cut it.
2735000	2738000	Twitch is inching closer and closer to that direction though,
2738000	2742000	because they are trying to do more like with the videos on demand,
2742000	2745000	but they have to just have a premiere live on your channel or something,
2745000	2749000	you know, but I mean, as a primarily gaming content creator,
2749000	2752000	I wouldn't have a hard time moving all my stuff over to Twitch.
2752000	2757000	Um, but I would wonder how is Twitch going to police all this stuff?
2757000	2758000	I mean, it sounds like it's,
2758000	2761000	it's requiring more of their moderation team and their moderation.
2761000	2764000	They're going to do the a word algorithms.
2764000	2766000	I sure as fuck hope not.
2766000	2768000	I really, cause that's where it's all going to break down.
2768000	2770000	That's where it's all going to break down.
2770000	2775000	Um, let's see, act deft and chat brings up some good points.
2775000	2777000	I use YouTube for my podcast.
2777000	2780000	I depend on YouTube to make it work.
2780000	2783000	Uh, but people being turned off on YouTube,
2783000	2786000	like Rob is going to hurt our podcasts in the long run.
2786000	2788000	Good thing we're now on iTunes and all, but still,
2788000	2790000	and I would agree with that.
2790000	2793000	That's why you want to kind of put your show as many places as possible.
2793000	2796000	And that's why I was looking to put Shaking and Crying,
2796000	2799000	the new show over on YouTube, because I was like,
2799000	2801000	okay, well maybe there is an audience there.
2801000	2804000	You know, they can, uh, even though we don't really do video,
2804000	2806000	at least they could have the audio with maybe like a waveform
2806000	2807000	in the background or something.
2807000	2809000	But the more YouTube does this shit,
2809000	2812000	the more I'm like, well, maybe not, maybe not.
2812000	2815000	We did, I, that is a Shaking and Crying is the first show though
2815000	2817000	that I've had that's on iHeartRadio.
2817000	2818000	So that is, you know, I was like,
2818000	2819000	where are all the podcast apps we're going to,
2819000	2821000	so we're on iHeartRadio with that.
2821000	2823000	So I might put this show on there too.
2823000	2825000	I'm trying to, I want to see how it works.
2825000	2828000	So Shaking and Crying first before I go that length.
2828000	2831000	We'll see. Yeah. So, because you know, they,
2831000	2834000	they are tied to corporate radio, which is interesting,
2834000	2837000	but that can be, that can be for better for worse.
2837000	2840000	Uh, let's see. Let's move on, I guess.
2840000	2841000	We'll move on to some more news.
2841000	2844000	Uh, let's talk about, let's talk about Space Channel 5.
2844000	2847000	This is a series that's been dormant for a while
2847000	2848000	that I love this series.
2848000	2851000	And it sounds like it may be coming back in a way in VR.
2851000	2857000	Uh, it was recently announced at the Niko Niko Tokagi Festival.
2857000	2862000	Uh, uh, this past week that Space Channel 5 VR,
2862000	2866000	Arakata Dancing Show is, uh, going to be demoed there
2866000	2871000	and that the game will be seeing a release in spring of 2018 for the HTC Vive.
2871000	2875000	Now a little while ago, we had talked about a Space Channel 5 thing in VR.
2875000	2878000	That was called Uki Uki Viewing Show.
2878000	2882000	And that's where you threw confetti and helped Ulala to improve the viewership counts.
2882000	2886000	But this new game will be, you're going to dance and do the same poses.
2886000	2890000	I suppose it's a little more similar to what you were doing on the Dreamcast
2890000	2893000	where you were doing it in, you know, up, left, two.
2893000	2897000	And you probably have to do, like, you know, that type of thing with actual motion
2897000	2898000	since it's going to be in VR.
2898000	2902000	So I'm here for that because I love Space Channel 5.
2902000	2904000	So I'm just excited they're doing a new game in the series.
2904000	2908000	I'm a little surprised it's only Vive and they're not talking PlayStation 4,
2908000	2912000	you know, which is usually where I see a lot of gamey stuff,
2912000	2915000	you know, that I remember from consoles and up.
2915000	2916000	But, okay, I mean.
2916000	2917000	Maybe it's just the motion control stuff.
2917000	2919000	Yeah, it could be. It could be.
2919000	2923000	Because you're not required to have a move stuff on, I don't know.
2923000	2924000	A lot of people do, though.
2924000	2925000	Yeah, it's free.
2925000	2926000	Can you have a game?
2926000	2927000	You kind of have to have to.
2927000	2929000	Okay, you can have a game that requires the move stuff, right?
2929000	2930000	Yeah, there's a lot of them.
2930000	2931000	Yeah.
2931000	2933000	What was that?
2933000	2935000	Was there a noise in the background or was it just me?
2935000	2936000	I think it was just you.
2936000	2937000	Maybe it was his website. I don't know.
2937000	2938000	All right.
2938000	2941000	Anyway, maybe Mr. Smoosh knocked something over. I don't know.
2941000	2942000	All right. Well, anyway.
2942000	2947000	So Space Channel 5, in VR, I would be very excited to play that.
2947000	2951000	I still need to get something that does VR already,
2951000	2954000	besides just the little cell phone VR.
2954000	2957000	Maybe over the summer.
2957000	2959000	Maybe with a tax refund. Who knows?
2959000	2963000	They have some pretty good PlayStation VR bundles.
2963000	2965000	Okay, thank you. Yeah, the chatters heard that noise, too.
2965000	2967000	I'm sorry, guys. I don't know what that was.
2967000	2969000	I think the website I was on might have one of those autoplay videos or something,
2969000	2971000	so sorry about that.
2971000	2972000	All right. Well, moving on.
2972000	2973000	All right.
2973000	2980000	So Google is looking to possibly get into the video game streaming business.
2980000	2987000	So they've got a company that they are working on a service called, what is it, Yeti,
2987000	2991000	which allow people to stream games to them online,
2991000	2996000	and I guess it allows you to avoid having a console or high-end computer or something like that.
2996000	3000000	So kind of like all those other streaming services that they had out there for a while,
3000000	3002000	like PlayStation Now and stuff.
3002000	3005000	They have Phil Harrison hired on now.
3005000	3009000	You may remember him from such companies as Microsoft and Sony.
3009000	3014000	And now they're working on possibly this service.
3014000	3019000	They haven't really said what the pricing is going to be or what the details are on this yet.
3019000	3023000	Still kind of early, but it is something that's being worked on.
3023000	3027000	So I guess we'll have to see what happens with this.
3027000	3032000	Maybe cool, though, like if they're saying that like you could work with like Chromecast or something like that.
3032000	3034000	You know, that'd be neat to see how that works out.
3034000	3041000	I just don't I'm not really turned on to the idea of like paying a subscription service to like something like that,
3041000	3045000	where you can play all these different games because I have a library of steam games,
3045000	3051000	like five or some games that I can play and probably all very entertaining and same on my PlayStation.
3051000	3053000	And I just don't do that.
3053000	3062000	So unless you can like get me something, it would be hard for me to want to do something like that.
3062000	3070000	Yeah, I kind of feel like nothing has really hit that level of GameTap back in the day,
3070000	3073000	which was like game streaming in a way.
3073000	3077000	I don't think it really streamed per se. It was like you're kind of downloading a copy of the game temporarily.
3077000	3079000	But, you know, is that the whole like rich library on demand?
3079000	3083000	But GameTap was really good at having a rich library of retro stuff, too.
3083000	3086000	So I don't know. I guess it would really depend on what the game offerings look like.
3086000	3091000	But I find that also playing a lot of PC stuff on my TV just doesn't like I don't know the SteamBox.
3091000	3095000	I'm not getting as much use out of that as I thought I would when I first bought it.
3095000	3098000	I thought I would use it a lot to play stuff on the TV.
3098000	3099000	Oh, the SteamLink?
3099000	3101000	I'm sorry. Yeah, SteamLink. Sorry, not SteamBox.
3101000	3107000	SteamBox is the computer. SteamLink. I really use SteamLink, but I know other people that use it a lot.
3107000	3108000	So maybe that's just...
3108000	3110000	I still haven't hooked mine up. I need to do that.
3110000	3111000	You should do that. Test it out.
3111000	3114000	Well, it's because you need to have your computer on, right? To do it.
3114000	3117000	So I have my laptop on. It would just be kind of silly.
3117000	3119000	It's like, well, I can play on my laptop, which is right in front of me.
3119000	3122000	Or I can play on my TV that's a little bit more in front of me.
3122000	3126000	It's like, I don't know. I should try it.
3126000	3130000	Yeah. So, I don't know. It depends on what's in the library.
3130000	3132000	That's what it's really going to boil down to.
3132000	3140000	And if there's a really rich retro library, that was something that GameTap did very well that I didn't mind paying for.
3140000	3146000	Especially another thing that I think GameTap did well back in the day was the leaderboards and some of that stuff that they did.
3146000	3151000	I think if a game streaming service can incorporate more of that, that'll be really cool.
3151000	3155000	You know what you want to bring people back with if you want to do something? One versus 100.
3155000	3158000	Oh, don't get me on that rant again.
3158000	3161000	Man, why did Xbox ever have to get that?
3161000	3164000	Well, now everybody's crazy about HQ.
3164000	3165000	What's HQ?
3165000	3170000	It's that phone app, which is like the live game show that's like 10 or 15 questions.
3170000	3174000	And if you answer them all, you win real money. You win a share of the pot.
3174000	3177000	They just started one at 6 o'clock. That was because I was getting all the notifications.
3177000	3181000	But they do them at 6 o'clock every night, so obviously when OLR is going on, we start at 6 o'clock.
3181000	3183000	Like in the middle of my drive.
3183000	3185000	Well, no. It's in the middle of the show.
3185000	3187000	Well, that too.
3187000	3191000	Oh, at nights when you're commuting home. Yeah, it's in the middle of your drive. You got it.
3191000	3195000	But during the weekdays, they do them at noon and 6, I think, for our time.
3195000	3198000	I realize East Coast is different hours, but it's noon and 6 for us.
3198000	3204000	I think tonight they were giving away $15,000 or something like that, but it's split between all the winners.
3204000	3209000	So if 100 people win, they're really only winning 150 bucks each.
3209000	3212000	That's still $150 you didn't have.
3212000	3216000	For what's essentially a free app that I don't even think is running ads still.
3216000	3222000	I think all of the money that's funding that app came from investment money.
3222000	3226000	I mean, they probably could start selling ads and make it decent, because they've got like...
3226000	3232000	I haven't played it in a while, but there was at least 80,000 people in each game when I would go check it out.
3232000	3236000	But it's one of those games where the first few questions are easy, but then they get really fucking hard.
3236000	3239000	So that's why most people don't make it to the end.
3239000	3245000	And you only have, as he reads the question, when he starts reading the question, you have like 10 seconds to answer.
3245000	3249000	So you can't Google it. If you think you can sit there and Google it, you're not going to have enough time to do it.
3249000	3252000	I've tried. You don't have enough time to do it.
3252000	3254000	Voice search.
3254000	3258000	It's still not going to work, because usually by the time he's done reading the question, you have like 3 seconds left.
3258000	3262000	And that's not enough time to wait for the search results.
3262000	3264000	Is it multiple choice? You have to type it in.
3264000	3268000	It is. A, B, or C. Or D. I think there's 4 answers.
3268000	3271000	It's harder than you'd think.
3271000	3277000	Bobby Blackwolf says HQ trivia equals 1 vs. 100. They use the same concepts. Live host, etc.
3277000	3280000	Yeah. HQ's probably the closest thing.
3280000	3283000	I just don't care for HQ.
3283000	3287000	It's a really basic-ass trivia show.
3287000	3290000	It's nothing but 4-question multiple choice.
3290000	3294000	And for me, it's been very buggy.
3294000	3296000	The video gets really shitty.
3296000	3300000	I haven't played it in a while, and I know they've done a lot of patches, so maybe it's better now.
3300000	3306000	But in my experience with it, it was a lot of frame skips, a lot of missing stuff.
3306000	3308000	It kind of was clunky.
3308000	3310000	Maybe that's better now, I don't know.
3310000	3316000	But there was a certain flair that 1 vs. 100 had on Xbox 360 that I just liked so much better.
3316000	3321000	So anyway, thanks for getting me on that rant again about how much I miss the Xbox game shows.
3321000	3324000	I shouldn't bring up Classic Game Room then, should I?
3324000	3327000	No, let's not. Let's not do that. Let's do another story instead.
3327000	3329000	Alright.
3329000	3339000	So, there was a guy that created a mod for The Division that was used for doing kind of cinematic screenshots, I guess.
3339000	3346000	So, the modder, he put out this thing. It was a set of tools called Cinematic Tools.
3346000	3353000	And I believe that it allowed you to kind of do a freecam and move stuff around.
3353000	3358000	But apparently, I think it used Cheat Engine as well to kind of do this.
3358000	3367000	And because of that, Ubisoft detected that he was doing this and basically banned him for life from the game.
3367000	3371000	And what's ironic, though, is there was an update.
3371000	3376000	Actually, some Ubisoft, you know, let's see here.
3376000	3381000	We had a creative director, Julian Gerdy.
3381000	3386000	Looks like he reached out to him saying, hey, yeah, I love your stuff.
3386000	3389000	I mean, it worked. I'd like to see more of it.
3389000	3392000	You know, he's going to look into the whole situation.
3392000	3397000	Because I guess he was tweeting Ubisoft these pictures that are really amazing.
3397000	3399000	Yeah, no, I don't even play the game.
3399000	3403000	And I was looking at those pictures when, you know, I was looking at the news for this week.
3403000	3406000	And he goes, look at those pictures and, man, they're beautiful.
3406000	3410000	And that's the direction that video games are moving into looking more and more alike.
3410000	3413000	Although, of course, that takes a lot more art and all that stuff.
3413000	3416000	But, man, it looks incredible.
3416000	3423000	I can see a happy medium where they reverse his ban and maybe work with him to build a cinematic mode or something into the game.
3423000	3430000	Well, yeah, and it also seems to me that algorithms probably detected what he was doing and ended up banning him.
3430000	3437000	Which, you know, technically he probably did, you know, but Ubisoft should try to work with this guy, I think.
3437000	3439000	There's exceptions to every rule, right?
3439000	3440000	Yeah.
3440000	3441000	Absolutely.
3441000	3446000	All right, well, let's talk about Ages of Mayhem, which was a game that you kind of skipped, right, Loki?
3446000	3448000	Oh, yes. Totally skipped.
3448000	3456000	Yeah, and it sounds like a lot of people skipped it because I don't think this game did as well as they were hoping for being a, you know, Saints Row spinoff game.
3456000	3459000	Well, that's my problem is the Saints Row spinoff game.
3459000	3460000	You wanted it to be its own thing.
3460000	3462000	Well, it was its own thing at one time.
3462000	3470000	Like, in the very beginning, when the very first trailer, they announced it, it was just its own game and they, like, kind of hinted a little bit that it might be in the same universe as Saints Row.
3470000	3481000	And then by the time we get to the end of it, they have fucking Johnny Gat in there and, like, they're putting, like, Pierce and fucking just, like, Kinsey, all the fucking people from, like, Saints Row practically in there again.
3481000	3489000	It's like, dude, what the hell? You couldn't make this game stand on its own? You just had to borrow from Saints Row and then make it some underwhelming piece of shit?
3489000	3502000	Well, it may be getting another life in a board game form, of all things, and the way people found this was through Academy Games' website, which they do a lot of, I guess, more historical-based type of games.
3502000	3507000	For example, they have a game called Freedom the Underground Railroad, which is about the Underground Railroad.
3507000	3510000	They have a game called Conflict of Heroes, which is about World War II.
3510000	3517000	But apparently, there's a Kickstarter campaign link for a game called Agents of Mayhem, Pride of Babylon.
3517000	3523000	It's a 3D tabletop game based on the game and you, it is a real Kickstarter campaign. You can go check that out.
3523000	3527000	It's on Kickstarter.com and it's already met their goal four times over.
3527000	3533000	So apparently, there were enough fans of Agents of Mayhem or at least board games where this thing got funded.
3533000	3535000	You can still get in on it. There's 15 days left to back it.
3536000	3543000	Depending on how you feel about Kickstarters, I don't always like to talk about Kickstarters on this show anymore because I realize a few of them come to full fruition.
3543000	3550000	However, this does seem to be a company that has kind of proven themselves through these other historical-based games.
3550000	3554000	And they probably have other stuff too. I'm just not as up to speed on board games as other people are.
3554000	3559000	But anyway, so through the Agents of Mayhem, Pride of Babylon game, it's a board game for two to four players.
3559000	3564000	It's on a module 3D board that is fully destructible. That sounds like fun.
3564000	3567000	Like maybe you get to build things up and then destroy them. That's kind of fun.
3567000	3569000	That's a neat little concept.
3569000	3573000	Knock it over. Aren't all board games fully destructible?
3573000	3578000	When you're losing Monopoly, fuck this and you flip it over and it's destructed.
3578000	3582000	Although, did you hear about the Monopoly that's like the cheaters Monopoly?
3582000	3583000	No.
3583000	3585000	Because you know how there's a million versions of Monopoly, right?
3585000	3588000	You could get like Golden Girls Monopoly, Scooby Doo Monopoly.
3588000	3590000	Like Cheaters as in the show?
3590000	3592000	No, no, no. Cheaters.
3592000	3595000	Oh, not the show. Not even Cheaters the show.
3595000	3596000	That would be hilarious.
3596000	3597000	That would be great.
3597000	3600000	I don't like this community chest. Next.
3600000	3602000	No, it's none of those dating shows.
3602000	3613000	It's like you are encouraged to steal money from the bank and do things that people do in regular Monopoly that try not to get caught.
3613000	3619000	Like they steal money from the bank or they, you know, will draw extra cards or try to steal a property.
3619000	3621000	Haven't you known somebody who's tried to cheat at Monopoly?
3621000	3622000	No.
3622000	3623000	I totally know, yeah.
3623000	3627000	Anyway, I got a little bit distracted from the topic at hand.
3627000	3633000	So, Ages of Mayhem, board game, but it looks like you're going to be able to build multi-level buildings that can be destroyed.
3633000	3636000	And that part's kind of cool actually, I gotta say. That sounds kind of fun.
3636000	3642000	You can either play Legion or Mayhem in the game and yeah, so folks I'm sure are getting in on that.
3642000	3651000	So, very cool. And it sounds like $90 is the minimum pledge for a reward and that will get you the 3D board game.
3651000	3652000	No thanks.
3652000	3658000	And an expansion and so on. So, neat.
3658000	3662000	Yeah, I'll play the video game when it comes in one of those Humble bundles or something like that.
3662000	3664000	Or when it's inevitably on PlayStation Plus.
3664000	3667000	Oh, it's going to be marked down. Like they marked down all the Saints Row games to like dirt cheap.
3667000	3670000	It only took four years for Knack to come to PlayStation Plus.
3670000	3672000	It's just a matter of time, Loki.
3672000	3673000	It's just waiting game.
3673000	3674000	That's right.
3674000	3683000	Yeah, I bought Saints Row on console because I got the bundle with that and Johnny got out of hell.
3683000	3687000	Bobcoffee in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
3687000	3696000	When's RuPaul's Drag Race Monopoly? Hey, wait. I'm sure there's going to be something where it's like, go directly to jail.
3696000	3698000	You better sissy that walk to the cell.
3698000	3701000	Hey, you know, it's still in review right now to be a Lego set.
3701000	3705000	Yeah, so the Lego set might happen. That's going to be awesome if it does.
3705000	3708000	But I think there's no way it's going to lose to that Christmas Story house.
3708000	3710000	And that Christmas Story house is going to be the winner.
3710000	3714000	No, you don't understand. It's not a voting thing. They're not picking one out of there.
3714000	3717000	They look at all of them. They approve multiples.
3717000	3720000	I thought out of each group of eight, only one ever got approved.
3720000	3721000	No.
3721000	3722000	Oh, I thought that's how it worked.
3722000	3723000	That's the case at all.
3723000	3728000	So it's whatever ones they think that they can work into a set and get the licensing and everything for.
3728000	3730000	So it could very well do.
3730000	3733000	Well, if there's a Lego thing out there, fucking do it. Do the drag racing.
3733000	3740000	They have, and y'all know how I feel about the pop vinyl figures, you know, and here's the thing.
3740000	3742000	I'm trying not, I'm really not trying to hate on the pop vinyl thing.
3742000	3745000	I get why they're really popular. I get why people collect them.
3745000	3747000	But they're everywhere.
3747000	3748000	They are everywhere.
3748000	3750000	You go to conventions, it's every other booth.
3750000	3752000	You go to the mall, it's every other store.
3752000	3753000	Every store has them.
3753000	3756000	But despite what I'm saying about all that, look over there.
3756000	3764000	I got RuPaul, Alaska, and Trixie pop vinyls that I found at a Hot Topic when I went to the DDR thing in the Bay Area.
3764000	3766000	Because our malls didn't have them, but that mall did.
3766000	3770000	So I was like, you know, and it dropped like 45 bucks on those fucking dolls.
3770000	3771000	But my love for-
3771000	3774000	Try and find more of them. I bet they've got them stocked down in San Francisco.
3774000	3779000	Those are the only three for drag race that are out now, but I'm sure there'll be more.
3779000	3783000	It blows my mind there's not a Bianca Del Rio doll, but maybe they just couldn't get the rights for it.
3783000	3784000	And, you know, I don't know.
3784000	3787000	Maybe they just drag it out and make sure they sell all of them.
3787000	3788000	Maybe. That could be part of it, too.
3788000	3789000	So we'll see.
3789000	3792000	Anyway, let's move on.
3794000	3796000	You got a story about Fortnite, right?
3796000	3803000	Yeah, so Fortnite Battle Royale's been pretty popular, especially that, you know, that portion at least is free to play.
3803000	3808000	So now they've got, they've hit a new record.
3808000	3813000	Apparently 3.4 million concurrent players at one time.
3813000	3819000	And so the previous record was held by PlayerUnknown's Battleground at 3.2 million.
3819000	3825000	But now they have smashed that record, and it's only gonna go up from here, right?
3825000	3827000	So, yeah.
3827000	3829000	Pretty awesome that they're doing well.
3829000	3833000	I mean, those Battle Royale games are definitely popular, so I'm sure we'll see a lot more of that.
3833000	3840000	I heard, was it even, that they're talking about that there's gonna be a Battle Royale-type game in Red Dead Redemption 2.
3840000	3843000	Yeah, I think a lot of games are looking at doing a mode like that now.
3843000	3844000	So, it's...
3844000	3849000	Meanwhile, the creators of PUBG are coming out saying,
3849000	3853000	And you have us to thank! I made you, and I can break you just as easily!
3853000	3858000	Or H1Z1, King of the Kill, had that fucking first.
3858000	3860000	You missed the joke, because PUBG was...
3860000	3861000	I know, PUBG is...
3861000	3864000	A little salty at this whole thing to begin with.
3864000	3868000	Wasn't it like Capcom and do something like that?
3868000	3869000	I don't know.
3869000	3874000	Capcom has sold oodles and oodles of Monster Hunter World.
3874000	3876000	They have nothing to be upset about right now.
3876000	3880000	Like, Capcom has no reason to complain, at least this week.
3880000	3883000	I just, like, the PUBG guys, like, you know,
3883000	3886000	I'm sorry that your game is not the most popular game anymore.
3886000	3891000	Darn, you'll just have to settle to be the second most popular game in the world.
3891000	3893000	It's like...
3893000	3896000	I feel so terrible for you.
3896000	3899000	Minecraft couldn't be number one forever. No game's gonna be number one forever.
3899000	3902000	Minecraft's not number one, but it's got fucking feet, so make your game have feet.
3902000	3906000	Make people want to keep coming back and playing. Give it long legs.
3906000	3909000	Alright. Let's move on.
3909000	3912000	Other big games that have cooled down a little bit.
3912000	3915000	Alright. And then...
3915000	3918000	Let's see here. So, other stuff.
3918000	3922000	We can talk about, you know, one of the not very popular games.
3922000	3925000	And that being, you know, Pokemon Go. No one plays that anymore.
3925000	3928000	But Pokemon Go, they have...
3928000	3932000	There's a rumor that there's gonna be some story-based quests coming soon.
3932000	3936000	Thanks to data miners who have taken apart the latest version of the game to see that.
3936000	3941000	So, with that, apparently there's gonna be both short and long-term goals with these.
3941000	3946000	They're gonna include different characters from the franchise, including, like, Professor Willow.
3946000	3950000	They're saying that according, I guess, the website, Silph Road,
3950000	3955000	these characters are gonna be given animations and facial expressions and stuff like that,
3955000	3957000	so you'll be able to see them emote and stuff.
3957000	3961000	And then also, they're noting that...
3961000	3963000	What else?
3963000	3966000	They're gonna basically...
3966000	3969000	Yeah, different, I guess, indicators about the quests and stuff.
3969000	3972000	And then, of course, the actual patch notes they're talking about.
3972000	3975000	You know, that they'll let trainers...
3975000	3980000	I guess you'll be able to search your Pokemon collection using terms like shiny.
3980000	3983000	So, if you wanna look at all your shinies, you can do that.
3983000	3986000	Then, improved in-game news feature, which...
3986000	3988000	Swear to fucking God, I've been playing, like, today.
3988000	3990000	I swiped it away the first time.
3990000	3993000	It's like, hey, did you know there's Pokemon from Gen 3?
3993000	3995000	And I'm like, fucking, I'm trying to play this game.
3995000	3998000	This, like, pop-up is getting in my way.
3998000	4001000	Yeah, I mean, it looks a lot better, but it's...
4001000	4003000	Yeah, I get alerts all the time from it, too.
4003000	4005000	It's like, dude, no shit.
4005000	4009000	Is that where all these Gen 3 Pokemon are coming from?
4009000	4011000	I don't need to know that.
4011000	4013000	Well, I think the story mode could be really cool.
4013000	4015000	I think it's something a little different, so it's not just, you know,
4015000	4017000	catch all the nests and raid all the things.
4017000	4020000	I'm wondering if it's gonna be like, you know, the missions that they do in Ingress.
4020000	4022000	I mean, that wouldn't be bad.
4022000	4024000	Oh, God, I'd love that, like, where you get little mission badges.
4024000	4026000	That's, like, the best thing in Ingress right now.
4026000	4028000	I'm so bored of the fielding game.
4028000	4030000	It's just, I like doing the missions.
4030000	4032000	Like, maybe it could be, like, they could have,
4032000	4034000	instead they can't capture anything.
4034000	4036000	I doubt they'd have you capture a gym,
4036000	4038000	because that takes a long time.
4038000	4042000	I, like, did that during, I was watching my kid do gymnastics or whatever,
4042000	4044000	and, like, I sat there hacking away at their gym,
4044000	4047000	and it's just, it takes so long.
4047000	4049000	For those that don't know missions in Ingress,
4049000	4051000	and what I'm referring to is that in Ingress,
4051000	4053000	you can, like, you know, you'll go to places,
4053000	4056000	and you can hack, like, they are user created,
4056000	4058000	and they're in the game once they're approved
4058000	4060000	by the moderation board or whatever,
4060000	4063000	and it's, like, you hack these six portals in a park,
4063000	4065000	and you'll get a permanent badge on your profile
4065000	4067000	that shows you completed this mission,
4067000	4070000	and, you know, so it's just a nice way to show that you visited this park.
4070000	4074000	For example, and some of them have, like, banners,
4074000	4077000	so instead of just one mission, it's, like, 18 missions,
4077000	4079000	but when you put them all together,
4079000	4081000	it does a nice little banner on your profile.
4081000	4084000	For example, when I was in Atlanta for Dragon Con last year,
4084000	4088000	I did an 18-part Ingress mission that took you around the hotels
4088000	4090000	and around that part of Atlanta,
4090000	4095000	and now I have a permanent copy of the old carpet at the hotel,
4095000	4098000	the infamous, you know, carpet, on my profile.
4098000	4102000	So that's really cool, because they actually took that carpet out last year,
4102000	4106000	so, but it's really funny that now that's on, you know, my profile in Ingress.
4106000	4108000	That would be kind of cool if they did something like that.
4108000	4111000	I mean, I guess they could have it, like, be within distance of this portal,
4111000	4114000	or not portal, Poke Stop and catch a Pokemon or something like that,
4114000	4115000	or I don't know.
4115000	4118000	But, yeah, the cool things with Ingress missions, too,
4118000	4121000	it's, like, aside from just, like, you know, hack this, destroy this,
4121000	4125000	upgrade this or whatever, they also have walk to this spot
4125000	4127000	and answer this trivia question, you know.
4127000	4129000	Yeah, those can be cool.
4129000	4133000	They can also be annoying when the source of the question is gone.
4133000	4135000	Like, I did a mission in Seattle.
4135000	4136000	It was when they were newer,
4136000	4138000	we didn't have a lot of the multi-part stuff yet.
4138000	4141000	I did one in Seattle at the Pacific Science Center there,
4141000	4144000	and I had to hack, like, 40 portals, I swear.
4144000	4146000	And then, finally, I got to, like, the last one.
4146000	4147000	It had a trivia question.
4147000	4150000	The board with the trivia question was gone.
4150000	4151000	I could not answer the trivia question.
4151000	4152000	I could not finish the mission.
4152000	4154000	I was so irritated.
4154000	4160000	So, when it works, it's great, but when it doesn't work, it's fucking annoying.
4160000	4162000	So, yeah.
4162000	4163000	Anyway.
4164000	4166000	Let's move on.
4166000	4169000	And one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week,
4169000	4172000	and this has to do with Crash Bandicoot.
4172000	4175000	And, of course, Crash Bandicoot had the N. Sane Trilogy,
4175000	4177000	which did pretty well on PlayStation.
4177000	4179000	I don't know if you guys know, but it did pretty well on the PlayStation.
4179000	4184000	Apparently, there was an article that came out on the, what,
4184000	4189000	Licensing Sourcebook Europe apparently mentioned that
4189000	4194000	there's going to be an N. Sane Trilogy Switch port was mentioned in the article.
4194000	4200000	And that also a new entry in the franchise was going to be coming out next year.
4200000	4202000	Well, that would make sense that if the trilogy did so well,
4202000	4204000	they're probably going to revisit this franchise at some point.
4204000	4206000	But the trilogy coming to the Switch?
4206000	4207000	Huh.
4207000	4213000	Well, the article was edited to remove all the mentions of those details.
4213000	4214000	Hmm.
4214000	4218000	Could this be something we hear about at E3 or maybe a little sooner?
4218000	4219000	I don't know.
4219000	4224000	But that's very interesting that Crash Bandicoot was mentioned for the Switch,
4224000	4227000	because I think most of us think of that as very Sony-related property,
4227000	4229000	even though it's an Activision...
4229000	4232000	I guess. I mean, I don't know.
4232000	4237000	They had Crash games, I think, on the Wii.
4237000	4239000	Did they? I don't remember.
4239000	4241000	I want to say that maybe the racing game was on the Wii.
4241000	4242000	Oh, you might be right.
4242000	4244000	Or the 3DS, I feel like, had something.
4244000	4245000	Something, yeah.
4245000	4247000	The DS or 3DS had something.
4248000	4249000	All right.
4249000	4253000	Well, it's time for us to get to the classic game of the week.
4253000	4256000	We're going to take a trip down memory lane to a time
4256000	4259000	when we were all playing Crash Bandicoot for the first time.
4259000	4262000	And we are going to be joined by Dark Soccer at this point in the show,
4262000	4264000	so let's try to get her on the line here.
4264000	4266000	And she's going to take us on a trip down memory lane
4266000	4270000	to find a classic game that we're going to look back on this week,
4270000	4272000	as she's going to step into the gaming vault
4272000	4274000	and find a game that she wants to talk about tonight.
4274000	4276000	And we are calling the actual phone,
4276000	4277000	and I think we have her there.
4277000	4278000	You there, Jamie?
4278000	4279000	Yes.
4279000	4281000	I forgot that I changed your ringtone.
4281000	4283000	Well, but we're calling from the computer.
4283000	4285000	I'm not calling from my cell phone.
4285000	4288000	Yeah, but it still comes through.
4288000	4291000	I mean, I didn't like your ringtone, but my ringtone in general.
4291000	4295000	My new default ringtone is the Dark World theme from Link to the Past,
4295000	4297000	and it used to be the Doctor Who theme.
4297000	4298000	Oh, okay.
4298000	4301000	So you didn't realize there was a phone call coming through at first.
4301000	4302000	No, I knew.
4302000	4304000	I heard it, and I looked at it, and I'm like, what?
4304000	4309000	Because my brain's all addled because I had an accident.
4309000	4311000	Well, I hope you're feeling better.
4311000	4313000	I missed you tonight, but I understand.
4313000	4316000	So if you're not okay to drive, then don't drive.
4316000	4320000	Yeah, I wasn't okay to walk.
4320000	4321000	Well, feel better.
4321000	4322000	Feel better.
4322000	4323000	Are you okay to do the Classic Game of the Week?
4323000	4325000	Oh, yeah.
4325000	4326000	Well, then let's get to it.
4326000	4328000	What is the Classic Game of the Week, Darth Zagara?
4328000	4332000	It is the arcade stage.
4332000	4333000	Good choice.
4334000	4336000	I'm going to play some of the music loud here at first
4336000	4340000	so people can hear the awesome Eurobeat in this game,
4340000	4344000	but I'm going to take it way down so that you can talk over it.
4346000	4347000	All right.
4347000	4350000	Well, the game is in the initial arcade stage,
4350000	4353000	which has spawned many other games,
4353000	4355000	and I'm half talking about the first game
4355000	4357000	and half talking about the whole series.
4357000	4361000	So the first game came out,
4361000	4364000	and, you know, I had the date on here a moment ago.
4364000	4366000	I think it was 2002.
4367000	4368000	Maybe I'm wrong.
4368000	4369000	No, I'll take that back.
4369000	4374000	2001 in Japan and 2002 in the English version.
4374000	4379000	So, you know, basically it was based off the manga and anime,
4379000	4384000	which is basically all street racing and drifting and cars.
4384000	4385000	Ooh.
4385000	4387000	And cars that kind of exist.
4387000	4388000	Ooh.
4388000	4394000	So anyway, you have different types and modes to play through.
4394000	4396000	It's all, you know, one-on-one racing.
4398000	4402000	And there are some interesting things about the arcade versions themselves.
4402000	4405000	So basically the arcade stage,
4405000	4408000	which we only just got it over here as just initial D,
4408000	4413000	and then they started putting out the version numbers and all that later.
4414000	4419000	But you can save your progress with a magnetic card system,
4419000	4422000	and you can save your customized card and your progress,
4422000	4424000	or you lose your progress,
4424000	4430000	but with those cards you have to play only on an initial D cabinet with the same version,
4430000	4433000	and you have to renew every 50 plays,
4433000	4435000	so that way you can get their money.
4435000	4436000	Yay!
4436000	4439000	And of course they're not backwards compatible,
4439000	4442000	like a version 2 card cannot be used on a version 1 machine.
4442000	4445000	And if you upgrade it on another machine it's a permanent upgrade.
4445000	4447000	So that's how the card thing works.
4447000	4450000	As far as the games in the series,
4450000	4453000	there was arcade stage and then version 2,
4453000	4456000	version 3, arcade stage 4, arcade stage 5,
4456000	4458000	and those were all the arcade ones.
4458000	4461000	And then there were three home versions.
4461000	4465000	There was initial D special stage for PlayStation 2,
4465000	4466000	which I have it,
4466000	4468000	initial D street stage for PSP,
4468000	4470000	which I don't have it,
4470000	4473000	and initial D exchange stage for PS3, which we have it,
4473000	4476000	because Hubby is kind of obsessed.
4476000	4479000	So as far as the different modes for the first one,
4479000	4482000	I mean first of all the cabinets themselves,
4482000	4484000	they look like standard racing cabinets,
4484000	4486000	but they play all the Eurobeat,
4486000	4488000	and you get to pick which songs you start off with,
4488000	4490000	which was pretty much for me,
4490000	4493000	it was always Heartbeat,
4493000	4494000	because I love that song.
4494000	4499000	So as far as the first version that you had three different modes,
4499000	4501000	you have Legend of the Street,
4501000	4504000	which is your main story mode
4504000	4507000	where you go against different opponents who are in the manga
4507000	4509000	or in the anime,
4509000	4511000	and you have to go against them.
4511000	4512000	And then there's Time Attack,
4512000	4517000	which is basically racing against other players
4517000	4520000	or at the current machine or across the internet,
4520000	4522000	you rank that way based on your time.
4522000	4524000	And then Battle Mode,
4524000	4527000	which is I guess just the one-on-one race.
4527000	4530000	You had four different courses,
4530000	4531000	you had Miyogi,
4531000	4534000	you had Usui,
4534000	4535000	you had Akina,
4535000	4538000	and you had Hapagahara,
4538000	4541000	which the cool thing about this is that
4541000	4545000	it actually has two different versions of each track.
4545000	4548000	So for Miyogi and Usui,
4548000	4551000	you had Clockwise and Counterclockwise.
4551000	4554000	For Akina you had, since it's a mountain drive,
4554000	4556000	it's downhill or uphill.
4556000	4558000	And then for Hapagahara,
4558000	4560000	you had Inbound and Outbound.
4560000	4565000	So it actually had technically eight different ways you could race.
4565000	4567000	And then later versions,
4567000	4569000	if I remember right,
4569000	4574000	brought in Time of Day and different weather conditions.
4574000	4578000	Version 3, which was the 2003 one that came out,
4578000	4582000	had different tracks,
4582000	4584000	like Irohazuka,
4584000	4586000	which was one of the expert modes,
4586000	4588000	the new export one.
4588000	4590000	You had Akina Snow,
4590000	4591000	Shomaru,
4591000	4593000	and Shisaka.
4593000	4595000	So you had a bunch of different ones.
4595000	4598000	I just want to jump in real quick,
4598000	4600000	because the chat room is lighting up,
4600000	4602000	saying the Initial D went up to,
4602000	4604000	they actually are past Initial D8.
4604000	4606000	I guess they did a game called Initial D0,
4606000	4608000	which is kind of like the ninth game,
4608000	4609000	but there's more than five.
4609000	4610000	They're up to like nine.
4610000	4612000	Yeah, they're up to Arcade Stage 0,
4612000	4614000	and then there was Special Stage, Street Stage,
4614000	4615000	and Extreme Stage.
4615000	4616000	And there was also,
4616000	4618000	6 was Stage 6 AA,
4618000	4620000	and 7 was AAX.
4620000	4623000	I'm sorry, I was going between two different lists of the games.
4623000	4626000	So the one I had hasn't been,
4626000	4628000	the first one that was going off hadn't been updated in a while,
4628000	4630000	but I know that all of them exist.
4630000	4633000	In fact, Stage 0 is actually pretty neat.
4633000	4635000	And that was on the SEGA New 2 Arcade board.
4635000	4638000	It came out just last year in March.
4638000	4641000	And it has a six-speed gear shift,
4641000	4643000	like the ones in One Gun Midnight Maximum 2.
4643000	4646000	So, pretty good.
4646000	4649000	But as far as though back to the earlier ones,
4649000	4651000	because your rears are in the classics,
4651000	4656000	because all up until we hit 2007,
4656000	4661000	they of course, they all had great music.
4661000	4663000	It was all, you know,
4663000	4664000	Eurobeatle.
4664000	4669000	The newer games, of course, have some other music.
4669000	4675000	In fact, our TV Zero brought in some rocks from,
4675000	4679000	in fact, Jeff Smith, The Hug Me, The Vow, Gecko Green.
4679000	4688000	And it also reduced the vehicles back to the originals.
4688000	4691000	So, you know, but the games, I mean,
4691000	4694000	I've never seen them not busy.
4694000	4697000	Even some of the older ones at arcades these days,
4697000	4699000	they're still pretty busy.
4699000	4702000	And of course, you know, for people who were not,
4702000	4704000	you know, para para people,
4704000	4709000	this was a lot of people's introduction to Eurobeat, you know?
4709000	4712000	Heck yeah, Eurobeat rules.
4712000	4714000	Yeah.
4714000	4719000	So I figured that a game that kind of hearkens back to another one of our
4719000	4722000	big, you know, video game loves being, you know,
4722000	4724000	pata pata in the Devony series.
4724000	4726000	They have that in common.
4726000	4730000	So I figured this would be a good one to bring up for classic games.
4730000	4733000	So yeah, there are 12 games in the series,
4733000	4735000	nine for arcade, three for home consoles.
4735000	4738000	And I don't think it's ever going to stop even though,
4738000	4742000	what was the last movie they brought out like three years ago?
4742000	4743000	Oh, I don't know.
4743000	4744000	I think?
4744000	4745000	I've never seen any of these movies.
4745000	4747000	I rarely play the games, to be honest.
4747000	4748000	I'm not a hater.
4748000	4751000	It's just usually these are the things I'm playing in between waiting for
4751000	4752000	games of DDR.
4752000	4755000	Somebody said this exact same thing in the chat room earlier,
4755000	4759000	but it was kind of like it was that other game at the arcade that wasn't DDR.
4759000	4760000	All right.
4760000	4761000	So I was kind of right.
4761000	4765000	The Legend 3 movie, hold on.
4765000	4766000	There was, yeah,
4766000	4772000	the final stage was a four episode series that came out in 2014.
4772000	4775000	And then there were the movies that they did,
4775000	4781000	and then they did a live action initially that was, hold on.
4781000	4783000	It came out in 2005 as well.
4783000	4786000	So one thing I was reading about,
4786000	4791000	just the areas that they filmed part of the movie is that now there are
4791000	4795000	apparently a bunch of like figure and model car museums.
4795000	4802000	And then there are, what else did they do?
4802000	4808000	They actually have like photo ops at where the races are,
4808000	4810000	where they were the places that were modeled.
4810000	4813000	Like Akina isn't really a real mountain location.
4813000	4814000	It had a different name.
4814000	4817000	And off the top of my head, I can't remember what it was called,
4817000	4821000	but a lot of those places, they are real places,
4821000	4823000	but they were renamed for the series.
4823000	4826000	So anyway, you know, that's Initial D.
4826000	4830000	Lots of Eurobeat, lots of fast driving, and a car from 1986.
4830000	4831000	All right.
4831000	4832000	There it is, your classic.
4832000	4835000	It has the Tofu delivery logo on the side.
4835000	4837000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
4837000	4839000	Initial D.
4839000	4841000	The whole dang series.
4841000	4843000	Although we're focusing, I guess, on the first game for this,
4843000	4845000	since we have to name something.
4845000	4846000	The first few,
4846000	4850000	which is why I was going for anything that was like 2007 and earlier.
4850000	4851000	Yeah.
4851000	4852000	All right.
4852000	4855000	It brings back memories of playing at the arcade because, you know, again,
4855000	4858000	it was kind of like, you know, your DDR fans had that, you know,
4858000	4861000	your racing game fans had, you know, Initial D,
4861000	4864000	and then your fighting game fans had like, you know, back at the time,
4864000	4868000	like Soul Calibur 2 or, you know, continued Capcom versus SNK 2.
4868000	4870000	You know, I know I'm dating this a little bit,
4870000	4872000	but that was back when DDR was, you know,
4872000	4874000	we were playing Fourth Mix and shit in the arcade.
4874000	4876000	So good times.
4876000	4878000	Yeah.
4878000	4882000	So I, you know, it's something I haven't done before,
4882000	4884000	and I can't believe I've never done that one before, so.
4884000	4886000	It's like as long as we've been doing this segment,
4886000	4888000	every week there's a new game where it's like,
4888000	4889000	I can't believe I never did this before.
4889000	4891000	But that's the joy of this segment.
4891000	4893000	Why do we still do it?
4893000	4894000	Seriously.
4894000	4895000	All right.
4895000	4896000	Well, I wish I could bear.
4896000	4899000	I'm sorry I was, you know, messed up.
4899000	4900000	No worries.
4900000	4901000	We'll get through the show.
4901000	4904000	So we'll see you next week, okay?
4904000	4905000	All right.
4905000	4906000	See you then.
4906000	4907000	All right.
4907000	4908000	Bye.
4908000	4909000	Bye.
4910000	4912000	To register participation for this week's episode
4912000	4914000	of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
4914000	4917000	use the passphrase DREAM.
4917000	4918000	All right.
4918000	4919000	DarkSakra here on the show,
4919000	4921000	making a guest appearance via the telephone.
4921000	4924000	She'll be back in the studio next week.
4924000	4926000	In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break.
4926000	4927000	We have plenty more show to come,
4927000	4929000	including some rapid fire news.
4929000	4931000	We're going to get into the mailbag,
4931000	4933000	which I don't know if we have emails or not.
4933000	4934000	I'll look in there and see.
4934000	4936000	And then we'll talk a little bit about,
4936000	4938000	oh, that debate that's going around Twitter this week
4938000	4941000	about Toad, and is that a hat or not?
4941000	4943000	And Nintendo made an answer,
4943000	4945000	and it sounds like everybody's rejecting the,
4945000	4946000	well, not everybody.
4946000	4948000	Half the people are rejecting the answer.
4948000	4951000	It's GIF and GIF all over again,
4951000	4953000	except now it's Toad's hat.
4953000	4954000	That's what it is.
4954000	4955000	The creator has said something,
4955000	4957000	and there are other people out there saying,
4957000	4959000	nope, the creator's wrong.
4959000	4961000	So we'll talk about that when we come back
4961000	4965000	after our break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4965000	4968000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4968000	4971000	Live tonight with the 718th episode of our show
4971000	4974000	already in progress for this February the 11th.
4974000	4976000	Just Loki and I here tonight.
4976000	4979000	DarkSakura was joining us a little bit via phone over there
4979000	4980000	for the Classic Game of the Week,
4980000	4983000	but she's unfortunately not here in studio tonight,
4983000	4984000	hopefully back next week.
4984000	4985000	But in the meantime,
4985000	4986000	we still have a lot of news to get to,
4986000	4988000	so let's do some rapid fire news.
4988000	4989000	Let's get to it.
4989000	4990000	Let's get to it.
4990000	4991000	Let's get to it.
4992000	4993000	All right.
4993000	4996000	So let's talk a little bit about Doom.
4999000	5000000	The new one or the old one?
5000000	5001000	The old one.
5001000	5002000	Cool.
5002000	5003000	The old one.
5003000	5004000	I like the new one, too.
5004000	5005000	Yes.
5005000	5007000	So there's been a lot of mods for Doom.
5007000	5011000	So this new mod is actually a mod that was created by
5011000	5014000	a user by the name of My Name Is,
5014000	5016000	and it's basically...
5016000	5017000	What?
5017000	5018000	Your name is what?
5018000	5020000	My name is My Name Is.
5020000	5021000	What?
5021000	5022000	Your name is what?
5022000	5023000	Funny.
5023000	5029000	Basically, it adds D.Va's mech from Overwatch into Doom,
5029000	5032000	and so the mod is called Overdoom,
5032000	5035000	and so they have this neat little animation
5035000	5036000	where you're getting into the mech.
5036000	5039000	You can even see the hairy arms of the Doom guy and stuff
5039000	5040000	as you're doing all that.
5040000	5044000	So it's quite funny, but looks pretty awesome.
5044000	5047000	So they have that, and then of course they also have
5047000	5049000	a bunch of other weapons as well
5049000	5051000	that they've introduced from the game,
5051000	5053000	so lots of cool things.
5053000	5055000	So if you want to check that out,
5055000	5057000	I'm not sure which you can grab.
5057000	5058000	Oh, okay, let's see here.
5058000	5063000	You can grab that at moddb slash mods slash Overdoom.
5063000	5064000	So go check that out.
5064000	5067000	And then this is kind of exciting.
5067000	5071000	So there was a LinkedIn profile for Bandai Namco
5071000	5078000	that suggests that they're working on a Switch FPS game.
5079000	5082000	And Ridge Racer 8.
5082000	5084000	Speaking of racing games,
5084000	5088000	since we were just talking about that before the break,
5088000	5091000	Ridge Racer is one that's been gone a long time.
5091000	5095000	Yeah, so apparently there was a LinkedIn profile
5095000	5098000	which was a developer that was at Bandai Namco
5098000	5100000	and made mention that it said unannounced IP,
5100000	5102000	first person shooter slash adventure,
5102000	5105000	exclusive to Nintendo Switch.
5105000	5107000	And the other one just says Ridge Racer 8.
5107000	5110000	Have you heard the rumors about what shooter that is?
5110000	5112000	I'm sorry, it doesn't say Ridge Racer 8 specifically.
5112000	5117000	It just says drift-based, high-speed car racing game exclusive
5117000	5120000	to Nintendo Switch is another one that they had.
5120000	5122000	So Ridge Racer 8 coming to the Switch?
5122000	5124000	Ooh, wouldn't that be something if the infamous Ridge Racer
5124000	5126000	were to come over to Switch as an exclusive?
5126000	5131000	Have you heard about what the exclusive FPS is?
5131000	5132000	No.
5132000	5135000	I mean, it's just a rumor, but Metroid Prime 4
5135000	5138000	that perhaps Bandai Namco is the ones that are making it,
5138000	5140000	so be interesting.
5140000	5141000	Yeah.
5141000	5144000	I mean, quality products, quality product,
5144000	5147000	I'll wait and see what they turn out, if that's true,
5147000	5149000	but that's what some people have been putting together.
5149000	5150000	I just want Ridge Racer,
5150000	5152000	and please don't make it exclusive to Switch
5152000	5154000	because we all want Ridge Racer.
5154000	5158000	But don't you want Ridge Racer to go?
5158000	5159000	Handheld?
5159000	5161000	I don't need it to go.
5161000	5165000	I just need it to be on a system that I own.
5165000	5166000	You're so selfish.
5166000	5167000	All right.
5167000	5168000	Oh, yes.
5168000	5169000	I'm so selfish.
5169000	5170000	You know what?
5170000	5171000	I got Ridge Racer to go.
5171000	5173000	It was for the Vita, and it sucked ass.
5173000	5175000	And I want a redo.
5175000	5176000	All right.
5176000	5178000	Well, moving on, the next story I had slotted
5178000	5181000	was the response from Billy Mitchell
5181000	5183000	to the Donkey Kong high score controversy,
5183000	5186000	except now the website that I was supposed to be using won't load.
5186000	5187000	That's great.
5187000	5189000	Gotta love live radio.
5189000	5190000	Let's see what I can remember off memory,
5190000	5191000	and hopefully I don't misappropriate this.
5191000	5192000	I didn't do it.
5192000	5194000	Well, I mean, it kind of boiled down to a lot of the stuff
5194000	5195000	we talked about last week,
5195000	5197000	is that one of the scores that he got was...
5197000	5198000	All right.
5198000	5199000	I'll help you out here.
5199000	5200000	Thank you.
5200000	5201000	Well, let me say the part I remember.
5201000	5205000	One of the scores he got was in front of a live crowd,
5205000	5207000	and that score didn't go anywhere.
5207000	5210000	It's just that these higher scores that he also did,
5210000	5212000	those did get discounted,
5212000	5214000	although Twin Galaxies has not really formulated
5214000	5218000	an official response to this whole debacle as of yet.
5218000	5220000	But the reason why I want to clarify that is because
5220000	5223000	last week we also were talking about the dragster guy
5223000	5225000	that had made up those times,
5225000	5229000	but had never really proven that he could even get in that ballpark.
5229000	5231000	And part of why I said the Billy Mitchell story was different
5231000	5233000	is I was like, well, Billy Mitchell can at least prove
5233000	5235000	he can hang in that league.
5235000	5237000	Like, he is good at Donkey Kong.
5237000	5240000	He's gotten a score very, very high before.
5240000	5242000	So, I mean, who knows?
5242000	5245000	It would be very weird to fake that.
5245000	5246000	Yeah, yeah.
5246000	5249000	But, I mean, did he know that those machines were running main?
5249000	5252000	People do weird shit with arcade cabinets all the time.
5252000	5254000	So that's all I was saying is that, you know,
5254000	5256000	give him a little bit of the benefit of the doubt.
5256000	5259000	He's not always the super villain that you saw in that movie.
5259000	5261000	So, you know.
5261000	5264000	But, you know, fair is fair, and if it was an emulator,
5264000	5265000	then it does need to be discarded.
5265000	5267000	It's not the same rules that everybody else is playing on.
5267000	5270000	But if I were Billy Mitchell, this would just motivate me
5270000	5273000	to get a higher record and do it again.
5273000	5275000	Yeah, so apparently this was from an internet talk show
5275000	5278000	called Eastside Dave, and he commented on the whole situation
5278000	5280000	saying that I've never played MAME.
5280000	5283000	I don't have MAME loaded in my home.
5283000	5286000	The film footage that he has that Jeremy,
5286000	5290000	Donkey Kong 4 moderator who analyzed the footage has,
5290000	5292000	shows MAME play.
5292000	5296000	Now, I contend that if he gets the original tape
5296000	5298000	or gets the original room shot,
5298000	5300000	he will see that what I say is true.
5300000	5302000	I'm not disputing what he says.
5302000	5304000	What I'm disputing is the fact that I want him
5304000	5307000	to have the original tape, and the fact of the matter
5307000	5310000	is that the original footage given to Twin Galaxies,
5310000	5313000	Twin Galaxies has it or should have it,
5313000	5316000	and that's if it's anywhere other than Twin Galaxies,
5316000	5318000	that's the real problem.
5318000	5322000	So, I remember the responding back saying,
5322000	5326000	if that were for them to fake that footage,
5326000	5328000	like say this was a whole conspiracy
5328000	5331000	and it wasn't really his footage that he submitted to them,
5331000	5335000	that they would have to mimic what he's done in the game.
5335000	5338000	It would just be like a really elaborate thing.
5338000	5340000	So, I don't know.
5340000	5343000	All this over fucking Donkey Kong, my God.
5343000	5346000	And then it basically said that also,
5346000	5350000	you know, with that, that apparently...
5351000	5352000	What was it?
5352000	5354000	There was another comment here.
5354000	5356000	It says here.
5356000	5360000	From Twin Galaxy owners, Pete Bovier,
5360000	5362000	was saying that, you know,
5362000	5365000	when I absolutely had a good fortune to get the...
5365000	5368000	I think he's talking about the whole thing with Todd Rogers.
5368000	5370000	So, when I had the absolutely good fortune
5370000	5372000	to get the score on Donkey Kong,
5372000	5374000	I turned around and one of the people shaking my hands
5374000	5378000	was one of the people patting me on the back
5378000	5380000	was Pete Bovier, the owner of Twin Galaxies.
5380000	5383000	So, basically saying, hey, when I got those scores,
5383000	5385000	it was a witness of the guy that runs Twin Galaxies.
5385000	5386000	Yeah, yeah.
5386000	5390000	So, this shit's never gonna end.
5390000	5392000	The advances in technology are gonna make people
5392000	5393000	really analyze those footages.
5393000	5394000	Right.
5394000	5399000	And, like, I would be more on the side of believing Billy Mitchell
5399000	5402000	versus definitely the other dude, you know,
5402000	5404000	that has all these impossible scores
5404000	5406000	that they have proved to be impossible to get.
5406000	5408000	Whereas, you know, Donkey Kong,
5408000	5411000	I mean, he's definitely got the skills to do it.
5411000	5414000	It's just a matter of, like, getting this whole thing straightened out.
5414000	5418000	And, like, I have to wonder, like, with, you know, VHS,
5418000	5423000	like, how, like, could any of that have been caused by the VHS?
5423000	5424000	Mm-hmm.
5424000	5425000	Like, if, I mean, obviously,
5425000	5427000	every screen readjaw's not gonna be, but, I mean,
5427000	5430000	VHS is exactly the most high-definition format out there.
5430000	5436000	I can only imagine that'd be pretty hard to get into the details on that.
5436000	5439000	I go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5439000	5440000	Rob D. in chat says,
5440000	5443000	I actually watched King of Kong again this week after hearing the story
5443000	5444000	and it bothers me so much.
5444000	5447000	You say that Billy Mitchell isn't always a supervillain how he appears,
5447000	5450000	but he's so much scummier with the knowledge that those runs were emulated.
5450000	5453000	I feel so much worse for Steve Weeby.
5453000	5456000	Well, I mean, I'm saying is that, you know,
5456000	5458000	I met him at Dragon Con this last year
5458000	5460000	and he's pretty much a normal freaking person.
5460000	5463000	You know, he's not, like, ego all the time,
5463000	5466000	but when the cameras are on, I think it's part of the persona.
5466000	5469000	And could he go that far to try to one-up the next guy?
5469000	5471000	I mean, in line, maybe.
5471000	5473000	I don't know him that well, you know.
5473000	5476000	People are capable of crazy shit,
5476000	5479000	but there's also that part of me that doesn't want to give him the benefit of the doubt
5479000	5482000	of, well, maybe he didn't know.
5482000	5485000	Because I think of the Man vs. Snake thing
5485000	5488000	where the board was overclocked or whatever.
5488000	5491000	Assuming that he did do this in MAME,
5491000	5494000	what would be the advantage of him doing this in MAME
5494000	5497000	versus, like, an actual arcade cabinet?
5497000	5500000	Like, what possible ways would he be cheating in that?
5500000	5503000	That you would probably be able to detect,
5503000	5505000	I would assume, like, you know, if it's scoring,
5505000	5509000	if he's, like, giving himself a higher score for everything that he picks up,
5509000	5511000	I mean, that would be pretty detectable.
5511000	5514000	Technically, since it's emulated, it's not the real thing,
5514000	5517000	but I get what you're saying. What advantage is the emulation giving him?
5517000	5520000	Right, because, like, that would be, like,
5520000	5522000	the only way I would think he would do that on purpose
5522000	5525000	would be to gain some sort of advantage.
5525000	5529000	I don't see why he would do that if he knew it would invalidate his run.
5529000	5532000	Like, I would think if he's gonna cheat, he's gonna cheat,
5532000	5537000	and it's gonna be to, you know, somehow game the system somehow,
5537000	5541000	and I just try to figure out what he would be doing in that regard.
5541000	5543000	Rob follows up with this, saying,
5543000	5545000	in the worst case scenario, he could replay levels over and over
5545000	5549000	and record his input as he goes, getting the best RNG.
5549000	5551000	That's from live.vognetwork.
5551000	5552000	Oh, so, like, a tool assisted run?
5552000	5554000	Tool assisted, yeah, I guess.
5554000	5556000	That comment from live.vognetwork.com.
5556000	5558000	Anyway, rapid fire news, right?
5559000	5562000	I'll be curious to see where this goes,
5562000	5565000	but, um, I think maybe thanks to the All Games days,
5565000	5568000	I'm so over Twin Galaxies drama.
5570000	5572000	Over it, I have had it officially.
5573000	5575000	Take the damn score away, see if I care.
5575000	5577000	None of you get the score.
5577000	5579000	We're not playing Donkey Kong anymore.
5579000	5581000	In fact, Donkey Kong doesn't exist anymore.
5581000	5582000	It's off the table.
5582000	5584000	The non-game. Donkey Kong is cooking software.
5584000	5586000	Cooking software.
5587000	5590000	All right, let's talk about Red Dead Redemption 2,
5590000	5592000	because that's a much newer game
5592000	5594000	that people will be setting records on,
5594000	5595000	you know, when it comes out.
5595000	5598000	Apparently, there's leaked notes,
5598000	5600000	good old leaks, that's why I'm putting this in rapid fire,
5600000	5604000	leaks and rumors, and what's possible and what's not.
5604000	5607000	The leak features a slew of online modes,
5607000	5609000	including Battle Royale,
5609000	5612000	a team-based shootout known as Fight and Revive,
5612000	5614000	and Money Grab, where you race against
5614000	5617000	to get bag stacks of gold, return to your base,
5617000	5619000	and get a fortune as fast as you can.
5619000	5621000	There's supposed to be a huge online world
5621000	5624000	where you can roam at will, and so on and so on.
5624000	5626000	It sounds like they're really trying to make this
5626000	5628000	a little more of a service type of game,
5628000	5629000	which I don't know how you feel about that.
5629000	5630000	It just sounds like Grand Theft Auto Online,
5630000	5635000	and I want to say that they have similar gameplay modes
5635000	5636000	already in Grand Theft Auto Online.
5636000	5638000	I know they have like a PUBG type game
5638000	5640000	in Grand Theft Auto Online they can play,
5640000	5643000	and I know one of the rumors is the first person mode,
5643000	5645000	which that's already in Grand Theft Auto 5,
5645000	5649000	so I wouldn't see why it wouldn't be in this.
5649000	5651000	It seems plausible.
5651000	5653000	Oh, my favorite word, thank you.
5653000	5655000	Well, I guess, I mean, it's not like,
5655000	5657000	oh my god, that's so shocking.
5657000	5659000	It's just, it's not.
5659000	5660000	It's not shocking at all.
5660000	5662000	It sounds like it's just stuff that they're reporting
5662000	5663000	from Grand Theft Auto 5,
5663000	5665000	and they already have it built in the engine,
5665000	5668000	so yeah, I can probably see that happening.
5668000	5669000	Yeah.
5669000	5671000	It is a little bit one of those
5671000	5673000	safe prediction type of things.
5673000	5678000	I think there may be a Final Fantasy XVI at some point.
5678000	5680000	I think it's very possible there will be
5680000	5681000	a Final Fantasy XVI at some point.
5681000	5683000	Square Enix is developing Final Fantasy XVI.
5683000	5684000	That's right.
5684000	5687000	Sources say.
5687000	5688000	All right, moving on.
5688000	5690000	What else do you have, Logie?
5690000	5696000	So after much teasing on the Steam forums,
5696000	5701000	apparently Puyo Puyo Tetris is coming to PC
5701000	5704000	on February 27th, so they were putting out
5704000	5706000	these ASCII art wallpaper things
5706000	5707000	that were in different forms,
5707000	5712000	like showing a Tetromino and one of the Puyo Puyos.
5712000	5715000	So now, after all that, it's been confirmed
5715000	5718000	that they're gonna be releasing it,
5718000	5720000	so you get to check them out.
5720000	5721000	Oh, hooray.
5721000	5723000	For those of you that have already bought the game twice
5723000	5725000	on Switch and PlayStation 4,
5725000	5726000	now you can buy it again.
5726000	5727000	Yay.
5727000	5729000	So, interesting.
5729000	5732000	And then along with that,
5732000	5738000	so EVO 2018 is adding Dragon Ball FighterZ to the lineup.
5738000	5740000	What's kind of ironic, though,
5740000	5742000	is what's not being added to that,
5742000	5744000	Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.
5744000	5747000	Yikes, because that's kind of a newer fighting game.
5747000	5751000	I don't think it was received as well.
5751000	5753000	Reception just wasn't there for that.
5753000	5756000	But Capcom has good news with Monster Hunter World,
5756000	5759000	but just the news over here isn't as good, that's all.
5759000	5761000	Yeah, I mean, at the very least,
5761000	5763000	Street Fighter V is gonna be there,
5763000	5766000	so that's represented, but other games,
5766000	5768000	you know, Tekken 7, Smash Brothers Melee,
5768000	5771000	Smash Brothers Wii U,
5771000	5775000	BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle,
5775000	5778000	and then, of course, you know,
5778000	5782000	they're saying that Injustice 2 is still on the roster,
5782000	5784000	so that'll be there.
5784000	5786000	And then, specifically, Street Fighter V,
5786000	5788000	the arcade edition will be there.
5788000	5790000	Well, that's, you know, the new one.
5790000	5791000	The new one.
5791000	5794000	And then Guilty Gear Xrd Revision 2.
5794000	5797000	So, it's disappointing,
5797000	5799000	but, I mean, I don't know.
5799000	5802000	I wasn't impressed by Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.
5802000	5805000	All right, well, let's travel around the world
5805000	5807000	and check out some releases that will hopefully impress you
5807000	5809000	a little more that are coming out around the world this week,
5809000	5811000	starting with the US.
5811000	5813000	All right, so let's take a look here.
5813000	5815000	I can't imagine there's too much coming out,
5815000	5819000	although we are in February, and that's an okay month.
5819000	5820000	So, let's see.
5820000	5823000	Coming out this week, we've got a few things.
5823000	5826000	Dynasty Warriors 9.
5826000	5830000	That's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5830000	5836000	Kingdom Come Deliverance on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5836000	5838000	Uh, okay.
5838000	5841000	Monster Energy Supercross, the official video game on PC,
5841000	5844000	the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5844000	5847000	Owlboy finally getting released on console.
5847000	5850000	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5850000	5854000	Radiant Historia Perfect Chronology on 3DS.
5854000	5860000	The longest five minutes on PC, Switch, and the Vita.
5860000	5862000	And, let's see.
5862000	5867000	Legend of Heroes Trails of the Cold Steel 2 on PC.
5868000	5871000	And then, this is interesting.
5871000	5873000	I'm curious to see what this actually looks like.
5873000	5875000	Remember, I think we talked about this a while back,
5875000	5877000	but a certain magical virtual lawn
5877000	5881000	is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and the Vita,
5881000	5883000	but that's not actually for PlayStation VR,
5883000	5885000	so that might be cool.
5885000	5887000	Fe, or Fe.
5887000	5888000	I remember.
5888000	5893000	That's on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5893000	5896000	Secret of Mana on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5897000	5899000	Yeah, that's the big release this week.
5899000	5901000	Now, hold on.
5901000	5903000	Before you speak too soon there.
5903000	5904000	The big release.
5904000	5906000	That's going to be hard to top the Secret of Mana remake.
5906000	5907000	I'm really looking forward to that.
5907000	5911000	How about I'll give you Bayonetta 1 and 2 on the Switch.
5911000	5912000	Oh, fuck, that's this week?
5912000	5914000	That's this week.
5914000	5916000	Why did I think that was like March?
5916000	5918000	Oh, shit.
5918000	5919000	You're right.
5919000	5921000	That is the big release this week.
5921000	5923000	Wow, and you tried to write this week off
5923000	5924000	at the beginning.
5924000	5925000	It's not a big deal.
5925000	5927000	Those are two big fucking deal games.
5927000	5930000	Those might be the things that finally tear me away
5930000	5933000	from fucking Final Fantasy XIV for a little while.
5933000	5934000	All right.
5934000	5935000	Great.
5935000	5937000	And then there's a game called Long Gone Days
5937000	5939000	on PC, Mac, and Linux coming out one week from today.
5939000	5940000	That's it.
5940000	5942000	All right, traveling over to Japan.
5942000	5944000	The releases this week in Japan include
5944000	5947000	on the PlayStation 4, Cyber Troopers Virtual On
5947000	5949000	cross Tora Majutsu no Index.
5949000	5950000	It's that same.
5950000	5951000	Yep.
5951000	5953000	The Secret of Mana remake.
5953000	5956000	Of course, you would notice Seiken Detsetsu 2 over there.
5956000	5958000	That is also released on the 15th this week.
5958000	5962000	There's also a game called Shinobi Koi Utsutsu
5962000	5965000	Banka Aya Imakai in a regular and limited edition.
5965000	5967000	That should not be confused just because it has the word
5967000	5969000	Shinobi in it with Sega's big series.
5969000	5972000	This is a different game that actually looks like it's more
5972000	5975000	like it based on an anime based on the various faces
5975000	5976000	that are there.
5976000	5978000	That is on the PlayStation 4.
5978000	5981000	On the PlayStation Vita this week, Idol-ish.
5981000	5982000	It's not Idol.
5982000	5983000	It's just Idol-ish.
5983000	5988000	Idol-ish 712 Fantasia is out as well as that same Virtual On
5988000	5991000	and the Secret of Mana remake on the Vita, don't forget.
5991000	5995000	Like a rare Vita sighting.
5995000	5999000	And then on the Nintendo Switch this week over in Japan,
5999000	6002000	actually nothing sadly.
6002000	6005000	I'm not showing anything in Japan this week except that
6005000	6009000	same Bayonetta 1 and 2 remake is on February 17th.
6009000	6011000	So I guess that is the day before our next show.
6011000	6014000	So the Bayonetta remake is on the Switch in Japan as well.
6014000	6019000	And the Nintendo 3DS, nothing this week.
6019000	6020000	Do you have Europe up, Loki?
6020000	6021000	You wanna do that?
6021000	6022000	Sure.
6022000	6023000	So let's see.
6023000	6026000	This week we've got Kingdom Come Deliverance on PlayStation 4,
6026000	6028000	Xbox One, and PC.
6028000	6033000	South Park, The Stick of Truth on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6033000	6037000	The Secret of Mana on PlayStation 4, Vita, and PC.
6037000	6039000	That's all they have listed.
6039000	6042000	All right, let's get to the mailbag.
6048000	6049000	Every week you guys email us.
6049000	6051000	Participate at Orangelaungerator.com
6051000	6053000	if you wanna email us for a future week.
6053000	6056000	And we will read your emails live on air.
6056000	6057000	So let's get to it.
6057000	6059000	We have a couple of emails tonight.
6059000	6061000	I know I said before the break I wasn't sure if we had any
6061000	6063000	and I forgot there were a couple that came in.
6063000	6065000	There was one earlier in the week and then one yesterday.
6065000	6068000	So we have a couple emails to get through tonight.
6068000	6072000	So let's start off with this first email from our pal YYR
6072000	6074000	who emails us saying,
6074000	6077000	Hello, LR. I'm just gonna do what I often do.
6077000	6079000	Comment on last week's episode.
6079000	6081000	Regarding the Rock Band Network songs being delisted,
6081000	6083000	I can tell you the most likely cause of that
6083000	6085000	and has nothing to do with licensing.
6085000	6089000	Guess what system powered the submission and sales of Rock Band Network songs?
6089000	6091000	Xbox Live Indie Games.
6091000	6094000	Yep, Xbox Live Indie Games is the backbone of Rock Band Network
6094000	6096000	and I'm surprised they didn't both go down together.
6096000	6098000	Or perhaps they will be doing just that
6098000	6102000	because while all Xbox Live Indie Games were officially delisted in October,
6102000	6104000	the system's still up
6104000	6107000	and three of the games were left on sale up until just recently.
6107000	6110000	My belief is they're finally bringing that system down this month.
6110000	6111000	That could be.
6111000	6112000	Probably.
6112000	6113000	I think you're onto something there.
6113000	6117000	It's surprising that they didn't just rebuild that system to support it.
6117000	6119000	No. It is what it is.
6119000	6121000	So if you're wondering why those songs are disappearing,
6121000	6123000	yep, that's the reason.
6123000	6125000	And as far as custom music in-game goes,
6125000	6126000	that was something we talked about last week,
6126000	6128000	personally, I barely ever do that.
6128000	6131000	But I admit that I played both Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge
6131000	6133000	on the original Xbox with a custom soundtrack.
6133000	6136000	And not just for any soundtrack, but the best one.
6136000	6139000	The soundtrack from Wangen Midnight Maximum Tune
6139000	6141000	composed by the one and only Yuzo Koshiro.
6141000	6143000	Dude, I've done the same thing in racing games.
6143000	6144000	I have done the same thing.
6144000	6145000	You've done the Wangen soundtrack.
6145000	6146000	Gives you the edge.
6146000	6147000	Fuck yeah. Makes me...
6147000	6149000	Here's the dangerous thing.
6149000	6152000	I've listened to that soundtrack in my car driving to LA
6152000	6153000	and I shit you not.
6153000	6154000	I shit you not.
6154000	6156000	That's like when you're going down the cow towns on iFET,
6156000	6158000	which I know not everybody knows the west coast,
6158000	6164000	but between Sacramento and LA on i5, there ain't shit.
6164000	6166000	It's a lot of cow towns and stuff.
6166000	6170000	I caught myself going 95 miles an hour on the freeway to LA
6170000	6173000	because I was listening to the Wangen Midnight Maximum Tune.
6173000	6175000	That's one thing I liked about Ridge Racer
6175000	6176000	was the music in the game.
6176000	6177000	Yes.
6177000	6179000	So anyhow, let's see.
6179000	6181000	And by the way, if you happen to go to round one,
6181000	6183000	play the fifth version of that game.
6183000	6185000	He's still doing the music and it's fantastic.
6185000	6187000	I didn't know he was still doing the music.
6187000	6189000	That's great. I've got to find those soundtracks then.
6189000	6190000	All right.
6190000	6194000	I'll close with a response to your response to my previous email
6194000	6196000	that if you acquire a game and put it in your house,
6196000	6198000	it ought to not be ripped away from you.
6198000	6200000	But the unfortunate fact is that we don't actually own
6200000	6203000	any of these network-based games and we never have.
6203000	6204000	We never will.
6204000	6207000	Whether it's Miitomo or World of Warcraft or Overwatch
6207000	6209000	or any other network-based game on any platform,
6209000	6212000	we simply can't approach it with the mentality of I own this
6212000	6214000	because no, you don't and you still won't
6214000	6216000	when the service is eventually terminated
6216000	6218000	even if you spent a significant amount of money on it.
6218000	6219000	Am I wrong?
6219000	6222000	Not necessarily, but didn't we have that whole thing
6222000	6225000	with the Congress, like somebody was trying to petition
6225000	6226000	with copyright.
6226000	6228000	I think it was one of these gaming archive sites
6228000	6230000	that they should be able to,
6230000	6233000	if the official companies are not going to run the servers,
6233000	6236000	then somebody else, hackers or whoever figured out
6236000	6238000	how to reverse engineer a server,
6238000	6240000	should be able to run their own servers for games
6240000	6242000	so that these types of games can be preserved.
6242000	6243000	Because you're right.
6243000	6245000	Everybody's fucking talking about Overwatch now
6245000	6248000	and it's at full-time fever with Overwatch League
6248000	6252000	and all that stuff, but it'll go away someday.
6252000	6255000	But how are people a hundred years from now
6255000	6257000	going to be able to play Overwatch?
6257000	6260000	I can go back and watch Gone with the Wind,
6260000	6262000	which was made 80-plus years ago.
6262000	6264000	Eighty years from now, how are they going to play Overwatch
6264000	6266000	if the servers are down?
6266000	6268000	So, it'll be interesting.
6268000	6272000	Anyway, and yes, if you have a copy of Super Multitasking,
6272000	6274000	you can stream it now.
6274000	6276000	Well, I plan to after tonight's show, actually,
6276000	6279000	because I haven't streamed in an awfully long time
6279000	6281000	because I've been focusing on the podcasts
6281000	6282000	and just other stuff,
6282000	6284000	but I will be doing Super Multitasking tonight
6284000	6286000	because I've been waiting for this one.
6286000	6288000	And if you'd like to stream it before release
6288000	6290000	and you have an audience of any size,
6290000	6293000	please reach out to me at yyr at yyrgames.com
6293000	6294000	and I'll send you a copy right away.
6294000	6296000	Now, if only I could find some time to sleep.
6296000	6298000	Have a great week, Aaron, yyr.
6298000	6301000	Best of luck on the release of the game, by the way.
6301000	6303000	So, it's coming out, I think.
6303000	6305000	In fact, I know it was the February 23rd
6305000	6306000	is when the game's coming out,
6306000	6308000	so check that out on Steam.
6308000	6312000	Or if you have an audience on Twitch of any size,
6312000	6314000	yyr is a nice guy. He'll help you out.
6314000	6316000	Just send him an email if you're interested at all.
6316000	6319000	All right, one more email. Let's get to it.
6319000	6322000	This email from Midnight Dream,
6322000	6324000	who says, dear Orange Ons Radio,
6324000	6326000	firstly, thank you for your podcast.
6326000	6330000	I've been enjoying it off and on since 2005.
6330000	6332000	Holy shit. Well, thank you.
6332000	6333000	Thank you. That means a lot.
6333000	6336000	You're in the 10-year club. You get a gold star.
6336000	6339000	And I even called in once in 2015.
6339000	6340000	You probably don't remember,
6340000	6342000	but I'd been playing Sega Master System games
6342000	6344000	and told you that I started listening to you guys
6344000	6346000	and I was looking for podcasts to listen to
6346000	6350000	while I was getting wired up to participate in a sleep study.
6350000	6353000	I have to be honest, since I was about three years ago,
6353000	6355000	I don't remember that specific call.
6355000	6357000	I don't remember anything that happened last week or last month,
6357000	6358000	so don't feel bad.
6358000	6360000	Yeah, don't feel bad.
6360000	6363000	I have a hard time remembering what happened in my own life yesterday.
6363000	6367000	Two aspects of your podcast that I enjoy in particular
6367000	6369000	is the friendship of you three, the hosts.
6369000	6371000	Yeah, Logie's okay.
6371000	6372000	I am.
6372000	6374000	This is a good way for us to hang out every week.
6374000	6376000	And the discussion of all games,
6376000	6379000	from retro to PC to mobile to modern console.
6379000	6383000	In fact, I think the only genre of games you guys rarely discuss
6383000	6385000	is text-based games,
6385000	6387000	though you did do Zork as Classic Game of the Week
6387000	6391000	and have discussed text-based roadlikes here and there.
6391000	6393000	I am only aware of this fact
6393000	6395000	because I am actually the nerd of nerds
6395000	6399000	and still enjoy interactive fiction and text-based games.
6399000	6402000	Well, you know, there's that witty part of me that wants to say,
6402000	6405000	or not so thinks he's witty part of me that wants to say
6405000	6407000	they're still making text-based games,
6407000	6410000	but they really are because Twine has made it so easy
6410000	6412000	to make those types of games
6412000	6414000	and even with some limited interactions with it.
6414000	6417000	And I know, correct me if I'm wrong,
6417000	6420000	but wasn't Depression Quest,
6420000	6424000	remember the whole, you know, that was the Zoe Quinn game
6424000	6427000	and then that led to, you know, a Kotaku article, dot dot dot,
6427000	6428000	that's all I'll say,
6428000	6430000	but Depression Quest was a text-based game, right?
6430000	6431000	I believe so.
6431000	6432000	Yeah, and that was, you know,
6432000	6434000	obviously it was hugely impactful in gaming culture.
6434000	6436000	We'll leave it at that.
6436000	6437000	So, you know, text-based games,
6437000	6439000	oh, they definitely still have a place, you know.
6439000	6442000	Books still have a place against movies,
6442000	6443000	so I think there's some people
6443000	6445000	that definitely like those text-based games.
6445000	6448000	Why did anyone ever give a shit about such like an indie,
6448000	6450000	whatever, okay, we're not going to go on that topic,
6450000	6451000	but like I just like,
6451000	6454000	why make a big deal out of something like that?
6454000	6456000	Yeah, yeah, let it go.
6456000	6457000	No, I understand.
6457000	6459000	It's just pondering.
6459000	6462000	Some topics, some topics aren't worth revisiting.
6462000	6465000	One versus 100, worth revisiting every single week.
6465000	6468000	Classic game room, worth revisiting every week.
6468000	6470000	That, let's not revisit it.
6470000	6472000	There you go, Nintendo.
6472000	6474000	You want a good idea to get people interested
6474000	6475000	in virtual console games?
6475000	6478000	Just have them be able to build like your own virtual arcade
6478000	6482000	with your classic NES, Super NES games.
6482000	6485000	And to be clear, I'm not dogging on Depression Quest,
6485000	6487000	which is an important game and you should check it out
6487000	6489000	because it is, you know,
6489000	6492000	it's something I don't think we'd really seen in gaming before.
6492000	6494000	One more brief aside,
6494000	6497000	I'm glad you guys got rid of the F.U. of the week not long ago.
6497000	6499000	Personally, while I realize this is your show
6499000	6501000	and it's an outlet in many ways,
6501000	6503000	I tune into your show for the aforementioned camaraderie,
6503000	6505000	inclusiveness, and positivity,
6505000	6508000	and there is enough negativity that is bound to pop up naturally
6508000	6511000	without having to dedicate a pre-scheduled block of the show
6511000	6513000	to it every week.
6513000	6517000	I thank you for seeing the exact reasons
6517000	6520000	why I really pushed to have it sunsetted.
6520000	6523000	I know, I wish DarkSakura was here so she could say her piece
6523000	6526000	because I know the F.U.s were, you know, a lot her as well.
6526000	6528000	But I know she agrees and she's on the same page
6528000	6530000	and I think, ironically enough,
6530000	6533000	that whole topic we just brought up was around the same time
6533000	6535000	when we had that intense negativity in gaming,
6535000	6539000	was around the same time we decided to sunset the F.U. of the week
6539000	6541000	for many of those reasons.
6541000	6543000	But we always reserve the right to bring it back
6543000	6545000	because sometimes there's just going to be things we have to,
6545000	6547000	you're right, it is an outlet
6547000	6550000	and sometimes we just have to let it go.
6550000	6553000	All right, continuing with the email.
6553000	6557000	So, after awakening from the three-year metaphorical sleep study
6557000	6559000	since my call in 2015,
6559000	6563000	I've decided to write in to ask y'all's opinions on social media.
6563000	6567000	I personally have cut social media out of my life for many months now.
6567000	6570000	That means no Facebook, Twitter, YouTube comments or anything like that.
6570000	6573000	I am subscribed to some Discord servers and subreddits
6573000	6575000	that are well-moderated,
6575000	6578000	mostly related to my chosen trade and its related fields,
6578000	6581000	and built on communities based on mutual respect.
6581000	6584000	Even these, however, I don't check on a daily basis.
6584000	6588000	I find myself less distracted and more peaceful as a result of these changes,
6588000	6590000	and personally I find the aforementioned services
6590000	6593000	to be a net negative influence for most people in most cases.
6593000	6597000	My girlfriend, after doing some reading and noticing my example,
6597000	6600000	has also dropped social media.
6600000	6603000	She held onto Instagram for a while, but eventually she gave that up too.
6603000	6606000	We still look up cute animal photos and videos from time to time though,
6606000	6608000	so tell Mr. Smoosh not to worry.
6608000	6610000	I just posted a new pic of them before the show too.
6610000	6614000	Mr. Smoosh, spelled M-I-S-T-E-R, Smoosh on Instagram.
6614000	6616000	Cheap plug.
6616000	6618000	I love that Rob has decided to focus on podcasts
6618000	6622000	because I find podcasts to be my favorite way to consume information through the Internet.
6622000	6624000	They are generally long form,
6624000	6628000	which gives you the chance to flesh out an idea and go deep on a topic,
6628000	6630000	and you get to hear people speak for themselves,
6630000	6634000	which humanizes the speaker and usually makes nuances in their ideas clearer.
6634000	6637000	Thank you, because you're saying it, yes,
6637000	6640000	but I'm going to cut that out and put it on the back of the box, exactly.
6640000	6645000	Also, I'm under the impression that podcasters are generally more reflective,
6645000	6651000	thoughtful, and respectful than video jockeys or clickbait article writers and twitterers,
6651000	6653000	though when it comes to why exactly this is,
6653000	6656000	or even whether this is a fair assessment, I can't say for sure.
6656000	6659000	My intuition is that it may be due to the short attention span
6659000	6662000	plus ad-driven nature of most of the Internet.
6662000	6665000	Shock value might get you to stop and listen to a host
6665000	6668000	when you are flipping through the channels while you're stuck in traffic, old time radio,
6668000	6671000	or browsing links online, modern Internet,
6671000	6673000	but it is not likely to get you to download a podcast
6673000	6678000	and sit and listen to it for 30 minutes, an hour, or even gasp three hours.
6678000	6681000	And podcasting doesn't yet attract fly-by-night trolls
6681000	6683000	willing to do or say anything for views or listens.
6683000	6687000	I find that people that stick with podcasting generally value community,
6687000	6689000	discussion, and in some cases,
6689000	6692000	evangelizing about whatever it is they care about
6692000	6696000	much more than they do view counts and ad revenue at any cost.
6698000	6701000	I think it's harder for, this is not in the email, this is my thought,
6701000	6705000	I think it's harder for the negativity in podcasts to kind of float to the surface
6705000	6707000	because there are so many podcasts out there
6707000	6711000	and because a lot of the algorithms are focused on what is being downloaded
6711000	6712000	and what is highly rated.
6712000	6715000	It can be very difficult for all sorts of new shows to kind of rise up,
6715000	6718000	but also people that want to get into this for the wrong reason
6718000	6720000	have a really hard time kind of rising up.
6720000	6723000	In the video-based world, in the YouTube-based world,
6723000	6728000	it's very easy to clip a video and show 30 seconds of something,
6728000	6731000	whereas with a podcast, that doesn't really happen.
6731000	6734000	I'm fully aware of things like Anchor
6734000	6737000	and people that will take clips of podcasts and put them on YouTube,
6737000	6740000	but they don't really seem to catch that same fire
6740000	6742000	that I think you're kind of referencing here
6742000	6747000	when it comes to little bits, short attention span moments.
6748000	6751000	Well, there's a podcast that I sometimes listen to,
6751000	6756000	the Totally Unnecessary Podcast with Pat the NES Punk.
6756000	6759000	So what they do for their podcast is they just have,
6759000	6762000	they cut out basically each story that they're talking about or each topic,
6762000	6766000	and they split it down to basically like a 10-minute video,
6766000	6771000	and they just like for a whole week they'll have like 20 videos that go up.
6771000	6775000	So that's one way to do it so that you have that kind of short thing.
6775000	6777000	Plus, you're uploading lots of videos,
6777000	6780000	so that also helps with the algorithms and whatnot.
6780000	6781000	Interesting.
6781000	6783000	So anyways, so what are your thoughts,
6783000	6785000	experiences with different forms of social media?
6785000	6788000	Has the internet really made progress since 2005,
6788000	6791000	when podcasts were the new hot tech and blogs were dominant?
6791000	6794000	Or have we devolved into a culture of ADD,
6794000	6796000	an outrage fueled by ad revenue
6796000	6798000	and technological manipulation of our monkey brains?
6798000	6801000	Thanks again for the show, and until next time,
6801000	6804000	may your lounges be orange and your soccer has dark.
6804000	6806000	That's from Midnight Dream.
6806000	6808000	Great email, Midnight Dream. Thank you so much.
6808000	6809000	Thoughts on social media?
6809000	6811000	You know, I got to be honest.
6811000	6815000	I have come so close time and time again to just getting rid of Facebook.
6815000	6819000	It's, it's, Facebook sucks for a lot of things.
6819000	6821000	It's very unusable right now.
6821000	6825000	It's the clickbait culture and the headlines
6825000	6828000	and the outrage that that leads to
6828000	6833000	and the fact that people will say things behind a computer screen
6833000	6835000	that they won't say to somebody's face in real life.
6835000	6839000	A lot of that shit is getting to a point where it's, it's just becoming,
6839000	6841000	I think a lot of people are doing what you're doing
6841000	6843000	and kind of reflecting like, why do I waste my time on this?
6843000	6845000	And now that's even like doubled by,
6845000	6849000	we have these recent stories about people in the tech industry
6849000	6851000	that are kind of regretful they committed,
6851000	6853000	or that they created this stuff.
6853000	6855000	You know, like what was that thing we just talked about last week
6855000	6857000	that, you know, Tim Cook from Apple,
6857000	6859000	like doesn't let his nephew use social media.
6859000	6862000	And then there's also the part that, you know,
6862000	6864000	and I don't mean to get too political here,
6864000	6869000	but the reality is Russia impacted our election
6869000	6871000	by using social media engineering.
6871000	6876000	Now, I'm not going to go so far as to say how much of an impact did it have
6876000	6878000	and did it tip the election the entire way.
6878000	6880000	Y'all can draw your own conclusions on that.
6880000	6882000	I'm not going to open that can of worms.
6882000	6884000	But the fact is, because the reports are out there
6884000	6887000	and Facebook will tell you if you go click on,
6887000	6891000	these pages were created by Russian entities
6891000	6895000	to try to distract what was going on basically in American politics.
6895000	6896000	That is fact that it happened.
6896000	6898000	And it's still happening on Twitter,
6898000	6901000	and it's probably still happening to some extent on Facebook as well.
6901000	6903000	And all that noise, all that garbage,
6903000	6905000	kind of makes you go like,
6905000	6908000	well, why am I still continuing to use these websites?
6908000	6911000	But here's reality.
6911000	6912000	If I didn't use Facebook,
6912000	6915000	I probably wouldn't know when certain people got pregnant.
6915000	6917000	I wouldn't know when certain people got married.
6917000	6921000	I wouldn't know so and so went on a trip lately.
6921000	6923000	I would be so far behind on the news.
6923000	6926000	And I do have a friend that left Facebook behind some time ago,
6926000	6930000	and I'm finding all the time I'm messaging her something about duh-duh-duh,
6930000	6933000	and I have to stop for a minute and go, shit, she never saw the post on this.
6933000	6936000	She has no idea that I did this new thing
6936000	6939000	or I hosted this other show last weekend or something.
6939000	6942000	She has no idea about any of that because she's not on Facebook.
6942000	6945000	So it's one of those things where kind of like we all have to make a decision
6945000	6947000	to leave Facebook or there's going to be some of us
6947000	6950000	that are putting their news updates on there and others that aren't.
6950000	6953000	And then another big reason that I stay on Facebook is Messenger
6953000	6956000	because the reality is that's just replaced email,
6956000	6959000	and there's friends that I talk to every single day on Messenger,
6959000	6962000	and if I don't have Messenger, I wouldn't be able to talk to them.
6962000	6965000	But my understanding is you can deactivate Facebook but still keep Messenger.
6965000	6969000	But I still kind of feel like, well, you're supporting Facebook by using Messenger,
6969000	6971000	so I don't know.
6971000	6973000	One other thing I want to get out with this,
6973000	6976000	I realize it's not like completely gaming related, but I think it is.
6976000	6978000	A lot of this stuff is very adjacent.
6978000	6983000	I do use Twitter a lot, and I really enjoy Twitter,
6983000	6986000	and I've met a ton of people on Twitter,
6986000	6989000	some of which I consider really close friends
6989000	6993000	or that I have relationships that have gotten closer because of Twitter.
6993000	6997000	It's very similar to LiveJournal.
6997000	7000000	I met my husband on LiveJournal many, many years ago,
7000000	7004000	which was the social media that we were using before Myspace
7004000	7007000	and Facebook and all that stuff took off.
7007000	7012000	This community that formed OLR got stronger because of LiveJournal,
7012000	7015000	because of social media and all of that.
7015000	7018000	So I realize there's a lot of bullshit on Twitter.
7018000	7021000	There's a lot, a lot of bullshit on Twitter.
7021000	7026000	But I found that with every block I make, with every mute that I do,
7026000	7029000	it gets a little easier to dodge that noise.
7029000	7033000	I blocked Notch, I don't know how long ago,
7033000	7037000	and it's great because when people get mad about whatever he posts,
7037000	7040000	I don't see it, because I blocked him.
7040000	7042000	He's not going to give a shit, he has no idea who I am.
7042000	7044000	On top of that, I follow Notch,
7044000	7049000	but even the way Twitter is with their feed and stuff,
7049000	7051000	even when he does post something that people are getting mad about,
7051000	7056000	I can't see it because it sorts my feed all fucking weird.
7056000	7059000	Oh, here's the new thing I get is now on my feed
7059000	7063000	because it shows a heck of a lot of what other people liked.
7063000	7069000	I get so much softcore gay porn.
7069000	7072000	Yes, thank you Captain Spike and all the other people.
7072000	7077000	Yes, I've had to, I think I had to unfollow them or something
7077000	7081000	because I'm all, okay, it's cool to like your own things,
7081000	7085000	but Twitter, there was no way for me to block people's likes.
7085000	7087000	I can't block people's likes, and if you're liking
7087000	7091000	scantily clad photos, be it of women or men,
7091000	7095000	I can't block that. I can't view Twitter at my work
7095000	7100000	because, oh hey, here comes this guy posed all seductively.
7100000	7103000	It's like, okay, that's going to be awkward.
7103000	7105000	Yeah, no, I totally get it.
7105000	7108000	I think you can get around that by using lists
7108000	7111000	because I don't think that happens on lists,
7111000	7114000	but then if you've muted a person's retweets,
7114000	7117000	it doesn't matter when you go to the list.
7117000	7120000	So Twitter has some bullshit that needs to really be fixed.
7120000	7124000	And then, you know, there are still a lot of problems on Twitter
7124000	7127000	that they have had a real hard time policing certain parts of it,
7127000	7129000	but the good news is it's very easy on Twitter,
7129000	7132000	at least in my experience, to cut that out.
7132000	7134000	It's just that you feel a little dirty being on the website
7134000	7136000	where all that shit is happening,
7136000	7140000	but it is kind of easy to block out that noise, if that makes sense.
7140000	7143000	And there are a lot of people on Twitter I haven't befriended,
7143000	7146000	be friended, and have some good friends with them.
7146000	7148000	Yeah, and all I did, I think, for the pictures
7148000	7150000	is I just started blocking those people,
7150000	7152000	not the people retweeting that stuff,
7152000	7154000	but the actual people whose pictures they were.
7154000	7157000	And that's why I don't see Notch's shit,
7157000	7163000	or the people, all the crazy right-wing guy
7163000	7165000	when he was still on Twitter before they kicked him off.
7165000	7168000	Like, I was able to dodge that shit
7168000	7171000	because I just blocked them all, or muted them.
7171000	7175000	Yeah, or just don't follow anybody that has that kind of stuff.
7175000	7178000	It's hard sometimes, you know.
7178000	7182000	So anyway, let's see, I haven't been looking at chat in a minute.
7182000	7186000	Over at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says,
7186000	7188000	I never like anything on Twitter anymore.
7188000	7190000	I don't want to spam people's feeds.
7190000	7194000	I only like tweets that are positive and to me or about me.
7194000	7197000	I can't help myself. If I see a fucking funny Drag Race reference,
7197000	7199000	I'm gonna like it.
7199000	7201000	Well, it doesn't make sure...
7201000	7207000	Sorry, I do not like the thirst pics of some of the people that I follow
7207000	7211000	because I don't want my followers to have to confront that in their own feeds.
7211000	7217000	So I hope my friends understand that it's not that I don't like your pictures.
7217000	7219000	I just don't want my followers to be subjected to it,
7219000	7220000	and I know how Twitter works.
7220000	7222000	Well, that's why they have retweet.
7222000	7225000	If I want my followers to see a certain thing that someone else has posted,
7225000	7227000	then I can retweet it.
7227000	7232000	Why do I need to have, like, if I like something, it retweets it.
7232000	7233000	That doesn't make any sense.
7233000	7235000	Yeah, I'm totally with you there.
7235000	7237000	That's something that Twitter needs to fix.
7237000	7240000	Anyway, here's the other thing, though, is that, you know,
7240000	7242000	just like there was LiveJournal before,
7242000	7246000	even if Facebook and even if, you know, Twitter fade away,
7246000	7248000	there's gonna be something else.
7248000	7250000	There's always Ello.
7250000	7253000	Stop it.
7253000	7257000	All right, yeah, the Rob D hits the nail on the head.
7257000	7260000	All it would take is a group of celebrities and athletes
7260000	7262000	to promote something else, I feel.
7262000	7263000	Exactly right.
7263000	7266000	Twitter took off when the president started using it, you know,
7266000	7268000	when celebrities were using it.
7268000	7271000	And the same thing happened with Myspace, really.
7271000	7274000	Now all the adults are using it. It's not cool anymore.
7274000	7277000	All right, let's move on.
7277000	7279000	Let's move on. That was a great email.
7279000	7281000	But, yeah, I mean, those are my thoughts,
7281000	7284000	is that there are still good things on social media,
7284000	7287000	but I totally understand where, like, sometimes it's just too much.
7287000	7291000	Like, the way, like, you will see people that know each other
7291000	7293000	go at each other's throats on Facebook.
7293000	7295000	It's like, I want no part of this
7295000	7297000	because you're both being ridiculous right now.
7297000	7300000	Like, you both wouldn't say that to each other's faces.
7300000	7301000	This is dumb.
7301000	7305000	And I've seen some really ugly stuff go on on Facebook
7305000	7308000	and some of these social media campaigns and lies.
7308000	7311000	They get spread because somebody's feelings get hurt
7311000	7312000	and all this shit.
7312000	7315000	And it's like, I don't want any part of it.
7315000	7319000	But at the same time, it's a really great way for me to promote,
7319000	7321000	hey, I'm going to be hosting this.
7321000	7324000	Like, I did a screening of The Room in Sacramento in Midtown last night.
7324000	7327000	And, like, I wouldn't have really been able to tell people that any easy way.
7327000	7329000	And it's something I'm very proud of that, you know,
7329000	7332000	I got asked to host an event that's something different that, you know,
7332000	7335000	I'm getting more of these types of live hosting gigs.
7335000	7336000	And I'm very proud of that.
7336000	7339000	And I do want people to know so they can come see me if they want.
7339000	7342000	So, anyway, Facebook makes that easy.
7342000	7345000	All right, let's move on.
7345000	7346000	We do have some more news.
7346000	7349000	And then we'll get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio,
7349000	7352000	all one word, on Skype.
7352000	7353000	But first, Loki.
7353000	7359000	All right, so there has been a secret ending for Metal Gear Solid 5
7359000	7361000	that people have found out about a while back.
7361000	7365000	But it's never actually triggered until recently.
7365000	7366000	And that's right.
7366000	7371000	What is involved to get the secret ending is basically all the players
7371000	7376000	that have to dismantle all of their nuclear weapons.
7376000	7379000	So, basically, everybody has to disarm the nukes,
7379000	7382000	and there's world peace, and yay.
7382000	7387000	So the nuclear disarmament ending, I guess,
7387000	7391000	would have triggered and shows basically this cut scene.
7391000	7395000	Well, that happened recently on February 2nd.
7395000	7397000	However, it was a glitch.
7397000	7398000	Whoops.
7398000	7400000	It wasn't.
7400000	7403000	They didn't actually disarm all the nukes.
7403000	7404000	No.
7404000	7406000	So, apparently, Konami came out and said, you know,
7406000	7410000	the nuclear disarmament event was triggered in the Steam version
7410000	7412000	of Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain on February 2nd,
7412000	7416000	approximately 12 o'clock GMT,
7416000	7419000	we're still investigating, but we can confirm that the event was triggered
7419000	7423000	while the nuke count hadn't reached zero.
7423000	7430000	The thought is that hackers have been manipulating the nuke count in the game,
7430000	7434000	and they got it so high that it wrapped back around to negative numbers,
7434000	7437000	and that caused it to trigger.
7437000	7438000	Huh.
7438000	7440000	That game's been out a long time,
7440000	7443000	so it's kind of funny that people are just now finding it.
7443000	7444000	Yeah.
7444000	7449000	And so that was basically the thing that happened.
7449000	7453000	And so everyone thought, oh, hey, is this going to trigger a new chapter in the game?
7453000	7454000	Nope.
7454000	7456000	Just the cut scene, sadly.
7456000	7457000	Nothing else.
7457000	7460000	And, well, that's it.
7460000	7465000	I guess that's the end of that bookend for Metal Gear Solid 5.
7465000	7469000	For your favorite series, it's probably never coming back,
7469000	7472000	because remember, Kojima, no affiliation with Konami anymore.
7472000	7474000	Metal Gear Solid survivor.
7474000	7475000	That's true.
7475000	7478000	Konami could always take the franchise and give it to somebody else,
7478000	7481000	but anyway.
7481000	7484000	Meanwhile, over on Nintendo Switch, I don't know about you guys,
7484000	7487000	but I've amassed all these gold coins that I can't fucking spend on anything,
7487000	7490000	because it's just discounts on software I don't want,
7490000	7493000	or it's free stuff that's also things I don't want.
7493000	7496000	Well, the good news is Nintendo is going to be changing their gold point system
7496000	7498000	a little bit starting in March, and that's going to affect Europe,
7498000	7500000	Japan, and North America.
7500000	7503000	So an update is going to occur where you can use gold points
7503000	7507000	to buy Switch games from the Nintendo eShop.
7507000	7511000	So they are saying that will be something you can use in the Switch eShop.
7511000	7515000	I just hope it's like, well, for one,
7515000	7518000	maybe they'll offer select games and so forth,
7518000	7520000	but the stuff they're offering on 3DS and Wii,
7520000	7523000	or it's like old Wii U, it's stuff that I bought a long time ago
7523000	7525000	and I don't need again or what.
7525000	7528000	Based on what they were saying before, it was supposed to be one-to-one,
7528000	7532000	so each coin you get in Japan is equal to one yen,
7532000	7535000	which is basically like a penny here.
7535000	7539000	So I don't know how many gold coins you earn.
7539000	7541000	So not only will there be the Switch rewards,
7541000	7544000	but there's this other element of it where you could use one gold coin
7544000	7548000	to basically be, yeah, you're right, in Japan it would be one yen.
7548000	7551000	So that's nothing.
7551000	7553000	How many gold coins do you earn at a time?
7553000	7560000	You get like 5% back in gold if you get a digital version,
7560000	7565000	and it's only a 1% return for packaged Switch purchases.
7565000	7571000	So if I buy a $50 game, I get like 50 coins.
7571000	7575000	So that would be 50 cents from my $50 game.
7575000	7576000	That sounds pretty terrible.
7576000	7577000	Yeah, I know.
7577000	7580000	It's almost like I would just rather take the crappy little game
7580000	7582000	that I missed and cash out that way.
7582000	7584000	But it is another way you could do it.
7584000	7586000	I have something like 200 coins in my account,
7586000	7589000	and if it's only worth two bucks, forget it.
7589000	7592000	It's not the way I want to spend those points.
7592000	7595000	I'll just wait and hope something good or a really good discount comes around.
7595000	7599000	All right, let's move on. Loki.
7599000	7601000	All right, so I don't know.
7601000	7603000	This is a big controversy, I guess,
7603000	7607000	but apparently the debate on the Internet has been,
7607000	7613000	Toad, is the mushroom part of his hat, or is that part of his hat,
7613000	7615000	or is that his head?
7615000	7620000	Which is it? Is it attached to his skull, or is it just cosmetic?
7620000	7624000	And apparently Nintendo came out and answered that question,
7624000	7630000	saying that yes, canon is that it is attached to his head.
7630000	7635000	That's what the story is, and apparently even though in the cartoon
7635000	7639000	he does take it off, that's just him removing the top portion of his skull
7639000	7641000	and not his hat.
7641000	7644000	Nintendo also didn't make the cartoon.
7644000	7647000	Nintendo allowed somebody else to make the cartoon.
7647000	7650000	I would subscribe to the theory that it is not a hat,
7650000	7653000	because if they're from the Mushroom Kingdom,
7653000	7655000	then they look like mushroom people.
7655000	7660000	So if it's just a hat, mushrooms don't wear hats.
7660000	7664000	That's my perspective on it, but I guess this is going to be the new argument.
7664000	7668000	This is the new pineapple on pizza, which, by the way, I love Hawaiian pizza,
7668000	7672000	so don't try to come at me with the whole pineapple doesn't belong on pizza,
7672000	7674000	because it totally is fine.
7674000	7676000	Hawaiian pizza's great.
7676000	7679000	I wouldn't put it on every pizza, but I put it on that one.
7679000	7681000	Yeah, I don't know.
7681000	7684000	So that's how I officially feel.
7684000	7686000	It's not a hat.
7686000	7688000	Yes to pineapple on pizza.
7688000	7690000	Gif.
7690000	7692000	Just so we're clear.
7692000	7697000	Dark Tetsuya says,
7697000	7700000	Well, why did they animate that scene with Toad taking his hat off?
7700000	7702000	Nintendo didn't animate that scene.
7702000	7705000	Nintendo had another company animate that scene.
7705000	7710000	Another company had the rights to do their own cartoon thingy from Nintendo.
7710000	7715000	So technically, all of that is not official canon.
7715000	7716000	So there's that.
7716000	7720000	I'm fine with that too.
7720000	7725000	Yes. Why doesn't Zelda or Link, I should say, in Zelda ever say,
7725000	7727000	Excuse me, princess.
7727000	7729000	That never once happens in any of the games.
7729000	7734000	So, you know, who either believe the cartoon or the games?
7734000	7736000	I am already sick of this argument.
7736000	7737000	All right.
7737000	7740000	Speaking of ways to get muted on Twitter, come at me with this argument.
7740000	7741000	All right.
7741000	7743000	Let's move on, Loki.
7743000	7744000	All right.
7744000	7747000	And then finally, this is kind of cool.
7747000	7750000	So you may, if you've played Super Mario Odyssey,
7750000	7754000	especially if you've done some of these weird hat tricks where you jump to
7754000	7758000	No more hat talk!
7758000	7761000	You jump to, like, these, like, hard to reach places and stuff,
7761000	7763000	and you find there's coins there.
7763000	7765000	And you think, well, why the hell did they put coins there?
7765000	7766000	That's kind of odd.
7766000	7769000	So apparently in testing this game,
7769000	7773000	a lot of the game testers were able to get to different places in the game
7773000	7776000	that you normally wouldn't be able to get to.
7776000	7778000	I guess some unexpected areas.
7778000	7782000	And to kind of pay tribute to those testers as well,
7782000	7784000	they put coins in those places.
7784000	7787000	So they hid coins in all these places that you would not normally go
7787000	7791000	to reward people that have found ways to get to those places, I guess,
7791000	7793000	if that makes sense.
7793000	7795000	So that's kind of neat.
7795000	7797000	Yeah, that is kind of neat.
7799000	7801000	I don't know if this has to do with Toad's hat, though,
7801000	7805000	but, you know, it's neat.
7805000	7808000	No, because Mario's hat is the item in Odyssey.
7808000	7810000	But yes, people get to very hard to reach areas,
7810000	7812000	and I think that's kind of cool that Nintendo was like,
7812000	7814000	well, I never thought to get up there, let's put a coin there
7814000	7816000	so other people think to get up there.
7816000	7818000	I think that's kind of cool that, you know,
7818000	7822000	they let the testers kind of find the hard to reach shit for them in a way.
7822000	7824000	So, kind of neat. I like that.
7824000	7826000	All right, one more story for you guys,
7826000	7828000	and it also has to do with Nintendo.
7828000	7830000	And then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
7830000	7832000	all one word on Skype if you want to call in tonight.
7832000	7836000	And it's about Nintendo Online,
7836000	7840000	and they're saying that it's going to be worth the wait.
7840000	7843000	That's right, in a Q&A session for investors,
7843000	7846000	the Nintendo Switch architect Shinya Takahashi
7846000	7850000	says that this service is going to be, again, worth the wait.
7850000	7852000	The question was about Nintendo Switch Online.
7852000	7855000	The official start of service has been significantly delayed.
7855000	7858000	Has anything changed during this extended development period?
7858000	7861000	Also, how do you plan to popularize the service?
7861000	7862000	The answer.
7862000	7866000	We view the online service as one component of our efforts
7866000	7868000	to diversify how our games are played
7868000	7870000	and get people to play more of our games.
7870000	7874000	That is why we want to apply substantial resources to the online service
7874000	7876000	with the thinking that we will devote our energies
7876000	7878000	to making this a for-pay service.
7878000	7881000	As for how we plan to popularize the service,
7881000	7883000	it is less about the mechanism
7883000	7887000	and more a question of what kinds of products we can offer.
7887000	7890000	The spread of the service will depend on whether consumers want what we offer.
7890000	7893000	Please give us a bit more time to announce more details about the service.
7893000	7897000	I think that announcement will convey to you how we plan to popularize the service.
7897000	7900000	It does sound very clear to me from that
7900000	7903000	this is not just pay to play online.
7903000	7906000	There is definitely another component to this
7906000	7910000	and whether it is the classic game a month that you play online,
7910000	7912000	whether it's that whole thing
7912000	7915000	or there's another twist to it that we just don't know yet,
7915000	7917000	there's something else there.
7917000	7922000	It's not just 20 bucks to play online Splatoon anymore.
7922000	7925000	But I think we all kind of knew that was the direction it was going in,
7925000	7930000	but it really does sound like Nintendo is trying to push for something more
7930000	7932000	and that something more they really think is a big deal,
7932000	7934000	whether they're right or not.
7934000	7937000	But the Switch is selling like fucking crazy,
7937000	7939000	so what do we know anymore?
7939000	7942000	Anyway, one more follow-up by Takahashi,
7942000	7946000	who said we have some ideas about how to make Nintendo Switch Online appealing
7946000	7948000	when it becomes a four-pay service,
7948000	7953000	so I think our next announcement will be worth the wait.
7953000	7955000	How about that, Loki?
7955000	7957000	It's going to be worth the wait.
7957000	7960000	Balloon fight with your friends. Worth the wait.
7960000	7962000	We'll see what's worth the wait.
7962000	7964000	I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
7964000	7968000	I mean, if they are really exceeding my expectations,
7968000	7970000	maybe what they're even doing with the classic games,
7970000	7972000	like maybe they are doing more leaderboards,
7972000	7975000	maybe they're infusing some of these old classic games
7975000	7979000	with newer technology and it's not as simple as just emulating the old ROM,
7979000	7982000	maybe if they are going back and doing some crazy shit to their catalog,
7982000	7987000	then bring it on. Let's do it.
7987000	7990000	For now, though, I do enjoy that I can play Splatoon Online for free.
7990000	7994000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
7994000	7998000	You can also do the old school phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7998000	8003000	Also in chat, more comments at live.vognetwork.com.
8003000	8007000	SSG100Matt says, hey, as long as they don't mess it up, they can take as long as they want.
8007000	8012000	Nintendo Arcade Room. Don't tease me. Don't tease me with that.
8012000	8015000	We have a call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8015000	8018000	Hey, what's going on? This is Ron. I'm a long time caller, long time listener.
8018000	8022000	Yeah, great. Great to hear from you again. No, I'm kidding. It's always a delight.
8022000	8024000	What's on your mind, buddy?
8024000	8029000	A couple of things. Now, one thing, I tagged you with something on Facebook
8029000	8032000	and I understand you're going away from Facebook and I get that,
8032000	8038000	but I'm dragging you back over for one thing you have not responded to. I need to know.
8038000	8041000	I have a feeling I know what this is, but go for it.
8041000	8044000	Yes. Spice Girls, are you down?
8044000	8048000	Absolutely. Here's the thing. Here's why I didn't respond, Rama.
8048000	8053000	Because I got tagged in posts by five other people on that.
8053000	8057000	And although I love that people associate me with that news,
8057000	8060000	I just didn't get around to responding to every single one.
8060000	8065000	But let me just put it this way. The name of my other show, Shaking and Crying,
8065000	8068000	is not ironic at this point.
8068000	8074000	Especially when this news inevitably comes up on the show this week.
8074000	8080000	I'm so happy. I fucking... I know people are going to laugh, but I shit you not.
8080000	8084000	The Spice Girls reunion tour they did, like back in, what, it was 06 or so,
8084000	8087000	was seriously one of the best concerts I've ever been to.
8087000	8090000	I had so much fucking fun.
8090000	8094000	Well, I'm going to try to make it this year, because I saw Spice World in theaters,
8094000	8097000	and I have the VHS tape, so you know I'm a fan.
8097000	8100000	I know, and I saw Spice World in theaters, too.
8100000	8103000	I don't have the VHS tape, but I have the DVD.
8103000	8105000	But did you play the PS1 game?
8105000	8110000	I did, and did you know that Brad from Pod Culture found a copy of it,
8110000	8112000	like a thrift store or something, and he sent it to me,
8112000	8114000	so that I could play it on my PlayStation 3?
8114000	8117000	Because PS3 will play PS1 games.
8117000	8122000	So I can go through the, let's put another girl through her paces, all over again.
8122000	8125000	What is this about? Human trafficking?
8125000	8127000	What? The Spice World game?
8127000	8128000	Oh, the Spice World game.
8128000	8133000	No, the Spice World game. Jesus, don't take it to a dark place.
8133000	8136000	But this is Loki here. Of course she's going to take it to a dark place.
8136000	8138000	That's a very good point.
8138000	8142000	So yes, I'm excited about the tour. I hope they are coming to the States.
8142000	8146000	Although the excuse to go overseas, I wouldn't really complain,
8146000	8148000	but we'll wait and see what's going on.
8148000	8152000	The only outlet that's really confirmed anything is TMZ,
8152000	8154000	so I am still kind of just cautiously waiting.
8154000	8157000	I would like the Spice Girls themselves to say something,
8157000	8160000	because TMZ is kind of, you know, trashy news.
8160000	8161000	True.
8161000	8163000	So I'm waiting for something a little more official,
8163000	8167000	but it does seem like something's going to happen. I'm very excited about it.
8167000	8170000	Me too, and I did also see it linked from Entertainment Weekly,
8170000	8172000	so, you know, getting there.
8172000	8175000	Getting there. Well, what else is on your mind, buddy?
8175000	8179000	All right, so I was traveling back from Michael Charles' birthday party,
8179000	8183000	so I missed parts of the show, but I spoke to Hack Def.
8183000	8185000	That's my boy, and I appreciate that.
8185000	8190000	So I wanted to comment quickly on the whole Twitch community guidelines thing,
8190000	8195000	because I'm starting to see some of the backlash of that on my feed.
8195000	8197000	Oh, really?
8197000	8202000	Yes, because, well, I have friends with various cosplayers,
8202000	8205000	and some of them stream on Twitch,
8205000	8209000	and I know some of them stream on adult sites and so forth, you know?
8209000	8210000	Sure.
8210000	8212000	Everyone's got to hustle, make their money, and I respect that.
8212000	8213000	Sure.
8213000	8217000	And I know a few who are doing both, and it's all good.
8217000	8224000	I mean, personally, I really don't want to see some of the titties
8224000	8227000	all up on my gaming screen while I'm watching,
8227000	8230000	but if that's part of the hustle, so be it.
8230000	8234000	But Twitch is mostly for gaming.
8234000	8240000	I mean, whether it's male or female, if you want to sexify yourself, that's fine.
8240000	8242000	Be on one side of the screen,
8242000	8248000	and let's see you playing through Super Metroid or another game on the other side.
8248000	8250000	You know, that's how it's supposed to be.
8250000	8254000	But I get why this happens, because believe it or not,
8254000	8256000	it's much more accessible to get onto Twitch
8256000	8259000	as it is to the various other adult sites that are out there.
8259000	8262000	I have two things to say real quick.
8262000	8265000	To the Rob D. in chat who named Posh sporty and scary,
8265000	8267000	you forgot Baby and Ginger.
8267000	8270000	There you go. Anyway, those are the five.
8270000	8272000	Then to your point, here's the thing,
8272000	8274000	and this is what I think everybody needs to keep in mind.
8274000	8277000	For everybody that's saying Twitch is gaming, Twitch is gaming,
8277000	8282000	Twitch is gaming, y'all, not for much longer, quote me on this.
8282000	8285000	I mean, ever since Amazon bought Twitch,
8285000	8290000	I think you've seen it inch closer and closer to being more than just gaming.
8290000	8293000	And I realize the irony here that, you know,
8293000	8297000	Twitch once started as a life casting site through Justin TV.
8297000	8301000	But I don't think it's really, I don't think it's that Twitch is going back to Justin.
8301000	8304000	I think it's that Twitch is kind of getting closer and closer
8304000	8308000	to answering our fucking prayers and giving YouTube a competitor
8308000	8310000	that can take them on at their level.
8310000	8313000	Amazon is at the level where they can compete with Google.
8313000	8316000	I think that's where Twitch is headed, eventually.
8316000	8320000	So I just don't want people to be shocked when that news inevitably comes out
8320000	8323000	that Twitch is much more than games.
8323000	8329000	I like that. I kind of feel as if Twitch is going back to Justin TV as part of their roots.
8329000	8331000	It's like, you know what, this is where we started.
8331000	8333000	Let's add a little bit of this and go out there.
8333000	8340000	Because I know cosplayers who have their own creative channels on doing live streams of making various cosplays.
8340000	8344000	I know people who do art and stuff like that. I get that.
8344000	8350000	But there are some levels of lewdness that goes on in Twitch that really shouldn't be there.
8350000	8353000	Am I going to sit there and tell someone they shouldn't do it? Nope.
8353000	8356000	Not my business. Not my monkeys.
8356000	8360000	But if it's my site and I see it's causing an issue, then I'm going to be like,
8360000	8364000	yeah, you gotta reel that back in. Simple as that.
8364000	8365000	Yeah.
8365000	8369000	And I honestly feel some are saying, you know, Twitch just opened up an 18 plus site.
8369000	8373000	I'm just like, well, that's not going to do you any good.
8373000	8377000	I don't think Amazon doesn't want to moderate that. They don't want to have that in their holdings.
8377000	8380000	For whatever reason in this country, and I'm not saying it's right,
8380000	8386000	I'm just saying for whatever reason in this country, nobody wants to do sex-related stuff
8386000	8389000	and that keeps to an industry all its own.
8389000	8394000	Oh, go ahead. I was gonna say, you know, I was hearing someone talking about like, you know,
8394000	8397000	what they thought who could be a possible contender.
8397000	8400000	They would have the infrastructure to be able to compete with YouTube.
8400000	8404000	And it makes so much sense. It's so easy for them to do this.
8404000	8412000	Pornhub. Pornhub come out with a video platform called like VideoHub or TubeHub or something like that.
8412000	8414000	You know, basically like a non porn site.
8414000	8417000	They have the infrastructure in place to be able to do this.
8417000	8420000	And they have a section off for porn already.
8420000	8422000	They could compete, I think.
8422000	8427000	Yeah, but when you can already submit videos, it's just a matter of time of streaming live videos.
8427000	8433000	Oh yeah, and I love it when people are like, they post those videos that are like,
8433000	8438000	70 year old man fucks the entire country at once and it's like Trump giving the speech or something.
8438000	8443000	Pornhub is out there fighting for our internet rights and so forth.
8443000	8444000	You gotta understand something.
8444000	8450000	Here is a site that makes money off of guys and girls getting off, fapping, all of this.
8450000	8456000	And they're out there on the forefront fighting for your right to spank and so forth.
8456000	8458000	And they do something like that.
8458000	8465000	I can actually see everybody just going over and then there's just tumbleweeds going through Twitch and YouTube, you know?
8465000	8468000	Yeah, and I totally get what you're saying.
8468000	8473000	And here's the thing, with this whole argument, it's like, I don't want to shame sex workers.
8473000	8475000	And I don't think you do either.
8475000	8480000	And I think there's a lot of, you know, people earn, make a living however they're going to make a living.
8480000	8484000	And that's, you know, as long as everything is consensual, that's the most important part.
8484000	8488000	What happens between two consenting adults is their business and that's fine.
8488000	8490000	And I'm not out here to shame sex workers.
8490000	8495000	I think the reality of the situation aims a little closely to what you're talking about where,
8495000	8499000	but I don't want to be looking for video games and then come across that.
8499000	8502000	You know, there's a time and a place for that.
8502000	8503000	I get it, you know.
8503000	8504000	Yeah.
8504000	8507000	If I'm watching somebody, you know, they're going through a game.
8507000	8510000	If she's wearing something cute, that's fine.
8510000	8511000	I mean, I'm cool with that.
8511000	8517000	I mean, but if they're doing like, you know, if you tip and they pose a certain,
8517000	8525000	I get that I'll get more people in, but that kind of takes away from what the reason why you're there.
8525000	8526000	Yeah, I get it.
8526000	8527000	I get it.
8527000	8528000	Yeah.
8528000	8531000	And again, I mean, it's still going to be a great area.
8531000	8537000	And I see Twitch is still trying to dance around it because if they just come down and be like, this is what it is now.
8537000	8539000	Oh, the backlash is going to be horrible.
8539000	8540000	But you know what?
8540000	8544000	I laugh when people say, oh, I don't like what you're doing.
8544000	8545000	I'm going to leave the site.
8545000	8546000	I'm going to leave the site.
8546000	8547000	Go right ahead.
8547000	8553000	For one person that leaves the site, three more people will come through and be like, I like what's here.
8553000	8555000	That's what it boils down to.
8555000	8559000	I believe it's the 85-15 rule or in this case, the 90-10 rule.
8559000	8564000	As long as 90 percent of the people are happy with what's going on, that's all that matters.
8564000	8571000	And that may end up, you know, referencing the early email that goes on, that may ultimately end up being what happens with Facebook.
8571000	8579000	You know, once enough people are tipped off about it and go somewhere else, especially when it ends up being the celebrities and so forth.
8579000	8581000	That's when Facebook is going to be hurting.
8581000	8583000	No.
8583000	8585000	Anyway, Rama, great call.
8585000	8588000	But I'm going to let you go to see if anybody else wants to get in since we're coming up on 10 minutes.
8588000	8590000	But thank you so much for the call.
8590000	8591000	Hey, no problem. You all take care now.
8591000	8592000	Yeah, take care, buddy. Bye.
8592000	8593000	Bye.
8593000	8597000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you would like to give us a call.
8597000	8600000	I didn't check on last minute stories because the phone's lit up pretty quick there.
8600000	8601000	Do you have any last minute stories to share?
8601000	8604000	No, I don't really have any. I don't remember talking about these, but there was like some...
8604000	8606000	I thought there was one I wasn't able to fit in. I didn't know if you...
8606000	8608000	Oh, I didn't look at it.
8608000	8610000	Way to prepare. Way to prepare.
8610000	8614000	All right, we do have the phone lighting up with another phone call, so let's get to it.
8614000	8616000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8616000	8619000	Hi, it's Aaron, YYR.
8619000	8622000	Oh, you're going for the two for tonight, email and phone call.
8622000	8625000	But no, we love hearing from you. What's up, YYR?
8625000	8627000	Well...
8629000	8632000	Oh, yeah, that's right. My mind just totally blanked out.
8632000	8642000	I've been kind of burning the candle at both ends and living, breathing, trying to fix all the little problems with the game.
8642000	8647000	Actually, JD has been a humongous help.
8648000	8651000	He pointed out a couple of bugs I don't think I would have found otherwise,
8651000	8659000	including the fact that my entire routine to figure out the aspect ratio of your screen and adjust accordingly,
8659000	8663000	I broke it and I didn't even notice until he pointed it out.
8663000	8665000	Wow, gold star for you, JD.
8665000	8670000	Honestly, I've been playing the game, and besides the alt-tab thing, which you already knew about,
8670000	8674000	and I didn't get to test your workaround, but besides the stuff you already knew about,
8674000	8680000	I was really not finding stuff, so good job, JD, who found new stuff in there.
8680000	8688000	Well, actually, it's pretty funny because the alt-tab crash, I think it has something to do with the resolution,
8688000	8697000	and JD's fix had to do with resolution, so I just tried this new build in Steam and I couldn't alt-tab crash it,
8697000	8700000	so I'm wondering if it maybe is fixed now.
8700000	8704000	But he's not going to be able to test for an hour and a half because he's at a friend's place right now.
8704000	8710000	Yes, it's Star Trek Discovery finale night. It's a very big deal, so yes, that's what's going on.
8710000	8712000	Well, now I feel bad for having interrupted him.
8712000	8715000	No, no, no, no, no, I'm sure he's fine.
8715000	8721000	But yeah, no, but you know what, I know making a game is hard and selling it is even harder.
8721000	8728000	Well, actually, I shouldn't say that. Making a game, making some games are really easy.
8728000	8732000	Making a game in ZZT and Twine and stuff with all the tools that are out there, easy.
8732000	8737000	But making something that other people want to buy, that's where it gets hard.
8737000	8742000	So, you know, props to you for these late nights, and I really, really hope you do see success with this game.
8742000	8750000	I understand you're not going to be a multimillionaire that ends up buying Beyonce's house from a game like Super Multitasking,
8750000	8754000	but I do hope it gets people to recognize your talent, if nothing else.
8754000	8756000	I do hope it gets people to take you seriously.
8756000	8760000	I hope you get everything I could never get through this podcast, YYR.
8760000	8771000	Well, you know what, like I've always said, if this does wind up becoming big and then people are all of a sudden lining up to try to interview me,
8771000	8777000	I'm going to be like, okay, well, okay, so the game's coming out on a Friday, right?
8777000	8778000	Right.
8778000	8787000	So if everyone is all of a sudden lining up to interview me, I'll be like, okay, well, I'll start entertaining those requests on Monday,
8787000	8797000	but Sunday night, I'm doing an exclusive interview with Orange Lounge Radio, the longest running podcast about video games on the internet,
8797000	8800000	and not a thing is going to change that.
8800000	8804000	And that loyalty, that loyalty means a lot to me, my friends.
8805000	8810000	And hey, if I bring in a whole bunch of new listeners, that's not a bad thing, right?
8810000	8813000	I appreciate that, but at the same time, I don't want to set false expectations either.
8813000	8818000	I get really excited about Super Multitasking, I think it could be a success, but you know what?
8818000	8821000	I thought this show would be a bigger success.
8821000	8826000	Hey, you did just get an email from a very long time listener.
8826000	8830000	You're right, and I don't ever want to make it sound like this show wasn't a success.
8830000	8836000	If it wasn't, I wouldn't be doing it, but the reality is, you're not hearing ads for Squatty Potty for a reason.
8838000	8842000	Oh, and actually, you know what? I missed the beginning segment of the show.
8842000	8848000	We were visiting my folks today, and I was still on my way home, but you didn't happen to mention KAC at all, did you?
8848000	8852000	KAC, is that one of the DDR championships that happened?
8852000	8853000	Konami Arcade Champion.
8853000	8860000	We, like, tangentially mentioned it happened, but we didn't get into details, so if you'd like to bring up details, go for it.
8860000	8869000	Well, you know what? To spoil the details, I think would be detrimental to anyone who would watch it.
8869000	8882000	So I would very strongly recommend, if you're into the DDR scene at all, and if you want to see some really, really great competition,
8882000	8891000	I would definitely recommend that you go to, actually, really, the easiest way to say this would be if you go to ddrcommunity.com.
8891000	8900000	I mean, they'll probably spoil who won on the front page, but if you scroll down just a little bit, you'll get all the links to watch everything that happened.
8900000	8908000	And, I mean, really, just knowing the result is not going to spoil your enjoyment of just watching how everything went down,
8908000	8917000	and also the quality that went into the production. Like, they did a great job. They did, like, you know how, you know, before a wrestling match or whatever,
8917000	8927000	they always do, like, interviews, and it's like, oh yeah, I'm going to take this person down. They did all that with all the contestants for KAC also,
8927000	8933000	so it was pretty cool to watch. Like, they had the WWE promo videos down pat. Like, it was pretty cool.
8933000	8941000	That's funny. Okay, I like that. I like that. I do want to just clarify an earlier statement, because the Rob D in chat makes a great point over at live.vognetwork.com,
8941000	8947000	saying, this show is a success for the camaraderie and community it's generated. And you know what, buddy, you're absolutely right.
8947000	8953000	Don't think I don't, you know, even though I like to make tongue-in-cheek jokes, like, if you can't make fun of yourself, who can you make fun of?
8953000	8961000	But it's one of those things where it's like, it hasn't been the money that's motivated us for 16 years, let me tell you that.
8961000	8968000	But take it as a compliment that this show has lasted for 16 years without that, and I hope everybody understands what I mean by that.
8968000	8974000	So, anyway. Oh, the other thing I was going to say with that, it's funny, because you bringing up the Konami Championships and saying all that,
8974000	8982000	it made me think of the DDR freestyle tournament that happened recently, which I can say, I don't think I'm stepping out of line by saying,
8982000	8989000	they are working on what's next. It's not going to. Freestyle will continue. But I don't have any specifics beyond that.
8989000	8996000	I'll be lucky if I can get them to do the OLR exclusive, like YYR does with me, gives me the exclusive.
8996000	9005000	Anyway, but I want to say this, because I don't think Loki's heard this. Did you know there was an earnings call with Round 1, the popular, you know, chain that does,
9005000	9012000	there was an earnings call, and they talked about, because this is on front page of Imani Style, as well as some other sites, they talked about what the future holds for Round 1.
9012000	9019000	They are opening a brand new Round 1 in Hayward later this year. So the Bay Area is going to get another Round 1, which is pretty cool.
9019000	9024000	And in the fourth quarter of 2019, Roseville confirmed getting a Round 1 entertainer.
9024000	9025000	Nice.
9025000	9029000	Right at the, they say it's at the Galleria, which I don't, I'm like, what closed?
9029000	9030000	Where?
9030000	9036000	Yeah, that's my question. I'm like, where? But then I'm thinking across the street from the Galleria, they've had that empty furniture store for years,
9036000	9040000	so they do the haunted houses and all that stuff. I would bet that's where they put it.
9040000	9041000	Huh.
9041000	9042000	Sweet.
9042000	9049000	Well, their patterns thus far have been, you know, low rent in a mall, like a mall in a low rent area, so.
9049000	9051000	Yeah, yeah, the Hayward one.
9051000	9055000	Well, I've got a mall in a low rent area just down the street from my house.
9055000	9056000	Sunrise mall?
9056000	9059000	Sunrise mall, hey, let's bulldoze all the stores, let's just turn the whole thing into a Round 1.
9059000	9062000	They're going to turn that mall into an arena, it's doing so bad.
9064000	9070000	That happened in Sacramento, by the way. Our downtown mall was so bad, they bulldozed it, and that's what the Sacramento Kings played out.
9070000	9071000	It's a pretty nice mall, too.
9071000	9075000	It was when they first opened it, but did you go there in the past couple years it was open?
9075000	9076000	No.
9076000	9083000	Where, like, nothing was open and you'd be walking through just these empty halls, and then there'd just be a random TCBY in the middle of it?
9083000	9085000	I went there when they had BattleTech.
9087000	9091000	So, ooh, apparently Dark Tetsuya did not know that news. Yeah, go check out Bomani Style DT.
9091000	9098000	And there's some other ones they announced, too. I mean, there's a few in California, which you would expect, but there's some in other parts of the nation as well.
9098000	9101000	I think in the Ohio area there was one that was opening, so go check it out.
9102000	9104000	Yeah, they're really expanding all over.
9104000	9109000	Yeah, awesome news. Well, while we are, I'm going to be doing super multitasking after the show tonight.
9109000	9113000	So, I imagine I'm not the first to stream it, but I've got to be one of the first, right?
9114000	9122000	You know what? I sent codes to a few people on a message board, and they said they would be looking forward to streaming it.
9122000	9128000	But, to be honest, I've been so busy, I don't know if anyone's streamed it yet or what.
9128000	9134000	So, because the show is ending a little bit early tonight, I will actually be able to tune in for a bit.
9134000	9138000	So, you will be the first person that I watch stream it.
9138000	9141000	I'll fucking take it. There we go! Live with the creator.
9141000	9146000	Alright, and that'll be coming right up here. I'm going to wrap things up here pretty soon.
9146000	9151000	So, while we are on that note, I'm going to let you go, and I am going to wish you luck with the game that is out February 23rd.
9151000	9159000	And I'm usually not such a commercial whore for products, but those of you that have been listening to OLR for a long time know that, like,
9159000	9166000	I like to think we've personally had a hand in pushing this game to make YYR, like, fucking motivate him to do it.
9166000	9170000	So, now if only it could just push me into making a game.
9170000	9171000	I'll try. I'll try.
9171000	9179000	I'll tell you what I've been doing lately. I've been down this rabbit hole of trying to hack arcade DDR mixes to add new songs to them.
9179000	9186000	So, there is a little piece of this baby that I do think, I do feel like we owe a little bit to.
9186000	9189000	So, that's why I want to see you do well.
9189000	9196000	Thank you. Thank you. And, Loki, seriously, like, just throw Stepmania on it if you want to add songs.
9196000	9200000	It's just going to be so much easier, and it's going to save you so much time.
9200000	9202000	I know, but I like the challenge.
9203000	9211000	You just, you don't know him like I do. He's just, it's just, he, sometimes he has to do it the hard way to say he fucking did it the hard way.
9211000	9212000	He's a guy like that.
9212000	9219000	I understand, yeah, I have all the stuff that puts Stepmania on there. I have all the hardware and everything I need to do that.
9219000	9223000	I just, I want to try it this way, because it hasn't been done yet.
9223000	9226000	Alright. Alrighty. Cool. Well, enjoy.
9226000	9228000	Alright, my friend, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy.
9228000	9230000	Have a great week, you guys.
9230000	9231000	You too. Bye.
9231000	9232000	Yep. Bye bye.
9232000	9237000	Okay, I am going to close up the Skypline on that note. Sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always send us an email.
9237000	9240000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
9240000	9245000	But I think with that, if there are no last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
9245000	9251000	But I want to thank all you guys for downloading the show and checking it out this week or being here live to listen, whatever the case may be.
9251000	9258000	I know some of you all skipped the 12 hour delayed Olympics footage to come out and listen to the show tonight, so I appreciate that. Thank you.
9258000	9265000	And yeah, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play.
9265000	9271000	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.
9271000	9279000	So tell a friend or two or fifteen about the show. We appreciate it. We appreciate the loyalty, just like YYR has for us.
9279000	9285000	Alright. We're going to get final thoughts, and then I think we're out of here for the night. So, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9285000	9291000	I do actually need to work on a game. I've been thinking about it lately because I've been wasting a lot of time with this whole DDR stuff.
9291000	9301000	And it's actually kind of fascinating because there are people that have managed on the PlayStation 2 versions to swap songs out and do the music and stuff.
9301000	9309000	And apparently format-wise, it's pretty similar. It's just the tools that do it for PlayStation 1 stuff and a lot of that.
9310000	9315000	It's ironic. I had it on my old hard drive, and then I was copying stuff over from my old hard drive to my new hard drive.
9315000	9321000	I'm like, I don't need that. And I deleted it. And immediately after I deleted it, I'm like, ah crap, I did need that.
9321000	9332000	So, it's alright. But the other day I dumped, because apparently I own most of the arcade discs from the pre-Extreme stuff.
9332000	9338000	So, I dumped all those onto my computer to take a look at them. But I'm curious to see.
9338000	9344000	Because I know that they've hacked in Marvelous ratings in rankings into Extreme for the arcade.
9344000	9348000	So, if that's possible, then what else is possible is what I want to know.
9348000	9349000	Anything is possible.
9349000	9350000	Exactly. Anything is possible.
9350000	9352000	That was a long final thought. Jesus, alright.
9352000	9353000	Sorry.
9353000	9360000	That's okay. My final thought is I think Marissa is going to win Celebrity Big Brother because I'm trash.
9360000	9365000	Goodnight everybody. We'll see you in seven days for another OLR. Goodnight.
9390000	9395000	But you know they were all still true.
9395000	9397000	See you next week.
9420000	9429000	Thanks for watching!
