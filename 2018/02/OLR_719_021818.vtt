This week it's a potpourri of topics in gaming news, fighting games, imminent releases, lootboxes, acquisitions, cryptocurrency and more! There's something for almost everyone in the lineup of tonight's news, so let's waste no more time and get right to the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 719 for this February the 18th of 2018.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts, including DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Moaning and moaning.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
What?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm so full.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, I see. I was like, that's not usually a reference to full noises.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Moaning. Pain.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
How are you? Thanks for the movie date today. That was fun.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Thank you as well.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, well you're welcome.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
We saw Lady Bird today.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes, we finally saw the Lady Bird.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
And I kind of want to see it again, but I might have, it wasn't quite ugly crying but it couldn't stop.

01:20.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, not that we're a movie podcast, but I really love that movie a lot. Well, I mean, this show, as you probably know, is based in Sacramento, California.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
And so certainly there's a certain something, I mean, obviously, like, for example, there's a lot that resonated with you, even though you grew up in Mobile.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
You said you had a lot of similar, without kind of giving away the entire plot, you had a lot of similar feelings as the plot progressed.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Especially dealing with my mother.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Although I didn't have, you know, a stable male influence in my life like that. I didn't have a dad I could rely on like that.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
But I still have that kind of relationship with my mother.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And, of course, she left and I stayed with Grandmom.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
But, you know, just the whole, I need to get out of the place that you still know very well.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
And then when you're gone from there, you have the shock, you know.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And it's like, what do I do now?

02:10.000 --> 02:18.000
There was definitely pieces of it. I mean, the fact that I have lived in Sacramento my whole life, there are still like pieces that really resonated with me.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
Like the whole, like, the first time you're driving around in your town, you know, it feels so different even though you lived here your whole life.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
It was very big for me.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
And then all the places were so different, you know, when I moved out here.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
I kept going back to the, there were several scenes that show the Rose Garden downtown.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Oh, McKinley Park, yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah. And the thing is, is that I used to work over on C Street at the Cannery Building.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And so I used to walk all the way around that park every day.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, it is kind of awesome that there's like legit, like local landmarks.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
Like when they do the, when, again, I don't want to spoil something, but there's a very distinct thing that happens and she's with her friend at the Tower Bridge.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
And I'm like, I know exactly how they shot that and where that is at because that's on a walking path that I've played Pokemon Go on.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Several times. There's lots of PokeStops up there.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
But it just, it makes the whole place, you know, it kind of lets you see the town in a different, through a different lens.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah. So anyway, anyway, not to be too movie chat, but maybe there'll be a Lady Bird game someday.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Just kidding. I think that's one of those games where they can't really make a game out of it.

03:20.000 --> 03:28.000
But then again, they somehow made a game out of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and they made a game out of the room at some point.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So anything's possible, I suppose.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Anyway, say hello to somebody who one of these days will ride a game.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's Tagmaster Loki.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Hello.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm doing fine.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah, good. Is your mic even on over there?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yes.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
You're just really quiet for some reason. Sorry.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
No.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Not hearing you back.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I'm not quiet.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
All right.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm very loud. I can see myself on the waveform.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Yes, it is on. For some reason, I'm not hearing the same. Maybe I'm just a futz with these speakers.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
It's just you're getting older. You're going to need to turn up a hearing aid.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Okay. Here's the other problem.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
So it is February 18th and you may or may not know, it is National Wine Day, everybody.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, that explains my children.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
What the hell does that even? Oh, not that kind of wine, Loki. Not that kind of wine.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
No.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
You got me good, bitch.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Well, the problem is where I'm going with this and you can probably already figure it out.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
I've already had about a glass and a half of one of our favorite sweet wines here locally.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So, yeah, it's National Wine Day.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I can't really drink wine because I don't enjoy it because it makes me feel like I have a really bad.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
It goes to my face.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
That's what I'm feeling right now.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Like it feels like I have a really bad sunburn.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Like that's not a pleasant.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I feel you, bro.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
That's what I'm feeling right now is that sunburn feeling.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But here I am doing a three hour podcast about games.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So good times.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
But yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So it's Wine Day.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
But of course, everybody, if you do drink, drink responsibly.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Tomorrow is a three day weekend.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Tomorrow is a holiday.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
It's President's Day.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
So it's a three day weekend for me.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
So that's why it really works out to have Wine Day be today.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
So I can actually indulge in a little bit of wine.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
So there you go.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
So I don't know.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Is anyone drinking along in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
The Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Excuse me.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Hiccups plus wine equals bad.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, I guess.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
We're just going to jump right into it and talk a little bit about

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Kickstarter's gone really, really wrong.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Loki, would you lead us a little bit on our kickoff topic tonight?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
So I don't know if this is really wrong.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
But basically, the System Shock remake that was kickstarted a couple years ago

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
for 1.3 million is on hiatus.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Thanks to, they say they had problems with development.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
And so the company Night Drive Studios, they're an indie game developer.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
And they were, of course, going to basically remake that whole thing.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
That was kind of back when a lot of the games coming out were remakes.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Like you'd have the BioShock remakes and that kind of stuff.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
Now, of course, as our concept grew and our team changed,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
so the scope of what we were doing and with the budget for the game,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
as the budget grew, we began a long series of conversations

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
with potential publishing partners.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
The more that we worked on the game, the more we wanted to do.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
And the further we got from the original concept that made System Shock so great.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
So I guess right now they're just taking time to work on it longer

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
or reassess what they need to do to bring the project back to their original scope.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
And here's why I shade all the Kickstarter stuff.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
And look, I understand the whole if you have to delay a game

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
to make it the game that you need to make, then fine.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
But it's a tricky balance with Kickstarter.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Because in Kickstarter, you're asking for people's money up front.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
And usually, almost always, it's the full cost of the game,

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
maybe with a small discount because you're showing your faith in the game early on.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
And yet this is just another in a long line of games that has either been delayed

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
or in some cases disappeared.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And there's a part of me that hears, oh, such and such game has gone on hiatus.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And I kind of go, well, some bands go on hiatus.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
The Spice Girls are on hiatus.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
You have to recognize, though, that Kickstarter is not a pre-order.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
It's just you're investing money in a company for a product,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
and that may not work out.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
And so we've already told people enough to stop pre-ordering games.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
So this is even worse.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
You pre-order a game before it's even made, like two years before it's even made.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
So I don't know.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
where I was going to go with the system's shock story

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
is that it was put on Kickstarter as a remake,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
but now it's just a different game in the same universe.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Everyone on Kickstarter backed a remaster.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
That's another good point is that things have kind of changed

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
from what it was originally supposed to be.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
MXC says, I'm very nervous about Night Drive Studios.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
They mostly get the licenses of old PC games and then remake them,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
so they run on Windows 10.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
But do they have the skill to fully remake a game even with the money?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I can see why they're having trouble.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And JD points out the Spice Girls are coming back.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Technically nothing official has been confirmed.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
This is all through TMZ.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So there's still that part of me that says,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
until I hold those concert tickets in my hand, I don't believe anything.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And don't believe those dates that are on Facebook either.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Read the descriptions of that stuff

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
and look who's actually inviting you to that stuff.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Because all that shit that's like Spice Girls tour in this city,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
that's some frickin' lame-o concert promoter locally

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
trying to farm the likes to then push out a bunch of crap to you.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Just basically get your name on a mailing list, essentially is what that is.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Another reason why Facebook sucks, but I won't get into that right now.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
But how are you feeling overall, Loki, about Kickstarter at this point?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Do you still back projects on Kickstarter?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Not really.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It's been a while for me. It's been a very long time.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
I know one project I backed, We Happy Few,

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
spams the fuck out of their updates.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I get so many stupid updates from them.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm sure there's a way to turn that off, but it's fucking annoying.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Don't get me wrong, I like backing stuff,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
but dude, I don't need a million fucking updates about that.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
I think the last one I backed was one of the guys we had on the show.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
We had the guy who made Tangledeep that was on the show.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
But what I liked about the way he was doing it

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
is that that game was pretty much already done,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
and was going to be done,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
is that he was looking for this money to put the extra coat of paint on it.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You remember that? It was bringing in guest composers,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
help with some of the publishing and stuff like that,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
and I was like, okay, that's the way to do it,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
because he already essentially had a game done.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
He was just looking for the money to kind of elevate it into

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
this is the commercial release, or whatever you want to call it,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
that I want it to be. I kind of liked that.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
It wasn't something that had to be built from the ground up,

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
because hell, even Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night,

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
that game is still not out, and how long ago was that Kickstarter?

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Now, again, take the time to get it right, I suppose,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
but there's still that part that's like,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
dang, I gave them money four years ago,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
when this game was supposed to be on the Nintendo Wii?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
No, I'm just kidding. There's a lot of games.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
The problem is, we always focus on the games that this stuff is happening in.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
We forget half the stuff that goes through it,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
and it's just fine.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I think Stardew Valley was a Kickstarter game, wasn't it?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Was it? I don't remember,

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
but there's been games like that that have gone through the process

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
with Kickstarter and stuff, and have come out just fine.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
We always focus on the ones that do bad,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
because that's all you ever remember.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Fifth Dream in Chat says,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I back Patreons more than Kickstarters nowadays.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
Have I ever talked in depth about why I really don't care for Patreon?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Maybe I'm only willing to do it tonight, because I've had a little bit to drink.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
But here's my problem with Patreon, full stop.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Patreon feels very pyramid scheme-y to me,

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
because Patreon shows what you're contributing to other people,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
as well as what they're contributing to you.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
So I kind of feel like, okay, if I go on to Patreon,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
and I've had plenty of other podcasters say,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
why don't you have OLR on Patreon, why don't you do this on Patreon?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Because, okay, cool, then we would be getting money on Patreon,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
but I would also kind of feel this sense,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
because I want to promote other podcasts,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
I would feel like, in turn, shouldn't OLR be showing the support

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
by backing other people's Patreons?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
And then what happens?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
You give us a dollar, now we give you a dollar,

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
so it's not even, except for the fact that Patreon has taken a percentage cut of both sides.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
So that's the part, and I know not everybody's going to understand that

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
and think I'm being weird, but that's the part that never really sat well with me,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
is that I feel like Patreon is this never-ending,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I give you a dollar, you give me a dollar,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
and Patreon still gets a percentage of the cut off the top the whole way.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
And that's not even getting into the other part of it,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
which I know I've talked about before,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
which is all still very relevant about the whole,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I like to do OLR because it's fun, I get to see you all,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
and once I feel a little more like,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I feel like if you're giving us money,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
and then we have to go and, let's say, cancel a show,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
and last year we had to cancel a lot of shows,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
because there was just a lot going on.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
Even though I know 99.9% of the listeners were more than understanding those scenarios,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
and I thank you for that,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I would still feel that kind of sense of,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
you paid us for something we didn't deliver on,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
now I've become one of these Kickstarters.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Now you're part of the whole network.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Yes, now I'm part of that whole problem.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And whether it's true or not, I'm just telling you that's where my brain goes.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
Whether I'm being rational or not, that's what happens with my brain.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
So that's kind of a big reason why I've never gone to Patreon.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
And I have nothing against other shows that go to Patreon to do this stuff.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
That is something you have to figure out for yourself,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
and you have to do for your show, and that's totally cool,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
and I am definitely a supporter of independent podcasting,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
whether that's through finance, whether that's through word of mouth, whatever.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Well, I think a lot of the shows that I've seen that use Patreon,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
they kind of put it this way.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
It's like, we're doing this show, if you want to back us, that's cool,

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
but if you can't find it, if this is going to be a financial burden for you, please don't.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Or just, only if you want to, type of thing.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
And so kind of making it, listen, this show's going to be what it is,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
whether you back it or not, type of thing.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Getting some comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
SG100Matt says, I stopped backing gaming Kickstarters.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Too much nonsense happens in development where I will just purchase the game when it comes out.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah, I'm not helping the cause, but there have been many gaming Kickstarters

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
that have gone wrong during development.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Dungeon Buster says, Pillars of Eternity boasts Divinity Original Sin games,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Wasteland 2, the Shadowrun series.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
There's a lot of success stories, but it only takes a few to sour people on the process.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And some people are also bringing up other games.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Shovel Knight was another success, and so forth.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
Also, Bobby Blackwolf points out Mutant Football League,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
which I know he's been streaming more and more of lately,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
cheap plug for Bobby Blackwolf,

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
was a failed Kickstarter, but what came out of it was a much better game, in my opinion.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
That could be.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
I can't really say yes or no, because I haven't played the game myself,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
but it looked interesting.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
JD in chat says, I can't find the Kickstarter for Stardew Valley.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I think it might not have been one.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Ok.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
And AkumaJP says, Sky will not do well in business.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
He is too nice.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
I can be a dick when I need to be, but it's a fair criticism,

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
but I don't want OLR necessarily to pay the bills.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I have a day job that's cool.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I want it to pay my meth habit.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Oh wait, I don't have a meth habit, so I guess I don't need it.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
I need it to pay for my cookie habit.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
But I could develop a meth habit, and then I wouldn't have to worry about the cost of it.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I wouldn't have to worry about having a job.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
I'm just thinking about this animated short that plays before Rocky Horror every time,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
where the little dancing popcorn and that stuff,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
but it's a death metal band with the pretzel and stuff,

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
and they go, don't stop, watch, and then they go,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
we have all your fucking money and we're going to spend it on drugs.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
It's pretty awesome.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
But that's just what you said kind of reminded me of that.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm going to start streaming more, just basically,

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
the whole thing is going to be going back into whatever I happen to make on it.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
We'll be going back into doing stuff for VOG.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Oh, sorry. I was going to say, ironically,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
there was a game today that I saw that I was like, ooh, I want to back that.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
What's that?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It was What the Golf.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
This already sounds like a Loki game.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
It's basically, yeah, it's kind of, you know, it's like,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
this is what, you know, it's time the car should have been,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
but it's basically this golf game by people that hate golf,

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
and it's just the most ridiculous thing.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
It's basically the whole thing is kind of the golf controls,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
where you point a direction and you pull back and click and stuff like that,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
and you try to get to the hole, but they're not really counting strokes.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
It's more of like trying to avoid obstacles and stuff, and it's really silly.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
But yeah, look up What the Golf, everybody. It's awesome.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Okay.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I will get right on that.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I'm right on top of that, Rose.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
I was going to say, though, before somebody points it out

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
and accuses me of being a total hypocrite, which may or may not be true,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I do stream on Twitch occasionally.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I haven't been doing it as much as I'd like,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
but I'm very proud of the fact that I'm juggling three podcasts a week right now.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
So a pro over here, a con over here.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
But when I do stream on Twitch, I do take the tips and I take the subscription,

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
and I'm totally fine with that.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
But I also feel like a tip in that sense is a tip.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
It's a one-time thanks, hi, how you doing, here's some money to support it,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
and I'm literally offering you nothing for that.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Now believe me, I appreciate it deeply,

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
and we do pay money to have the capture card

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
and have the cable running.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
But even deeper than that, for stuff like OLR,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
obviously we need to buy new microphones probably.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
We're getting to that point where these lovely microphones

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
that Brad used to use for Pod Culture,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
some of them are seeing their last day

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
because they get through a lot of use around here,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
so we could probably stand to have some more microphones.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
We do pay a pretty good chunk of, about a video game's worth of money a month

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
to keep the stream up and running, and that's just what I'm paying.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Bobby's paying for the website.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
So your money does get used for good stuff,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
but I'm okay with that because, in a sense,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
you're giving me money for nothing on paper.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
And the rent's for free?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
But your money is being turned around.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Brain went to dire straits, sorry.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
No, no, it's all good. I understand.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Let's see.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Dungeon Buster says, Steam Greenlight.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
According to the wiki, Stardew Valley went to Steam Greenlight,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
and then went into early access for funding.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I thought it was kickstarted at 1.2, though.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Whatever, it's still a great game.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
ActDeftInChat says, It's not my money, it's Amazon or Twitch's Prime.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Well, but that's still, in a way, it is still your money,

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
because you're paying for Prime, but I get it.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I mean, it's like you get all this stuff with Prime,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
and you really should, like, if you guys do have Amazon Prime,

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
you should be giving that free Prime a month to somebody.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Like, obviously, I'd love it if it were me,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
but if it's not, like, give it to, like, I know Flaco does streaming.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Bobby's trying to get affiliate status.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Jamie did get affiliate status.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Like, give your, and even if it's not one of us,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
just a streamer that you like that's working hard,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
please remember to use your sub,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
because they don't do a good job about reminding you, like,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
oh, you have a sub to give away.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It's been 30 days. You have a new sub.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
So, you know, trust me.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
The people really, really appreciate it when you do use your sub.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
If you're using Prime anyway for the shipping stuff

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
or the TV service or whatever, like, just don't forget to give those away.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
If I end up getting that Visual Novel Maker,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
I might stream using the Visual Novel Maker.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Why not? Why not stream making a game?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
That's what I'm kind of thinking about doing,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
except I still need to get the rest of my story.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
And I'm actually planning on streaming doing my webcomic

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
when I do the existential crisis in Animal Crossing.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
One more comment on the Twitch stuff.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, you may not accept our money,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
but you accept our love, appreciation, and occasional meals or drinks

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
when we see you in person.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
I love all that stuff, especially drinks in moderation,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
as I'm doing tonight here on OLR.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Jamie, I didn't really pick your brain on the Kickstarter stuff,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
but have you backed anything in a while, and if so, why or why not?

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
The last thing I backed was my Hataful Boyfriend plushies,

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
and I got them, and they're great, and that's it.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
Dan backed Bloodstained, and I don't think he regrets it.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
We both kind of agree that...

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
Actually, I think I did put that as well so I could get a copy too,

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
but I think we both agreed that it would, you know,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
we'd rather wait for a good finished game.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Sure. That's fair.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah. I don't mind. That money's already gone.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
What's it going to do us now, right?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Well, but at least we still have a game coming,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
but, you know, if you donated to this,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
A, you're not even going to get the game you thought you were getting.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
B, now it's on hiatus.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I mean, we're just hoping at this point it's still going to happen.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
You know, and I'm not trying to be overly negative,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
but it's just the reality is a lot of stuff that gets put on hiatus

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
gets put on hiatus for a long time.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Yeah.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Guys on a show technically is on hiatus.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I would love that for that show to come back,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
but it just, you know, extras going through a lot.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I'm going through a lot, so I just don't know when it's going to be right

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
for that show to come back.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
So that show's also free.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Well, speaking of money and things,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
I would like to take a moment just to thank everyone who donated to my mom.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yes.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
She now has rent for another month,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
and the GoFundMe is still open.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
If anyone wants to contribute, I'll link it in the chat.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
But I really do appreciate it,

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
and listening to my mom cry on the phone instead with happy tears

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
was definitely more what I wanted to hear

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
as opposed to, you know, when she called me after Michael died.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
She just got his ashes.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
So, but yeah, she wanted me to pass on to all of you

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
and how grateful she is to everyone that's contributed to

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
and continues to contribute to her GoFundMe.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
So thanks, everyone, for keeping a roof over my mom's head

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
until the government assistance comes through.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Awesome.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Thank you.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I also want to give a quick shout-out here

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
since we're talking about really good fundraisers.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
So this is one that I actually picked up through my Ingress circles,

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
which, you know, was a game we talked about about a month ago here on the show.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
But this is really funny because I actually met this guy

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
from playing Ingress, but he's actually, like,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
a fairly well-known classic game developer,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and it was one of those things where I was like,

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
oh, I had no idea that is, like, what you did and what you were known for.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
But anyway, his name's Chuck, and he was actually the creator

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
and developer of a game called Chip's Challenge,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
and it was on the Atari Lynx.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Another game.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
So here's the deal.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
There's another Ingress player who,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
she's a single mom raising her kid right now,

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
and she found that she had an Atari Lynx, like, sitting around,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
and she said in one of the Ingress hangouts,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
does anyone want, like, an Atari Lynx?

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
And that kind of started, like, a whole conversation about it,

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
and Chuck was like, well, wait a minute.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Let's, you know, I'll try to, you know, give my little endorsement

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
or whatever to this, and let's try to, like, you know,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
get you some extra money to help out here.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
So they actually put up on eBay.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
It's an Atari Lynx, and it has California games and Chip's Challenge,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
and Chuck is going to autograph the Lynx

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and autograph Chip's Challenge for you,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
and you can see more information about that.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
It is on eBay.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I'll have to post the link in chat.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
It was recently on my Twitter earlier today.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Maybe somebody can dig that up for me.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Do you know what generation of Lynx it is?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
The old one.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Is it?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
It's the original.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Okay, because I can't tell from the picture.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I know because I have an original.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
PAG 0201, tested with two games.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah, we have the newer one.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Okay.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Yeah, but we already have all those games.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
So, anyway, I will definitely,

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
I'm going to work to get Chuck on the show at some point, absolutely.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Cool.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
You know, I wonder if he's been to Atari Party

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
because the name sounds really familiar.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I don't see how he hasn't been.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I mean, if they know he's in Folsom,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
they know that, you know, they probably invited him.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I should have him sign my Lynx.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I need to sell it anyways because I don't play it.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Yeah, but this is for a good cause, Loki.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It's a good cause, too, for me.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Well, I'd have him sign our cartridge, but we play our Lynx sometimes.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Well, I'll ask him next time I see him if he knows about Atari Party.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
So, I see him at least once a month or so for various Ingress events.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
So, I'll ask him if he knows about Atari Party,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
and we'll get him on the show at some point, if he's willing, which I don't...

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I used to play a crap...

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I think he did say he would.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I used to play a crap ton of Chip's Challenge in the,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
was it the Windows Game Pack order they used to have on Windows 3.1?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah, a lot of people kind of talking about that.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
They kind of know the Windows version almost a little bit better,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
but it was, I guess, a Lynx thing because he had a lot to do with Lynx.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
So, anyway, check that out and help out with my books.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That's Windows Air Team Impact. Thank you.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
All right. Thank you, Azette.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Please approve the Lynx that's in our chat.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Thank you, Azette.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
She actually put that in there because Azette is also one of these Ingress folks

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
that knows all of these people involved.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Anyhow, cool, cool.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So, we got the fundraisers out there,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
and we've got our kickoff topic all finished,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
so I think it's time to get into our gaming week.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Just Animal Crossing and Miitomo,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
and I actually didn't play hardly any Ingress,

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
or actually I played Ingress today in the bathroom of the movie theater.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
I had things to your portal at the movie theater.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I was going to say, what did you do, bump the portal?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah, bump the portal.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I didn't even notice.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
A euphemism.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
No, no.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
No. No bumping the portals that way.

25:49.000 --> 25:55.000
But really, it's been kind of a weird week for me,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
so I haven't really gotten to play much.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Although, I installed Secret of Mana because I wanted to stream it,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
but now that 50 million other people are streaming it,

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
I might stream something else.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Sorry about it.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Let you know you're not.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
So, I'm actually thinking of playing the original Secret of Mana

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
either on our cartridge, so we'd have to get up to the CRT

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
to keep it with no delay, or just doing it through the SNES Classic.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
So, Hubby and I are talking about it, but he'd have to be my player two.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
I'm the player one around these parts.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
All right.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
So, if that's it for your gaming week,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
we'll go to Loki with your gaming week.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I mainly played...

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Well, I played a little bit of Stardew Valley.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Not as much as I have been.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
A little bit more of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes,

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
just trying to grind out the last 100% on there

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
so that I can finally stop playing the game

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
because I'm not really enjoying it anymore.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
And then lots of Dance Dance Revolution.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
I've been playing at least 30 minutes a day, an hour yesterday,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
because I have time to do that.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
And then a little bit of Pokémon GO,

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
a little bit of Ingress when I'm out.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
That's pretty much it.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
All right.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Well, I don't usually talk about the Ingress stuff,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
but I did go on about a two-hour bender last night

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
just because we did Rocky Horror on Friday this weekend,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
which isn't the usual night.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
We usually do Saturday.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
So, I was up until 2 a.m. on Fridays,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
so I was kind of up late last night.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
So, I was just like, you know, I'm bored,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
and I don't feel like playing Final Fantasy XIV again.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
So, vroom, vroom. Let's go make green things.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
So, I did that for a little bit.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
But otherwise, I've, of course, been playing Final Fantasy XIV.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I got my Red Mage up to level 60.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I've really enjoyed playing that class in the game.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I really like how the kind of like ping-pong mechanic

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
works in that game.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
You want to jump in here?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Yeah, I just remembered I've been playing WoW.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Oh.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Me talking about MMOs reminded you of MMOs.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Well, yeah, I've been playing A Night Born.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
So.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Okay. Awesome.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I have also been playing a shit ton of Pokémon GO.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh, my God.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Like, just having the gacha, like, I'm able to play a lot.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
And Community Day is coming up this weekend.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
I'll probably play even more then.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
So, yeah.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
What is Community Day?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
So, that's where, that's kind of like what they're trying to do

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
instead of the whole, like, we do a big event in Chicago

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and it melts down everything.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
So, what they did last month is that they set like a three-hour window

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
and they're like, okay, for these three hours,

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
what they did last month is Pikachu is going to spawn everywhere.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
It's going to be like a Pikachu day.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
And for these three hours, it's double XP.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
And I don't remember if they did double Stardust.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
I don't remember.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
But it was something that, it was at least double XP.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
And the amount of shiny Pikachus went way up.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
Like, it was more like a 1 in 64 or a 1 in 128.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
I caught four shiny Pikachus in the three-hour window of Community Day last time.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
So, anyway, the Community Day they're going to do this month is Dratini,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
which is kind of a harder to find one.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
You know, most people in these parts, you know,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
even though we had the Anatolia farm the first two weeks of the game,

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
that's long gone.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
So, anybody getting into the game now,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
usually the only place to go is like Pier 39

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
or you might luck out once in a while in Cameron Lake.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
But otherwise, you have to hatch them, right?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Like, you don't really get Dratini.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
So, this is going to be great for people around the world.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Dratinis are going to spawn everywhere.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
We don't know if shiny Dratini is going to happen,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
but it seems like lately in Pokemon Go with all the events,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
they've been introducing a new shiny.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
Like, they did the Valentine's event where Love Disc was everywhere.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Well, shiny Love Disc was a part of that.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
They rolled out shiny Love Disc with that.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
They just did, they just wrapped up Chinese New Year.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
It's the year of the dog, right?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Oh, that's why those dogs were everywhere.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
Yeah, so Puchina, I think is the name from Gen 3, the gray dog.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Well, the shiny tan dog started showing up.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
So, they've been releasing new shinies with events.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
So, everybody expects that shiny Pink, I think it is Dratini,

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
will start showing up, which means Dragonite and Dragonair,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I think is the middle evolution for that.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
So, all those shinies are going to start.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
People are assuming that part, though.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Niantic has not confirmed that.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
But that's kind of neat if they're rolling out shinies very slowly

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
to correspond with events, because my understanding is that

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
the shinies don't go away just because the event did.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
So, we'll see. We'll see what happens.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Anyway, other stuff I've been playing.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I have also been playing a lot of Heroes of the Storm,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
which has been my every week lately,

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
but I'm still just trying to get my gold so I can buy my new characters.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Been working on that.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
And then this week, I did get that Secret of Mana remake,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
and I did stream it, Jamie, I did stream it on Friday,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
about the first hour, maybe hour and a half of the game.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
I at least got up to the point where you get the girl character

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
to join your party, because I got to name her Jamie.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Because, well, you know, it just makes it,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
if you look at the dialogue, she kind of,

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
she's kind of a little bit, she's kind of mean to the guy,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
and I was like, oh, it's Jamie to me.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I'm not mean.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
No, you're not mean.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Always.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
It's that very, she's just an independent woman

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
who isn't here for your shit.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
So, and that's, that's Jamie.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
So I named Jamie.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
And, of course, of course, when the Sprite joins the party,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I'm going to name the Sprite Loki,

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
although I'd like to do Loki as Tingle, but that might be too long,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
so Dark Soccer has suggested on the Bobby Black Wolf call tonight,

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
I do Lingle, and I'm kind of liking that, so.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
That's so much like Linkle, which is the character now.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Or you could do Logel.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Logel.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I like Lingle.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I like Lingle.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I think I'm going to go with that, so.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Makes me think of Lincoln Berries.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Lincoln Berries are delicious.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
All right.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Anyway, so that was otherwise pretty much my gaming week.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm enjoying the Secret of Mana so far.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
I think the redone music is actually fine.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
I think a lot of the problems I've been reading on the game is that,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
you know, it's just different from the original,

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
and I don't know, like, I'm liking it.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
I get how you can kind of screw up the original when you do a remake.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Like, look at Final Fantasy VI on tablets.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Like, it's bad, right?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
But...

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
Oh, that's too bad they have a bad version of Final Fantasy VI.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Why is that even a thing?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
I don't know.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
It's because they, I think they probably just got the art done really cheap,

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
and it shows.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
I do feel like the Secret of Mana thing kind of looks like it might have been designed with tablets in mind.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
I would not be surprised if this game shows up on tablets eventually,

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
which would be funny, because the original Secret of Mana is already on iOS, at least.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It's got to be on Android, too, if I'm not mistaken.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
But I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up there, too, eventually.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
My only complaint is that there's some really weird things that happen with loading.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Like, every time there's, like, a new texture or something happens,

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
like, there's this little pause, and you could see it on my stream when I was streaming.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
It's like the game would kind of skip a little bit, and that was annoying.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Granted, this is on PC.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
I have been playing the game on PC just because I thought,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
well, I can probably play in a higher resolution than I can on PlayStation 4,

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
and it turns out you can play in a better resolution.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
So I was like, all right, I'll get it on PC.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
How much RAM does your video card have?

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
I don't know. A lot. I need to get a new video card, but my video card's not...

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Remember, I totally redid my computer.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
It doesn't matter. You know what? I should be able to run it anyway.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
I redid my computer, like, two years ago, and it was top of the line then, so...

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
It's just... What it is is it's Square Enix, and they're shitty ports, is what it is.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
But I don't think this is shitty. It's just that's one little hiccup with it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Okay. Unoptimized ports.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Okay, I'll agree with that. Unoptimized. Good.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
All right. I think we're going to get into some of the news.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Usually I would talk about housekeeping here.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
I don't have a whole lot to say besides you follow us on Twitter.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

33:37.000 --> 33:44.000
And we will not be here. The last weekend in March will be gone that week.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
So... But otherwise, we should be here.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
Even though it's killing us, because Dark Soccer and I just found out

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
that Trixie Mattel is going to be here in SAC two weeks from tonight.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Yep.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
But we love y'all so much, we're going to do O-L-R anyway.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
But it's Sunday, March 25th. I'm not going to be here.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
We all need to go to Ready Player One.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
We need to do O-L-R at the movies.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
We haven't done O-L-R at the movies in a while.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
We need to go see Ready Player One.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
I want to see it.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
We all went on a Thruple date to Avatar.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
So let's go see Ready Player One. Let's do it.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Opening night. Yes, let's do it.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
When's opening night?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
I hate seeing movies opening night.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
I hate opening night.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
But I'll do it.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Whatever, I'm going to go see opening night.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
It's the one reason I haven't gone to see Black Panther.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Yeah, we're waiting a couple of weeks to go see it.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
It's like, I just saw Lady Bird today.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
That movie's been out for like three months.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
I'll see Black Panther in May.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
For opening nights, I have to get off work.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Oh, yeah.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Because I work late.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
We'll try to make something work.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Alright, anyways.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Alright.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah, let's do it.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Let's get into the news.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Start us off with some gaming news, Logie.

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
THQ Nordic announced today that they had purchased Koch Media.

34:55.000 --> 35:02.600
So, if you may not know, Koch owned the rights to Saints Row, Metro, and Dead Island, which

35:02.600 --> 35:08.000
were previously owned by the old THQ, which went bankrupt and sold off all their assets.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
So it's like THQ buying old THQ stuff.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So now it's back under THQ Nordic again.

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
So it's like they went back to the pawn shop and bought their ring that they had pawned

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
a few weeks ago.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Sort of, yes.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Okay.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Yeah, so it's like it's back now.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
But, I mean, technically it's kind of new people, but it's just kind of interesting

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
how it's kind of moved in that.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Yeah.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
It is interesting.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
I watched a little video today about Saints Row and this guy's essay about why the franchise

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
just kind of died, and I completely agree with all of it.

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
It's basically just, especially like they're talking about, see, I can't even remember

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
their stupid game that they had.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Not Saints Row game.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
That's whatever.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
It's so, so good.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Agents of Mayhem.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Agents of Mayhem.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Thank you.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Yes.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
It was so good that the name just really stuck in my brain.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Yes.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
Agents of Mayhem was supposed to be this thing that was completely a brand new IP.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, they couldn't get away from Saints Row.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
And really, with Saints Row, it's always been kind of like a copycat game where originally

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
it's like, okay, yeah, it's this game that's going to be kind of like Grand Theft Auto

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
San Andreas, and then it kind of went over the top.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
And it's like, well, now Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5 are out.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
And it's like, well, shit, what are we going to do?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Let's just go more over the top.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
And it just didn't work.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
It just, it kind of lost sight of what it was supposed to be.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
And now that he tried to do this spinoff.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
I did love the over-the-topness of Saints Row, but to be fair, I don't even remember

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
if I started four.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
I mean, I love three.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
I laughed so fucking hard at three.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
No, three was good.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Three was all right.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
There was some room for improvement, but it was okay.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
I liked that game.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
That was fine.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
That skydiving sequence.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
I cried.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Yeah.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
I cried from laughing so hard.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
Four, though, was just like, they basically slapped it.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
It was the time that basically they were getting, from what I hear, it was they were getting

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
pressured because originally four was supposed to be DLC for three.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
And it's very obvious that it was.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
And they're like, well, instead of putting out DLC, you need to flush it out into a full

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
game and make that its own game.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
And that was kind of a problem.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.000
PJ Technomage in our chat at live.vognetware.com says, I've never finished a single Saints

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Row game.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Yeah, you and me both.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
But I have this problem inherently with all games.

37:28.000 --> 37:34.000
Like if I finish a video game, that is really a testament because I am definitely the type

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
of person that's like, I'm going to play this game.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
I'm going to play this game.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Ooh, shiny!

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Something new is out.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Have you played Grand Theft Auto 5 yet?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I did, but I didn't beat it.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
That's for sure.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
I should play it more.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
But I at least started it.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
That's something.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
That's something.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
I have actually finished all of the Saints Row games, so I can say that.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
But then my problem is fucking MMOs.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
It's weird because I'll keep playing MMOs forever and ever, even though you can't beat

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
it.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
But it's something about that social element.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Like, that's the thing.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
The social element can't be beat.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
And I think when I have played more console games, like, oh, here's a great example.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Mass Effect 3, right?

38:09.000 --> 38:15.000
I beat that entire fucking trilogy, and that's a great testament to how good those games

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
were, right?

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
But then Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, I still played for a very long time, but that's because

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
I had a lot of friends that were playing it.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
It was a social thing.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I remember a problem with Saints Row 3.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
That's right.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
Saints Row 3, I thought, was a spoiler, but it's been out forever.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
They kill off the big bad guy in the beginning pretty fast.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Like he's just knocked out.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
And just in a really shitty way, it's just like, and now he's dead.

38:42.000 --> 38:50.000
And then this other guy that's not quite as good as the main bad guy becomes the big bad

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
guy, and then you fight him a bunch of times, and it was just kind of, eh, it's lame.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
But then they tried to do too much, too.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
They just threw everything together that didn't necessarily fit.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
It was like, now there's zombies for no reason.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Now there's this.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Now there's this.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
It's just, it didn't quite work.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Interesting conversation in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
Vidpower says, we all have those comfort games that we keep playing despite new games coming

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
out.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
And PJ Technomage says, civilization for me.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
That's another one, though, that can be very social.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
Like the easiest way to pull me back into civilization is some of my Bay Area friends

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
going, we randomly decided to play Civilization 4 tonight.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
We did.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Cool.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
And then now I'm up until 3 a.m. playing Civilization.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Those games, you know, they don't end.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
I haven't gotten into Civilization yet.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Oh, they're so good.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
That's probably a good thing.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Isn't Civ 4 free on Twitch Prime, question mark?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I have them in my library.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Okay.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Here in my Steam library.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
I've got, I may have Civ 5.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
I bought the Civilization Humble Bundle a while back.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Chatters, where's Civ 4 free right now?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
I swear I saw something on that.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Is Rageinator here?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
He knows where the free games are.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I swear I saw Civ 4 free somewhere.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
It wasn't GOG.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
I know GOG's been giving away a lot of free stuff lately, but it was somewhere else that

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
was giving it away.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
I think it was Twitch Prime.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I really feel like it was that.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
But I hope, you know, I know the new Metro game's coming out.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Thank you.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Act F confirmed it.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Thank you.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Thanks, Chatters.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.720
The new Metro game looks pretty nice, so that's going to be something that's coming out.

40:17.720 --> 40:21.720
And I really do hope that there is a new Saints Row someday.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.520
Just stop it with the Agents of Mayhem thing.

40:23.520 --> 40:27.040
That just did not work at all.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.000
But I would like a new Saints Row game.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
Well, another game that maybe folks will be looking forward to.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.080
How about a non-EA Star Wars game?

40:36.080 --> 40:44.720
So this is some pretty big fallout from the loot box controversy that kind of shot Battlefront

40:44.720 --> 40:45.720
in the foot.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.400
Now, I do want to stress this is a rumor.

40:48.400 --> 40:53.240
I will tend to cover these a little more on a slower news week, which this week has been.

40:53.240 --> 40:56.480
So again, take it with a grain of salt.

40:56.480 --> 41:02.760
But the word going around is that EA is, or excuse me, I'm sorry, Disney is rumored to

41:02.760 --> 41:07.480
be speaking with two other developers besides EA.

41:07.480 --> 41:11.440
These developers are Ubisoft and Activision.

41:11.440 --> 41:15.480
What I also found interesting about this is that the outlet that I saw this on that's

41:15.480 --> 41:18.520
reporting this is My Nintendo News.

41:18.520 --> 41:22.140
And one interesting thing they're saying about the Ubisoft and Activision partnership is

41:22.140 --> 41:26.680
that if one of these two were to go through, we'd be likely to get the Star Wars games

41:26.680 --> 41:33.200
on the Nintendo Switch, which I thought was a very interesting kind of tongue in cheek

41:33.200 --> 41:38.680
little thing there because we all know that EA kind of left Nintendo at the altar with

41:38.680 --> 41:40.180
the Wii U, right?

41:40.260 --> 41:43.660
They got up on stage at that E3 and they're like, fuck yeah, we're going to support the

41:43.660 --> 41:44.660
Wii U.

41:44.660 --> 41:49.260
And then they put out, you know, some pretty shoddy ports of year old games and they were

41:49.260 --> 41:51.660
like, wow, none of these things are selling.

41:51.660 --> 41:52.820
We don't know why they're not.

41:52.820 --> 41:54.940
The Wii U is a disaster, everybody.

41:54.940 --> 41:56.020
What's going on?

41:56.020 --> 42:01.420
And then EA just left Nintendo at the altar and EA hasn't really supported the Switch

42:01.420 --> 42:02.420
with the same intensity.

42:02.420 --> 42:05.460
I realize they're kind of throwing the Switch a bone here and there with like FIFA ports

42:05.460 --> 42:10.140
and stuff, but they're not as invested in the Switch as say Ubisoft is right now.

42:10.220 --> 42:19.140
So isn't that interesting that perhaps Disney wants to let Ubisoft make a Star Wars game

42:19.140 --> 42:24.020
because that would mean a Star Wars game on the Nintendo Switch, which is kind of the

42:24.020 --> 42:25.340
hot console right now.

42:25.340 --> 42:29.240
I realize there's a lot of love out there for PlayStation 4 and some for the Xbox One

42:29.240 --> 42:33.640
X and PC stuff as well, but certainly the Switch is growing and growing.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.020
It's already outsold the Wii U completely.

42:36.020 --> 42:39.700
And I think there's a lot of people that would like to see a Star Wars game on the Switch.

42:40.140 --> 42:43.260
Nintendo doesn't have the online system to support loot boxes very well.

42:43.260 --> 42:48.140
They want to tap that younger audience so that they can be involved in all Star Wars

42:48.140 --> 42:49.140
things.

42:49.140 --> 42:50.140
Sure.

42:50.140 --> 42:55.140
So, uh, yeah, I, I'd be very interested to see what happens with all this.

42:55.140 --> 43:01.260
And it's also kind of fascinating that EA might lose their exclusive hold on Star Wars

43:01.260 --> 43:02.780
over what happened in Battlefront.

43:02.780 --> 43:07.660
Like we're starting to see the results of all that bad press.

43:07.660 --> 43:11.340
So as they should, it's been mismanaged for two games now.

43:11.340 --> 43:12.340
Yeah.

43:12.340 --> 43:13.340
So ouch.

43:13.340 --> 43:19.220
Jamie, would you, would you be interested in a Star Wars game from Ubisoft on the Switch?

43:19.220 --> 43:22.580
I haven't been interested in a Star Wars game in a very long time, Rob.

43:22.580 --> 43:24.740
Since 1981 in vector graphics.

43:24.740 --> 43:25.740
Not even then.

43:25.740 --> 43:26.740
What?

43:26.740 --> 43:27.740
I love that game.

43:27.740 --> 43:28.740
Oh my God.

43:28.740 --> 43:31.100
Did you know, and I didn't even know this tangent time, slow news week.

43:31.100 --> 43:34.940
I'm talking about like super return of the Jedi tangent train pulling into the station.

43:34.940 --> 43:35.940
Choo choo.

43:35.940 --> 43:36.940
Okay.

43:37.220 --> 43:41.780
Um, I didn't even know this in old town sack because, um, some friends were visiting from

43:41.780 --> 43:42.780
out of town.

43:42.780 --> 43:46.700
So I did the tourist thing and I went to old town sack with them this weekend, right there.

43:46.700 --> 43:49.700
They have a classic game arcade in this toy shop.

43:49.700 --> 43:50.820
I didn't even know.

43:50.820 --> 43:54.380
Was there a, I didn't even know there was a toy shop in old town now be there's a classic

43:54.380 --> 43:55.380
arcade in the back.

43:55.380 --> 43:58.580
I remember in toy shop being there, but I didn't know they had a, it's small.

43:58.580 --> 44:04.020
It's like one tiny little room, but the reason why I bring it up, they had a star Wars machine,

44:04.020 --> 44:06.620
original vectors, graphics, right?

44:06.620 --> 44:08.580
50 cents a play.

44:08.580 --> 44:13.540
And tiger claws entirely wrong says that I'm more of a star Trek fan than a star Wars fan.

44:13.540 --> 44:14.540
You are wrong.

44:14.540 --> 44:20.080
They have a classic arcade down in, uh, I am a doctor who fan and that's classic doctor

44:20.080 --> 44:22.080
who.

44:22.080 --> 44:26.660
And also for the record, star Wars was the first movie I had ever been taken to.

44:26.660 --> 44:28.860
I was nine months old.

44:28.860 --> 44:33.700
So you cannot say that star Trek is bigger in my heart than star Wars.

44:33.700 --> 44:35.060
You can say that about me.

44:35.060 --> 44:40.260
I like, I prefer Star Trek assumptions when you know nothing Jon Snow, but I don't, I

44:40.260 --> 44:41.820
don't hate star Wars by any means.

44:41.820 --> 44:42.820
I like star Wars a lot.

44:42.820 --> 44:46.620
I still need to see episode eight, but again, I just saw lady bird today.

44:46.620 --> 44:48.620
So maybe we'll go see episode eight next week.

44:48.620 --> 44:49.660
Lady bird was great.

44:49.660 --> 44:51.200
Is episode eight still playing anywhere?

44:51.200 --> 44:52.200
It's gotta be somewhere.

44:52.200 --> 44:58.260
Um, sunrise mall, sunrise doesn't have a really, I don't think, you know, I looked there.

44:58.260 --> 45:01.780
I honestly looked at the movies playing there calling it by those numbers.

45:01.780 --> 45:02.780
All right.

45:02.860 --> 45:06.220
Well, anyway, uh, so, but I like star Trek a lot.

45:06.220 --> 45:08.420
In fact, what am I going to do tonight?

45:08.420 --> 45:10.020
There's no discovery to watch tonight.

45:10.020 --> 45:12.820
I'm a little, what do I do with myself?

45:12.820 --> 45:15.700
You can watch the new episodes of queer eye, which are all right.

45:15.700 --> 45:22.860
But there's one that more, um, mortified is really good on, um, I forget that you and

45:22.860 --> 45:25.660
the wife like super dig queer eye for the straight guy.

45:25.660 --> 45:27.100
I don't like the new series.

45:27.100 --> 45:28.100
Okay.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.100
Really?

45:29.100 --> 45:30.100
You're the first person I've heard say that they don't like the new one.

45:30.420 --> 45:37.180
Well, yes, that that's one, but two it's, they're like in the original queer eye, it

45:37.180 --> 45:42.260
was really kind of Carson was kind of the only one that was like annoying, I guess sometimes

45:42.260 --> 45:46.420
like he was just kind of would play up stuff and it'd be ridiculous and all that.

45:46.420 --> 45:51.980
But in the new series, all of them do it and it's, it's so irritating and annoying that

45:51.980 --> 45:57.780
they just waste so much time and it's just like go on these tangent things in the show.

45:57.780 --> 46:01.820
It's like, okay dude, tone it down as a smidge.

46:01.820 --> 46:03.700
It's just a little much, man.

46:03.700 --> 46:09.660
I hate it when my favorite shows go on tangents anyway.

46:09.660 --> 46:14.340
Let's get next to go to our next, at least I'm not sitting, you know, here simulating

46:14.340 --> 46:16.660
childbirth like they did in the show.

46:16.660 --> 46:21.620
That was something that they did in the show while this guy's Lee next to them going, dude,

46:21.620 --> 46:23.020
what the fuck did I sign up for?

46:23.020 --> 46:25.220
Like seriously, what the fuck is going on here?

46:28.100 --> 46:32.380
To register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry radio at vog network.com

46:32.380 --> 46:34.060
use the pass phrase father.

46:34.060 --> 46:36.020
All right, let's go to our next story.

46:36.020 --> 46:37.820
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

46:37.820 --> 46:39.460
Oh God.

46:39.460 --> 46:45.180
So sorry people who got certain copies of Bayonetta two on switch because the download

46:45.180 --> 46:48.380
codes were mis-parented.

46:48.380 --> 46:50.740
Oopsies.

46:50.740 --> 46:57.760
It was a download code to get Bayonetta one and some of these codes were printed incorrectly.

46:57.760 --> 47:04.240
So if it happened to you and you're listening and you hear this, go to support.nintendo.com

47:04.240 --> 47:08.040
and report it so that you can get your proper code.

47:08.040 --> 47:17.240
Um, it also said that you can call the Nintendo contact center at 800-255-3700, which when

47:17.240 --> 47:22.840
I was a kid, it was long distance and you had to talk to a game counselor, dude.

47:22.840 --> 47:23.840
They were fun though.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.680
I talked to all kinds of cool people who was some temp with a giant binder.

47:26.680 --> 47:32.200
My grandma was like, why are you calling, uh, why are you, why are you calling Washington?

47:32.200 --> 47:38.800
Um, reasons, but yeah, and it didn't have the internet back then and it's not particular

47:38.800 --> 47:39.800
batches of it.

47:39.800 --> 47:42.800
They went to certain retailers, they are multiple batches.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.800
So it's just a odd misprint.

47:44.800 --> 47:48.080
So if it happened to you, you're not alone.

47:48.080 --> 47:51.860
Well I need to try my ice, my Bayonetta is still in the box cause I'm kind of waiting

47:51.860 --> 47:55.920
on it until I have had my fill of secret of mana streaming and then I'm going to go over

47:55.920 --> 47:57.000
to Bayonetta.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.640
So I haven't, I should try to cash in my code.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.520
I wouldn't want to get left out in the cold.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.000
Thou shalt do such a thing.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.720
I would be very sad if I got shut out of drinking my shot of wine now.

48:07.720 --> 48:08.720
That's right.

48:08.720 --> 48:12.820
If you're just joining us, uh, it is national wine day, uh, the 18th here.

48:12.820 --> 48:16.960
So we're, if I seem a little out of it tonight, it's because I'm now two glasses in.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.960
Cheers.

48:19.960 --> 48:23.160
Three sheets to the wind, three sheets to the wind.

48:23.160 --> 48:25.400
No, my wine does not come in a box.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.920
No, it's, it's frivolous.

48:26.920 --> 48:27.920
It's delicious.

48:27.920 --> 48:28.920
No judgment.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.480
If you change their bottles, Robin, that makes me sad in my heart.

48:31.480 --> 48:33.480
Why did they change the bottles?

48:33.480 --> 48:35.100
But I don't know.

48:35.100 --> 48:37.340
This is delicious and I miss being able to drink.

48:37.340 --> 48:38.340
We fear change.

48:38.340 --> 48:39.340
All right.

48:39.340 --> 48:40.340
Loki.

48:40.340 --> 48:41.340
Next story.

48:41.340 --> 48:47.440
So kind of the topic of Star Wars Battlefront and the whole loot box controversy, Senator

48:47.440 --> 48:52.360
Maggie Hassan, the New Hampshire Democrat Senator.

48:52.360 --> 48:59.160
She wrote an open letter to the ESRB, urging them to review the completeness of the board's

48:59.160 --> 49:04.600
rating process and policies as they relate to loot boxes and then taking into account

49:04.600 --> 49:08.500
the potential harm these microtransactions may have on children.

49:08.500 --> 49:15.080
Of course, you know, the ESRB has made comment regarding, um, loot boxes in the past being

49:15.080 --> 49:19.980
that they don't really see the harm in it, but then again, you know, this is funded by

49:19.980 --> 49:24.300
the ESA, which is backing the games industry.

49:24.300 --> 49:29.100
And of course, you know, the games industry is making several billions of dollars off

49:29.100 --> 49:31.860
of these types of loot boxes and stuff.

49:31.860 --> 49:35.860
And so they don't want to see that cash cow go away.

49:35.860 --> 49:36.860
So it's going to be interesting.

49:36.860 --> 49:43.640
I see this as more of like, Hey, maybe you should take a look at this and consider regulating

49:43.640 --> 49:48.580
it because if you don't, yeah, we're going to, no, I, and that's really fascinating to

49:48.580 --> 49:53.700
me that, you know, now we have a, uh, say Senator or, or representative Senator.

49:53.700 --> 49:54.700
Okay.

49:54.700 --> 49:59.900
So that you have this Senator basically going with the ESRB saying, you might want to read

49:59.900 --> 50:02.820
about that thing you said about loot boxes not being a problem yet.

50:02.820 --> 50:05.060
You might want to reevaluate that.

50:05.060 --> 50:09.940
And that is definitely the equivalent of like a verbal warning.

50:09.940 --> 50:14.300
So I mean, that, that really says to me that the ESRB is under a lot of pressure to self

50:14.300 --> 50:18.260
regulate this because certainly she is not the first Senator to know.

50:18.260 --> 50:19.260
She's not.

50:19.260 --> 50:22.100
In fact, a lot of this has been on the state level.

50:22.100 --> 50:25.940
Is this, is she a state Senator or is she a national Senator thinks she's a state Senator.

50:25.940 --> 50:26.940
Okay.

50:26.940 --> 50:30.420
So still a lot of it's only been on the state level, but it's really just a matter of time

50:30.420 --> 50:31.420
before that buzz.

50:31.420 --> 50:34.900
Of course that would require our Congress to actually do something, but that's a whole

50:34.900 --> 50:36.140
nother tangent for another day.

50:36.140 --> 50:40.420
You could be done on the state levels if they have regulations on the state levels and how

50:40.420 --> 50:44.940
are you going to, I mean, that's still going to affect something if, if they go through.

50:44.940 --> 50:49.620
Because remember California passed something and that ended up getting overturned by the

50:49.620 --> 50:50.980
Supreme court in the end.

50:50.980 --> 50:55.820
Although I would say the whole loot box thing is all violent video was about the violent

50:55.820 --> 50:56.820
video game.

50:56.820 --> 51:02.300
And the fact that the standard was very nebulous when there already is an ESRB, which I am

51:02.300 --> 51:06.040
pretty sure was called out in the Supreme court decision that there was an ESRB, which

51:06.040 --> 51:10.420
is even more of the reason why, you know, a lot of these, you know, political folks

51:10.420 --> 51:14.980
look to the ESRB to regulate and fucking handle this stuff.

51:14.980 --> 51:17.380
Like it's your job to fix this.

51:17.380 --> 51:18.660
It's essentially what's being said.

51:18.660 --> 51:23.860
Well, at the same time, you know, like aside from, you know, government stepping in all

51:23.860 --> 51:29.060
this, it's just people that are consumers of these games have to consider that if you

51:29.060 --> 51:32.960
don't want this kind of stuff in these games, you know, bite the bullet and just don't buy

51:32.960 --> 51:34.020
the game.

51:34.020 --> 51:38.380
Like I was interested in Star Wars Battlefront because I wanted to try the single player

51:38.380 --> 51:42.300
campaign, which apparently was not very good.

51:42.300 --> 51:46.060
And then the whole loot box thing on top of that, I was like, well shit, I'm just not

51:46.060 --> 51:47.540
going to buy it.

51:47.540 --> 51:53.220
So I spoke with my wallet, but you know, like if there's say Grand Theft Auto six comes

51:53.220 --> 52:00.280
out and it's just loot box shit, like all it's just loot boxes, just integrated entirely

52:00.280 --> 52:01.280
in the game.

52:01.280 --> 52:04.940
It's just obstructive, just like it is with Battlefront.

52:04.940 --> 52:08.340
Then maybe I'll have to pass.

52:08.340 --> 52:12.700
Well hopefully something they don't throw into loot boxes in the future is better graphics,

52:12.700 --> 52:15.740
but I think it's only a matter of time, right?

52:15.740 --> 52:17.940
You unlocked HD textures!

52:17.940 --> 52:21.860
They have textures, you unlocked skins, so.

52:21.860 --> 52:23.420
There's a big difference though, Loki, with that.

52:23.420 --> 52:25.100
The cosmetics are one thing.

52:25.100 --> 52:29.380
But anyway, the whole reason I make a silly transition like that is because over on the

52:29.380 --> 52:35.860
Xbox One X and the Xbox One S, 1440p support is coming in the near future.

52:35.860 --> 52:40.780
This is from Kevin Gamill, who's the program manager for Microsoft's Xbox platform partner

52:40.780 --> 52:47.240
group, and a tweet said, many questions recently around the timing of our 1440p support.

52:47.240 --> 52:51.540
Those of you in our early preview ring should be pleasantly surprised very soon if you have

52:51.540 --> 52:56.780
an Xbox One S or an Xbox One X, meaning that that support is coming very soon.

52:56.780 --> 53:01.760
Now you might be thinking, well what's the big deal because the Xbox One X does 4K gaming,

53:01.760 --> 53:03.580
so who gives a shit about 1440p?

53:03.580 --> 53:09.300
Well, you may notice I included the Xbox One S in that, which right now doesn't really

53:09.300 --> 53:14.580
support 1440p, but it sounds like it will, however, I do need to stress, and this is

53:14.580 --> 53:21.700
a big however, the 1440p for gaming is not going to be something for Xbox One S. I'm

53:21.700 --> 53:26.900
assuming that is the interface, so we'll look a little crisper, and maybe some of the, maybe

53:26.900 --> 53:31.380
like video playback and things like that, if you have a video that supports it.

53:31.380 --> 53:34.300
Are there TVs out there that support 1440p?

53:34.300 --> 53:35.660
I thought it was like computer monitors.

53:35.660 --> 53:40.580
Yeah, I think it's more computer monitors that support it, but the only 4K device in

53:40.580 --> 53:44.700
my house is a computer monitor, so I'm sure there's some people out there that do have...

53:44.700 --> 53:49.180
I just thought, like, you know, if it's a 4K TV, why would you want to output the 1440p?

53:49.180 --> 53:53.740
Well, maybe you have a 4K TV, but you only have an Xbox One S.

53:53.740 --> 53:58.340
I have a 4K TV and I don't have anything to utilize it other than the regular high def.

53:58.340 --> 54:02.940
So if, hypothetically, you have an Xbox One S, which is weird that the older Xboxes won't

54:02.940 --> 54:03.940
support it.

54:03.940 --> 54:08.340
Well, I look forward to those online advertisements and extra clarity.

54:08.340 --> 54:14.000
The only thing that I'm going to get 4K right now is when I get my 4K Apple TV, which, by

54:14.000 --> 54:17.540
the way, you can play Sonic CD on it.

54:17.540 --> 54:20.180
I keep forgetting there's games on Apple TV.

54:20.180 --> 54:21.180
And they're fun.

54:21.180 --> 54:26.220
I bought a controller, the SteelSeries controller to use on my Apple TV, and we freaking played

54:26.220 --> 54:28.420
through Sonic CD together on the Apple TV.

54:28.420 --> 54:29.660
Is there a lot of stuff on that?

54:29.660 --> 54:34.380
I haven't looked lately, but I just cared because I already owned Sonic CD, so I just

54:34.380 --> 54:35.380
installed it.

54:35.380 --> 54:38.340
I know there was that random harmonics game that was, like, only on Apple TV.

54:38.340 --> 54:39.340
Yeah.

54:39.340 --> 54:40.340
I never saw it anywhere else.

54:40.340 --> 54:41.340
That we immediately forgot about.

54:41.340 --> 54:45.140
Yeah, well, I personally just don't have an Apple TV, but for me...

54:45.140 --> 54:46.860
I'd sell you mine when I buy my new one.

54:46.860 --> 54:48.940
Well, my game consoles do everything.

54:48.940 --> 54:50.860
What's my Apple TV going to do?

54:50.860 --> 54:52.300
Drag Race.

54:52.300 --> 54:54.340
Actually, I may...

54:54.340 --> 54:55.820
Is there a VH1 app or something?

54:55.820 --> 54:58.140
No, I just have bought the season.

54:58.140 --> 54:59.820
Oh, I use...

54:59.820 --> 55:03.780
It's the one thing that I can actually use the Xfinity on demand for, is I can watch

55:03.780 --> 55:08.860
All Stars 3 at five o'clock, because you can get it as soon as it hits the East Coast.

55:08.860 --> 55:12.260
I just usually watch it the next day after everyone spoiled it for me.

55:12.260 --> 55:13.260
Annoying.

55:13.260 --> 55:17.140
All right, let's move on to another story.

55:17.140 --> 55:18.940
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

55:18.940 --> 55:21.460
Well, I was disappointed that I had no Bitcoin.

55:21.460 --> 55:22.460
I thought I had one.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.460
Yeah, I was going to ask whatever happened with that.

55:24.460 --> 55:25.460
I thought I had it.

55:25.620 --> 55:29.540
I thought you had like 25 Bitcoin, and I was like, bitch, you're a millionaire.

55:29.540 --> 55:30.740
Well, I thought that I did.

55:30.740 --> 55:31.740
That was an error.

55:31.740 --> 55:32.740
Of course.

55:32.740 --> 55:33.740
And it was...

55:33.740 --> 55:34.740
You would have needed it.

55:34.740 --> 55:35.740
Yeah.

55:35.740 --> 55:37.740
If she didn't sell it that week, I told her, then now she'd be a thousandaire.

55:37.740 --> 55:41.340
And then it was like, it ended up, I had like a Dogecoin.

55:41.340 --> 55:44.260
Oh, you had the Dogecoin.

55:44.260 --> 55:45.620
That's so worth something, isn't it?

55:45.620 --> 55:48.100
They gave away a ton of Dogecoin at Gamers.

55:48.100 --> 55:51.260
I think the value of Dogecoin went way up.

55:51.260 --> 55:53.300
Like it was worth like next to nothing.

55:53.300 --> 55:55.380
And now maybe it's a nickel.

55:55.380 --> 55:56.380
No.

55:56.380 --> 55:57.380
At any rate...

55:57.380 --> 55:58.380
You have a fucking Litecoin.

55:58.380 --> 56:02.940
Well, and it took me like an hour to get back into my old wallet because it was the old

56:02.940 --> 56:04.500
style wallet.

56:04.500 --> 56:06.780
Even I think I have Dogecoin too.

56:06.780 --> 56:09.460
Well, I'm not worried.

56:09.460 --> 56:11.340
Fuck if I know how to get in my wallet.

56:11.340 --> 56:14.980
Well, I figured out how to get back into my Bitcoin wallet.

56:14.980 --> 56:15.980
And that was interesting.

56:15.980 --> 56:16.980
Oh, I don't have Bitcoin.

56:16.980 --> 56:17.980
Because you had to...

56:17.980 --> 56:18.980
Thankfully, I don't.

56:19.140 --> 56:22.620
You had to do like these words and they had to be perfect.

56:22.620 --> 56:23.620
Oh, wow.

56:23.620 --> 56:30.060
But anyway, if anyone is regretting their lack of Bitcoin right now, there is a game

56:30.060 --> 56:37.300
that is offering a shot at winning one Bitcoin, which is about 10 grand.

56:37.300 --> 56:39.380
The game is on Steam for $1.99.

56:39.380 --> 56:42.460
And actually it's on sale on the release date for 40% off.

56:42.460 --> 56:43.460
You can get it for $1.19.

56:43.460 --> 56:47.620
But it's called Monte Crypto, the Bitcoin Enigma.

56:47.620 --> 56:50.980
It looks like it's first person and has 24 puzzles.

56:50.980 --> 56:56.420
But the first person to beat it will win one Bitcoin.

56:56.420 --> 56:58.300
So hey, you want 10 grand?

56:58.300 --> 57:01.380
Play this game that they're trying to bribe you to play.

57:01.380 --> 57:03.660
I don't think Bitcoin is still worth 10 grand.

57:03.660 --> 57:05.500
I think Bitcoin came down a bit.

57:05.500 --> 57:06.660
But maybe it'll go back up.

57:06.660 --> 57:07.660
I don't know.

57:07.660 --> 57:12.220
Like, it's so hard to fucking know these days what's going to happen with the cryptocurrency.

57:12.220 --> 57:13.860
It's been pretty volatile.

57:13.860 --> 57:14.860
Yeah.

57:14.860 --> 57:15.860
Who cares?

57:15.900 --> 57:17.460
It's more than the price of the game.

57:17.460 --> 57:18.580
You still end up in positive.

57:18.580 --> 57:19.580
Yeah, fair enough.

57:19.580 --> 57:23.420
But they'd have to sell, even at that rate, because this is at the time the article was

57:23.420 --> 57:26.820
printed, they'd have to sell 5,000 copies of the game.

57:26.820 --> 57:28.540
So good luck.

57:28.540 --> 57:29.820
It has a fun name.

57:29.820 --> 57:31.260
I like Monte Cristo sandwiches.

57:31.260 --> 57:33.420
Oh, Bobby tells me I'm wrong.

57:33.420 --> 57:34.420
There's a big surprise.

57:34.420 --> 57:38.140
And that Bitcoin is $10,566 right now.

57:38.140 --> 57:44.220
I swear I saw just in the last week it had dropped to like $600 or something like that.

57:44.220 --> 57:46.140
No, maybe $6,000 or something.

57:46.140 --> 57:47.660
I thought it dropped a lot.

57:47.660 --> 57:48.660
Yes, girl.

57:48.660 --> 57:49.660
Okay.

57:49.660 --> 57:50.660
It's that volatile.

57:50.660 --> 57:51.660
Okay.

57:51.660 --> 57:52.660
So I'm not crazy.

57:52.660 --> 57:53.660
It has been going up and down like a lot.

57:53.660 --> 57:54.660
Okay.

57:54.660 --> 57:55.660
All right.

57:55.660 --> 57:56.660
Okay.

57:56.660 --> 57:57.660
Thank you.

57:57.660 --> 57:58.660
Chatters.

57:58.660 --> 57:59.660
Chatters are meeting me halfway.

57:59.660 --> 58:01.220
Yes, it did go down, but it went back up.

58:01.220 --> 58:06.460
You know, though, if I had had Bitcoin and I sold it when the whole thing was going down

58:06.460 --> 58:11.100
and I had a million bucks, do you know that you can technically live off the interest

58:11.100 --> 58:14.300
of a million dollars and not have to work?

58:14.300 --> 58:15.300
You have to live frugal frugally.

58:15.300 --> 58:16.300
Yeah.

58:16.300 --> 58:18.580
I was gonna say, can you still do it in today's standards?

58:18.580 --> 58:23.020
Like I know that's something you used to be able to do, but like it takes more to live

58:23.020 --> 58:27.060
on in this day and age than it used to, but what I would do is I would actually pay off

58:27.060 --> 58:33.460
my house and then I would find a part time job and write a book.

58:33.460 --> 58:35.540
I don't know if I could ever not work.

58:35.540 --> 58:36.540
Okay.

58:36.540 --> 58:37.540
You ready?

58:37.540 --> 58:38.540
You ready for another tangent train?

58:39.180 --> 58:42.340
Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, slow news week tangent train, choo choo.

58:42.340 --> 58:45.340
And this story literally involves trains.

58:45.340 --> 58:47.380
Oh, that's cause you went to the train museum.

58:47.380 --> 58:48.380
I did.

58:48.380 --> 58:49.840
Again, I had friends from out of town.

58:49.840 --> 58:50.840
Is PJ still listening?

58:50.840 --> 58:51.840
Hello.

58:51.840 --> 58:52.840
Hiya.

58:52.840 --> 58:53.840
If Kevin's out there too.

58:53.840 --> 58:54.840
Hi.

58:54.840 --> 58:55.840
Hello.

58:55.840 --> 58:56.840
Hello.

58:56.840 --> 58:57.840
Uh, so they were visiting from out of town.

58:57.840 --> 58:59.820
So we went to old town and we went to the train museum because PJ is a fan of trains.

58:59.820 --> 59:03.260
You know, the train museum is the first time I ever saw a midnight person in person.

59:03.260 --> 59:04.260
No.

59:04.260 --> 59:05.260
True story.

59:05.260 --> 59:06.260
Anyway.

59:06.340 --> 59:11.860
So anyway, I went, I went to the train museum and one thing I forgot like about the train

59:11.860 --> 59:14.820
museum is that, you know, you can actually like, well, I didn't forget that you could

59:14.820 --> 59:18.500
walk into the trains, but as you do walk into the trains, there's actually people sitting

59:18.500 --> 59:22.820
there that work for the museum in the trains just to make sure you're not horsing around

59:22.820 --> 59:26.420
or trying to ruin anything, you know, protecting the integrity of the exhibits or like one

59:26.420 --> 59:32.020
of the ladies that was policing the dining car, she would actually play the dining chimes

59:32.020 --> 59:33.020
every few minutes.

59:33.020 --> 59:34.020
Cool.

59:34.020 --> 59:36.500
And she'd be like, and look what else you can play with the chimes.

59:36.500 --> 59:40.820
And she'd go, she played the NBC theme with the chimes.

59:40.820 --> 59:41.820
Funny.

59:41.820 --> 59:42.820
So anyway.

59:42.820 --> 59:43.820
Who remembers that?

59:43.820 --> 59:44.820
Silly stuff.

59:44.820 --> 59:46.780
But the reason why I say that and how it relates to what you were just saying is I was thinking,

59:46.780 --> 59:48.660
you know what?

59:48.660 --> 59:51.940
That's going to be me when I'm like 75, not that I'm literally going to work at the train

59:51.940 --> 59:58.820
museum, but I would bet I'm going to end up at some museum, like part time, like teaching

59:58.820 --> 01:00:03.160
people about that, doing like that volunteer stuff, because I don't ever see myself like

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.580
not working either.

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.580
Like not working is fun for probably a few weeks, maybe even a few months.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.520
But then I would think like, oh my God, I'm going to go crazy.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.160
You'll just add more podcasts.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.760
That's still working in a way.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:25.180
I actually super enjoyed my fun employment because at the time I was living rent free

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:31.160
and I went to Disneyland a bunch and I pretty much just still did kind of whatever I wanted

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.160
to.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.800
But what I should have done was started my book and I'm going to write that book.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.640
It's going to get started this year.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.640
Okay.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.680
I'm laughing hard over here because Tiger Claw may have got something wrong with you

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.680
a minute ago, but he just got this very, very right.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.920
Tiger Claw says Rob will be at a podcast museum.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.300
That's pretty, pretty true.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:56.720
Back in my day, my friends and I sat around and we talked about video games.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.220
You know what a video game is Timmy?

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.220
Get off my lawn.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.660
Get off my God damn lawn.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.380
Get off my hollow lawn.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:11.180
You would have holographic lawns that simulate the feeling of grass.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.340
What's a video grandpa?

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:18.860
Like it would just be, everything's implanted in the chip in our brain now.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:24.700
I was talking about that with somebody today that we should have like our ability to use

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.300
our driver's license like Apple pay.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:32.020
And then I was like, no, it's just going to be a little tattoo on our skin that has

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.580
a QR code that you scan.

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.620
In the words of Sasha Velour, don't joke about that.

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.460
But it's already happening.

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.460
They're already working on that technology.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:43.740
Did I tell you about the one tattoo I was thinking about getting?

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.300
No.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:52.460
So they have this type of tattoo where you actually get a tattoo of a sound wave, a sound

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.820
form tattooed on your body.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:59.340
And then you have an app on the phone that you can scan the sound form and it plays it.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:04.340
So I was thinking about, since I'm fortunate that I have a lot of audio of my mom from

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:10.660
her appearances on this program, when she was around, I have considered getting something

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.660
of hers tattooed.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.980
Here's the trick though, just so you know, because somebody in chat will correct me on

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:15.980
it.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:19.660
Because you might be wondering like, wait a minute, how do you get the sound to be that

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.660
crisp?

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:26.020
It's all kind of an illusion, because it's not really, you are getting an accurate representation

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.500
of the sound form.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.580
But all the app is doing is it's reading the kind of like the close, what it looks like,

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:34.640
and then looking it up in the database and playing the sound.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640
So it is kind of...

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.940
It works kind of like a QR.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.900
It's yeah, you got it.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.360
It's what it is instead of a QR code.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.660
But I still kind of like the idea.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:47.740
I mean, even if it's not 100% accurate, I just love that idea.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.980
Because I am into sound, I do do podcasting.

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:54.060
I think that's one of those things where I can't possibly see how I would regret that

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.060
decision.

01:02:55.060 --> 01:03:00.500
See, I'm planning on having a medical QR code where, you know what I'm talking about?

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.060
Where it used, it scanned.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.540
Oh, instead of life alert.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.540
Exactly.

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:05.540
Yeah.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.340
Because I mean, by all rights, due to...

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:12.500
So I'm sorry, life alert is I've fallen and I can't get up.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.500
Medic alert.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.500
Yeah, medic alert.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500
Is it working?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500
Like the bracelets.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.500
It's not working.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.500
Like the bracelets.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.380
It would actually have a little label that says medical ID and a QR code on it that would

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:27.800
bring up a page that you can update that lists your allergies, your surgeries, all the things

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.860
like that without having them to invasively go into your phone for this information.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:36.100
And I recommend to everyone right now, I know we're going way off topic, but if you have

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.500
a health app on your phone, keep it up the fuck to date because they do look at that

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.500
information.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500
Yeah.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.500
Mine is actually up to date too.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.700
So, um, that's a good advice if you ever are in an issue or what have you.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.700
Yeah.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.700
Yes, we are off topic tonight, but I warned them in the first five minutes it was national

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.700
wine day.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.700
So you know what?

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.900
Hey, I had my ounce of wine and I'm already, I've already lost it now, but I was pretty

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.700
tipsy for about a good minute.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:03.380
We do have two hours.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.900
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio everybody.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900
Uh, I can't.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.900
All right.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.900
So how about another story, Loki?

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.000
All right.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.440
So I don't know what Atari is doing nowadays.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.400
I mean, it seems like that they're just trying to jump on all of the terrible bandwagons

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.000
at the same time.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So you may remember that they have their Atari console coming out that we have still no fucking

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.840
clue what the hell that is.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.000
Then they have their Kickstarter theme that they did crowdfunding for the roller coaster

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.600
tycoon game that's probably going to suck for the switch.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:42.520
And now, now they're announcing that the Atari token is going to be their new cryptocurrency

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.440
that they're going to offer people to buy cause that's the road to the future.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.000
Well maybe my doge coin will be worth something more than this.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Yeah.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.880
So the Atari tokens.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:59.440
So you know, basically they announced, you know, share it was, they said, um, Oh my God,

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.760
can I play yards revenge with the token?

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.800
Is that, is that the joke?

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:10.420
That like you buy this fake currency and you can play games online with it?

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.600
I don't think so.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.680
I think that they're hoping that they're going to become rich from this.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.960
Why, why doesn't Atari just do the fucking obvious?

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.240
Like what I just said, like why not really give that cryptocurrency some value right

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.240
off the bat?

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.160
Like, look, I'm not, I'm not trying to shade on cryptocurrency.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:31.400
I understand it's a, it's a thing that a lot of people are into and I even, even my, to

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.340
an extent I'm like, okay, Bitcoin is making more and more sense to me, especially when

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:39.800
you explained it a few weeks ago, Jamie, um, and made the whole analogy with like, uh,

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.360
X-Box points or whatever they were called.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:45.600
Like, you know, I think that makes a lot of sense, but Bitcoin is only worth what Bitcoin's

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.120
worth because more and more places are accepting Bitcoin.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:55.120
But like if Atari right off the bat said, you can use this Atari coin for our rich catalog

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.980
of Atari products, then it kind of has some inherent inherent value right off the bat.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.820
Even if it's small, even some value.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.760
Let's just assume that, you know, people are going to want to hold on to these Atari tokens

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:11.240
because they're not sure that it's going to become, remember there's ways you could pay

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.900
for pizzas and stuff with Bitcoin at one time.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.560
I bet the person that paid for pizza with that Bitcoin's probably regretting that quite

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.560
a bit nowadays.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:27.160
Like I just fucking use cash and said, I spent $30,000 on that pizza.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:32.940
The same could be said that I didn't invest in my 401k enough money.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.080
I went to Disneyland instead.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.280
Um, and am I going to regret that when I'm 65?

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.700
I might, but at the same time I got to go to fucking Disneyland.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:49.040
So Loki, what I'm trying to tell you is that that pizza was fucking good.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040
Hope it was.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040
Anyways.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.040
Yeah.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.880
So they're saying with that, um, you know, blocked blockchain technology is poised to

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:02.480
take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize the

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:08.160
current economic ecosystem, especially in areas of video game industry and online transactions.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.920
So because I don't understand enough about blockchain and ship, how is it that we're

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.560
just creating money from nothing?

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.760
I mean, it's what I want to know.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.320
Cause like if we can just create money from nothing, then I guess I should just come out

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.600
my coin and sell that and stuff.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600
I know.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600
Oh, a VoG coin.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.920
Is that what you, you want a VoG coin?

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920
I don't know.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.920
I mean, what's Bobby.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.400
Maybe if Atari VoG coin, can we get a book?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:38.040
If Atari can do it and Atari is just like, I can already see it's just like, I can already

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:41.120
see the disapproving look on Bobby's face and the art style.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.560
The thing is, is that I don't think that Bitcoin was created from nothing technically.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:51.520
I think that it was created with a pool of real funds into creating this currency.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.880
Cause I mean, think about it.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:08:00.440
The origins of coinage anyway, were a result of having something for a barter system.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:07.040
It was a unit of, instead of having physical goods to change, people would then use these

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.680
as a token to exchange for other goods.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.640
So it's basically adding another layer into the barter system.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:20.840
And then from there, now all society will, unless you are extremely, extremely communist,

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.600
you know, works on this now system of currency.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:29.440
They've just taken that system of currency to work the way, almost like our credit cards

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440
do.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:37.700
Except our credit cards work on debt, whereas Bitcoin is, it's not, while it may not have

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:42.440
physical substance, it's as substantial in currency as having coinage.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.440
Makes sense.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.440
Yeah.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.400
Akuma JP kind of adds to your thought saying money was just a paper, if not for banks.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.400
So kind of a...

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.880
Well, what happened?

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.120
Jamie just did the actual Oprah gif that you may have seen where Oprah just kind of goes,

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120
there you go.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120
There you go.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.480
But the other thing too is, I mean, if you want to have another prime example of this,

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.080
let's just use American history here for a second.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.800
Confederate money.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.600
They created the money for the Confederacy when the Confederacy died, the money became

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:22.200
worthless except as, you know, to collectors or after World War One, the Deutschmark because

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:28.320
the company, the country was so impoverished, their money was nothing.

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.440
People were using Deutschmarks to actually use as kindling because they were worth nothing.

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.920
So I mean, there you go.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:40.740
It only has the value ascribed to it by whatever financial institution is behind it and the

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.760
power of the country it's in.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.760
So...

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.200
Or commemorative plates.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.160
Bobby Blackwolf in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm trying to figure out if I really

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:55.860
want to take my old tokens from Electronica, the experience at Disney California venture,

01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:00.080
and put the VOG logo on it and give them to you as a VOG coin.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.840
You know, there's kind of a, there's a double meaning there though, because remember when

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.520
VOG was born, when the idea came out that this is a thing that should be happening.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.640
It was at Disneyland at Electronica.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.640
So...

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.020
Well, and I do agree with JD that's either collector's items or racist tokens as back

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:22.840
to the Confederate money, but there also are historians who collect.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:28.200
There is historic value in it, even though that history is not a pleasant one to always

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.200
confront.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:37.520
I also do know people who collect defunct coinage and you know, have like old Roman coins, old,

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.560
you know, even the, you know, little stone coins, you know, from other cultures.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.160
One man's trash is another's treasure.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.160
Right?

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.160
Yeah.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:54.060
Anyway, let's move on to, it's not cryptocurrency, something completely different.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.200
It's VR.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.280
And this is the interesting headline out there.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.880
Nintendo president is interested in VR, but says nothing interesting has been done yet

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880
with the tech.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.280
Well, that, that comment's just leading itself over to, what do you mean nothing interesting

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.280
has been done?

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280
No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.860
Well, hold on.

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:15.400
So here's the quote from Tatsumi Kimishima, who of course is the president of Nintendo

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.900
right now.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:22.680
He said in this tweet, I guess that came from Japanese Nintendo, was this in an interview

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680
or something?

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.600
I'm not sure where the interview was or what have you.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.800
But the quote was, I understand that VR is interesting as a technology, and I am very

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.040
interested in it.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.720
I will use it if I can make interesting things with it.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.720
We have not done anything interesting yet.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.760
So I'll give them that with, with the technology.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760
Here's the thing.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.320
And this is what it really boils down to.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.760
And, and, you know, I'm going to take his words in another fashion and agree with it.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.720
And that is that VR does not yet have its Wii Sports.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.640
And that's what Nintendo, you know, really does.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.320
Well, A, they didn't invent the VR technology.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.360
They like to do this stuff with the new ways to game that they invent.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.000
But if Nintendo can kind of find that must have way to incorporate VR, that must have

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.920
game or kind of see that must have game out there, then they're going to jump on board

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920
with it.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.520
Are you telling me that VR chat isn't the Wii Sports of VR?

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:25.840
Regretfully, Loki, I'm sorry to inform you, don't think it is.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.840
I don't know.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.880
I think there's been plenty done with VR, but yeah, there's not like been any really

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.720
killer apps have sold the platform.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720
I think.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:36.880
I mean, there's been a lot of good games, but nothing like, you know, is the finding

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.840
is like Mario Odyssey or something like that for VR.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.840
You don't, when you think of VR, you don't really think of like a particular game.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.600
It's more of just kind of an experience or platform.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.920
So I get it there, but also at the same time, it almost seems like that they're just defending

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.920
themselves of the fact that they're not entering that market as like, Oh, nothing, nothing

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.420
significant has been done yet.

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.360
That's why we're doing what we're doing, you know, kind of thing.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.500
Cause they did the same thing or like other companies are the same thing with like motion

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:09.960
controls or rumble or like HD and all that stuff.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.300
And they've made that argument like before where it's like, eh, here's the thing.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:19.880
Nintendo is in this position now that they don't have to defend their fucking choices.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.180
Four years ago, they needed to defend their fucking choices because the Wii U is not performing.

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:27.720
The switch on the other hand is exceeding expectations in many ways.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.480
So whether we like it or not, Loki, and we've had this conversation a thousand times, even

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.420
though you and I go back and forth all the time on Nintendo and things, they ought to

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.520
be doing better.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.940
The reality is they're selling shit, tons of switches.

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.140
They've got enough on it.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.300
That's fun to play.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.020
So VR be damned for them.

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:50.940
They'll incorporate VR when it suits their narrative.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.260
That's what it boils down to.

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:59.140
In the meantime, cardboard folded into interesting shapes to do crazy things.

01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.060
That is what Nintendo sees a market in instead.

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:08.340
And it's like, and I'm not shading that because like a lot of people are like, wow, that's

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:09.460
fucking neat.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.100
And even I'm like, I don't know if that's for me, but that is kind of fucking neat.

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.220
And the more and more stuff I see them doing with it, like I did see that little like light

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.400
gun thing they were doing.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.060
So I guess there's a new one they're doing with Labo is like a light gun.

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.020
And I'm like, okay, that is kind of neat.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:27.740
It's just, I know it's a gimmick.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:28.780
It's a gimmick.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.900
It's a gimmick to sell a tech demo game.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.900
And honestly, I hope the games are good because that's where it's going to come down to.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:39.300
But it's like, no, it's an interesting concept, but no.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.780
I think the whole thing with Labo though, is that it has to have been in development

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:49.180
for quite some time because, um, does anyone remember, um, when Nintendo for Wii U was

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.300
talking about Project Giant Robot?

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.300
Yeah.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.300
Yeah.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:58.500
And that game actually ended up, uh, looks like it's what got turned in to the Toy-Con

01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.500
2, the robot kit.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.500
Yeah.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.580
But at the same time, I think Nintendo just didn't want to maybe waste those resources

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.360
when they saw the writing on the wall for the Wii U, it was just kind of like, well,

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.720
how do we not lose what we've done here so far?

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.720
And they, it was repurposed.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.320
I don't think it was like designed with Labo in mind or anything like that.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.640
And I think that kind of shit happens in the game industry all the time.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.800
Well shit, Overwatch, right?

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.320
That game is fucking insane what that game's doing, right?

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:29.640
Overwatch came from Project Titan, which got axed, you know, and we'll never know really.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.240
I mean, we, we've heard rumors and things of what Project Titan was, but all we know

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.520
is that a lot of this stuff for Overwatch, like some of these maps and things were supposed

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.080
to be like a part of Titan.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:45.000
And I think the, the game in Overwatch was like one element of Titan, but they instead

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.200
put it into this like full flesh game.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.920
So anyway, long story short, sometimes these games are born from canceled things, you know,

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.440
or they just, they, they evolve.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:01.080
So anyhow, uh, let's, let's, let's travel to a simpler time, shall we?

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.540
There was, there was no virtual reality or anything like that.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:06.540
You know what there was?

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.540
They tried.

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:14.400
There was a power glove, which is a great transition into the classic peripheral of

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400
the month.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.040
Because usually every week on this show, uh, Dark Soccer's Steps into the Gaming Vault

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.840
finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brat should be checking this game out.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.300
But in a 2017 twist, no one should use this.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.780
She did systems every month.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:33.800
And this year, 2018, she's doing one peripheral a month.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.800
So Dark Soccer.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.800
No one should use this one though.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.800
Okay.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.800
This is a bad peripheral.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.800
It is.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.800
And what I'm gonna-

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:40.800
So wait, hold on.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:44.120
Bobby, see, sometimes we pick bad things, but I didn't pick that game.

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.860
So that was a week you weren't here.

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.860
All right.

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:50.260
But, um, but I've decided that because it's kind of hard to find music to go with some

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:56.340
of these, that I'm trying to pick like, I guess, music from the system, like Bios music

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.380
or something.

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.380
Uh-huh.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:03.340
So I picked the Sega CD Bios 2 because honestly it's awesome.

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.540
But that's not the peripheral.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:05.540
The Sega CD is not the peripheral.

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.540
But it worked on it.

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.540
Okay.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.580
Well, what is the classic peripheral of the month?

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:14.160
It is the Activator by Sega.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:23.420
And when I moved out here, we bought an Activator with Eternal Champions for $10 at Virgin.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.660
If you remember the old Virgin store that we had here.

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:36.380
It was released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993, also known in the U.S. as the Genesis.

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:44.140
And the technology was used in- similar technology was used in the Sega System 32 fighting game

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:47.780
Dragon Ball Z VR versus.

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:54.020
So it used your motion sensors to play the game.

01:17:54.020 --> 01:18:00.060
But anyway, it was when a lot of companies were investing in virtual reality or I would

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:05.220
more put this as augmented reality, but not the type of AR that we're used to using our

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:11.820
phones, but as a way to immerse the movement of the player with the game, you know.

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:17.900
And so the Activator was developed by a company called Interactive Light for Sega.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:23.300
And then it was- for those in Brazil, it was brought there by Tech Toy, but it was based

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:29.140
off of a musical interest called the Light Harp that was conceived of by a person named

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:30.140
Asaf Gerner.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:31.140
Did we know that?

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.500
No, we did not.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:38.820
It had eight segments that put it together, made an octagonal ring that you place on the

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:43.460
floor and then it fires beams of light upwards where-

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.300
Just like a Para Para machine.

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:47.140
Yes, I was getting to that.

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.140
Sorry.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:52.860
It seems to me like also one of the influences for Para Para, at least the game versions.

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:56.540
Para Para is by itself special.

01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:02.860
So you would break the light beams by kicking or punching to send signals to the Mega Drive

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:06.940
console and then it's supposed to, you know, repeat it in game.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:15.980
It's basically a giant control pad with your left, up, right, down, A, B, C, and start

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:19.220
buttons mapped to those segments.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:25.820
They were marketing it as a martial arts simulator that it was supposed to work specifically

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:32.300
with the fighting games, but a lot of games just did not work very well with it.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:36.980
And you could also distort those light beams by not having a flat ceiling.

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:41.180
And we tried it in my house that had a vaulted ceiling at the time.

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:46.100
I mean, we've still got vaulted ceilings now, but it really didn't work very well.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:51.940
And then, like I said, they revamped the activator for Dragon Ball Z VR versus and it had extra

01:19:51.940 --> 01:20:00.940
sensors so that it could better, I guess, better read, you know, what was going on.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.820
And it was really popular.

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:07.780
And it was also one of the first full body motion games because, you know, we've had

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:14.500
several since then, like, well, we have Police 9-1-1 and wasn't there like a firefighting

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.500
game or something?

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.500
Anyway.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:24.500
But there were some games that were designed for the activator and they were called Activated

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:30.500
so there was best of the best championship karate, Eternal Champions, Greatest Heavyweights

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.820
and Streets of Rage 3.

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:37.500
It had support for Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter II, Special Champion Edition and Streets of

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.280
Rage 2.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:45.180
And the Sega 32X versions of Mortal Kombat 2 also mentioned the activator by game but

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.760
it didn't work very well.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:51.380
There were also a couple of unreleased games that were meant to be specifically used by

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:56.980
the activator but were canceled called Air Drums and Bounty Hunter.

01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:59.480
And that's it.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.660
That was the activator.

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:09.460
It came in this big red box that had all the, you know, 90s looking text that, you know,

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.380
it glowed and had, you know, drop shadows and shit.

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.580
So there you go.

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.540
The activator.

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.860
The flop of the week.

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:24.540
Yeah, it was kind of shitty but an important, you know, peripheral nonetheless.

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:26.220
Not all peripherals were great.

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.820
Well, it's only slightly better than the U-Force.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:31.620
Hey, don't spoil what might be an upcoming.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.220
I did the U-Force last month.

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.820
Oh, why did I...

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:35.820
Girl.

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:39.460
I thought for some reason you did the Power Glove the first month.

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:40.460
I don't remember why.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:42.820
No, I haven't done the Power Glove yet because it's so bad.

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:43.980
We talk about it so often.

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.620
I'm trying not to do anything too terribly obvious.

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.620
That's fair.

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:48.620
But...

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.620
That's fair.

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.620
Because I can't...

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:53.580
Because Para Para Biscuits, yeah, they're a peripheral but they were part of the arcade

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:54.580
game.

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:55.580
Yeah.

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:56.940
I don't know.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:00.420
I'd like to have some suggestions from people like what is so shitty it deserves to be mentioned.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:05.140
I'm gonna say go to our Discord to shout those out.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:07.020
I kind of pay attention to the Discord.

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.020
I pay close attention to it.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.020
It took me, what, three months to join it?

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.020
Good job.

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020
You're finally on board.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.020
Yeah.

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.020
Vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:18.740
I also, though, have my own channel in there too but I don't do anything with it.

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:19.940
JD has a great question.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.540
Is it terrible peripherals only?

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:22.540
No.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.540
No.

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:26.100
This is gonna probably be a two-year segment.

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.020
Oh, you're gonna stretch this into 2019.

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.020
Because there's so many things.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:30.020
There are a lot.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.020
And I've run out of ideas.

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.020
All right.

01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.020
OLR confirmed through 2019.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.020
We'll see.

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.020
All right.

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.380
Anyhow, we're gonna take a quick break, you guys.

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:44.340
In 2020, I'm probably gonna do like video game-related endorsement of the month.

01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.580
Like Mario cereal or something.

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.580
Video game commercial.

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.580
Put them on.

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.580
Now I'm gonna do endorsement.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:52.500
So that means I can also talk about Doki Doki Panic.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.500
And Wrecka.

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.500
Sure.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.380
And we can talk about Cool Spot on the NES.

01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.380
I'd rather not.

01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.380
All right.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:22:59.380
We're gonna take a quick break, you guys.

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:04.220
When we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio coming up, including we'll

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:08.180
talk about some rapid-fire news, including some updates on Stardew Valley and Dragon

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.500
Ball FighterZ.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.660
And then we'll talk a little bit about Overwatch.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:13.660
Why not?

01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:16.100
We already brought it up earlier in the show, so we'll talk about it a little more.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:21.100
All this and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:31.340
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:37.260
Episode number 719 of our show for this February the 18th of 2018.

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.260
Already in progress.

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:43.760
Let's get into, before we get into rapid-fire news, actually, I gotta ask Loki about this

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:46.940
because I'm sure you've been following some of this news and it's been coming up on the

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:47.940
Discord.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.580
We're talking about Discord before the break and definitely some folks talking about movies

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.580
coming up.

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:56.980
Ready Player One, of course, all those character posters are showing up and there's a lot more

01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:57.980
news about that.

01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.980
Yeah.

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.300
Darsakha and I even saw the Ready Player One poster today at the theater, so it was like,

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.780
that movie's getting closer.

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:04.780
Getting hype.

01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.780
Excited for that?

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:06.780
Yes, I'm very excited for it.

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.780
So, here's another movie.

01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.300
I didn't even know this was happening, but apparently they're doing another Kung Fury

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.300
movie?

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.300
Yeah.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:17.100
So, is this just a remake of the short as a movie or is it a sequel?

01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:21.020
I think they're doing a full-length movie, but as a sequel.

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.020
Okay.

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:27.300
And apparently, and what I'm reading online, Michael Fassbender is in it.

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.300
Is in it.

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.300
We don't know what he's...

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:30.300
Yes, he was in Shame.

01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:31.300
Yes, we all know that movie.

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:37.980
I just want the soundtrack to still be done by Mitch Marder because it was, well, thanks

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:44.340
to my friend Nikki, I've, I guess, discovered Retro New Wave, which is all that 80s style

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.340
synth pop.

01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.540
And I've listened to some of his other stuff and it's amazing.

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.100
Have you ever played Hotline Miami?

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:50.100
Yeah.

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:51.100
Okay, I was gonna say.

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:57.500
Because, I mean, they have him or Future Cop or Droid Bishop on that soundtrack, or even

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:01.300
pull Stan Bush out of retirement, you know.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.500
Is Hasselhoff confirmed for this one?

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.500
Yes, he is.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.500
Yes.

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:11.860
And then I saw a good old Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of this state that kind

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:16.780
of had a disgraceful exit, but he's back doing movies again, so he's gonna be doing Kung

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.780
Fury.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:18.780
Yeah.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:22.900
I'm gonna take Andrew Kossing's role, the Thor God.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.420
I hope Schwarzenegger is not there to take that role.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:28.180
No, I think he's supposed to play someone else.

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:32.860
I hear you might, I think he might even be the villain or something like that.

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.860
Oh shit, okay.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:34.860
Maybe.

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:35.860
Nice.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.980
So, I don't know, but yeah, he's not, no, he's not gonna take Thor's role or anything.

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:43.900
As long as that arcade machine comes back.

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:48.140
Well, he got killed in the first one, didn't he?

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:52.140
There's always a chance that more of them will come back, but yeah, it, it, I'm excited

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.140
about it.

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:57.460
Um, of course that's so far off, you know, um, we'll have to see when that comes out,

01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:02.180
but I hope they don't replace the guy that plays Kung Fury because I understand Fastbenders

01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:06.380
into, but like at what they didn't say, he is Kung Fury.

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:07.380
So I don't know.

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.780
No, I don't know.

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:12.380
I guess we still have some time to find out, but I just, I'm kind of shocked that they're

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:15.280
getting like all this big talent very suddenly.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.040
So because it's a cheat, it, it's more of like, it's a fun project.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.880
I think at this point when you've done so many big things, when you've made Assassin's

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.440
Creed, what else is left to like, look at like almost forcing your perfect example or

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.600
his words to nigger and Jackie Chan or in like some Chinese film or something when he

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.960
plays like this general guy in that as well.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.520
It's just kind of like fun projects.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.120
It's not necessarily like they've made their money.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:44.040
I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger at this point kind of has to make fun of himself.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.760
Like there's really nothing left for him.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.520
I think, yeah, I mean, you take some roles for money and you take some roles because

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.520
they're just fun.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.240
They're just stupid, weird or something.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.240
I don't know.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:01.240
So, um, but yes, I am incredibly excited about, um, Ready Player One.

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.240
All right.

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.840
So lots of stuff going on in gaming.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.840
And then we saw also a poster for Tomb Raider cause that's just, I didn't realize how close

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.840
that movie.

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:09.840
I didn't even know it was coming out.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:10.840
Yeah.

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.800
And if you saw, well, I don't know if you've seen the new trailer for Ready Player One.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:19.240
They have that play in front of, um, Black Panther right now as well, Linzels online.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.280
But uh, there is a cameo from Hello Kitty and Batsmaru in there.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.280
Woo.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280
No, I haven't seen the new trailer.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.480
No, there is a small cameo.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:33.560
I saw every, we, every single trailer we saw today were the exact same trailer except for

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:34.560
one.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.560
There was one, the one about the Quantum Leap.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.040
It was Quantum Leap for teenagers.

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040
That's what it was.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.480
It was the, what was it called?

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.480
Everyday.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.480
Was that the name of the movie?

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.480
With the pink song in the trailer.

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.480
What?

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.080
It was like, every day I'm waking up in a different body and I'm falling in love with

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.080
you.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.940
It looked like some teenage movie, but like the main character was all these different

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:55.240
people that was, yeah, it actually was the most interesting out of all the trailers.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:59.440
I liked the one about, but I also fucking love pink and I love that song.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.440
Like the song is so good.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.440
Yeah.

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.440
I want to see that one.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.880
I kind of want to see the black comedy though.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.880
The yeah.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.320
And then we, we see all these other trailers and what's, what's the other one we saw twice

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.340
now with the, it's like Charlie and the horse or something.

01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.220
And I leaned over and I was pick up Pete, pick up here.

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:21.340
I leaned over and I whispered in Jamie's ear, you know, he's going to fuck that horse because

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:24.740
the whole trailer is like, I'm going to take my horse.

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:25.740
I love you.

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:26.740
I'm going to take this horse.

01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:27.740
I'm going to leave.

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.740
Yeah.

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.740
But you know what my reply was?

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.480
Steve Buscemi is randomly in it too.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.480
Catherine the Great.

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.480
He ain't.

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.480
No.

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.820
Unfortunately it's not the horse.

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:38.060
The horse is not, it's not a Mr. Ed thing going on.

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:42.260
It's supposed to be like a legit movie that I suppose maybe we'll give some people feel

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:48.540
like, was it like I go on a Netflix now and the turn, the first two things that, um, greet

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:54.180
me as, as we enter into the kids section is two abominations to the cinema.

01:28:54.180 --> 01:29:00.740
Number one, the emoji movie and number two, the who the fuck asked for this fucking remake.

01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:08.740
But Woody Woodpecker, the CG animated CG live action, Woody Woodpecker movie.

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.780
I'm like, no, God, no, no.

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.300
Why?

01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:14.300
No.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.980
Thankfully my kids are smart and do not want to watch either one of those.

01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:17.980
All right.

01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:21.180
Anyway, it's, that's the second time we've become a movie podcast tonight.

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.980
We're starting to creep on critical myths turf here at the Lucy keeps network.

01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:25.980
All right.

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:28.940
Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news back in these games.

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:29.940
Loki.

01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.780
So, uh, this is kind of cool cause I've been playing a little bit of Stardew Valley, but

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:37.380
they are going to be adding multiplayer soon and they announced that they're going to be

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:41.460
doing a beta for said multiplayer in the spring.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:46.340
So, um, basically it'll give us more details as it gets closer to that, but it is something

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.340
that's coming.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:53.540
Uh, but he did post the picture of, you know, kind of some of the screenshots from that

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:56.340
multiplayer add on expansion or whatever.

01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:01.540
And of course it shows two houses or as opposed to the one house.

01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:03.220
Um, so that's kind of cool.

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:08.940
I'm be kind of interested to see how that plays out or if it's going to be like, you

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:13.140
have to play at the same time or is it like, you know, you can keep visiting like Animal

01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:16.700
Crossing where you can keep visiting back to the same world type thing.

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:18.500
That'll do wonders for streaming too.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.140
I think that's going to be a lot of fun to watch.

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.740
Like people kind of doing that together.

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:26.180
So yeah, I mean, I don't know how much that's going to really add to the game, but I'm hopefully

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:30.000
they're going to add more content to the game along with the multiplayer.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
So we'll see.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.620
Um, and then of course this is exciting news regarding dance rush.

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:41.060
Round one is basically said that they're going to be bringing it to the US in their locations.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.860
So that's pretty awesome.

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.860
Starting this summer.

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:46.380
We'll have to drive all the way to Concord to play that.

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.380
Although soon, did you guys hear this?

01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:53.420
They have announced the upcoming round one openings, uh, later this year, they're going

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:56.580
to be opening one in Hayward, uh, at the mall there.

01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:01.200
And uh, I don't know if you guys have heard this in the fourth quarter of 2019, Roseville

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.520
is getting around one that was confirmed.

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.960
So pretty, pretty cool.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.280
There'll be one in our neighborhood.

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.280
So where's the Concord one?

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.280
Is that the mall there?

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.480
The Concord one is at Sun Valley mall.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.480
Oh yeah.

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.200
I don't know what store it used to be cause I don't, that's not my own.

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:18.160
And they say this new one is going into the Galleria, but the Galleria doesn't have any

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:23.280
open space that I know of in the mall, uh, unless some big store closed there that I

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.280
can't think of.

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.400
But I don't think the Galleria has like, like there's no like Sears there that went under

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.400
it.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.400
Like the Sears there is still open.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.400
Yeah, it's still open.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.400
Yeah.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:35.400
But across the street from the Galleria, there's that big open lot that used to be the furniture

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.000
store that they do the haunted houses in every October.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.800
I bet that's it.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:45.240
That's big enough to be around one, but that's kind of a long time for that to sit empty.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:49.320
I mean, you know, that I would be surprised if they're going to have to do, if they're

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:52.940
going to have to do make makeovers on the building to make it work, put a bowling alley

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:57.280
in there and you know, maybe there's already an agreement for Halloween of this year that

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.600
they have to see through or something.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:31:59.600
Who knows?

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.920
But yeah, so they'll be coming out, um, starting this summer.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:05.840
So that's going to be pretty exciting.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.420
And just real quick, I'm sorry, JD is put the list in chat.

01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:12.080
There are more round ones opening besides just in our neighborhood.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.740
Like I saw like there's a new one in Ohio somewhere and there's, there's, there's others

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.960
opening across the country.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:21.120
So, um, you should check and see if you're on the list because you know, again, they're

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:26.160
not paying us to make this plug, but I mean, round one is bringing like old school arcades

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.800
back and especially with the types of games that flat out interest me, you know, the Japanese

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.800
imports.

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.160
So I support it.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.160
Yeah.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.400
And I'm just going to be excited because by the time it does get in our neighborhood,

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:42.720
I'll be actually in shape enough to be able to play them again.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:43.720
Maybe I will be too.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.720
We'll see.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.680
Of course, as I say here, as I down my third glass of wine.

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:53.680
Um, but yeah, so like the final name of the game now is Dance Rush Stardom is the full

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.660
title that they have now.

01:32:55.660 --> 01:33:01.800
And um, so there's some additional information regarding dangerous stardom, including talking

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:02.800
about that.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.960
They have now language selection in there as well.

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:10.340
So they have Japanese, English, Korean, traditional Chinese, or simplified Chinese, um, or options

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:15.260
you can choose for the menu, which is kind of nice so that they can put it out, you know,

01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:16.260
internationally.

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.900
And then they have, of course, the, uh, the different modes you can do.

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:23.220
So you have your basic mode and your premium mode, the premium mode, of course, if you've

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:28.060
seen it online, there's some YouTube videos out there will basically record you playing

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:29.220
the game.

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:33.900
So you can actually upload that as well to the internet for all to enjoy.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.900
So there's that.

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:39.760
They show a little bit of the lesson mode that's available in the game as well.

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:44.040
And um, talking about songs that are in the game.

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.780
So there's quite a few songs.

01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:52.500
They said there's gonna be 50 at the North American launch, but, um, you know, some of

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:59.340
the ones I've heard so far, they had Wicked, um, from, uh, from our Jew, I guess.

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:01.660
And let's see without you a press.

01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.980
I know that there's, uh, give me a big beat by Korskay.

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:10.600
That's one I've been listening to my car, um, sacrosanorized by Rio star.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.860
They also have a remix of butterfly in there as well.

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:14.860
I've heard that one.

01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:15.860
That was pretty cool.

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:21.740
Um, I watched, uh, like a double, the group before the play in the butterfly remix.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:22.740
That was pretty cool.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:23.740
I saw that too.

01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.740
Yeah.

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:29.500
A revolution by Broadio and, um, I dunno, it looks like just a really fun game.

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:34.060
Um, so they did once again, uh, 50 songs at launch, four songs added every month after

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.060
that.

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:39.260
And it's scheduled for at least in March in Japan.

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:41.940
So the U S will receive it in the summer.

01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:45.880
I have to say, like, honestly, with all the like music games that come out, this one has

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.100
me kind of the most excited since like DDR, you know, like I really want to try it.

01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.100
Looks like a lot of fun.

01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.100
So yeah.

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:58.300
Um, I am very excited to see how this, how this looks when we come out because right

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:02.140
now I'm assuming, cause this isn't obviously 50 songs that they're listing on here.

01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:06.740
So I'm wondering if between the now and then is where we're going to get the additional

01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.660
songs because yeah, this is probably just the test test version list.

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.660
They'll probably be more, we'll see.

01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.580
So maybe some old classics coming back.

01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.580
Who knows?

01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:15.580
Anyhow.

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:21.700
Well, if you are a user of GOG or good old games, uh, good news, uh, and you use steam,

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:26.980
I should say, if you use both, some good news is that some more games got added to GOG connect.

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:31.300
If you don't remember what that is, that is where as long as your steam profile is public

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:36.580
and you link the two together, you can import your steam owned games into your good old

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:37.900
games library.

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:43.240
So they just added 11 more games, including mountain blade or well, tropical for a Y

01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:50.520
AI war collection, Hunie pop, Kim pirates, gold plus tempest, the sexy brutal, Hunie

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.520
pop.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.520
I think is what it is.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:53.520
A Hunie pop.

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.520
That was just one in.

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:55.520
Okay.

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.520
Sorry about that.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.960
Then a Hunie pop, uh, tempest, uh, torchlight, which is the one that I had that I was able

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.760
to import and unreal tournament game of the year, which I know a lot of people own that

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.760
one.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.760
So pretty cool.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.200
So if you haven't checked out that feature, uh, and you use GOG, uh, you should get on

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.200
that.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.800
Uh, in other news, how about mega man legacy collection for the Nintendo switch?

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:20.340
We knew it was coming because Capcom did announce they are going to make it happen when they

01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:24.760
finally finally put out that trailer for mega man 11, right?

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:29.000
They announced that mega man legacy would come to the switch, but this is what's interesting.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.940
Apparently the ESRB rated a game called mega man legacy collection one and two.

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:40.160
So it sounds like the games are simply being bundled together, which is great.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.220
I hope they just did one cart with both games.

01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:43.220
Why not?

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:44.220
Yeah.

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:48.680
And give the switch owners a little something for having to wait or what'll probably really

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.680
happen.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.820
I think weren't these games like 20 bucks a pop when they were, uh, on the PS four marketplace

01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:55.820
and the Xbox marketplace.

01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:56.820
Yeah.

01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:58.400
It'll probably just be a $40 cartridge.

01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.400
Gotcha.

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.400
Yeah.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.400
Maybe let's hope not.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.360
Let's hope they maybe change that a little bit.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.360
We'll see though.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.360
Uh, dark soccer.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.360
What do you have for us?

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:10.080
Oh, we have some stuff about dragon ball fighter Z, which I haven't gotten because I went ahead

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.720
and bought, you know, the battle for Azeroth for world of Warcraft and I'm being frugal,

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:20.360
but we do have the announcement of two DLC characters and one of them is Bardock and

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:29.200
Bururi, um, going in for a even more fighting, but you can get them through the season pass

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.840
that unlocks eight additional characters for $34.99.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:43.800
Um, and then in other news, uh, there is a rumor about a, uh, a kart racing that's going

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:49.940
to be Sonic and friends, more, more Sonic karting from Sumo digital.

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:53.580
Somebody out there is playing a cruel joke on orange lounge radio where we have a long

01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:58.060
running gag of saying Sonic and all of his shitty friends.

01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:02.240
So somebody is actually making a karting title for Sonic and all of his shitty friends.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.240
Yeah.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.640
I don't know.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:05.640
He's got some good friends.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:06.640
Really just knuckles.

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.640
Hmm.

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.640
Yeah.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.040
The ones that weren't starring in the game, they're all pretty shitty.

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:17.040
Now if Sonic's shitty friends include Ooh, la la and you know, other Sega characters

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.480
like the last Sonic racing game that was actually pretty decent, you know, considering how long

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:25.760
we had to wait for Mario kart eight, like was actually pretty decent that, that, uh,

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.760
what is it called?

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.960
Sonic and friend, no Sonic and Sega all-stars, Sonic and Sega all-stars racing.

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:32.960
That was rad.

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.800
Sonic's friends are the same.

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.800
And Danica Patrick.

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800
Yeah.

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.800
And Danica.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.800
Yes.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:41.840
If, if Danica Patrick and Sonic are still tight, if they're still BFFs, then I'm okay

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:42.840
with that.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:43.840
You know what I want them to do?

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:44.840
I forgot Danica Patrick.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.200
You know what I want them to do with one of these games?

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.920
We haven't had the OPA OPA in one of the racing games and it should just be the OPA OPA in

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.500
all of those modes.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:58.360
You know, instead of having little wheels, it's running around on its tiny little feet.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:02.000
And then when it says aerial scenes, the little wings come out or it's the big wing.

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.560
OPA OPA should be a special unlock, just saying.

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:10.720
And when I was playing Phantasy Star Online, you better believe I had an OPA OPA mag.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.900
Tiger Claw in chat says, Amy isn't one of Sonic's shitty friends since she was the part

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.600
of Sonic CD.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.760
Well, in the words of Britney Spears, if you seek Amy.

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.880
And then they're also like, she's also Sonic Adventure and in the comics, so whatever.

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.060
And then I know, yeah, they keep adding new, new friends in the comics too.

01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:34.340
Like I saw one today, it was like Rough and Tumble or something like that.

01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:35.340
But yes.

01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.340
All right.

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:40.880
We're going to travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.860
That's not rumor, that's fact until it gets delayed.

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.260
Loki, what's coming out this week, hopefully?

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:53.880
All right, so this week, let's see, we've got Age of Empires Definitive Edition.

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.060
That's on PC.

01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.180
Armored Warfare on PlayStation 4.

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:02.480
We have Little Witch Academia Chamber of Time.

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:05.140
That's on PC and PlayStation 4.

01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:07.340
Oh, goodie!

01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:12.140
Mel Gear Survive, the non-Kojima Metal Gear game.

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.620
I thought that game came out a fucking long time ago.

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:22.620
No, Mel Gear Survive is coming out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:28.860
Okuto Gotoku on PlayStation 4.

01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:34.300
Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 Plus on Nintendo Switch.

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:35.300
This is awesome.

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.660
Them's Fighting Herds on PC.

01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:39.940
Remember the game that was going to be in fighting?

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:41.540
Oh, yeah, didn't that come up last week on the show?

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:42.540
I thought it did.

01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:43.540
I don't remember.

01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.660
I've been hearing about it on Twitter or something this week, so that's cool.

01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:47.660
Yep.

01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:55.780
Then we've also got Pass Cure on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and Sword Art Online Fatal

01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:59.340
Bullet on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:00.340
That's it.

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:06.340
Alright, traveling over to Japan, the I'm sure incredible title of Metal Gear Survive

01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:09.340
is also coming out in Japan on February 21st.

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:13.700
It's kind of a little bit earlier than the rest of the releases on the 22nd, including

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:23.460
Senran Kagura Burst, Girls und Panzer Dream Tank Match, Kimi no Hitomi ni Hitmi in regular

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:33.140
and limited edition, and then let's see, Azayaka na Irudori no Naka de Kimi Rashiku comes out

01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.580
as well.

01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:39.740
And then there's another game called Summer Lesson, which is like a three-in-one basic

01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:40.740
game.

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.980
Yeah, that is all coming out as well.

01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:47.780
All that in Japan on the PlayStation 4 this week, the Vita seeing some of those releases

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:55.340
too, including Vitamin X Destination, Tokimeki Restaurant, Project Tri-Stars in all sorts

01:41:55.340 --> 01:42:01.220
of different configurations, including a fifth anniversary box, and Harukanaro Toki no Naka

01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:06.500
de Ultimate in like three different configurations of limited editions and so forth.

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:10.860
I don't think the Switch, oh no, the Switch has one pretty big game this week, Rayman

01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:13.780
Legends gets a Japanese Switch release this week.

01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.780
That's pretty cool.

01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:18.700
So you can check that out and let's see if the 3DS has anything.

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.900
No, I think things are slowing down over there.

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.980
So we'll go over to Europe with Dark Sakura.

01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:29.480
On the 20th, we have The Station for Mac, PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:37.180
On the 21st, Rad Rogers for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Steam World Dig 2 for 3DS.

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:44.140
On the 22nd, Metal Gear Survive on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Past Cure for Xbox One.

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:50.660
All right, well, it's time to dive into the mailbag because every week you guys send us

01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:57.140
emails or sometimes you don't, but you send them to participate at orangelauntradio.com

01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:58.660
and Dark Sakura dives in the mailbag.

01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:00.940
Who left the sticky stuff everywhere?

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:05.900
Finds an email, sorry, I spilled the wine, and finds an email worth reading on the air.

01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:07.340
We have one email.

01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:08.340
One email!

01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:09.340
All right, let's do it.

01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:11.500
Participate at orangelauntradio.com.

01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:14.540
Sorry again about the double mailbag submission two weeks ago.

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:18.480
As I said in the second, I didn't see my first and my second items.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:23.080
Just a quick thought here, I see the Nedroid toy line is adding mercy to their Overwatch

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:26.020
collection to go with Tracer and Mei.

01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:31.700
I wonder if they'll do more of these and if so, what the hell would a Roadhog Nedroid

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:32.920
look like?

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:38.000
I sort of wish there were Animal Crossing figures in the line besides just Isabelle,

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:45.460
Robert M. I would actually pay for one if I had a crazy red, which by the way, I'm wearing

01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.040
my crazy red shirt tonight.

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:52.360
It says, looks legit, or seems legit, sorry.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.360
What's a Nedroid?

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.560
The little cute figures, the kind of chibi figures.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:57.640
Not pop vinyls.

01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:58.640
Not pops.

01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.640
This is something new.

01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:02.840
They're expensive, number one.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:05.800
Where pops are like 12 bucks, these are like 60 bucks.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:09.320
I'll find you one, because there's a Nedroid link that I kind of have on.

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.720
There's a Kirby as well, but I'll find you one and link it to you so you can see what

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:14.720
they are.

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.440
Y'all will be happy to know I bought two more pop vinyls over the weekend, by the way.

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.360
I already finished my Drag Race collection, that's been there for a while, but I found

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:30.840
in a store a Liam and a Sarah Ryder so that Allen could finish off his Mass Effect Andromeda

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:31.840
collection.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.440
So now he has all of them.

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:37.920
So I did buy some pop vinyls, because y'all know I love pop vinyls.

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:41.160
I need to get a Vetra, because she's space waifu.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:46.200
Seriously, the playthrough I'm doing now on Andromeda, if I ever get back to it, is a

01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:50.700
Vetra romance, because Turians, meow.

01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:55.640
Overwatch is huge, and if Blizzard license it, it doesn't matter what the toy company

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.320
is, as long as they're putting out quality products, you'll probably see every Overwatch

01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.600
character at some point.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.080
They're doing a Mr. Rogers pop vinyl.

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.080
Yeah.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.080
Yeah.

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:08.080
I want it.

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:11.160
And they're also doing, and I thought I linked it to you, I don't remember.

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.480
The Coming to America dolls?

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.480
PeeWee's Playhouse.

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.480
Oh god.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.480
They're doing everything.

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.280
I just, you know how I feel about it.

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.320
I think the pop dolls, it's too much.

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:22.320
We have too much.

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:25.080
There's too many of them.

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:30.760
I say that, and yet I have my Drag Race dolls and my Golden Girls dolls, so even I get sucked

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:34.240
into it once in a while.

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.720
JD says, are they not Funko Pops anymore?

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:39.880
Oh, I keep calling them Pops, because that's what it says on the box.

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:40.880
You're right.

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.880
They are Funko Pops.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:42.880
I don't know.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:43.880
I'm three glasses in, y'all.

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:44.880
Leave me alone.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:45.880
All right.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:46.880
Is that it for emails?

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:47.880
Yes.

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.280
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.080
In the meantime, let's go into some more news.

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.080
Loki.

01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.380
Everything old is new again, so guess what's coming back?

01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:01.380
That's right.

01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:02.380
Twitch plays Pokemon.

01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.380
Pet rocks.

01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.380
Oh.

01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:05.380
What?

01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:06.800
No pet rocks.

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.320
We said everything old is new again.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.840
I guess maybe not everything.

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.160
Most things.

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.080
So Twitch playing Pokemon, that's right.

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.760
This time, there's a twist.

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.720
Not only are they playing one Pokemon game, but they're playing another Pokemon game at

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:22.720
the same time.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.680
So Pokemon Red and Blue are going on at the same time.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:31.680
On top of that, there is even a ... I don't even know what exactly this is, but there's

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:37.720
a game of Pokemon Pinball being played at the very bottom of the screen as well.

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:42.720
I guess somehow you bet on that, and you can earn tokens to do things.

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.880
So that's kind of neat.

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:51.680
Like the other games, this is mainly ... looks like they do incorporate a democracy mode

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:57.040
every once in a while, but for the most part, it's just whatever the other mode is, the

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:01.960
direct controlling of everything.

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:09.760
And I guess as of right now, looks like I think Pokemon Red is ahead a little bit.

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:11.080
But yeah, looks chaotic.

01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:15.040
So meaning they've gotten a little further in Red than they have in Blue.

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:25.280
Yes, Red right now is stuck in the bushes, and Blue is in a fight right now with Slowbro.

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.280
Thank you for the play-by-play.

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.280
Good stuff.

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:30.520
Oh, they got out of the bushes, woo-hoo!

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:34.680
All right, so yes, exciting stuff.

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.120
I'll take your word for it.

01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.280
All right, hey, this is a follow-up to something we talked about a couple weeks ago, and it

01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:42.520
has to do with the Overwatch League.

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:47.120
The Overwatch League is kind of between ... I don't know, I call it seasons right now, but

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:48.400
it's not like a whole new year.

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.760
I don't know what you describe it.

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:52.680
I guess they're saying stage, so there's stage one and stage two.

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:56.460
So the Overwatch League is on a little break for a couple weeks, and then they're going

01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.800
to come back with some more watches.

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:04.040
Well, during these breaks, the teams in the league have a chance to draft some new players,

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:13.440
and the Overwatch League did draft Kim Guiguri Se-yeon as part of a four-player edition,

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:17.300
and that's the Shanghai Dragons that drafted her to their team.

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:23.840
So it is official the Overwatch League now does have one out of its 100-plus players

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:24.840
is a woman.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:28.800
So, okay, I mean, I know we talked about this a few weeks ago.

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.800
It's a start.

01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:30.800
Thanks for the token.

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.120
Yeah, it's a start.

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.500
And I said when they do that, I would applaud it.

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:39.600
So I will applaud the Shanghai Dragons for taking this move.

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.980
I'm doing orchestra applause, snap, snap, snap.

01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:44.980
It's a start.

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:49.480
But you know, and I actually got into a Twitter dialogue with somebody on this because I wrote

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:54.060
a tweet about it, which got picked up in the moments thing on Twitter.

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:57.340
So I started getting some random replies on this stuff.

01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:04.420
And usually I try not to engage trolls, but I kind of felt like this response was mature

01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:06.220
enough where I could engage in a dialogue.

01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:09.100
So I went in a little bit of a back and forth with somebody.

01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:13.460
And this person kind of got to a point where it's like, well, how many would make you happy?

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:14.460
Half?

01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.460
30%?

01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:18.520
I'm like, it's not about a target number.

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:27.920
But the reality is, is that when one out of hundreds is female, are you saying that 1%

01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.920
of the people that play Overwatch is female?

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:31.920
Is that an accurate representation?

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:33.000
You know what I mean?

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.800
So just, I'm not saying they have to be like a target number, but as I said the first time

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.500
we did this, it should be at least like 10%.

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.040
Is that asking too much when half the population of the planet is female?

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.040
It should be 50%.

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:52.520
But at what level though are the female players?

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:55.000
And it goes with male players too.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.880
What percentages of those are playing at that tournament level?

01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.880
That's what I want to know.

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:03.640
Because you may have half the bases playing that, but maybe they're playing more casually

01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:04.640
than other people.

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.120
And that could be male or female.

01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:08.680
I don't even play competitively.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.240
Here's my little point.

01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.520
I understand that the first thing people come back with is that, well, I only want the people

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.680
that are the most talented and to do this and this.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:21.880
Who's being given that opportunity though?

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:26.460
That's the question we really have to challenge ourselves with is, well, if we don't have

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:32.160
women playing at that entry level that leads into the Overwatch League, then I think the

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.320
real question we need to be asking ourselves is, why?

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:41.400
Why aren't there more women in the entry level when we know there's more women playing the

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:42.400
game?

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.160
Anyway, I don't want to repeat myself too much from a couple of weeks ago.

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.600
I do want to try to leave this on a net positive because, okay, yes, it's progress.

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.680
Sure, I'd like to see progress happen overnight, but you know what?

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:57.400
And Jamie, I think about something we saw today.

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:02.320
We were at the movie theater and there was a poster for some movie coming out and it

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.920
said something like, love isn't always a straight path or something like that.

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:10.480
I don't remember what the term on it was, but remember I turned to you and I said, look

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.480
at that.

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.480
I pointed at the poster.

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.480
I said, look at that.

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:17.200
A 17 year old me would have never thought something like that would ever be in a movie

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:21.120
theater in Sacramento and here we are.

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:29.160
So I can be critical, but at the same time be a bit of a realist and say, okay, this

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:31.920
is a good step in the right direction.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:35.200
I hope we get there a little faster than 20 years, especially if we want esports to be

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:37.660
taken seriously by everybody.

01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:40.480
But this is a good start and I do think that should be acknowledged.

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:46.100
I just hope, you know, we get there in a few years where you don't notice that there's

01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:50.520
way less women than men because it accurately reflects who's playing the game.

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:53.560
Or we get to the same thing with other minority groups too.

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.760
I'm spotlighting the women and men thing, but you know, we're, we're challenged in all

01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:58.760
these areas.

01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:05.540
What I would like to get to a point is where the, where the heart and minds of people have

01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:11.700
changed to the point that it won't matter if there's an inequality in something because

01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:17.800
it is truly based on merit, if that makes sense, where it won't matter, but right now

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.980
we need the representation because it's not, I mean, that's where we're getting all these

01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:30.660
angry, you know, straight white boys from, you know, is that the, and I'm going to use

01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:33.860
the word patriarchy, is being threatened.

01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:39.500
The status quo, their privilege is being threatened and it needs to get to the point where they

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:42.620
need to just accept this is the world.

01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:47.020
And when we get to that point of acceptance, none of this representation is going to be

01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:51.100
necessary because our hearts will already be in the right place.

01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:52.100
That makes sense.

01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:53.100
Yeah.

01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:57.060
And throughout this whole dialogue, I've never said, fire the white dudes.

01:52:57.060 --> 01:53:00.180
I want Overwatch League to be successful.

01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:02.680
And if it's successful, guess what that means?

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:08.380
More teams, more space for diverse and more addition and more, you know, representation,

01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:09.380
all that stuff.

01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:14.340
So I didn't, you don't have to fire the dudes that are already there to make this happen

01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:20.060
except maybe the dudes that talk a little mouthy on their Twitch, but those are exceptions

01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:21.140
to the rule.

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:24.560
Many of the people in the Overwatch League are fabulous and you know, there's nothing,

01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:26.680
you know, nothing negative to say.

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.960
But anyway, long story short, I am officially a Shanghai Dragons fan.

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:31.960
Woo hoo.

01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:32.960
You know what?

01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:36.120
I don't care that they didn't win a match because you know, their record is like zero.

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.800
It's like no wins and all losses.

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:41.160
And this is part of the reason why they're shifting their roster around a little bit.

01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:42.480
But you know what?

01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:48.860
If I live in the town of the Sacramento Kings, I'm used to cheering for the losing team.

01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:51.560
So I am now officially a Shanghai Dragons fan.

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.560
Go dragons.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.560
All right.

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:58.120
Jamie, any interest in watching a Shanghai Dragons match at some point?

01:53:58.120 --> 01:53:59.120
Maybe.

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:00.120
Maybe.

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:01.120
Yeah, it might be fine.

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.120
I don't know.

01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:03.120
Keep in mind how, how motion sick I get on Overwatch.

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:06.440
Well, the good news is when you're watching the league, they're changing things so fast

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:09.920
that you're looking at like overhead maps, you're looking at the arena, like you don't,

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.920
I don't think you have enough time to really be immersed in the first person stuff.

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.920
So anyhow.

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:18.840
I felt so sick playing Overwatch.

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:19.840
Yeah.

01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:20.840
Oh my God.

01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:23.840
DarkTetsuya with a great comment and I think we'll close on this and we'll move on to some

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:25.240
other Overwatch stuff.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:29.560
DarkTetsuya says, I mean, look at the cast of characters in Overwatch anyway.

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:32.880
I'd hope that the pro leagues would reflect that as well.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:33.880
Yeah.

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:38.960
Blizzard, Blizzard, like the best part of Overwatch is the characters.

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.960
And like, it's not, and the thing is, it's not just that they are diverse.

01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:48.440
It's that they are diverse with awesome fucking stories.

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:53.640
Like there's like all the characters are awesome in Overwatch.

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:57.680
Everybody has written a fanfic of all of those characters having sex.

01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:08.320
That's how beloved those characters are probably animated, drawn and performed in some circles.

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:09.760
I just, some anime convention.

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:14.320
I just wish that there were more punitive steps that could be taken against, you know,

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:21.380
these really toxic little boys because I can't think of them as men cause they're just toxic

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:26.460
little boys who have to shit on a girl who's playing better than them, right?

01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:30.880
Or make it hard for women to go in because it's their little boys club.

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.000
Fuck your boys club.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Fuck you.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.460
Your tongue should be cut out.

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:39.100
SS here, when her mat and chat says, I know plenty of women who play Overwatch to get

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:42.460
heckled in competitive mode by immature shits.

01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:48.620
That that is the problem at the lowest level cause they're the lowest type of people.

01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:49.620
No, no, it's not that.

01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:55.740
That is the most entry level problem that has to be solved to fix what's happening here

01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:56.920
at the top.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:01.880
The answer to where are all the other women that are awesome at Overwatch?

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:06.340
The answer to that question starts with addressing that comment.

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:09.020
And that's what this all boils down to.

01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:10.740
Anyway.

01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:14.860
That's what, well that was actually what spawned my phrase about needing more punitive measures

01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:17.460
just cause they're not going to learn on their own.

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:21.460
And clearly their parents didn't teach them how to respect women or else they wouldn't

01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:23.960
be, you know, little shits like this.

01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:26.000
They need to be held accountable.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.620
There needs to be at least a way that you can block a channel from somebody or something

01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:31.620
like that.

01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:35.080
Cause I mean, that's half the reason why I don't play in group chats.

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:41.120
I play on my own and rely on, on text chat in, in game.

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.820
Because if it's not my friends, I don't trust what they're going to say.

01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:46.940
And I honestly don't give a shit.

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:51.140
Backdeft in chat says, what if I want to beat that woman in the game, but because I want

01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:52.580
to be better in the game?

01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:53.580
Great.

01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:55.260
You know, but there's, you'll have to talk down to her.

01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:56.260
Yeah.

01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:57.260
There's a difference between that.

01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:00.020
That's the difference between sportsman like conduct and unsportsmanlike conduct.

01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:03.860
Here's an example that I can think of to kind of relate this to things that I do on a regular

01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:04.860
basis.

01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:05.860
Ingress, right?

01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:06.860
I play that a lot.

01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:11.260
My frenemy here in the neighborhood is, you know, that plays on the other team is a woman,

01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.260
you know?

01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:17.540
I have no problem tearing down her fields and breaking her shit just before checkpoint

01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:21.720
to, you know, make the score hurt or whatever, or make sure that, you know, her team's color

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:26.500
isn't over my house and stuff like that, because that at the end of the day is the game.

01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:31.220
But I respect that she's playing the game and I don't send her nasty messages like,

01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:34.620
you know, stupid lady, get back in the kitchen and all this.

01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:37.180
I don't, I don't, I don't talk to her like that.

01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:40.020
You know, that's, that's unsportsmanlike.

01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:44.980
Whereas sportsmanlike is a little more like, you know, close but no cigar, you know, type

01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:50.820
of things like, you know, or, you know, sometimes she gets a field off because I'm not paying

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:55.340
attention and, you know, oh, good job if you weren't in the kitchen, we're out here blocking

01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:56.340
your.

01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:57.340
Yeah.

01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:58.340
Good job.

01:57:58.340 --> 01:57:59.340
Wrong color.

01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:00.340
LOL.

01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:04.180
You know, it's, it's, well, it just makes me think of, and I had to go look up the name

01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:05.180
of it again.

01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:11.640
In the Olympics, you know, they have the Pierre de Colbertin medal, you know, that is right.

01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.500
Like the, the Miss Congeniality medal.

01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:15.500
Not quite.

01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:17.860
It's for good sportsmanship.

01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:20.500
So like, for one example,

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:23.260
Yay fan favorite.

01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:31.060
Well, here's an example that like in 1964, there was a team whose bobsled missed a bolt.

01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:36.060
So after they had their run, this other team loaned a bolt to their bobsled and the other

01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:37.060
team won.

01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:41.140
But, and he flat out said they didn't win because they gave them the bolt, they won

01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:45.700
because they were faster, but that team still won, though that, that, the leader of that

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:49.380
team still won the, the de Colbertin award.

01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.200
So you know, and it's the same thing.

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:55.180
We should be lifting each other up.

01:58:55.180 --> 01:59:00.420
We should be encouraging each other and, and being a team and it makes the whole game more

01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:01.420
fun.

01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:05.420
And I'm not saying don't talk a little smack in the game, you know, like, Oh, I got you

01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:08.380
now, you know, but don't be a shit.

01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:10.020
Just don't be a shit.

01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:11.420
Yeah.

01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:13.620
And recognize when you're crossing the line.

01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:14.620
You know what I mean?

01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:15.620
Anyway.

01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:16.620
Okay.

01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:17.620
We've talked.

01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:18.860
I ended this segment like three times already.

01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:23.620
We are really moving on to the next story, but it is also about Overwatch kinda, right,

01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:24.620
Jamie?

01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:25.620
Yeah.

01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:31.460
So this is about a fan project that has made some adjustments to Overwatch.

01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:41.940
So basically, they've turned Overwatch into a fighting game and, I mean, complete with,

01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:45.220
with finishers and all kinds of things like that.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:49.980
It was, I'm trying to see who did it.

01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:50.980
Hold on just a second.

01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:53.700
It looks like it, TGN.

01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:59.420
They looks like they made a video of Overwatch as a fighting game.

01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:01.140
And so it's, it's pretty neat.

02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:05.480
I mean, honestly, if Overwatch was a fighting game, I'd play it, but yeah, it's this Overwatch

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:09.180
fighter and I'll send the link into the chat.

02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:11.220
It's on YouTube, but just look up.

02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:13.320
What if Overwatch was a fighter?

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.320
It's pretty fun.

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.740
And that's it really.

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:19.020
All right.

02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:22.300
Just a couple more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the Skype line at orange

02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:28.180
lounge radio, all one word on Skype, but first Loki, you know what the Sims was missing

02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:29.180
drugs.

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.180
No, it's not.

02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:35.060
You can mod it in exactly my point.

02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:36.060
You can mod it in.

02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:37.060
Thank you.

02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:38.060
I don't think I like Jamie's comment.

02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:39.060
Got on the mic.

02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:40.060
I don't know.

02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:42.640
But I said, yeah, you can mod it in.

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:44.780
There's all sorts of stuff already modded into the Sims.

02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:45.780
Yes.

02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:50.300
And one of those mods is a mod by the name of base mental.

02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:52.900
And it's a drug theme on for Sims four.

02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:59.120
You can do different drugs, including cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines, and weed.

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:03.020
And you can also buy and sell and use different drugs.

02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:08.020
And they have like even a drug dealer that's in your neighborhood that's at ABC.

02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:13.020
And then of course, if you also are using another mod by a modern name, wicked whims,

02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:20.220
which is a comprehensive sex mod for Sims four, you can exchange sex for drugs.

02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:25.820
Suddenly the Sims became a lot more interesting suddenly, but this guy, the guy that actually

02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:31.940
makes this, um, he has a Patreon and he's actually being funded almost a $6,000 a month

02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:33.720
to work on this.

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:38.580
So people are interested in maybe I need to reconsider my thoughts on Patreon because

02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:41.300
clearly I'm missing it.

02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:46.700
I clearly, um, they had mods like this even in the first Sims, I actually still have some

02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:48.260
mods and Sims do.

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:49.820
They came with their own animations.

02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:52.860
Remember the Sims online, everybody?

02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:57.700
I have to say based on the screenshots that I'm seeing here, that sex mod is quite comprehensive

02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:00.940
in an almost disturbing faction.

02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:04.500
Um, yeah, I think physic, what?

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:06.300
I don't even know what I'm seeing here.

02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:07.300
This is just weird.

02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:08.300
Okay.

02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:11.260
Anyways, I don't know for that, but yes, the Sims four, it's a silly place.

02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:13.140
It is a silly place.

02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:14.140
It is a silly place.

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:15.140
Let's not go back there.

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:16.140
All right.

02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:17.140
It's only a model.

02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:18.460
All right.

02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:24.220
Uh, and lastly, but certainly not leastly tonight, uh, valve has actually banned a developer

02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:25.220
off of steam.

02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:26.660
And why did they do it?

02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:30.660
Because of, uh, essentially forced reviews that were, you know, you could view this as

02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:33.900
fake, uh, in cell games was the name of the developer.

02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:37.340
They are from Malta, uh, developing various online multiplayer titles.

02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:39.380
Uh, they had been banned from steam.

02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:45.060
This story comes from a Redditor, uh, who posted a leaked email, uh, from in cell game

02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:50.500
CEO, encouraging employees to buy copies of the reimbursed wild Buster.

02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:54.020
I think it was the game, uh, to leave a steam review.

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:58.180
And the email said in part quote, of course I cannot force you to write a review, let

02:02:58.180 --> 02:03:02.720
alone tell you what to write, but I should not have to neglecting the importance of reviews

02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:05.400
will ultimately cost jobs.

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:10.980
If this game fails in cell fails, and then we will all have no jobs next year.

02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:12.660
Get what you reap what you sow.

02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:19.660
So, well, I feel bad for all the other employees who aren't the CEO because now they're fucked

02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:22.740
and it's their CEO, you know, was a dumb fuck.

02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:28.720
But anyway, um, valve said it investigated the claims that were put on Reddit and identified

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.780
unacceptable behavior involving multiple steam accounts controlled by the publisher of the

02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:33.780
game.

02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:37.500
The publisher appears to have used multiple steam accounts to post positive reviews to

02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:38.500
their own games.

02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:44.580
This is a clear violation of our review policy and something we take very seriously, obviously

02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:51.220
in cell games is not like this huge, you know, developer, but, uh, you know, it still is

02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:55.540
certainly a precedent of sorts and hopefully other companies won't make the same mistake

02:03:55.540 --> 02:04:00.440
in cell games did release a statement, uh, talking about this, uh, saying at the day

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:04.600
of launch in December, an email was sent to everyone in the company telling staff about

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:09.220
20 people, including freelancers, how important reviews are in the steam ecosystem.

02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:11.360
It was meant to rally support.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.120
It was never intended to threaten anyone, but just state the importance of reviews for

02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.360
the whole company.

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:19.440
No staff has received penalties for not buying the game.

02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.160
We apologize for the misleading wording, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:24.640
I'm skipping ahead here.

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:29.200
Um, we hope to regain the trust of players and are in further discussion with steam about

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:33.480
the incident until then current steam owners or those in possession of a steam key can

02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:38.460
continue to play normally, but it's just no longer available on the store.

02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:39.640
What do you guys think about that?

02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.740
Is that a good thing that valve smack that down or is just kind of one of those, it really

02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:44.740
doesn't matter anyway.

02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:45.740
Yes.

02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:47.080
It is a good thing that they smacked it down.

02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:53.560
I don't care what their excuses so, and it's, it is one of those things where it's like,

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:57.120
if it's obvious how important the reviews are, then you don't really need to say anything

02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:58.120
at all.

02:04:58.120 --> 02:04:59.120
Right.

02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:06.440
Or, you know, don't go leaving all these fakie fake reviews.

02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:09.680
So I said you reap what you sow.

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:10.680
All right.

02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:15.120
Anyhow, uh, we're going to open up the Skype line, orange lounge radio, all one word on

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:16.120
Skype.

02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:18.720
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe

02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:23.120
something else is on your mind, the Skype line is open now while we wait for a call.

02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:25.360
I'm going to check in to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:27.640
Um, I don't really have anything too much.

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:31.920
I mean, I've, there's a new Barbie doll that's based off tomb Raider.

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:32.920
Okay.

02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:33.920
That's kind of interesting.

02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:34.920
Probably for the movie.

02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:35.920
Yeah.

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.680
So tomb Raider Barbie is going to be 30 bucks.

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:44.600
Um, actually you can preorder now and yeah, she's not having a terrible day just yet,

02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:48.320
but if in the wrong hands, she might, she could.

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.320
Yeah.

02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.320
Right.

02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:51.320
We got a call coming in, so let's get to it.

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.320
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:53.320
Who's this?

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:56.400
I want everyone gather around, gather around, have a drink, have a shot.

02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:57.400
Cause it's Ron, man.

02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:58.400
You know it.

02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:00.480
I've already had a few drinks, but it's always a pleasure to talk to you.

02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:01.480
Rama.

02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:02.480
How are you?

02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:03.480
I'm doing good.

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:06.160
I just finished making dinner in my amazing instant pie.

02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:09.720
I love that little thing.

02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:10.720
Sounds delish.

02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.760
I can't wait for dinner around here, but we got to get through this show first.

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:15.760
What's on your mind tonight?

02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:16.760
All right.

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:22.160
I want to talk about crowd funding, Patreon, all of that.

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:26.520
Now I've already called in about this a couple of months ago.

02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:30.120
Y'all know how I feel about this.

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:37.600
And lately people have been coming to me for advice on podcasting, streaming, and so forth.

02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:44.520
And the main piece of advice I tell people is unless you have major financial backing

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:48.440
behind you, just do it for the fun of it.

02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:49.440
Just roll with it.

02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.160
You'll have one listener, one streamer.

02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:54.640
You can have tens, hundreds of streamers.

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:56.060
It's going to fluctuate up and down.

02:06:56.060 --> 02:07:02.480
As long as you get out there, roll with it, have fun with it, it's going to be okay.

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:06.440
And then it goes to what about all the equipment that you get?

02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:12.040
And I say, I pay out of pocket for it because this is something I want to do.

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.240
This is something that's fun.

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:18.680
And then it goes to what about putting yourself out there for sponsorship and stuff.

02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:24.620
And I'm like, truthfully, most people are not going to pay to hear me foam at the mouth

02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:32.520
about what's wrong with the cosplay and anime communities and the fandom in a whole.

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:33.520
You're right.

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:34.800
You have to have an angle.

02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:39.000
You got to think about, and I say this a lot to people that are, I don't want to discourage

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:45.840
anyone from podcasting, but people that want to be successful with a podcast, think of

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:50.040
what is that quick 30-second elevator pitch about your show?

02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:53.520
Can you condense that into one tagline like they do with a movie?

02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:56.080
What's the tagline to kind of sell your show?

02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:00.160
That's one big thing I really stress people to do with their show.

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:08.160
And don't, and here's my, the truth hurts, but a real friend's going to tell you this.

02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:14.360
If your podcast tagline is, just some friends sitting around talking shit about games, cancel

02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.640
your podcast immediately.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:21.520
Well, I will say that there are probably a couple of people who are running with that

02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:25.960
tagline and probably because how they're doing their show, they can get away with it.

02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:29.420
But just because they're doing it, that doesn't mean you have to.

02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:33.960
And also just because there are a bunch of people talking about this particular fandom

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:36.600
or this or that, that's not stopping you.

02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:38.200
You can go ahead and talk about it.

02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:42.200
Yes, there are multiple podcasts out there about anime, cosplay, whatever, but we talk

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:44.160
about it from a different point of view.

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:48.520
We're local to a particular area, so how we talk and discuss how things are could be

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.280
different from a bunch of fans doing it from California.

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.720
We have sort of like a sister podcast called Zero Hour, similar to us, but they're based

02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:56.720
out of California.

02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:59.960
Their experiences are different from ours and we're out of New York.

02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:03.640
And they don't do the Patreon, they pay out of pocket like we do.

02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:09.040
Now they have this thing called Ko-Fi, you know, if you like us, buy us a cup of coffee.

02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:10.280
That I can get with.

02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.120
You don't have to make promises or anything like that.

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:14.400
It's a tip jar.

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.240
You like us, buy us a cup of coffee.

02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:19.400
I kind of like that, you know, because that's similar to the Twitch model.

02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.540
Show me your biddies.

02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:23.720
If you like, you know, me playing the game, show me, show me your biddies.

02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:24.720
Exactly.

02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:25.720
Yeah.

02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:28.040
Oh, and the only thing and the thing I want to, you know, make sure I'm clarified with

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:31.320
my statement, because I would never tell anyone not to podcast.

02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:35.320
But the reason why I say if your tagline is four people talking shit about video games

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:39.320
or whatever it is and why just don't fucking do that show is because in part of what you

02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:42.520
said is that there's already a bunch of shows that are doing that angle.

02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:47.960
But at the same time, like if your podcast is a fan podcast, then sitting around talking

02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:51.480
shit is does not make you that great of a fan.

02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:57.000
There's a difference between being critical and talking shit.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:03.080
That's why I don't give the podcast critical myth any blowback, because there's nothing

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.960
wrong with taking a critical eye to fan them.

02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:08.760
But that's very, very different than talking shit.

02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:10.000
Does that make sense?

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Exactly.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Yeah.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.760
So if that's I mean, that that's why I think a tagline like sitting around talking shit

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.960
is kind of a lazy tagline.

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:24.540
And then the other one that I'm just again, honest truth.

02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:32.960
It's like the view, but with gay guys don't don't be only because that one isn't so bad

02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:38.360
in the fact of like, wait, but it's just that that that's like every show with several gay

02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:40.800
co if it's the view with gay guy.

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:42.240
No, I'm going to need some.

02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:45.480
I'm going to need a more specific answer.

02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:46.480
See that.

02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.480
I'm sorry.

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:48.480
What was that wrong?

02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:49.840
You got cut out there?

02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:50.840
Sorry.

02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:52.840
That reminds me of a question.

02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:54.400
Yeah.

02:10:54.400 --> 02:11:00.560
I need to know is shaking and crying the spiritual successor to guys on the show?

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:01.560
No it is not.

02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:02.560
OK.

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:03.840
It is not that.

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:06.580
No, because guys on the show is on hiatus.

02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:08.960
It is not over.

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:12.840
And you know, just Extfer and Victoria are two different people.

02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:16.080
And I've just really tried to kind of give the show sort of a different flow to it.

02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:22.600
I think it kind of feels like a successor because, oh, it's Rob's non gaming show.

02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:27.040
But there's room for both in the world if it ever works out that Extfer and I can do

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:28.040
a show again.

02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:34.200
Fair enough, because I'm looking forward to that, too.

02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:38.720
And then Bobby, Bobby's disagreeing with me in chat saying, no, Rob, I was told that negativity

02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:40.000
is funny.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.680
People who are positive are boring.

02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:44.400
You have to be negative to be entertaining and funny.

02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:47.080
I got this lecture last year.

02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:50.100
And then and why everyone loves Loki rants.

02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:51.100
They're funny.

02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:52.100
OK.

02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:55.440
But and I'm almost positive I said this to you then.

02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:01.380
The thing with the Loki rants is, again, I go back to my Tyra Banks top model things.

02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:03.600
Do you like Nintendo games, Loki?

02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:04.600
Sure.

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.680
See, that's the difference there is that, you know, at the end of the day, Loki gets

02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:13.200
frustrated because he sees Nintendo is like should be kind of grabbing on all the latest

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:14.200
and greatest technologies.

02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:15.800
And I see all these other companies do these things.

02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:16.800
And why not?

02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:20.800
And that's kind of different than like I fucking hate Nintendo and Nintendo.

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:24.480
Everybody there is, you know, sucking 20 dicks and like all this stupid stuff.

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:27.480
Well, that would explain why they're too busy to get networking working.

02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:29.320
Some people do like sucking that much dick.

02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:30.320
I'm just saying.

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:31.760
But anyway, that's that's the difference.

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:35.420
And I, I realize there's other people out there saying something different.

02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:37.300
I disagree.

02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:40.620
And those negative shows are things I don't want to watch.

02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:44.540
And I don't watch that YouTube channel you cited.

02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:46.540
But you know, what do I know?

02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:50.680
I've had this podcast for 15 years and we don't have squatty potty advertisements.

02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:52.860
So maybe I've got it all wrong.

02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:55.180
But I like to think at the end of the day, I'm doing a good thing.

02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:58.300
Well, I think you do because it was for your show.

02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:02.740
I wouldn't have my podcast and I wouldn't have like two other spin off shows I've been

02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:03.740
working on.

02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:09.180
One of the podcasts we do, we talk about, yeah, we kind of go into a negative aspect

02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:13.940
because we feel our opinions or whatever it is, no one hears it.

02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:19.980
So we just go out there is like, well, if 85 percent of people say this is great and

02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:24.580
we're at 50 percent says, no, this is trash, we're going to tell you why.

02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:29.020
It's like, OK, now you're going to kind of listen and be like, OK, here you go.

02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:30.020
Yeah.

02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:32.980
And to be fair, Bobby points out in chat.

02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:34.260
I was setting you up.

02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:35.260
This is the set up.

02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:36.680
And then Rob hits it over the net.

02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:40.740
You did tell me this in person that, Bobby, I'm three drinks in.

02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:44.300
I'm a little slow tonight, sorry.

02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:48.840
But thank you for the set up anyway.

02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:52.700
And I agree with that Akuma JP is saying, I think you say it very succinctly here.

02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:55.780
If you do it just because negative, then no.

02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:56.900
And that and that's the difference.

02:13:56.900 --> 02:14:01.980
If you're doing a show to be negative, no, don't do it.

02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:04.660
Or do a show about something you do like.

02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:05.660
That's all.

02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:06.660
Anyway.

02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:09.300
Good times with soap boxes, Rama.

02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:10.580
Well, I try.

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:11.580
All right.

02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:13.900
I'm going to let you go so we try to squeeze in some more calls.

02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:14.900
But take care.

02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:19.940
And of course, support indie radio such as anime jam session Tuesday nights here at Vogue.

02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:20.940
That's right.

02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:21.940
All right.

02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:22.940
Take care.

02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:23.940
Remember, pre shows 915.

02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:24.940
We go live at 930.

02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:25.940
OK.

02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:26.940
Fair enough.

02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:27.940
Take care, my friend.

02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:28.940
Take care, bro.

02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:30.940
Bye bye.

02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:31.940
Phones are lighting up tonight.

02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:32.940
Let's get to it.

02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:33.940
Hi.

02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:34.940
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:35.940
Who's this?

02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:36.940
Hey, what's up, guys?

02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:37.940
It's Kajuno.

02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:38.940
You can hear me?

02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:39.940
Yeah.

02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:40.940
We can hear you.

02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:41.940
Long time.

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:42.940
What's up, Kajuno?

02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:43.940
Thank you.

02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:44.940
Thank you so much.

02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:45.940
I'm using this little microphone, so I'm sure you can hear me.

02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:46.940
Yeah.

02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:47.940
I just wanted to point something out real quickly, and then I'll let you guys get to

02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:48.940
some more calls.

02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:54.460
You mentioned that Nintendo is looking for a Wii Sports for VR.

02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:57.940
And I just want to tell you, Wreck Room is like the Wii Sports for VR.

02:14:57.940 --> 02:14:59.620
That thing is so much fun.

02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:00.620
It's a free game.

02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:04.740
So maybe that's why people aren't really taking that much notice to it.

02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:06.900
But I mean, this thing is fun.

02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:11.900
You're playing laser tag in there, you're playing paintball, they have a room for charades,

02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:13.740
which is freaking hilarious.

02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:17.460
When you play charades, you're actually using, I don't know what you would call this, this

02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:21.020
type of gun that you have that squirts out this foam.

02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:26.580
So you're drawing things in the third dimension, which is really hilarious.

02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:30.620
And the only game I would say that doesn't work in it is that they have some type of

02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:36.060
soccer game that, I don't know what the hell I'm doing in that game, but they have dodgeball.

02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:39.700
They also have some little RPG stuff you can go through in there, where they have a thing

02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:47.700
where it's like a four-man RP group, and you're going through this room, and somebody has

02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:51.460
a sword, somebody has a bow and arrow, and you're fighting these monsters.

02:15:51.460 --> 02:15:55.700
They have a pirate ship thing coming up, where it's going to have a pirate theme.

02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:59.380
I mean, they're just knocking out the park with this game, I mean, there's so much in

02:15:59.380 --> 02:16:00.380
this game.

02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:01.380
A lot.

02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:05.780
It's a community game, so it's social, everyone's talking, everyone's having fun.

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:10.140
I appreciate what you're doing here with the recommendation, and it does sound like it's

02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:14.740
an awesome game, but to go back with the whole thing about why I brought up Wii Sports in

02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:21.820
particular, it's not quite that literal, where it's the collection of mini games and so forth.

02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:29.060
It's more that the Wii Sports was the app, it was the thing that really showed off why

02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:35.060
you would swing around and flail in your own home, and why you needed specifically the

02:16:35.060 --> 02:16:39.180
Wii, and not PlayStation 3 and not Xbox 360.

02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:42.940
You needed a Wii, because that was the only way you were going to actually swing that

02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:49.020
tennis racket into your hand, and so many people who bought the Wii, they weren't buying

02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:52.620
the Wii as much as they were buying Wii Sports.

02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:58.340
In a very similar way, in some ways, that many people who bought the Switch weren't

02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:01.580
just buying the Switch, they were buying Breath of the Wild.

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:11.660
And I completely understand that Breath of the Wild was also on Wii U, but for so many

02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:16.500
people that skipped the Wii U and kind of never really understood that it was separate

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:22.900
from the Wii and all that stuff, Breath of the Wild was really a breath of fresh air

02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:27.460
in many ways for Zelda fans, and the fact that you could do it portable and everything,

02:17:27.460 --> 02:17:29.160
that's what people were buying.

02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:32.820
So what VR needs, is it needs whatever it is.

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:39.380
Yeah, I didn't mean to cut you off, but I do have another point to make there.

02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:44.580
But yeah, I totally get what you're saying about why it's not necessarily the sports

02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:48.420
aspect of the game that brought people into it, it's just that it kind of demonstrated

02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:52.460
like all the things you can do on the Wii, and that's exactly what Rec Room does.

02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:57.900
Like it's not so much that it's comparison with the Wii Sports because they have sports

02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:04.580
games in it, it's just that it kind of demos all the possibilities you can have in VR,

02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:08.100
the social, being in a room where like, I guess I think it's like maybe 10 people can

02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:09.100
fit in a room.

02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:13.100
So it's like 10 of you inside of Rec Room, they also have like a private room that you

02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:16.620
can create your own room, they have some type of new logic system that they just created

02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:23.140
where it's kind of like a take on the Labo thing from Nintendo, where you can make things

02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:26.860
within the world now and just kind of make your own little mini games and little robots

02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:27.860
and crap.

02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:33.540
And I mean, it's just so much, like I said, it kind of just demonstrates every possible

02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:38.980
thing you can do in VR and you just have a good old time with it, so I still think it

02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:43.500
is that app that everyone's looking for to make them buy VR.

02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:47.100
Only thing is, you know, if somebody's like a graphic junkie, you know, they may run away

02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:51.660
from it because it's not the prettiest game in the world, but if you can overlook that,

02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:55.020
I mean, you're in for a treat because this one is the best game I ever played.

02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:59.460
Alright, so fair enough, maybe it's not the mascot game now, but maybe people should give

02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:00.820
it another look and it should be.

02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:02.460
I can respect that angle.

02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:03.460
Yeah, definitely good.

02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:04.460
Alright.

02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:07.580
So I'll let you get to some calls, and great show as always.

02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:08.580
Thank you.

02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:13.820
Alright, I'm trying to cut myself off for the evening just in case I need to go out

02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:14.820
later.

02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:15.820
I'm cut off for now.

02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:16.820
So thank you, my friend.

02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:17.820
Take care.

02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:18.820
Alright.

02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:19.820
Bye.

02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:20.820
Alright.

02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:22.940
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:19:22.940 --> 02:19:27.700
I saw some other calls trying to get in, so go ahead and try to give us a call.

02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:29.860
There it is, lighting up again.

02:19:29.860 --> 02:19:32.740
Some weeks I'm begging for phone calls, some weeks it's ringing off the hook.

02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:33.740
Excuse me.

02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:34.740
Hello.

02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:35.740
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:36.740
Who's this?

02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:37.740
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:38.900
Hey, Akdeft.

02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:39.900
What's up, buddy?

02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:46.420
Well, I wanted to call last week, but I couldn't, it was kind of late.

02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:52.860
And I forgot to make an email about this, but about the evil lineup that was announced

02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:53.860
last week.

02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:58.820
Oh yeah, we got to that in rapid fire news, and there was a lot of people, well I don't

02:19:58.820 --> 02:20:04.500
know about a lot, but certainly people noticed that Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite was not there.

02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:11.140
Yeah, but that was kind of expected, because the game isn't doing that great, even the

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:17.540
community isn't playing that much, and the competition for that is kind of dead.

02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:23.140
But I don't want to talk about, necessarily, Marvel, but the Smash Bros. in L.A.

02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:24.140
Oh, okay.

02:20:24.140 --> 02:20:25.740
What's on your mind?

02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:30.540
That game needs to die.

02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:33.440
Like seriously, needs to die.

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:40.060
So you're not a fan of the game still showing up, even though we're now on what Smash Bros.

02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:46.520
for 3DS and Wii U, and probably, honestly, there's a real good chance at E3 this year,

02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:49.800
we're going to see something about Smash Bros. on the Switch, and they'll still be playing

02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:51.240
it on the GameCube.

02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:58.360
Yeah, I don't know, I moved on from L.A. like really, really long time ago, especially because

02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:05.400
the Smash for Wii U and 3DS, it's like really good, it's like the best Smash up to date.

02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:11.960
But the thing with Smash Melee is, I don't know how the competitive scenes managed to

02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:20.480
keep even growing, because it has grown in the last few years, and managed to get that

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:28.560
tons of views, even despite the game getting really boring, really stale, because you see

02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:40.560
the same characters, basically, aside from someone like Hungrybox, or other people like,

02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:46.840
I'm trying to remember someone, but someone that uses Ice Climbers, or even Armada that

02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:51.000
switches from Fox to Peach.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:55.880
I think the fact that Twitch is around now, and it wasn't around when the GameCube was

02:21:55.880 --> 02:22:01.960
first out, like maybe that is kind of lending itself to why what's old is new again, in

02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:05.680
a way, but who knows how long that wave's going to last.

02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:09.080
But you know, at Def, there's many people that just suspect that whatever we're going

02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:13.560
to get on the Switch is just going to be the Wii U Smash Bros. with some tweaks, but what

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:19.560
if the joke is, at Def, that it's Super Smash Bros. Melee for Switch?

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:20.560
Shut up.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:27.900
That's okay, they'll never do backwards compatibility.

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:30.040
Thank god for that.

02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:32.360
I love when the listeners tell me to shut up.

02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:33.760
Oh, Rob.

02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:36.400
Well then what's the point of me talking?

02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:41.000
No, but that would be, I'm sorry, I can't help myself, I can't help myself.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:47.440
But seriously, even with Twitch, or without it, you see in the local competitive scenes

02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:55.800
in many places that Melee is the one that pretty much has the people.

02:22:55.800 --> 02:23:02.640
And again, despite the game getting really boring, seriously, if you have paid attention

02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:11.960
to the latest or the last few tournaments, like really big tournaments, for that game,

02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:17.240
it's like almost every single people uses the same character, which is Fox, because

02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:21.620
it is obviously the best character because it's really broken.

02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:28.680
But that makes the game really boring to see through Watch, which is kind of what happened

02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:35.080
to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, because the game was also getting really boring.

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:41.120
And last year even, the game wasn't even supposed to be on Evo, but because of donations

02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:53.160
and something, they did the donations thing for like nine games, and the one who, or the

02:23:53.160 --> 02:24:01.040
community who donated the most, had their game on Evo.

02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:07.040
And only because of that, because even like, it was close to losing to Pokken last year,

02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:10.160
like $1,000 short.

02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:16.440
But with Melee, the only thing that justifies it is because it gets the views.

02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:24.000
Even more than Street Fighter V, which is the main tournament at Evo, it gets more viewers.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:29.440
And again, I don't know why, I even pretty much promised myself that I wouldn't watch

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:34.480
the Melee tournament, even the top eight, because I really don't want to support that

02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:36.000
game anymore.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:42.760
I want to, for the community as a whole, the Smash Bros. community, not Melee, not Smash

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:47.960
War, Brawl, whatever, I want the community as a whole to grow.

02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:55.200
And that's the thing, Smash War is getting stale too, because many people are dropping

02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:59.480
it or are moving to other stuff.

02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:05.640
So I would rather for the people to, for the community to, okay, let's move to this game,

02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:10.680
which is the most recent, and just wait for Nintendo to announce the Switch one.

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:16.040
So that's probably going to come, at least an announcement this year, like you said.

02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:26.560
But again, I really want this year to be the last one I see Melee on Evo's roster, because

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:28.360
it really, really needs to die.

02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:33.320
At the end of the day, Akdeft, at the end of the day, honestly, some things just can't

02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:39.120
be explained, and it may also be part of that same phenomenon as to, why did we bring back

02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:45.600
Will and Grace, and The X-Files, and Roseanne, and all these shows of the 90s are all of

02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:47.120
a sudden coming back.

02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:51.880
And some are just as good as they were, like Twin Peaks I thought was just as good as it

02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:53.040
ever was.

02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:57.400
Some are not quite as good as they were, you know what I mean?

02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:02.180
Maybe it's something to do when it comes to Melee about, this is the game I grew up on,

02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:06.440
this is my comfort zone, and I don't like new, I don't like change.

02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:13.620
And so maybe some people just have a hard time letting that go.

02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:24.800
And I know that, because it's Nintendo, and they also pretty much use nostalgia for it.

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:33.920
And again, while I get mad at a Melee HD remake, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo does something

02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:35.180
like that.

02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:42.720
I wouldn't mind it either, if they actually balanced it, and make it actually better.

02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:47.600
But if they make the same game, if it stays the same, why bother?

02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:49.560
Like really, why bother?

02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:54.000
Well maybe there's some, and S2100Matt in chat says, let's see if ACT gets hate mail

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.640
in the mailbag.

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:57.480
Let's see, let's see.

02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:01.780
If you are still a fond fan of Melee, tell us about why this game still deserves its

02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:03.560
time in the spotlight.

02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:05.620
Send us an email, we'd love to read it on air.

02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:10.500
So we'll act deaf for now, I'm gonna let you go, but I appreciate your passionate opinions.

02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:12.940
Hey, thanks for having me, like always.

02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:16.820
Thank you, take care buddy.

02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:20.580
Kaijuto in chat says, it's not official 90s until they bring back Martin.

02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:22.220
I heard they were.

02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:24.680
I heard Martin was coming back.

02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:25.980
Wasn't that supposed to be like a thing?

02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:27.020
I haven't heard that.

02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:28.980
I thought for sure I heard somewhere that Martin-

02:27:28.980 --> 02:27:31.140
I know, I'm sure as hell not watching Roseanne.

02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:33.320
Yeah, Roseanne kind of-

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:34.320
Unfortunately-

02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.460
Although God and Jackie was so good in that movie.

02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:40.580
I'm gonna have to watch it because my wife adores Roseanne and so, you know.

02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:45.780
Yeah, but she knows Roseanne's gone a little, you know, cuckoo in the past few years, right?

02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:46.780
No.

02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:49.260
Having her as a dump supporter.

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:51.740
So it's just, yeah, anyway.

02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:54.300
Yeah, Ramas in chat says it is coming back.

02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:57.220
That's when I thought I heard that Martin was coming back, can you believe that?

02:27:57.220 --> 02:28:00.620
Now I say it isn't the 90s until In Living Color comes back.

02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:03.600
I was just gonna say, why don't we bring back In Living Color?

02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:06.720
If you want to talk about the definitive Fox television program-

02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:07.720
That shit was awesome.

02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:09.240
From the 90s, it was In Living Color.

02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:13.120
But then would it be all this, oh my God, can you imagine if they could get like Jim

02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:18.120
Carrey and all the Wayans family and like all of them back?

02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:20.920
Not so much Jim Carrey, but like what the hell are the Wayans doing?

02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:22.320
Why not get Jim Carrey?

02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:29.120
Like if it is a super limited like four episode, six episode thing, why the fuck not get Jim

02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:30.120
Carrey?

02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:33.340
He's like, he's eccentric now and just like, I don't think, yeah.

02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:35.220
He could do like, he could do like one sketch.

02:28:35.220 --> 02:28:37.100
I would love to see that, but-

02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:38.660
We just need him to bring back Vera.

02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:43.560
Have him do Fire Marshal, Bill, or Vera like one time and that's all you need.

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:45.580
Like and then they put his name on it and at least he's a part of it.

02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:49.620
But like they couldn't do like half the sketches that they did before because they're so like

02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:52.060
quote unquote offensive nowadays, like handy man.

02:28:52.060 --> 02:28:54.060
I would still laugh at men on film.

02:28:54.060 --> 02:28:55.060
That shit was funny.

02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:56.060
I'm sorry.

02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:57.220
I would still laugh.

02:28:57.220 --> 02:28:59.940
But you're right, like humor has changed a bit.

02:28:59.940 --> 02:29:03.600
So they might have to write the show a different way, but I bet it would still be funny.

02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:04.600
I don't know.

02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:05.600
Maybe not.

02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.360
Maybe some things are best left in the past.

02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:10.440
Bring back mad TV while we're at it, I guess.

02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:13.640
Oh, Kaishudo in chat says Wayans brothers were pushed out.

02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:16.600
I'm sure they can't bring it back cause someone else owns it.

02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:17.600
That's right.

02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:20.620
Cause what wasn't like the last season of In Living Color was like kind of a shadow

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:22.000
of its former self.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.600
Like didn't it kind of, I don't know.

02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:24.600
Yeah.

02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:28.540
I think there were some problems towards the end, but most of us don't remember that cause

02:29:28.540 --> 02:29:33.000
we stopped watching In Living Color after like four, four years or so.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:37.800
So uh, Tiger Claw in chat says Jamie Foxx as Wanda.

02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:38.800
Remember those skits?

02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:39.800
Oh yeah.

02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:40.800
I'm gonna rock your world.

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:46.040
Uh, and Homie the Clown, Hamon, God, that was some classic television.

02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:47.040
Of course.

02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:52.040
I also have a lot of love for Saturday Night Live, you know, especially in those same years

02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:56.840
were like, like, you know, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, like all those, you know, 1994 era.

02:29:56.840 --> 02:29:57.840
Oh yeah.

02:29:57.840 --> 02:29:59.660
Phil Hartman, rest in peace.

02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:03.060
Like, you know, just some of the most amazing performers.

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:08.940
So the nineties were a great time for comedy, but, but who knows, maybe there's a caller

02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:12.660
into some comedy podcasts out there that's like, get over the nineties comedy.

02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:14.020
It wasn't that funny.

02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:15.500
Who knows?

02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:16.500
I don't know.

02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:17.500
I don't know.

02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:21.180
Uh, I'll put out one more shout out for the call in line, Orange Lounge Radio, all one

02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:22.780
word on Skype.

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:25.140
If you want to call in and say hello to us.

02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:29.520
Uh, JD in chat says, I remember Full House, but that's already come back.

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:30.520
Yeah.

02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:33.880
God, they're on like fourth or fifth season of that Fuller House.

02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:36.920
Netflix sure changed the game, didn't it?

02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:39.740
Still don't know if I want to watch it.

02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:42.180
It's Fuller House.

02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:44.800
Just cause Candace Cameron.

02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:49.200
If you could just kind of like, you know, like realize she's already been paid for it

02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:51.480
and it's, it's not going to change anything.

02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:56.180
It's one of those things where it's like, if you know exactly what you're signing up

02:30:56.180 --> 02:31:04.140
to watch and that is a cheesy fucking TGIF comedy, cause those shows were so stupid.

02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:05.140
They were.

02:31:05.140 --> 02:31:07.300
But like they were so stupid, they were funny.

02:31:07.300 --> 02:31:11.020
And that's exactly what like Fuller House is, is it kind of maintains that same level

02:31:11.020 --> 02:31:12.460
of comedy.

02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:19.220
So um, now the, the one Netflix show I hear is really good that I had no interest in watching

02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:21.920
because I was like, why do you reboot this show?

02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:25.840
But apparently one day at a time, everybody tells me is amazing on Netflix.

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:26.840
Oh, huh.

02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:27.840
I didn't even know they did.

02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:28.840
They were doing that one.

02:31:28.840 --> 02:31:29.840
Yeah, they did.

02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:33.120
Except they reimagined it as a, I believe it's an all Latino family this time.

02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:34.120
Huh?

02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:38.920
So, um, but yeah, and that was a show that was on like, I remember it on like Nickelodeon

02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:44.000
at night because, or, or one of those like maybe syndicated on channel 58 or one of those

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.320
networks before they were the WB and that stuff like during the day because like those

02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:49.860
shows were on like the early seventies.

02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:50.860
Right.

02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:51.860
One day at a time.

02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:52.860
Huh.

02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:53.860
Interesting.

02:31:53.860 --> 02:31:54.860
Yeah.

02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:55.860
Yeah.

02:31:55.860 --> 02:32:00.300
Now that original one was like on in 1975 and it had, um, Valerie Bertinelli in it.

02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:01.300
That's right.

02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:02.300
It was a Valerie Bertinelli show.

02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:03.300
Yeah.

02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:07.860
Cause then Valerie Bertinelli went on to do Valerie's family, right?

02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:10.060
She got her own show with Valerie's family.

02:32:10.060 --> 02:32:13.740
And then there was like a fight between her and the producers and they fucking killed

02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:14.740
her character.

02:32:14.740 --> 02:32:15.740
Mackenzie Phillips.

02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:17.900
And renamed the show, the Hogan family.

02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:18.900
I remember.

02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:19.900
Yeah.

02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:20.900
It was Sandy Duncan.

02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:21.900
And then the show kind of really took off.

02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:25.440
Most people remember that show as the Hogan family, not as Valerie's family.

02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:28.640
But I had forgotten that Mackenzie Phillips was also in it too.

02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:29.640
Yeah.

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:30.640
Oh yeah.

02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:31.640
Oh yeah.

02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:32.640
One day at a time.

02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:33.640
Wasn't that a, uh, what's his name?

02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:34.920
Bonnie Franklin was the mom and she's dead.

02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:42.280
That ultra famous producer of all those fucking shows like, uh, uh, uh, oh my God.

02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:43.280
Those were the days.

02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:44.280
All in the family.

02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:45.280
All in the family.

02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:48.540
Done by, uh, crap.

02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:49.740
I just had Norman Lear.

02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:50.740
Norman Lear.

02:32:50.740 --> 02:32:51.740
Thank God.

02:32:51.740 --> 02:32:52.740
I'm like, you're killing me Smalls.

02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:53.740
No, I couldn't remember either.

02:32:53.740 --> 02:32:55.540
Norman Lear did one day at a time, right?

02:32:55.540 --> 02:32:56.540
Yeah.

02:32:56.540 --> 02:32:58.300
I think he's doing this new one too.

02:32:58.300 --> 02:32:59.500
Oh, interesting.

02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:03.500
Because I think he was on another podcast promoting it and that's how I heard that it

02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:04.500
was happening.

02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:05.500
Yeah.

02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:08.740
But one thing I've always liked about Norman Lear shows is that he tackled massive social

02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:11.940
issues and was really progressive.

02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:16.240
But you want to talk about something, Loki, that would be really offensive by today's

02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:17.240
terms.

02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:18.240
Go back and look at all in the family.

02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:19.240
Yes.

02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:20.240
Holy shit.

02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:21.240
Like, but that-

02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:26.840
But a lot of the show was challenging Archie's, you know, uh, prejudices.

02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:27.840
Yeah.

02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:28.840
Yeah.

02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:30.800
With, without all in the family, we wouldn't have had Maude.

02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:31.800
Yeah.

02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:39.120
Well, Bea Arthur is a, well, I know she's literally a goddess now ascended to the heavens.

02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:41.280
I hope Bea Arthur is watching over us now.

02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:44.820
And I'm sorry, I'm on my wine break.

02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:46.840
All right.

02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:50.660
We know what movie that's from, right?

02:33:50.660 --> 02:33:51.660
History of the World.

02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:52.660
Oh, of course.

02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:53.660
Of course.

02:33:53.660 --> 02:33:56.460
Cause she played the unemployment lady.

02:33:56.460 --> 02:34:02.020
I'm trying to remember if it was that or one of the other Mel Brooks movies.

02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:03.020
I'm three glasses in.

02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:04.020
It's all a blur.

02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:05.020
All right.

02:34:05.020 --> 02:34:07.860
Anyway, nobody else is calling in on Skype, so I think that's going to wrap it up for

02:34:07.860 --> 02:34:13.520
all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, uh, tonight.

02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:16.880
But we, of course, we can't end the show until we get everybody's final thoughts.

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:19.000
So we're going to go around the room and get the final thoughts.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Of course, I'm going to say to you guys, as I do every week, thank you so much for tuning

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.520
in and getting through this episode of Orange Lounge Radio, which was full of wine and tangents.

02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:28.520
And uh-

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:29.520
I didn't have a lot of wine myself.

02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:30.520
Well, I sure did.

02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:34.080
Uh, but I want to thank you guys, of course, for tuning in and listening and supporting

02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:35.080
the show.

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:37.680
You know, as we ask here at Orange Lounge Radio every week, if you enjoyed the show,

02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:39.560
please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:42.860
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only

02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:44.860
if the voices are here to air.

02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:48.140
So please tell the friend about the show.

02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:53.260
You can also leave a five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play Podcast.

02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:59.460
Those reviews help a lot, let me tell you, so podcasts really value that stuff.

02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:03.300
I think that's all I can think of, so let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:04.820
I'll start tonight.

02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:09.500
My final thought is, I didn't mention during my gaming week that I was still playing Pokemon

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:13.160
Red or no, I'm sorry, Pokemon Yellow.

02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:18.700
And I'm going to play some more Pokemon Yellow, I think, because I'm going to get those Pokemon

02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:25.320
in the Pokemon bank for hopefully Gen 8 so I can play Gen 8 with Gen 1 Pokemon because

02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:26.320
that's me.

02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:28.840
Uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought?

02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:35.620
If I'm not super exhausted after work, I plan on streaming, so, um, it's, uh, I think my

02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:41.560
channel is DarkSakura underscore O-L-R, so I think you're right.

02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:45.280
So just hang out or something and subscribe, please.

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.280
Awesome.

02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:47.840
Because I said so.

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:50.320
And last but certainly not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:52.040
I should probably stream something someday.

02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:54.840
I have so many things I could stream.

02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:57.600
Why don't you point a camera at your cabinet?

02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:02.200
Um, because I don't really have a camera that I can point at the cabinet.

02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:03.720
I have my old USB.

02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:10.520
I have like, I have like an old like, um, Sony Handycam that does HD, but like, I don't

02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:14.960
know about getting that to like actual video and who would want to watch me play?

02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:19.600
It's the lighting's not good because I only have one light, one fluorescent light in there

02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:29.720
and no one wants to see me out of shape trying to play, you know, standard difficulty songs.

02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:30.960
No one wants to watch that.

02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:31.960
Bobby Blackwolf in chat.

02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:33.600
I'm hearing excuses.

02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:34.600
Me too.

02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:41.520
No, I meant like a non like DDR, you know, like I, like I could play like you could stream

02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:46.100
yourself programming a game.

02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:49.300
That's also not real fun to watch right now, but yes.

02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:51.020
I could do that.

02:36:51.020 --> 02:36:55.500
Like if I was actually talented, I could do that.

02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:56.500
Yes.

02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:57.500
You are talented.

02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:58.940
Everybody's talented in their own way.

02:36:58.940 --> 02:36:59.940
All right.

02:36:59.940 --> 02:37:03.020
Uh, that's going to do it for another night here at orange lounge radio.

02:37:03.020 --> 02:37:04.860
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show.

02:37:04.860 --> 02:37:08.580
I appreciate it and we will see you in seven days to do it all over again.

02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:09.580
Sound good.

02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:10.580
Awesome.

02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:11.580
Good night.
