00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
What do Nazis, Aliens, Oracles, and Hellspawn have in common? Everything, apparently, in one of the most badass lineages in gaming history.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Others infamy may be tarnished or changed indefinitely.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Stay tuned for the details and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, February the 4th of 2018, episode number 717 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I have a problem.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
And it needs cowbell?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
No.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
What's the problem?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm on a-

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm on a hunt for a game.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Oh, what's this?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Robert Mondue.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I don't know if I know that one.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Also known as Jumping Flash 3.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know Jumping Flash 3. Why this game?

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Because I love Jumping Flash, and I've had a big urge to play Jumping Flash, but I want to play one that I haven't played before.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
So, that's why I'm hunting down Robert Mondue, but I kinda don't want to buy it on eBay.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
And is it one of those things where it's like, emulators not gonna do it?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Well, it's a PlayStation game.

01:21.000 --> 01:31.000
You could find- I don't know if they're still as prolific as they were when more people had PlayStation, but I remember disk images were not a problem to find back in the day.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, but there's- I wanna-

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Not that I endorse that.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
I wanna put it in the PlayStation and then flip the PlayStation upside down so it will actually not skip.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
We had to get our Japanese DDR games somehow.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Or play it on my Japanese PS2.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh, yeah.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
But I really, really super want to play Robert Mondue. That is also funny to say.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
I wonder if my Japanese PlayStation 2 still works. It's still around here somewhere, but I don't- you know what I don't have anymore?

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
Is a CRT TV, except what's in Loki's cabinet. The main cabinet that's just kinda been sitting here for a long time.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
That's not a CRT.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh, Hi-Tech Master Loki. That's not a CRT. I thought it was.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
It's too flat.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
That's a monitor.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Oh, wow. So, then I have no CRTs in this house.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I have a CRT.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I thought you did for, uh-

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Don't they support HDMI out?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
You could- well, no, I'm sorry.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
PS2?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
The component out.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Does it support component out?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, I think it does. I think it does.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
So you can do that.

02:21.000 --> 02:30.000
Because I remember that Final Fantasy XII, the first time it was out on PlayStation 2, when most people missed it, because the Xbox 360 had just come out.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
It supported, like, widescreen mode and stuff, so-

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And I also have converters to go from component to HDMI too.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
The thing to be careful with that is lag.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, music games are not gonna be good with that. That's the problem.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Well-

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
You can adjust, but you can adjust a lot of them.

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
The one I want is not a music game, but still. But also, when we were playing Guardian Legend through our converter, it was at least two seconds off.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Oh, barf.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It was so hard to play.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Barf. That's unfortunate.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Alright, well, hi, Tech Master Loki. How are you?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm fine.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah? How's the adventures in your new- I don't know if you heard this. Welcome back, DarkSakura. You were gone last week, I know.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
But I don't know if you heard about- Loki got a DDR Extreme machine in his house.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Nice.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, so how's the-

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm playing 30 minutes every day at least.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Are you really?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Good for you. Is it having an impact on weight? Not that it's any of my business, but-

03:20.000 --> 03:31.000
I don't think yet. Not much, if anything. I've been kind of cutting back on stuff too. I haven't been drinking soda. I tried diet soda today, and I'm just gonna stick with water. Thank you very much.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
But yeah, I've been cutting back on-

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
You should try Mio.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Do what?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Mio.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Mio?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
It's like a flavor additive. It makes everything taste like delicious Kool-Aid.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I have some if you wanna try it.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
It's okay.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Hey, it's gotten me through my 64 ounces a day.

03:46.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah, I don't mind water. So, I've been just cutting back and watching calories and stuff. So, haven't been eating health. I mean, sort of. Not really healthier, but less, I guess, if that makes sense. So, I'm sure that'll help.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
But yeah, just even exercise. 30 minutes. That's about all I can handle now. Well, it's all I have time for, really, in the evenings.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Well, that'll get better. The more you do it, your stamina will increase.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah, I've already noticed-

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
It's like running.

04:12.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, I've already noticed that it's a little bit easier to play some things, but I'm not- I'm definitely not where I was. Like, every last song I try- Okay, let me see if I can do A on Heavy now and see if- Nope. Still can do A on Heavy.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Nope.

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
Like, my brain can do it, but my feet just don't listen to my brain. They're like, fuck that. No.

04:34.000 --> 04:44.000
Well, let's go to our chat room, because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, over at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
It's a little quieter in chat tonight. It's almost like there's other things going on out there in pop culture that people are paying attention to, but we appreciate-

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
That aren't worthwhile.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It clearly must be the new Cloverfield movie.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Clearly. But we do appreciate the loyal few that are in our chat room tonight.

04:59.000 --> 05:08.000
S. Jonah and Matt offering some advice here, saying, I switched to flavored seltzer instead of soda. It definitely made a difference. And the DDR will help with the stamina and cardio training for sure.

05:08.000 --> 05:22.000
I don't really miss, like, soda. I mean, it's good every now and then. Like, I- Yesterday, like, we went- My kids wanted me to take them to the round table pizza, so we went there, and, like, I had a coupon with- They included four drinks, so I just- I drank water most of the time.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
I was like, I'll just take- I'll just fill a little bit of soda in here, take a sip of it, and then dump the rest out. And that was it. That's all I needed. I didn't really even need it. I was just like, eh.

05:29.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm not that big on soda. Like, I'm actually- Like, I'm weird. I'm totally okay with tap water. Like, it's fine. Water is fine for me. I don't mind a little flavoring. I like, um- You know how, like, in a lot of frozen yogurt shops, they'll have the water, but they do the fruit-infused water, where they, like, cut up strawberries. I like that a lot.

05:47.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah, they do that at my work. They do the fruit-infused water that they have available. Um, I thought I'd try Coke Zero, because everybody liked Coke Zero. It's alright. I sort of have a headache now.

05:58.000 --> 06:09.000
Just, I don't know if that's because, you know, I'm not drinking a ton of Red Bull during the weekend. Although, I still have a Red Bull each day, so I guess that's technically soda. Um, but whatever. That- I mean, that's the only thing I really have each day.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
Um, but, yeah, it's alright. I really don't like the taste of diet soda, though.

06:15.000 --> 06:24.000
You know, though, if you ever find one of those, like, Coke Infinity machines, or whatever they're called, um, add vanilla to it and it makes it taste a lot better.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, Freestyle?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, whatever they call them.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I haven't had a soda in-

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
A while.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Two months.

06:33.000 --> 06:48.000
Uh, going to chat again. Uh, Raginator with a gaming topic saying, finally got a chance to play Split Second as of yesterday. That was a, uh, kind of underrated and overlooked racing game that was on the Xbox 360, and my understanding is it just went backwards compatible on Xbox One.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
And are they giving that one away for free? Did that end up being a gold game? I thought-

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Might be. I don't remember.

06:53.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm sure Raginator knows free games, so I'm sure he'll speak up if it is. But, um, I know- well, I have the disc. I bought that game because I played it at E3 one year, and I thought it was really good.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
And then I remember the game- that studio kind of closed after the release of that game, right? That was a Disney game, and Disney kind of-

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Was that the Disney one?

07:12.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, it was. And Disney kind of backed out of gaming after that. I mean, they lent their licenses and stuff to things like Epic Mickey and obviously things like Kingdom Hearts.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
I think they partner up with these 16 studios, but that was like an in-house Disney studio that ended up, unfortunately, folding.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Well, I think that was Black Rock, if I remember correctly, yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah. Uh, Tiger Claw in chat says Split Second was a great racing game. Too bad Black Wolf didn't think so at the time. I don't remember him disliking it. Maybe he did. I don't remember.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
I tried it. I remember, um, I- I don't remember if I really got into it or not. It was alright.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, I think it just kind of came out when a ton of other games went out.

07:45.000 --> 07:54.000
I think the gimmick was, like, the race- like, there would be all these catastrophes and stuff happening at the same time that would change the course, blah blah blah.

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
You know, if you want to play a game like that, that's kind of ridiculous and stuff, um, Metal Storm Apocalypse is a great game that's very similar.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Uh, Raginators confirms it is a freebie with games with gold for this month, and Crazy Taxi will be free in two weeks.

08:10.000 --> 08:20.000
Well, that's- I thought I owned Crazy Taxi on Xbox 360. I wonder if it's popped up in my backwards compatibility. I haven't checked it a little bit, but, uh, I enjoy Crazy Taxi. That's a fun one.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
I don't remember. Does the 360 version bring back the offspring music? Because you kind of have to have the-

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
You don't remember if they have the same music in it.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
I thought they replaced it. I know in one version they replaced it. I think it was because the Dreamcast had it. I know the Dreamcast had it right.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And that was the Dreamcast collection is where that's coming from.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Maybe.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
Remember they had, like, the Dreamcast collection by this version that has, like, four of the Xbox Live arcade games, and then they, you know, had it separate as well.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, let's talk about music and games here at the top of the show with our kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
Um, not- I don't know. I kind of think this is an interesting, um, thing that's happened with Discord.

08:58.000 --> 09:06.000
You know, Discord has really changed, um, a lot in the past year. I think more and more people are using it, and I think part of that is Pokémon GO.

09:06.000 --> 09:16.000
I think part of that is people don't want to pay for ventrilo servers. Um, another part of that is, um, uh, well, the fact that it's mobile and, uh, on the desktop too.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
That's a pretty- pretty nice, uh, side effect with that. And I think Nintendo's lack of online has led a lot of people to using Discord.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
You know, and I remember Discord kind of being out there going, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, we're here. If you want to- if you need a Nintendo voice chat thing, we're here.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
So, um, anyway, the latest development with Discord is that Spotify has teamed up with Discord.

09:36.000 --> 09:45.000
And, uh, yeah, the interesting thing about tying together Spotify and Discord is so that now you know how Discord will usually list what game you're playing?

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Well, if you're not playing a game but you're listening to Spotify, if you want, you have to opt in, obviously.

09:49.000 --> 09:57.000
But it'll tell you- tell people what songs you're listening to, and it actually shows where in the song you are, too, which is kind of interesting.

09:57.000 --> 10:07.000
And if you have a Spotify, I guess, Plus account or whatever it's called, you can actually share and do, like, kind of party rooms with other people.

10:07.000 --> 10:15.000
It's a lot like a site that I know Dark Soccer and I used to love back in the day, Turntable FM. Remember that site? This site was so awesome.

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
And then, of course, music studios ended up shutting it down because they got greedy, so it was- the party was over over there.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
But they're trying to bring that back a little bit with this, but you have to have pro Spotify, which I know not everybody has.

10:29.000 --> 10:38.000
But also the interesting thing with Spotify, you know, you can- well, they have a gaming category on Spotify, which I know is, you know, something there that they're trying to do to reach out to gamers.

10:38.000 --> 10:48.000
But then, of course, the big one is that on PlayStation, you can access Spotify through PlayStation and you can kind of replace the music in a game with Spotify music if you want.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
And usually I'm very much the type that's like, you- why would you want to take out the music in a game? You know, like, I want to listen to the music in the game.

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
But I have found for things like, let's say, Diablo, where there's a lot of grinding and you're kind of doing a lot of the same stuff over and over.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
It's kind of like, okay, the music is kind of ambient at this point and I kind of need something else to help me with the grinding.

11:10.000 --> 11:23.000
So I've used Spotify when playing, like, Diablo 3 on PlayStation 4 and I thought I'd ask, I mean, I know- I don't think anybody else- anybody in here is a Spotify premium user except for me.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
I think, Jamie, you've used Apple Music, so there's really-

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I only use Apple Music.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah, there's no reason to have both, I don't think, and you don't have either one, right, Loki?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm not paying for music.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Dan prefers Pandora.

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
I say that and I just bought an album, you know, on Fridays. I'm not paying for a streaming music-

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
So you still buy albums as they catch your attention, basically. You're still doing it old school in that sense. That's fine.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
And Spotify is not perfect, like, this podcast is still not on Spotify, so there's room for improvement, I have to say.

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
But anyway, in all seriousness, I'm curious what you guys do when it comes to listening to music and gaming.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
Do you always stick with a game soundtrack and you don't listen to anything else, or do you let yourself listen to other music sometimes?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Jamie, I'm kind of curious about you, because you do a lot of-

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
I listen to what's in-game.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Really? You stick with the game only?

12:13.000 --> 12:23.000
That's why I play the game, is to listen to the music in the game, and play the game, and have the experience that was created for me in the game.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Even stuff you played over and over, like Mass Effect.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Hell yeah. I love all the music in Mass Effect, fuck yeah.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
You know, even World of Warcraft, which I'm playing again.

12:35.000 --> 12:46.000
I go to certain areas in the game just to listen to certain music, and I have macros that play certain pieces of music.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh, that's interesting.

12:47.000 --> 12:56.000
Like, I have a macro that does the thing that Sylvanas sings, and then the other one that plays on Mount Hyjal.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
The one with the singing in the middle that's like, oh, doo doo, and then singing, you know.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
My favorite in that game, and this is a deep cut for people that have played the game, but Grizzly Hills with the violins, that was my favorite.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I like Grizzly Hills.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
But, I mean, I do quite literally have macros set up in World of Warcraft to listen to certain pieces of music.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I didn't even know you could do that with macros.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yes, you can.

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
Interesting, because Final Fantasy set up this whole, like, you can't do it through macros, but you can put, like, in your house a jukebox, basically, and you can play songs.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I thought that was kind of interesting.

13:26.000 --> 13:35.000
There's just some places I'll go that I want to hear other pieces of music, or if I'm tired of listening to a piece and want to hear something in particular, then I'll play them, and I'll give you the macro commands if you want them.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
Well, it's interesting you bring up World of Warcraft, because with that one specifically, that is a game where I allow myself to listen to other music.

13:42.000 --> 13:51.000
Just because, you're going to disagree with me here, but for the most part, I find a lot of WoW soundtrack to be a little unremarkable after the first play.

13:51.000 --> 14:03.000
Don't get me wrong, there's some standouts, and the stuff that you named is all standouts, but, like, if I'm just grinding dungeons, like, if I'm leveling a character through dungeons and I'm doing Dire Maul over and over again, I listen to podcasts.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
That's, like, the time when I actually listen to podcasts. If not in the car, I listen to podcasts a little bit in the car.

14:08.000 --> 14:16.000
Or, I might listen to some Spotify. Like, I have playlists set up on Spotify, and, you know, they do a good job with some of their randomization.

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
So, I'll allow myself to listen to that, but it's mostly MMOs only for me. I don't really do it when I'm playing other stuff.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
See, I got kind of mad on 14, because I really liked a lot of the music, especially in Uldaa.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
And the music would just sort of cut off and go quiet for a while, and I didn't like that.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh, the day to night change?

14:37.000 --> 14:45.000
No, not even that. Like, I'd run around and do my quests or whatever, my dailies, and the music just stopped, and then I'd have to change, like, particular areas.

14:45.000 --> 14:57.000
So, it was really just kind of terrible. But, I mean, there's been some games that, like, the music was just really bad. I mean, really bad.

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
But I was having a fun time. Like, I kind of used to do it for Ragnarok Online, but not anymore. I love the music in Ragnarok Online.

15:04.000 --> 15:13.000
That's why when I play Idle Poring, I've actually used some of my costume coins and, you know, diamonds I've picked up to get extra soundtrack.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com to see what some of our listeners think. Dungeon Buster says,

15:19.000 --> 15:26.000
I always listen to the game's soundtrack in full when it comes to RPGs I like to play. Monster Hunter World has a great soundtrack, by the way.

15:26.000 --> 15:35.000
But Dungeon Buster also adds, I almost forgot what the music is like in the MMO I play, because I turned it off and listened to YouTube tracks or internet radio instead while grinding.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
So, I think you're kind of like me, where MMOs are kind of the exception.

15:38.000 --> 15:50.000
Ragenator says, 99.9% of the time I prefer to listen to the game's actual music. More often than not, it's pretty good, to the point where I make an effort to buy the soundtrack if it didn't already come as a pack-in bonus with the game.

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
Oh, here's Brad from Geekspin with a good follow-up here. I'll listen to other stuff in Forza Horizon. That's a pretty good point.

15:58.000 --> 16:08.000
A lot of these racing games and sports games, all their soundtracks are, are like pop music. So, would you replace the pop music with your own pop music?

16:08.000 --> 16:19.000
If they have an option to do that, like I know Grand Theft Auto will allow you to have a radio station that's just playing MP3s off your computer, so as long as it integrates into the game you can do that.

16:19.000 --> 16:31.000
A lot of Xbox 360 games, and I'm assuming to be the same with Xbox One, allowed you to put music on your system and be able to stream that as well, and it would integrate where the sound effects would be playing over everything.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
The only real game that I've done that where I've actually swapped out music would be Final Fantasy XI.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
I remember you actually went into the coded files and did stuff. Not so much for you, Jamie?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
No.

16:46.000 --> 17:02.000
And the other thing too, and this is just kind of, I've taken this sort of stance with movies and everything too, is that someone was paid to make that music. Especially music made for a game.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
I'm not talking about pop tunes or things like that. For example, take anything done by Yuzo Koshiro.

17:09.000 --> 17:26.000
That's his job, right? He put passion into making the music, you can tell. The people who did the music for Final Fantasy XIV put work into it, that's what they do. World of Warcraft, again, great music.

17:26.000 --> 17:34.000
These people, I don't think should be putting all this hard work into what they do to have it ignored.

17:34.000 --> 17:44.000
I don't ignore it, but if I've heard it literally a hundred times, it's like I wore it out. I wore the CD out, you know what I mean?

17:44.000 --> 17:53.000
It's just part of the thing for me, especially since I'll sometimes use certain music in-game to figure out when I've crossed an area border.

17:54.000 --> 18:05.000
Okay, I can see that. I can see that. But not so much so, but you do kind of say with the pop music, it's different because they're licensing other music anyway.

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
For example, I've never listened to a Justin Bieber song ever.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
You've been able to avoid Despacito?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yes.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Consider yourself lucky.

18:17.000 --> 18:27.000
And, for the longest time, I had also never listened to... fuck, who was it that I really hated for a while and refused to listen to anything?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Taylor Swift.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
I've listened to exactly two Taylor Swift songs. But yeah, Taylor Swift was the other.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Okay.

18:34.000 --> 18:44.000
But I've made it all this time in my life without listening to a single Justin Bieber song, and if I got a game and he did stuff on the soundtrack, I would not listen to anything else in it just to avoid it.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
You're going to get Justin rolled at the supermarket next time you go now.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
No.

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
You're going to be there shopping for whatever, for drinks and stuff, and then you're going to be, baby, baby, baby.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
And you're going to be like, who is this little boy on the radio?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
I know.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Is this a Tegan and Sarah song? I don't know.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I like Tegan and Sarah.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I love Tegan and Sarah. Anyway.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
But no. I've made it this far, and I think I can continue to make it the rest of my life.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Alright. Godspeed to you on that.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
You've got to have goals.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
And your goal is avoid Justin Bieber for all eternity.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
My secondary goal is to see him deported back to Canada, but that ain't happening.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
So, you have never heard Despacito.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
No. I didn't even know it was a song he did.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
I'm not going to be rude.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I don't even think I knew that was a song by that name.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
I'm not going to be rude and play it now. That's a shitty thing to do.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
And plus, that would mean I have to subject all of you to it. I'm not going to do that.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
I'm actually genuinely surprised that she's avoided it. That's an impressive accomplishment.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I only listen-

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
You should put that on your resume.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I only listen right now.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
Well, I mean, I listen to video games, soundtracks, but all the stuff that I listen to is stuff that either you've suggested to me or-

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Because I have great taste in music.

20:02.000 --> 20:14.000
Nicki has suggested to me, which right now I'm listening to random combinations of BTS, Monsta X, and what's that other Korean pop band I was listening to?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh, is that what Nicki-

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Oh, G-Dragon.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Is that what Nicki listens to is K-pop?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, lots of K-pop. And Retro New Wave.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Okay.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I've really been getting into Retro New Wave. I want a whole game that's Retro New Wave.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Nicki sounds like they have good taste in music.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Nicki is Gary's sister.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Oh, okay.

20:31.000 --> 20:41.000
Who is the complete polar opposite of Gary? Just saying. I know none of y'all know who Gary is, but Gary's one of my friends from my synagogue and his sister is 50 million times cooler.

20:41.000 --> 20:53.000
I like K-pop. I've been here. It seems to be getting more and more of a presence here. I mean, not to go on a tangents about drag queens, but you know, hey, slower night because there's other stuff going on.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
But did you see Aja doing the routine to, what is it, to anyone? Is that the K-pop band?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Yeah.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Did you see Aja doing the routine to that?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Sick Ning.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Right, but coming out in Japanese clothing to a K-pop song.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
I don't think-

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Wait, no, not a K-pop song.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
She wasn't wearing Japanese clothes.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
No, that was last episode. Sorry.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. She was wearing like a- I didn't think it was Japanese.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
No.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Like the arrow.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh no, I was thinking of the last episode instead of Turn Around.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Oh.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
But I am impressed with Aja, but sorry. Milk needs to go.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Okay. All right, look.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Fuck you, Milk. I'm lactose intolerant.

21:31.000 --> 21:39.000
Loki, Loki. What's your standpoint on the soundtrack thing? Do you listen to other stuff when you game or do you stick just pure with the soundtrack?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
It's mainly just whatever is in the game.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Interesting.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
For the most part.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
You know what's interesting though is with the Forza Horizon and stuff, I actually really like the soundtrack in Forza Horizon and there's enough variety.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
Like there's three different radio stations, like I'll flip between. I'll actually- no, four because I'll actually go to the classical radio station.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
Because you know all those games always have a classical radio station. Why? Because they don't have to pay for any of those songs because they're all public domain.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Because they're all dead.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
They're all hundreds and hundreds of years old, right?

22:06.000 --> 22:18.000
So I like- I get a lot of sick satisfaction out of like doing like big tricks and flying off of cliffs and all this stuff to like duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Like it's kind of fun.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Beethoven's fifth.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
And plus that's the stuff I can get away if I'm streaming those games. Those are the stations I can get away with playing on my feet and not get the quiet because it's classical.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
I will say one thing.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
Playing a racing game to A Night on the Bald Mountain.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, exactly.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
SSU 100 Matt says, I sometimes listen to different music when playing Overwatch.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
But yeah, if you play a lot of Overwatch, you're probably a little tired.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
Plus, Overwatch doesn't really have background music during the matches.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
I mean, although the thing that Dark Soccer's talking about with audio cues, I noticed that big time in Overwatch.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
Like, you know, when the game's about to be over, like the music does start buh duh duh duh duh.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
Like it starts pumping because the other team's about to win or you're about to win or whatever.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
And then, yeah, they use a lot of musical cues in that.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
But you hear it 500 times, you've heard it before type of things. I could see that for Overwatch.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
And then I used to listen to podcasts while playing Skyrim a while ago.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
Well, see, Skyrim has fantastic music, but when you're out in the world...

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
But the game's boring as fuck?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
No, it's not boring as fuck. Not for me.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
For me it is.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
But when you're out in the overworld and stuff, it doesn't really play anything at all.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I guess it does.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
It has very ambient types of flute-y music that plays.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
There's a lot of the same audio cues, too.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
You know, there's a series of games that I will personally go to somebody's house and kick them with a steel-toed boot in their head.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
If they listen to something else while playing the game.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
You're so polite. What is that?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
All Silent Hill games.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Oh, come on. You have to listen to the radio.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
It's part of the game. And no, I wouldn't do that, but I'd think about it a lot.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
I think about all kinds of violence these days.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
Scary games, in particular, you have to have the audio there. It's such a huge part of the game.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
But Silent Hill in particular.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah, I know, yeah. In particular, because of Kiryamoka, but I would say all scary games.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
That's when you need to pump in some Desposito.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Now that's scary.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
See, I'll be honest, I didn't even know that that was a song. Until today.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I would sing it, but I'm not going to.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
That could be a whole new CD soundtrack line. Now that's scary.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Rob, I would take you singing it over Bieber any day.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Oh, we should go to karaoke sometime, and I'll sing Desposito for you.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
And then I'll cry.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
And then that way you can say, I finally heard Desposito, but it was the Rob Roberts version.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
Exactly. I wouldn't mind going to karaoke, by the way.

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah, karaoke would be fun. My friend keeps trying to get me to go to one that they do at one of the bars around here that has a live band backing you up.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
I guess that's the new trend, is like, you are the singer of a band.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
They do piano bar night at sidetracks.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, okay.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
And you can sing along.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
I think I've been to sidetracks like once. Once.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
We did.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
I've been to sidetracks in Chicago as many times as I've been to sidetracks.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
We did.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
They're completely different places, let me tell you.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
We did Sister Bingo during all that.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Alright, let's see.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
SHO 100 Matt would like to clarify about Skyrim. It's certainly not boring.

25:24.000 --> 25:30.000
I mostly used to play podcasts while playing Skyrim to catch up on my podcast listening while I played for multiple hours.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
Sometimes it helped me cue, oh, I just finished blank podcast, which is two hours long. Maybe I should stop playing.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Hey, if you're listening to-

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
And the next line, and then I don't.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
Actually, I should put that out for the listeners.

25:45.000 --> 25:54.000
If you're listening to OLR while you're playing a game, would you please tweet us and let us know what game are you playing while you listen to OLR this week?

25:54.000 --> 26:02.000
Because, especially because of other stuff, which we will not name tonight, I know a lot of you are catching up on this in the podcast feed this week.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
So I'd be curious, what game were you playing when you listened to this?

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Tweet us at OLR or, cheap plug for Discord since we've been talking about Discord,

26:11.000 --> 26:20.000
join us on the VOG Network Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, and that'll get you the automatic invite, everything you need, and then let us know.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
I want to know, like, what game soundtrack did we replace this week?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Jamie, another thought for you?

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
Something just occurred to me. You were talking about playing, like, classical music when you stream on Twitch.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Is that because your intent is to put it on YouTube later?

26:33.000 --> 26:40.000
No, but Twitch, so, sometimes I stream so late at night that I don't know a lot of people, but I know one or two people.

26:40.000 --> 26:47.000
Honestly, I haven't streamed in a while because I really, really wanted to do more of it this year, but then I took on two podcasts.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
So I've been doing, I've been expressing myself creatively in other ways.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I thought Twitch covered the licensing.

26:53.000 --> 27:04.000
For some of their own music, Twitch has, like, their Twitch Safe music, and Twitch covers the licensing of a, like, live radio-style thing, but the problem is playing it back on demand.

27:04.000 --> 27:14.000
So Twitch has the on-demand thing. So, like, I have some people, because I stream late at night, they might go watch my stream the next day to see, like, oh, what did Rob do last night while I was asleep?

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
And the problem is, if I play licensed music, then, like, 30 minutes of video gets muted.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
So that's why I stick with the classical stuff.

27:21.000 --> 27:34.000
But, like, the video game music is never a problem. The problem is, if I play Despacito in the background, which, if you go and watch some streamers that stream a lot of content, like, they play Heroes of the Storm all day long, or they play World of Warcraft all day long,

27:34.000 --> 27:40.000
some of them sit there listening to Spotify while they're doing it, well, those streams get muted because of the background music.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
That's what I was talking about, because I don't ever have any background music.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Then you'd be fine.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Just the game.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
They're not going to mute anything.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Okay.

27:47.000 --> 27:58.000
But here's the problem. When a game like Forza Horizon uses licensed music, the system doesn't know, oh, that licensed song was for that game.

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
So it just has a match and says, oh, this is, you know, whatever, I can't think of any songs of Forza Horizon all of a sudden.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Lady Tron, which I actually think was in a soccer game, but whatever, it goes, oh, this is Ace of Hearts.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Oh, hey, there.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
And so, yeah, so it goes up, zonk, and it mutes the audio.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
So that's why I do the classic music, because that's not going to trigger it.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Does that make sense?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
No, it does.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
You can't play rock band on Twitch.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Yeah.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
But I'm so like, if I were playing like GTA, which I wouldn't, but if I were.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
If you were.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Yeah.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
To make sure I'm clear, you can play rock band live.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
It's just, if somebody tries to go back and watch it later, they're just going to hear silence.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
That just means you're really good.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
So that just means that I'm fine streaming something like Air Zonk.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
Since you don't, yeah, you don't replace your music, you'd be fine.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
And I don't really tend to replace mine either. I just have to be aware.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
And now a lot of games these days, like I want to say Crypt of the Necro Dancer is one of them.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
Correct me if I'm wrong, but some of them have a switch in the menus.

28:58.000 --> 29:06.000
You go in and say broadcaster mode and what it'll do, it'll strip out anything that is like license that could trigger it and only keep original songs.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
So like a lot of games are starting to do that now.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
That's cool.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:21.000
But, but no, I mean, I, and I mentioned it to you, Dan and I are looking at our old consoles and thinking about, you know, streaming them, the two of us together, like once a week.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
That'd be fun.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
So.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
She Hulk in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says rock band is a fun party game.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
It is a fun party game.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
I wish I, well, I have some bad news about rock band tonight.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
We'll get into that a little later in the show, but I don't want to, I don't want to be a downer.

29:35.000 --> 29:43.000
I do hope, even though I personally was a little disappointed in rock band four, um, I do hope they make another game.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I do hope they're able to correct some of those things.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
So the rock band five, and I also think rock band four is in a better place now than it was when it released.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Like rivals helped a lot.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
Rivals is kinda, I think would have been great if the game was that when it first came out, but you know, you live, you learn, right?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
So we'll see.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I hope they do another one, but it is a fun party game.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Even today.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
All right.

30:03.000 --> 30:10.000
Speaking of party games, let's talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week in a segment that we call how was your gaming week and dark soccer.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
We'll start with you.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

30:13.000 --> 30:22.000
Well, I did the whole reason that I do not have dragon ball fighter Z is because I bought battle for Azeroth.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
So, oh, you did the whole pre-order the collector's edition.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Okay.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
So you have, do you don't have the app?

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
They still have the allied races locked behind reputations, right?

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
But they opened up on, um, uh, the level, the skip to one 10.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Okay.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
For everything except demon hunter.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Okay.

30:39.000 --> 30:53.000
And so, um, since I'm mostly playing hoard on proud more, I figured I would use my, um, level skip just to make a brand new mage because I'm kind of tired of leveling in the blood elf area.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Sure.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Because I played nothing but blood elves.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
So I started playing trolls.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Trolls are cool.

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
Um, I've also been playing, um, animal crossing, uh, pocket camp.

31:02.000 --> 31:15.000
Um, they brought out new animals, including one very frightening clown creature named Pietro who, and oh my God, the new, um, the new, uh, fuck, what do they call them?

31:15.000 --> 31:25.000
Uh, not resources, the word that wants to come to mind, but it's, uh, amenity, um, is like this big stitched up ugly clown face thing.

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
And I swear I'm only going to have it long enough to get rid of it so I can get the points from my, from my visitors at my camp.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
But, uh, want Pietro to go away.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Pietro is the new Ed.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Actually no Ed is still terrible.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
So Ed can stay away forever.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
Um, I'm also still playing idle pouring.

31:45.000 --> 31:51.000
Um, I don't really know if I'm playing much else.

31:51.000 --> 31:57.000
So I was playing, I was actually playing Bust A Move, like Puzzle Bobble, Bust A Move and having a lot of fun.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Nice.

31:58.000 --> 32:09.000
Um, but I'm kind of thinking that when Dan and I do our stream, we're going to start off with maybe KOF 98 or maybe start off with something on the Neo Geo like Magician Lord or something.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
So we were just talking and I want ideas from people.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
I don't think you see a lot of Neo Geo games stream these days.

32:15.000 --> 32:23.000
I mean, you might see the stuff that's on Nintendo Switch from Neo Geo, but even then I don't think you see a lot of that.

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
The emulation on those is kind of not great anyway, but, um, there's nothing like playing like, or even just hooking up the Dreamcast and playing like Last Blade, something like that.

32:31.000 --> 32:40.000
You know, but we're, we've been kind of doing some inventory on some stuff and you know, I, oh, we, I played, I played a non-video game game.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Okay.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I played darts. We have a dart board.

32:43.000 --> 32:50.000
Oh yeah. Yeah. You guys have that. Well, it's not just any dartboard either. It's one of those electronic fancy pizza parlor dartboards.

32:50.000 --> 32:59.000
And so Dan, uh, I've only played darts twice, so I played darts with Dan. He won. We played 301 and he won.

32:59.000 --> 33:06.000
Although we were, every game was like neck and neck right toward the end, just making sure you can hit that, the one spot to close out your points.

33:06.000 --> 33:12.000
But it was pretty fun. You know, I, I like throwing pointy objects at things with the intent to stab them.

33:12.000 --> 33:20.000
I hit the wall once I made plastic tip, dart, go into drywall. Go me. Okay. That's it.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
Um, I didn't play a whole ton of stuff. I mainly just, uh, dance dance revolution.

33:26.000 --> 33:33.000
Um, so I've been playing that, like I said, every day about 30 minutes. Um, just, you know, easy stuff.

33:33.000 --> 33:42.000
I usually start off with a nonstop course and then to warm up and just pick songs that I feel that I can actually accomplish.

33:42.000 --> 33:55.000
And then also, um, kind of push it a little bit, but it's mainly just been playing on standard mode because like I said, it's been at least 10 years that I've played DDR and like a regular capacity.

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
So it's, it's going to take a while to get back up to that again, because it took a few years to get to that point in the first place.

34:01.000 --> 34:08.000
So just been taking it easy. Um, and then along with that, you know, I've been also playing, um, Stardew Valley still.

34:08.000 --> 34:24.000
It's kind of boring. Um, I don't know. It's, it reminds me a lot of like animal crossing, just with all like the fetch quests and stuff, except there's a little bit more flexibility with what you can kind of, you know, create in your house and like, you know, design your own kind of farm and everything.

34:25.000 --> 34:36.000
But I don't know. It's all right. The story's kind of dumb, but I'm thinking I'm almost finished with it based off of what I've seen, you know, like in some of the facts and stuff.

34:36.000 --> 34:48.000
So hopefully just get all the achievements and then I'll be done with that. So that's, that's pretty much it. Oh, a little bit Pokemon and a little bit of, um, Ingress, but yeah, not much of that.

34:48.000 --> 34:58.000
All right. Um, my gaming week, um, honestly, I'm so disappointing lately. I haven't been playing a lot of new stuff. It's still kind of the same old standards. I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14.

34:58.000 --> 35:09.000
I discovered how much I really enjoy playing Red Mage. Like the first time I tried doing it, I must have been doing something wrong, but now I'm like so into like how the class plays and how you like fly in and out of melee. That's a lot of fun.

35:09.000 --> 35:20.000
Uh, I did play Wow for a hot minute cause I helped get that guild over on Proudmoore that I'm assuming you and, uh, uh, Mr. Slidekick from a game buoy are playing together. Yeah. I helped with getting that sign. So I played that for a hot minute.

35:20.000 --> 35:37.000
Um, and, uh, let's see, which I actually think, what did he end up naming it? Did he give it the acronym VOG? I don't remember. That was something he was thinking of doing. He was going to call it something where the acronym was VOG, but it was like veil of ghouls or something.

35:37.000 --> 35:50.000
It was something. Yeah, something like that. But, um, actually speaking of which I'm planning on talking to him about restarting Hillsbrad Blues. Yeah. I think it'd be fun if you guys like did a Wow. I know that's a comic, but if you guys did a Wow show or something, it'd be fun.

35:50.000 --> 36:06.000
Good. Well, we got a gap. You can have the name Horde House for sale. Time to message somebody. Uh, of course I guess I'd have to get some other boys to sign off on that. Uh, but anyway, in all seriousness, uh, besides that, I've also been playing Heroes of the Storm still.

36:06.000 --> 36:18.000
I bought Hanzo. Finally, I got enough gold to buy Hanzo, who's probably more fun to play in Heroes of the Storm than he is in Overwatch. And then, uh, I actually, okay, so here I go again, buying a game on more than one platform.

36:18.000 --> 36:33.000
I bought Final Fantasy 12, the Zodiac Age on PC, cause it just came out a couple days ago, but hear me out y'all. The PC version runs 60 frames a second, which the PlayStation 4 one doesn't do, and it will do some higher resolutions.

36:33.000 --> 36:49.000
So like I can't do 4K at 60 frames a second. My graphics card isn't good enough, but I can do like 1440 or I think, I think I might even be on like two, two, 2K, whatever that is, Ultra HD. Uh, and it looks so good. Like it really looks good.

36:49.000 --> 37:01.000
Uh, it's for me, it's noticeably better than PlayStation 4. And I don't, I don't know if it's because my monitor is probably better than my TV, which is most certainly the case. I don't think that's anything about the PlayStation hardware, but yeah, it's just, it looks really good.

37:01.000 --> 37:14.000
So I kind of don't regret making the purchase, but I only played a little bit of that just enough to do the intro to see how it ran. And then I am thinking that might be a thing that I pick up 15. Now they put up the tech demo or not the benchmark for it.

37:14.000 --> 37:26.000
I hate to say it, but I'm giving it some thought and I kind of hate myself a little bit for doing it, but 12 looks so much better that like if 15 looks that much better too. I don't know. It's Ooh.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
I have to go back and play. I haven't even played 15 really.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
You want to borrow mine?

37:32.000 --> 37:55.000
No, I haven't. I bought it. Like I bought it at launch. Like I even got like, was it the zero or whatever that was, you know, um, type zero. And I have that and I played through that a little bit, but like, I don't know. It's a combat system, man. It just really turns me off on the game. I like, I like my turn-based combat. It's kind of disappointing. I'll give it a try again someday.

37:55.000 --> 38:11.000
I just, I just want them to hurry up and announce Final Fantasy 16 already. Although with the seven, I think the seven remake is Final Fantasy 16. I know that doesn't make any sense, but I feel like the effort and the stuff they're putting into this is like, that's what we're getting instead of Final Fantasy 16 right now.

38:11.000 --> 38:19.000
Like we'll get Final Fantasy 16 eventually, but it's just that much longer. We're going to have to wait. So we'll see. We'll see.

38:19.000 --> 38:26.000
Anyway, that's right. Besides the mobile gaming, I've also been playing a little bit of Ingress, a little bit of Pokemon Go, but, um, actually a lot of Pokemon Go.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Oh yeah, both of those two.

38:27.000 --> 38:45.000
I'm halfway through level 35. Woo. So, you know, and I've only got, I think like 4 million AP to go in Ingress till I hit level 16. So I want to get to that like super sick, sad individual where I'm level 16 in Ingress and level 40 in Pokemon Go.

38:45.000 --> 38:55.000
And I know I wouldn't be the first. I'm sure there's other people out there, but I know it's a very exclusive, sick, sad club. And then when the Harry Potter game comes out, I'll be max level in that too.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
So I'll go for the whole trifecta of sadness.

38:59.000 --> 39:10.000
Alright. That's it for our gaming weeks. So we'll do some quick housekeeping. Of course, you can always follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. I mentioned the Discord a minute ago as well.

39:10.000 --> 39:19.000
We're on Facebook. Sadly, we've been neglecting putting a lot of content on Facebook, but maybe we'll think of what we can do over there. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio if you want to at least follow the show.

39:19.000 --> 39:30.000
And I want to also just give a quick shout out for my side project because it's now available in iTunes and Google as of this week. And that show is called Shaking and Crying.

39:30.000 --> 39:48.000
It's not games. It's pop culture, geek culture, and sass with myself and Aria Snark, who's a very talented cosplayer lady. So we talk about, you know, I think we talked about Celebrity Big Brother this week and how we didn't know any of the people that were on it.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Well, I knew about half the cast, but Victoria knew less than that.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
Which, by the way, congrats.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Oh, to Courtney Act on the UK.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Courtney Act.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Yeah, Courtney Act. She's going to be big. I bet you she has a hosting gig.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Classy as fuck.

40:04.000 --> 40:17.000
If there is, I mean, not to sidetrack too much, but if there is justice in this world, Courtney and Andrew will have like a road trip show in the UK. Because I don't know if you've been following their bromance, but it's one of those things where it's like, so cute.

40:17.000 --> 40:27.000
You know what, though? I did find a gem on YouTube of Trixie Mattel and Courtney Act singing a duet.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
She was on once and it was really funny.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
But I think I posted it in a certain group.

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
Anyway, all right, let's move on. We're going to talk about some video game news.

40:39.000 --> 40:46.000
Let's talk about everybody's, well, I should say the least favorite company, fifth least favorite company in the US from the last poll I saw.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Uh oh.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
It's EA.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Uh oh.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
EA.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
What'd they do now?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Nothing.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Another stinky turd.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
EA announced that they're delaying. Oh, I'm sorry.

40:57.000 --> 41:04.000
They're putting out Anthem at a date that is later than when they originally specified.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Because it's not a delay.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
It is not a delay, according to Blake Jorgensen.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
Don't call it a delay. It's simply coming out at a later time.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
How about never? How about do a good Mass Effect?

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
I'm sorry, I'm just cracking up in the hole.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
It's not a delay.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
I know we announced fall 2018. Fall 2018 is just coming out later, that's all.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
The fall is delayed, not our game.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
The fall has been delayed.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
The Groundhog came out again and said that there was going to be more summer.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Climate change is not real.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Fall has just been delayed.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
And Anthem will come out now in fall of 2019 because fall is winter.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Is everybody following me?

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
Follow me. No? That's okay? Just enjoy Anthem when it's fucking ready.

41:54.000 --> 42:01.000
Well look, I will give EA credit for this despite this obvious sense of what the fuckery.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
I will give them credit for knowing when to delay a highly anticipated game when they need to

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
because they misfired on that call last time.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
My concern is that they are still going to force BioWare to put that out in the fiscal year whether it's ready or not.

42:16.000 --> 42:23.000
And I'm maybe not as extreme as Jamie is on this, but my feathers are pretty...

42:23.000 --> 42:31.000
I was in Anthem at E3 and the more I marinated on it, my feathers are pretty ruffled about the way EA has treated BioWare and has treated Mass Effect.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
So I know it sucks because I know there's a lot of people that are working hard on Anthem, but I'm just...

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I'm not inclined to support it.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
They're just setting them up to fail or disappoint.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Kinda. Kinda.

42:44.000 --> 42:54.000
But anyways, so along with that, of course, their excuse, I guess, or maybe the justification is that there's going to be a new Battlefield game coming out later this year.

42:54.000 --> 43:02.000
So a sequel to Battlefield 1 or Battlefield 2, a new modern Battlefield game. No one knows yet.

43:02.000 --> 43:10.000
Let's do Battlefield Medieval Times. They already have a medieval first person combat game like that, but why not? Let's just go back further.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
And then, of course, there's some comments regarding, you know, the next Battlefield 3.

43:15.000 --> 43:25.000
You know, like they haven't really said anything about Battlefield 3 yet, but of course there's going to be a new Star Wars game that's going to be coming out fiscal 2020, which ends in March 2020.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
So we'll see something coming out then.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And then, of course...

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
Unless EA decides that the fiscal year has been delayed.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
And then I know...

43:37.000 --> 43:44.000
We actually took over all the banks and we've actually delayed the fiscal year. So it's not a delay, it's the fiscal year moved.

43:44.000 --> 43:52.000
The fiscal year moved. And then, of course, as a shock, I mean, they made comments also about loot boxes and gambling saying,

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
We do not believe that loot boxes are a form of gambling and a lot of countries agree with us.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
A lot of countries agree with us? Is that the quote, really?

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
What a dump thing to say.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
That is the quote.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
Which countries? There's a lot of countries. There's some countries you don't want on your side.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
It's not literally gambling. It's just like...

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Metaphorically gambling.

44:18.000 --> 44:25.000
Metaphorically gambling. It uses the same predatory tactics that you use to get people to constantly gamble.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
And then, of course, with that...

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
You know what? I want to buy EA a fucking dictionary. That's what I want to buy EA.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And then smack everybody there with a clue by four?

44:33.000 --> 44:40.000
No, because I know people at EA that work very hard. EA executives, I would smack with a Merriam-Webster.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Well, yeah.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Obviously, right?

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
And I have really terrible news for you about Star Wars Battlefront II.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Uh oh.

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
So Battlefront II, and we really should feel so bad for EA. I mean, they are just hurting right now.

44:55.000 --> 45:03.000
It's reported that it sold short of their 10 million copy estimate. It's only sold 9 million copies.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Only 9 million copies.

45:06.000 --> 45:17.000
And because we feel so terrible for them, we should totally embrace in open arms the reintroduction of paid currencies for their loot boxes and microtransactions, which will be coming soon.

45:17.000 --> 45:25.000
How do we turn 9 million into 10 million? By financially fucking the 9 million people we have and squeezing that 10 million dollars out of them.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
That's how to do it.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
So, yes. So there...

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
And, of course...

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Oh, and this is great.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Gotta love...

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
God trust EA.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
CEO Andrew Wilson.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Go quoting.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
You shouldn't believe everything you read in the press.

45:43.000 --> 45:54.000
We have tremendous relationship with Disney and we have built some amazing games together and have been very proactive with the relation in service to our other players.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
That's another dump wording too.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Fake news?

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
Is that a quote from Chitolini? Like, wait. Say that again. Say that again.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
So, okay. It says, you shouldn't believe everything you read in the press.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
Fake news. Don't watch CNN. Fake news.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
We have a tremendous relationship with Disney and we have built some amazing games together.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Well, I don't know why I'm putting us out there.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
We have a bigly relationship.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
We have a bigly relationship with Norway. We wish more people from Norway would move here.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
And we have been very proactive with that relation or with that...

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
And we have been very... I'm gonna read this as exactly as it's quoted.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Okay.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
Okay. So, we read this whole last part.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
You should really...

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Loki's tripping up because it doesn't make any fucking sense.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Because it reads like a dump tweet?

46:48.000 --> 47:04.000
We have had a tremendous relationship with Disney and we have built some amazing games together, and we have been very proactive with that relation in the service of our players.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I don't... I think there should be a word in there somewhere.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
In relation to the... This doesn't seem like it makes sense.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
Our tax cuts have been tremendous.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
Walmart gave their employees $1,000. They closed all the Sam's clubs.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
It gets better. Hold on.

47:20.000 --> 47:27.000
We're at the point where when we make a decision that we have the right model for players in our community,

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
I have no doubt that we will get the support at Disney on that.

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
Discussing, of course, the microtransaction model that they were going to be putting back in the battlefront.

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
So, I think the EA CEO should only be allowed to speak in emojis from here on out because it would make more sense.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
That's why he's having trouble making words because he only speaks emoji.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
Okay. We need to take the box of crayons and the helmet away from...

47:52.000 --> 47:58.000
Actually, there's good reason to tonight. We'll get into that a little later. The crayons are up for grabs.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
Well, especially... Who did we give them to before? Kudaragi?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I thought it was Kazurai.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
Yeah, it was. It was. But he's thankfully doing an okay job now.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
Spoiler alert. He's retiring. It's coming up later in the show, so...

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
That's why I said he's doing okay right now.

48:13.000 --> 48:21.000
So, we need to... We can take the leash and the bike helmet off of him and give it to good old Chris there.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
It's like I can't keep...

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Andrew, whatever.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
I can't compete on that level with Andrew Joseph.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
White boy name.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Anyway, all right.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
So, yes, I'm sure that those microtransactions and stuff will be embraced with open arms and stuff.

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
And they totally haven't... I'm surprised that they sold...

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Open arms or open butt cheeks.

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
Can we talk about this real quick? Because it's EA related. It's not on the show roll, but it was all over Twitter this week.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
And if you really want to talk about fake news, I want to talk about this real quick.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
This rumor that Microsoft is buying EA.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
What the fuck are you all smoking in perpetuating that rumor?

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Do you know where that rumor came from?

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
It came from a Polygon article, which should be your first warning.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
Your second thing is that it was an analyst.

49:07.000 --> 49:15.000
An analyst said it would be a good move for Microsoft to get the first party exclusives for Microsoft to buy EA.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
It could happen. Monkeys might fly out of my ass. It could happen.

49:21.000 --> 49:27.000
Party on, Wayne. Monkeys are flying out of Rob's ass and Microsoft is buying them.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
Look, if the news comes out tomorrow that Microsoft bought EA, I will happily let you do the Photoshop.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
Okay, if the monkeys are gonna fly out of your ass, use an enema first.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
Here's the thing. It blows my mind how that rumor...

49:43.000 --> 49:50.000
And I will give, as much shit as we're giving this EA guy here, and rightfully so, I will give him some credit.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Don't believe everything you read.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
Because this Microsoft and EA thing is a perfect example of this.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
Because where did this fucking analyst set...

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
Which, you can't spell analyst without anal, by the way.

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
So, if you want a fucking prediction, call Ms. Cleo, okay?

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Ms. Cleo's in jail, right? No, she died.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Yeah, Ms. Cleo died. But you'd still probably get a better prediction.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
Do you think she saw that coming?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Fuck right off. Anyway.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
Hey, to quote Ask a Mortician, you're all gonna die.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
Anyway, my point is, is that the games media, now it's this headline.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
Rumor, Microsoft to buy EA. That's not even a rumor.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
Somebody literally made that up. Literally made it up.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
They didn't even say it was gonna happen. They said it should happen.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
This is a suggestion.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Video game industry fanfic right now.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
Oh, that's a perfect way to put it. Video game industry fanfic.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Oh my god, that's a perfect way to describe it.

50:49.000 --> 50:55.000
This is someone's yaoi fanfiction, where Microsoft and EA make out and then have a corn cob.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
What did everybody that was at NeoGaf, where did they all go? What's the new thing?

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
Era? Era? Era?

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
NeoGaf?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
That era is fanfic. That's all it is. Not all of it.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Is there another website now?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Yeah, there is. All the NeoGaf people went to some new place.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
Oh, I thought NeoGaf was just, they were still at NeoGaf.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
No, I think it's still there, but now there's like two houses.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Era?

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Yeah, era something. Resetting era?

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Resetti?

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
Resetti, that's it. Resetti era. Maybe, I don't know.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
No, I'm just making stuff up because that's from Animal Crossing.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
Alright, anyway. Yeah, so the Microsoft and EA thing, total crap.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
Seriously, watch how that is spreading around the gaming industry.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
It's crazy. Like, people are writing up these articles for clicks.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
Like, it's the thing that's most broken in gaming journalism right now.

51:45.000 --> 51:51.000
I mean, I can't believe here I am talking actually about actual ethics in gaming journalism, but here we are.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
Like, it's a new year, I guess. Anything's possible.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
Oh my god. Let's not do the gate thing again.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Nah, it's not.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
It's tied gate all over again.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Nope, nope. Them gate's been wired shut.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Let's move on to another story, shall we?

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
Let's talk about Mario Kart coming to smartphones.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
Now, this isn't fake news. This is something that they've actually said is going to happen.

52:12.000 --> 52:19.000
The original Mario Runner game came out, then Animal Crossing, then now Mario Kart.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
Nintendo did confirm this via their Twitter, and I believe it was some type of financial announcement over in Japan.

52:24.000 --> 52:31.000
They announced that Mario Kart Tour will be coming out at some point before March 2019.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
Which is a hell of a window, but it's basically this fiscal year. Here we go again with the fiscal years.

52:36.000 --> 52:44.000
But that's all they said. No screenshots, no nothing. Just that Mario Kart is kind of the next game on their agenda.

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
Although, no, it's not the next game on their agenda because they confirmed a Zelda thing was coming at some point.

52:49.000 --> 52:58.000
So Zelda I kept, because I've played touch screen Zelda on the DS, and they have a system that works well for touch screen.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
If it's Phantom Hourglass or Hyrule Warriors type of thing, you'll be fine.

53:00.000 --> 53:11.000
Exactly. That stuff, it worked pretty well. However, there's been several Mario Kart knockoff games on mobile platforms, and they're not that great.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
It's the lack of buttons thing again.

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
You know, we all know how it's going to be controlled. You're going to tilt your damn phone.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
You're going to tilt your damn phone, that's how it's going to work.

53:22.000 --> 53:28.000
Well yeah, it'll be just like the other mobile games that they have where you tilt the phone and they have on screen buttons for other things.

53:28.000 --> 53:37.000
Assuming that it plays like a Mario Kart game. I don't see why it wouldn't, but there is the possibility it could be more like a football manager type of thing.

53:37.000 --> 53:43.000
Where maybe you're getting resources and racing, maybe making tracks and watching your karts race on it.

53:43.000 --> 53:48.000
I mean, it doesn't have to be a straight up Mario Kart game. We're kind of making that assumption.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
But without a tangible controller.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
I think that would be terrible.

53:51.000 --> 53:59.000
I don't think it would be great either, but I'm just saying we are kind of making an assumption it's going to be like any other Mario Kart game.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
And without a tactile control, I just think that's going to be so weird.

54:03.000 --> 54:11.000
But the wheel thing on the Wii with kids was big. It's just going to be your phone now. That's what they're going to do.

54:12.000 --> 54:18.000
Maybe they can have some cardboard crap that you can strap to it to make some like...

54:18.000 --> 54:25.000
Funny, funny you mention that because Kaijuto in chat says Labo should let kids make a cardboard Mario Kart.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
That would be kind of fun.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
It would be, but this is smart phones.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
But they should let adults do that.

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
It's not the Switch, it's smart phones. Unless Mario Kart 9 confirmed?

54:37.000 --> 54:45.000
Well they technically have something like that. I mean there's that whole motorcycle racing game that they showed with Labo where you had like pedals and stuff.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Oh yeah, they showed that briefly.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
They sort of already have that, but...

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I mean, we're talking about mobile games.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
Just because we have a Mario Kart doesn't mean we shouldn't get an F-Zero game.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Oh yeah, mobile F-Zero game. That would look like shit.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
No, no, no. Not on fucking mobile. No, no, no. You stay the fuck away from mobile F-Zero.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
I mean an actual Switch game.

55:05.000 --> 55:14.000
You know, I've played some really gorgeous games on my iPhone X. They look astounding.

55:14.000 --> 55:21.000
So I think that yeah, a top end device would have no problem with something like F-Zero.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
I'm not worried about the way it'll look. I'm worried about the way it'll play.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
That's the only problem.

55:26.000 --> 55:32.000
It could look like Super Mario Kart, the first one, but it's gonna control like shit.

55:32.000 --> 55:39.000
Yeah. Well anyway, more to come on that in the future. There's a whole year and then some for that to come out.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Anyway, it should also be mentioned as part of this same financial announcement.

55:43.000 --> 55:48.000
Nintendo dumped a bunch of news the other night, and I think it was because they were doing a financial announcement in Japan.

55:48.000 --> 55:55.000
They also have confirmed Nintendo Switch Online is confirmed to launch in September 2018.

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
That's been pushed back again, although there were rumors that it was going to be pushed back from what the Italian website had done.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
Well, I don't know. But anyway, confirmed now, September 2018 is the new go-live date.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
They're still saying $20 a year, and that's gonna allow you to play Switch games online.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
And the classic archive will finally show up.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
Super Mario Bros. 3, Balloon Fight, Dr. Mario have all been teased before.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
Again, we're only going off of things that have been announced previously.

56:21.000 --> 56:29.000
There's no guarantee Nintendo is keeping any of this the same, but we're assuming all this stuff is still in place for September of 2018.

56:29.000 --> 56:41.000
Now, I would assume, here I go, but I'm gonna assume, if it's coming out in September, E3 is going to be a great time for them to finally explain the classic game shit, and how that's gonna work.

56:41.000 --> 56:46.000
Well, here's the other thing to consider, too, that I just now thought about with Nintendo's system.

56:46.000 --> 56:56.000
So, because the Switch is a portable system, most of these games that are multiplayer are available multiplayer locally, right?

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
So, what did they do before when they had local multiplayer games, and they wanted to get around the whole online thing?

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
They would tunnel. They would have warp pipe or something like that to play local area games over the internet.

57:10.000 --> 57:18.000
So, if this service sucks, and it's not even worth the $20 they were paying for it, that's how people are gonna get around that shit.

57:18.000 --> 57:25.000
Because most of those games, because it is a portable system, support local area play, and that's how they're gonna get around all this bullshit.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Hackers gonna hack, you mean?

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Exactly.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
Alright, let's move on with some more news. More pushbacks, right, Jamie?

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
Yep. Red Dead Redemption 2, which I know a lot of people have been super hyper about.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Maybe one in this room?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Well, I was thinking of Dan.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Okay.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Dan's really, really into that.

57:44.000 --> 57:59.000
They were, it was supposed to be out Fall 2017. They pushed it back once to Spring 2018, and now they pushed it to October 26th, 2018.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
It's also my brother's birthday, so maybe.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
But anyway, but they said, and this is the quote,

58:06.000 --> 58:15.000
We apologize to everyone disappointed by this delay. While we had hoped to have the game out sooner, we require a little extra time to polish.

58:15.000 --> 58:28.000
I like that. I would rather, again, that a game be delayed and come out right than them just putting out some shit and then polishing a turd.

58:28.000 --> 58:36.000
In this day and age, I think we've all learned our lesson. Let this game take the time it needs to be done.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
A good wine needs to age.

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
I'm not worried about Rockstar Games. When it comes to polishing stuff, I'm not, they'll, it's fine.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
They'll deliver.

58:44.000 --> 58:52.000
They did the same thing with Grand Theft Auto 5, and look how that turned out. I mean, oh, that was such a terribly selling game. It only sold tens of millions of copies.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
Are you worried about the online component of Red Dead Redemption 2?

58:55.000 --> 59:04.000
No, not really, because I own, like, Grand Theft Auto 5, and I mean, nowadays, like, I really should.

59:04.000 --> 59:14.000
It's funny, because, like, once again, I watch people play Grand Theft Auto Online, but I don't actually go and play Grand Theft Auto Online, even though I have it on multiple systems.

59:14.000 --> 59:23.000
It, there's so many options to, like, gain experience and stuff in the game. Yeah, there's a lot of grindy things with it, but it's, now they have, like, so many options available to you.

59:23.000 --> 59:29.000
Like, if you just wanted to, like, play online races and earn money and experience that way, you could probably do that.

59:29.000 --> 59:40.000
And so there's a lot of stuff out there, plus all the user-generated things, which is pretty awesome. So they have, like, you know, people can make their own custom race courses in there, and a lot of people play that, and there's lots of unique game modes coming out of that.

59:40.000 --> 59:51.000
So I am looking forward to how Red Dead does it, and yeah, I'm sure they'll have the shark cards or some equivalent to that, you know, money bags or whatever the hell it's gonna be in Red Dead, but it's not required.

59:51.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I mean, granted, they'll try to push you in that direction, but yet, ultimately, you don't need to do it, and honestly, the single player is worth the price of admission anyways, so I'm honestly okay with it.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Dungeonbuster in our chat, excuse me, over at live.vognetwork.com says, delaying Witcher 3 turned out pretty good for that game. Same with taking off a year to make sure AC Origins would be good. So delays aren't bad news anymore.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:37.000
The big thing about this, though, is that while they've announced PS4 and Xbox One, we still have nothing about a PC version, which, I mean, a lot of people are, you know, pretty hardcore PC gamers now, especially since you have a lot more flexibility on PC than you do on the home consoles.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I think it'll just come out later on PC.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Kind of like how GTA did.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
That's how all of their PC versions have...

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Yeah, they're worried about the piracy element of it.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I just want to see it modded.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Alright, well, let's move on with some more news for the people playing on PlayStation 4.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Yeah, so now there's a little bit more, you know, kind of an answer to the question, well, I won't, you know, should I get PlayStation 4 Pro? I don't own a 4K TV. What's it in for me?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Well, now they're adding system-wide super sampling to the system, so now that's going to be coming in firmware update 5.5, and it's basically going to allow games to render at a higher resolution than displayed on the screen, making the image look less aliased and also a little bit sharper, so that's kind of cool.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And, you know, still thinking about it. Haven't done it yet, but I am considering it just for the PlayStation VR stuff, and eventually a 4K TV.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Yeah, see, I'm the audience for this, because I don't have a 4K TV, but I do, yeah, super sampling stuff sounds really exciting.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Actually, I have been using, the PlayStation is now in my office, hooked up to my 4K monitor, so I have been using it here and there a little bit, but I don't really, I mean, a lot of the games don't, like, suddenly render in 4K.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It's like a lot of the interface stuff is 4K, and some things here and there might be, but usually the games themselves don't get, like, this gigantic upgrade visually. It might get, like, more frames a second.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah, more performance, more details and stuff like that, but it's kind of worth it. I'm waiting for the price to come down a little bit on that, just because I do have a PlayStation 4 already, and it's fine for what I'm using it for, so I don't know.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Maybe later, maybe when they come out with that new rumored controller for VR and stuff, and then I can kind of get a more powerful system to go with a new TV that hopefully I'll have at that time.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:47.000
All right. Well, you know, we play a little bit of Pokemon Go around here. I think all the hosts played that game a little bit, and I know some of you are still playing it.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Niantic, the company that makes that game, as well as Ingress, which we talked about a couple weeks ago on this show in depth, Niantic made another interesting acquisition this week.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:02.000
They already acquired one company a few weeks ago that does, like, the, I think it was, like, the avatars and stuff. Now they've acquired Escher Reality.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Escher Reality focuses on the, quote, persistent cross-platform multi-user experiences, and it's through AR.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Escher's been doing AR a while, I guess, and even Escher's CEO, Ross Finman, in an interview with TechCrunch said, everyone thought we were crazy at that time, but Escher is now working on creating AR developer toolkit to work on mobile.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Apple has their AR kit. Google has AR core. They all have toolkits, but Escher specifically is focusing on the multi-platform and multi-user experiences.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So could Niantic be trying to get in on this for Pokemon Go? They've already released some AR stuff where, like, the Pokemon are in the room. I did it once.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It was, like, one of those, oh, that's kind of neat, and then that was it. I never did it again.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I like to catch a Dratini in the toilet. It was great. I wish I still had that screenshot.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
It's probably better for kids, but for me, it was, like, I did that once, and I was, like, okay, I'm already over it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But this is interesting because this makes it sound like maybe you will battle other people in the real world, but through the phones.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So I don't know if that would be, like, something that works into an existing game, like, maybe an Ingress if I see a blue agent show up.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I can start zapping them or something, but I just, that would kind of change that game significantly.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Maybe Niantic is developing something for the Harry Potter game. Maybe this is how the spells are going to work or something.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Wizarding duels.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Who knows? Yeah, maybe. So it may not be for one of their existing games.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Cast a spell. Throw your phone.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And, but you have to yell when you do it. You have to do Avada Kedavra or whatever the thing is they say to kill people. Right?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Right, Darsakha? That's what you have to do.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I wouldn't want to kill people. I would want to use the septum separa.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
But you have to throw your phone when you do it.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Which would basically just rip people to shreds. They could live through that, but they'd hurt for a while.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I'm sorry, was that a little too violent?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000
No, that's fine. So Niantic's been buying some companies, but it's going to be a little while before we know what they do with them.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
You know what? Microsoft should buy Niantic.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Why not?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
No.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Since Microsoft has infinite pockets. That would be great. Yes, Niantic should really be developing games for the Xbox One. That sounds like a great idea.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:26.000
It's a mobile device. Strap it to your body. Somehow have some sort of gas power generator to power the thing. It could be done.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It could be done.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
It's dieselpunk at that point.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Anyway, we need to go back a few years, Darsakha.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Okay. Well, you know I love some classic games, right?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Well, and apparently I didn't realize that y'all had already talked about the Replicade X Centipede.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
There is a new Kickstarter for Replicade X Tempest.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So, is it X or X? I don't know if it's supposed to be.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:02.000
But it's going to be a one-sixth scale machine that is going to be Tempest in all of its beautiful vector glory.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And they've just passed their funding goal of $20,000.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And so, in fact, they've hit $100,000.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:19.000
If you pledge $90 to this, you'll get the machine, but you can also do higher tiers for more machines.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000
But, you know, I think it's going to be interesting. It's a 3.5 inch LCD screen with LED backlighting.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And runs on micro-USB lithium-ion batteries. So, we'll see.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I think it's going to be cool. I mean, I wouldn't mind having one.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But then again, I also do have an UltraCade in my garage. Just saying.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Do you kick it regularly?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I do. I hit it with a dart.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Oh, good.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Ours is technically not like an actual UltraCade, but a Pandora's box.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Okay.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
But it's in an UltraCade cabinet.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Yeah. I love the idea of this. This is perfect for me. Like an itty bitty cabinet.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I like this idea more than I do the Centipede one.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Because I was like, God, that Centipede joystick is going to be so tiny and hard to play.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Centipede's rollerball. Trekball.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Oh, that's right. It's a Trekball. But, well, maybe that will work okay.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I mean, Tempest, that I think would work pretty well with a little dial, even if it's small.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Let's be a tiny little nipple.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I think it'd be big enough. I mean, probably the screen size and everything would probably be around about,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
like, what my iPad one is. What's that thing called again?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The XCade? No. Is that what it was called?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I-Cade.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I-Cade. That was it.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Oh, you have one of those?

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I do have an I-Cade. I never use it, but I do have one.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
It's in the garage.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
No, that's what we have.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Mine is in the garage.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SEAL.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
All right. Well, Loki, what do you have for us?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So, going back even further, there was a world record originally held by a guy named Todd Rogers for the game Dragster that was on the Atari.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And he also held the world record for having the longest undisputed record in a video game as well.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Well, it was undisputed for a reason. It's impossible.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:29.000
So, apparently, after some research, because no one's been able to get close to this, there was a speed runner that created with Eric Omnigamer Coziel.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
He created a tool assisted run, basically allowing him to create the fastest possible time.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And it can only get it down to 5.57 seconds using all the tools available to him.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And basically saying even without tools, it would be impossible to get close to that as well.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And based on the findings and people testing it, there's just no way to ever hit that time.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
So, because of that, what happened?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Well, a whole bunch of backlash.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So, first, all of Todd Rogers...

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000
And there's a little bit more drama behind it, too, because I actually did watch a video regarding this Todd Rogers guy.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So, apparently, he had a friend at Twin Galaxies who would vet his scores for him despite not really having evidence.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And sometimes they wouldn't even really have...

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Ooh, ouch.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
You know, it would just basically be submitting stuff without any evidence.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And then he claims that there's tapes out there, but they lost the tapes, you know?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:36.000
So, anyways, so not only has he had this taken off of Twin Galaxies, he's been disqualified from the Twin Galaxies scoreboards altogether.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
So, he's had all of his records removed from the database.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And the Guinness Book World Records has also removed his two records from their books or database as well.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
So, he no longer holds the world record for Dragster and he no longer holds the world longest standing video game record.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Maybe he could have one, though, for the longest standing video game scam.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
He's still claiming that he's innocent, but he says,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Although I disagree with their decision, I must applaud them for their strong stance on the matter of cheating.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
While I do maintain that Twin Galaxies is wrong in my particular case,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:26.000
if the investigation into my scores and subsequent banning can serve as a catalyst to clean the database of questionable scores and facilitate methods to catch further cheaters, this is a positive thing.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
He's fucking guilty. He knows it.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Interesting. Now, did you hear, I know it's not in the show role, but there was a very, very similar thing this week that involved Billy Mitchell and Donkey Kong.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Oh, the fuck did he do this time?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:52.000
That basically somebody was able to prove, and I think it's by the way the screens draw, that some of his scores, the ones that were above a million, were actually done on MAME emulators.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
They were not done on an actual cabinet.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
But I believe he still holds a high score. It's not like, but here's the difference.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:08.000
We know Billy Mitchell is capable because one of the scores he got in front of like a live audience at a expo sort of thing.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So I think it's very different. And I don't want to necessarily lump these two stories together.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Right.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:23.000
But it and for all we know, for all we know, Billy Mitchell may not have known that these machines he was playing on were emulated, but he might have known.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
We should just go back to selling his sauce.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Did you know I finally got to meet him all these years? He was at Dragon Con. He's a nice guy.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I would give him the benefit of the doubt because at least it seems like he has the skills to do it. This guy, he's never like, you know, shown that he can do this again.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And that's the clear difference I wanted to make is that there is like, okay, there is another really good gaming documentary.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I know we've talked about on the show before, not the King of Kong, which we know is good, but on Netflix, it was man versus snake.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I think it was called. Have you seen that one? No, it's pretty good.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And it's another like back and forth sort of score thing. And it turns out, you know, well, I don't know if I should spoil it, but I'll just say this.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
The whole emulator angle comes into play in that.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And I think there's a question of and it just kind of depends on who you want to believe and what you want to believe.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Did the guy know that or not when he was getting the score?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And so I think, you know, especially if it took, I mean, Billy Mitchell's that, that, that King of Kong is like fucking 10 years old. Right?

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:31.000
So like if it's gone unnoticed this long that he's been getting scores, maybe he didn't even realize that these machines were emulators.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
He owned a machine. Like he's got to own a machine. I would hope so. And I would assume that.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.000
So does the other guy. He owns his own machine and, uh, but his, I think was a reconversion.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
His had been converted to one thing and he had to convert it back. Yeah. It's so hard to know these days too.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000
What I could go walk out by a donkey Kong machine, bring it home and come to find out it's, it's been overclocked.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:02.000
It's just like, what was it? The black tiger. There was a thing with black tigers back when I was actually trying to compete in that stupid, uh, ready player one contest.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
They had one of the games you had to break the record on was black tiger.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000
And I think it's impossible because if I remember correctly, it was, there's like a version of the game, like the Japanese game.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
That's a totally different game or something like that. Um, scores differently the way it's played.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And, but it, the record was on very specific version of the game and it's not like either not possible or not easy to get that type of score on that.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Uh, Dungeon Buster in chat says the hardware arcade version of donkey Kong does a windows wipe refresh from one side of the screen to the other.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But under maim, it renders the screen in chunks from the evidence that I saw. And that's what was seen. Yeah. That's how they figured it out.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:46.000
They had to slow the video way the fuck down to see how it was loading and they realized it does not load.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I mean, that is a, that's a pretty impressive thing to notice. You know what I mean? That's, you know, that, that person is very good at Where's Waldo books, I'm sure.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Or as a designer.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Perhaps, perhaps. Anyway, so anyway, two, two different classic gaming controversies, but I thought the Billy Mitchell thing was worthy of bringing up right there.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And also, you know, that, that he did, uh, perform, sorry, I guess some of these microphones on the Fritz. I don't know what that was.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Uh, I just put my down. I apologize for the loud.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Okay. Yeah. Sorry. My mic is dying. Okay. We're going to have to, sorry. I apologize for the audio, but that is, I'll just leave it on the boobs.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Yes. That is what happens. The cords coming out of it is the cord coming out. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm going to make sure you're muted.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:37.000
So go ahead and do what you need to do to try to plug that back in. And. Oh, sorry.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
The casing was coming off the connector, like the cover of the strain relief. Okay. So hopefully, hopefully that'll be a little better. All right.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Anyways, I was going to say he said he claims that he did this, the 5.5, one run for employees of Activision during the eighties.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Um, the people, you know, was one of the developers of the game said that they remember him doing the run, but they don't remember that score in particular, but they just remember that he was really good at the game.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So I don't know. I think if you don't, if you can't come up with evidence showing that you did this, it's just, he knows if he, he cheated or not.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I mean, I don't know. Well, what's he going to do is swear on a stack of Bibles. Like, you know, it's, you got to have the receipt. It wasn't like I'd give it to him.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Like I give him the benefit of doubt if it was just this one game, but there's a lot of other games that he has impossible scores on. Like there's a game.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:37.000
He had a score that was impossible to get because it increments by fives and it was like ended with a seven. It's like, okay, that doesn't, that can't happen.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:45.000
All right. Well, moving on to one more story before we get to the classic game of the week here on OLR this week, it has to do with a somewhat classic game.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:16:01.000
It's not 10 years old at this point, but it's a few years old. Rock Band Network. Rock Band Network songs on all legacy consoles, including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii are no longer going to be available for purchase via Rock Band beginning later this month.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:13.000
You can continue to play previously purchased songs, but, yeah, the delisting is going to be taken down. This has to do with community released DLC and not anything that's harmonics released DLC.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:24.000
So, yeah, that's, that's too bad, but I guess I'm sure this has to do with like probably some type of like five-year license window or something. We've got to be looking at the end of that right about now.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Rock Band Network was a, um, or the, the, the spinoff game for Rock Band was really cool.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Um, the like music, the rhythm game?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah. The, you know, the one that was basically like frequency.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Yeah. Rock Band Live Party. I don't remember what it's called.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I wish that one would come back. So anyway, uh, get, get those songs before they start, uh, pulling them all down. It's kind of, kind of too bad. I hope that's not the beginning of the end of Rock Band though. That'd be sad.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:00.000
But it's probably just a licensing thing or just some type of like the agreement that people were signing going into that or something like that.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000
All right. Well, let's, let's go back to a simpler time when, uh, games were on cartridges, so they lasted forever.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Yes.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Or maybe CDs. I think maybe this week's pick. Uh, Dark Soccer.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
No, this one was not CD. This was cartridge.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Well, then we're going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that Jamie thinks, Hey, Bratz, blow on this cartridge and check this out. What's the classic game of the week?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:32.000
In the U S it was called Sky Shark. It also was released under the name Flying Shark. Um, he shows on me.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Um, real quick. I'm sorry. Do you, do you know why I thought it was CD? Cause at first I thought it was sewer shark. Whoops.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000
By the way, this music to this day is one of my favorite pieces of gaming music and it was not in the arcade.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:57.000
This is one of the few games that a better soundtrack on the Nintendo entertainment system than it did in the arcade.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:05.000
But yes, I have a story about this game too. So Sky Shark, um, came out in 1987.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Um, it's a vertical scrolling shooter game that was developed by Toaplan. Um, and if I am right, I believe that Toaplan also did the, uh, uh, much, much, uh, lauded, um, crap, no I forgot what it was.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Trekkston. Trekkston's pretty fun, but we'll go to that. They also did like Tiger Heli, like Slap Fight, Rally Bike, Twin Cobra.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So, but anyway, um, Sky Shark also had a sequel in 1989 called Fire Shark. Um, the game was published by Taito in Japan.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.000
By Electricoin in the U.S. I'm sorry, in the U.K. and by Romstar in North America.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So basically it's, it's almost like any, I guess, other vertical, um, scrolling shooter. Um, but I like this one because you play in a biplane.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Um, and it's, you know, very kinda war, you know, theme instead of just, oh, future shooting or pew pew with crazy stuff.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:17.000
It had, like, quite a bit more realism with it, but you also did, of course, have, you know, your bonuses that you can get from shooting down planes.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:30.000
You get power-ups, and, um, it starts and ends on a runway, so that's actually kinda something I think is cool, just that at each stage isn't just, okay, you float in the air for a little while, okay, next stage.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:42.000
You land your plane, get your score, and you move on. Um, your bombs, um, multiply every three thousand points that you get, and, but you start off with three bombs at the start of each stage.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Um, and it has five stages and then loops back to stage two indefinitely. Um, but again, the, this just had, like, I don't know what it was about those Toaplan arcade games during this time,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:13.000
but, like, the music just wasn't always great, you know, and this, though, bringing it to the home version, it had great music. It was super good, you know, and with this game, I was, like, at the time, you know, I was like, I hate war games.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I hate, I mean, my dad almost bought me MagMax, okay, and MagMax is terrible. My sister loved MagMax for some reason.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:36.000
So, um, when he got me my NES, um, he got me SkyShark, and I ended up freakin' loving this game.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And, I mean, to this day, this is probably on my list of favorite shooters. Like, Guardian Legend would be up there, you know, at least in the vertical realm, this one is on my list.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:59.000
You know, I'd also would add, like, even though it's not only vertical, I'd add, like, Salamander to my list of favorite verticals.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
When I think of bi-playing games, I think of, like, 1942.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I love 1942. Um, but this, I have a softer spot in my heart for this game than for 1942.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I have to be honest, I've never played it.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Well, it did come out on the Commodore 64, Rob.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
What? And I still missed it.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It did. It was also, I like this music, too. The game just had great music. I mean, it was awesome.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
But, um, it came out on Amiga, for MS-DOS, the ZX Spectrum, so you know, it looked like crap.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Um, the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, the X68000, and the FM Towns.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:47.000
And, of course, the NES. Now, the NES had, um, it was actually the first music, uh, composition by Tim Follin.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And, let me see if I can find you some of the other stuff he did, because, I mean, he did some really just awesome game music.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
But, um, he did, let's see...

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Thanks for bearing with me.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Did a whole bunch of Mega Drive games.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Uh, did, uh, the Starsky and Hutch soundtrack for the games.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You know, so, just lots of stuff.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Uh, he did some of the retooling for Ghouls and Ghosts on the Amiga. He did Solstice.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000
You know, so, really, really good sound designer.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Um, but yeah, this game is seriously one of my favorites.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:38.000
But one thing of note, the NES port is a North American exclusive.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Oh, interesting.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
This did not come out in Japan.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Well, but they had FM Towns and MSX and Europe had ZX, so they had, none of that was stuff we were gonna get, so...

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:58.000
But, to this day, mostly because of the music, I would consider this one of the superior home releases.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Fair enough.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:06.000
It's so funny, because I know you probably didn't listen to last week's show, but I did a sub out for Classic Game, as I usually do, when I know you're not gonna be here.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And I picked a game, and I did the Commodore 64 version based on the music, which is Bomb Jack. I don't know if you saw, but that was the game I picked last week.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Bomb Jack's a fun game.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Yeah, but the Commodore 64 version specifically had a very memorable soundtrack, because they actually took, like, an 80's synth song and, like, redid it with the Commodore 64's SID chip.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Anyway, not to derail, but I just thought it was funny that our picks have that in common.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Yeah, but I mean, you can't listen to this and say, oh, that sucks. This is good, engaging music.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Quality chip tune.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But you remember we were talking earlier about how it's part, sometimes, the music that makes the game.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Yeah.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I've played the arcade Flying Shark. In fact, at California Extreme, they had a sit-down table of the Japanese version, and I played it, but the music is what will make me play the Nintendo version over the arcade. Every time.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Alright.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I like how you brought that full circle. Let's listen to a little more of the soundtrack here to take us out.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Sky Shark, classic of the week.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I like that you brought that full circle, Dark Soccer.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Not intentionally, but it was getting, the Stage 3 music is my favorite music in the game.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Got it stuck in my head. I was like, have I done Sky Shark? I haven't done Sky Shark! This is happening.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Alright. We're going to take a quick break. We have plenty more show to come. We're going to talk about, of course, release dates. We actually have a lot of emails tonight, so Dark Soccer is going to get ready for that.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
We're going to talk about movies based on video games, and we'll talk about porn. Because, you know, we always find a way to work that in.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
All this and more on Orange Lounge Radio when we come back, right after this.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 717 already in progress for this February 4th of 2018. Hope you all are having a good night so far.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.000
We got plenty more news to cover and things like that, so let's just jump right into some rapid fire news with Loki.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Alright, so this is interesting, but apparently this is canon now. Tom Hall and John Romero, they had went to Twitter, I guess, to talk about the official canon of B.J. Blackwitz.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And apparently, so here's how it goes. So, B.J. Blackwitz is Commander Keen's grandfather. And Commander Keen is, I guess, the Doomguy's father.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:52.000
So, that means B.J. Blackwitz is Doomguy's great-grandfather. Interesting, I guess. It all ties together.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000
What a small world we live in. What a coincidence. What a bunch of games where the plot really doesn't matter.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Pretty much. Where does Duke Nukem have to fall into this?

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Cousin. Godparent. Ruiner of lives.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Brother-in-law.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I don't know, brother-in-law. Wife.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Now, this is also something that we probably thought we'd never see, but what happens when you have a game that's on the Nintendo platform that's made by a Microsoft company?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Well, you get skins from Minecraft that are with Master Chief and the Gears of War folks and Halo and, you know, Banjo-Kazooie and other stuff.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So, yes, now you can play as Master Chief in the Mario-themed skinned world on the Nintendo Switch.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Okay, that is kind of neat that, you know, Nintendo and Microsoft are playing along together. That is kind of cool. I like that.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:59.000
So, that's available now as a skin pack. Along with that, if you're not necessarily a fan of Microsoft stuff, you can get Moana, which is made by Disney.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Another company that Microsoft should purchase.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Why not?

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And then they could just do, like, you know.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
They could just make all the Marvel games.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
That's right.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
And all the Star Wars games.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
They could do theme park rides. You know, they could do a Halo roller coaster at Disneyland.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Why not? Why not? Anyway, let's move on to some other news. Let's talk about some controversy. There's unfortunately a lot of it going on right now.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And this one has to do with the GDC and a lifetime achievement award. I guess actually it's, what do they call it? I don't think they call it the lifetime achievement award.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:44.000
They call it a pioneer award. And they have actually retracted. They were going to offer it to Nolan Bushnell, who of course, you know, founded Atari and did a lot with the old school days of gaming.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:53.000
But they've actually retracted the offer because essentially it came to light about some of the fraternity-like culture at Atari that was in the early days.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Which, as you know, there's a high visibility on how women are treated in a lot of different industries right now, most notably Hollywood.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:08.000
But obviously there's been a lot of that that's come back on games. And so, you know, there's been a lot of questions about how women were treated in some of the early days of Atari.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So, anyhow, the official statement from the GDC said, the Game Developers Choice Awards Advisory Committee, who vote on the special award winners for each show, have made the decision not to give out a pioneer award for this year's event, following additional feedback from the community.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:30.000
They believe their pick should reflect the values of today's game industry and will dedicate this year's award to honor the pioneering and unheard voices of the past.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
So, you know, most probably politically correct turnaround they could do.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Nolan Bushnell, not really putting up a fight over it or anything, in a statement response on Twitter, said, I applaud the GDC for ensuring that their institution reflects what is right, specifically with regards to how people should be treated in the workplace.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:55.000
If my personal actions or the actions of anyone who ever worked with me offended or caused pain to anyone at our companies, then I apologize without reservation.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:07.000
So at least, you know, he's saying the right thing in this particular scenario, so hopefully we can focus on making the future better, because we can't fix what's happened in the past.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
We can only take history and learn from it.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Hopefully people still aren't doing cocaine while they make games. I mean, you know, there was a lot that was going on in the old days. Anyway.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
How else do you expect them to stay awake and not feel anything?

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:30.000
How else do you think E.T. was done in six weeks? Jesus. Anyway, not that it's right, but I'm just saying, there's definitely a different gaming culture back then and maybe one that we don't need to continue perpetuating.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Anyhow, let's talk about Monster Hunter, because I know a ton of people are playing the new one, Monster Hunter World.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:45.000
None of us talked about it at the top of the show. I should say, I watched Shane play it, my buddy Shane, through the magic of PlayStation 4 SharePlay.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I watched him play a little bit of it, because I wanted to see if it was something I'd be into.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And I don't know, you guys. I wasn't super into, like, the combat and stuff, but I know people that are super into it, so cool. You know what? If you're into it, awesome.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But, if you are still playing some of the older Monster Hunter games, specifically Monster Hunter Frontier Z, the online service will be ending on the Xbox 360 and the Wii U, in Japan anyway, on August 1st.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I don't even think these games are still in.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Well, it was on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Right? I don't even think these games were running in the U.S.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
The company at Microsoft had to buy for that to happen.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.000
So yeah, those games are going to be basically no longer online, which is going to kill a lot of the functionality of them.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
But, at least there is a new Monster Hunter game I think most people have moved on to.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And yeah, like you said, Xbox 360 in Japan, and even the Wii U.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
You know, we talked last week, they've now officially sold more Switches than Wii U's in Japan.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
So, kind of interesting. Anyway.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:52.000
So, there you go. No more Monster Hunter Frontier Z online, but I'm sure all the fans have moved on to world at this point anyway.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Some stuff.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:05.000
There are, well, okay. We gave Nintendo shit over the handling of the NES Classic and the SNES Classic.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Well, the president of Nintendo confirmed that it will bring back the NES Classic this year and sell it alongside the SNES Classic.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I have yet to see these in stores.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I've seen one while someone was buying it.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I saw a Super Nintendo Classic. I don't remember where, but I've seen them on the shelf.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I love mine. It's so adorable.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I look every time I'm in a store. Not that I'm going to buy one, but I just look.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
You just want to know that if you wanted one, you could.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Yeah.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I still want a Famicom Mini, because it's cute.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Well, this might be your chance. I mean, if the NES Classes are coming back, I would assume the Famicom ones are coming back.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I know it had some different games on it. I'd have to look it up again.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:01.000
It did. I think it had, like, The Legend of Kage was on it, and some other games that, you know, in exchange, there's, I think, one of the other Final Fantasy games was on it instead of the first one.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Yeah.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
The Final Fantasy III is on it in Japan.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Yeah, but I don't read well enough to play it, so.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Yeah. That's the problem, is that some of those games that got subbed out, I'm not going to understand.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Like, you should have seen when I was trying to play Dobutsu no Mori.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Mm-hmm.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Oh, my God. I mean, there was hardly any kanji in it, but I was still like, syntax, syntax, what word is this? I give up. So, yeah. Okay.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I'd have to use that Google picture thing that on my picture.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Well, I'd have to use it now, but that didn't exist when I was playing it.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
You know when I was-

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
That is handy. Yeah.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Yeah, it is handy for that stuff.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:40.000
So, and then this one is also sad and disgusting because I have gone on public saying, gone on public, saying publicly that pedophiles are garbage.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
They're garbage. The ultimate of garbage.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Don't think you're going to find anyone that disagrees with you there.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Well, some people that may have vote for certain, was it governors or senators in certain states?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Touché.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
The president.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Yeah.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Touché.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Anyway, Jess Cliffe, who is the co-creator of Counter Strike, was arrested for sexual exploitation of a child.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Yes, also, you know, designer at Valve was booked on this past Thursday for, didn't say exactly if it was a child harmed or if it was child pornography or something like that.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:32.000
But he was arrested at 1 17 a.m. and has a bail hearing on, I guess it was Friday this past then after that.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:39.000
But, I mean, he was arrested in Seattle for disgusting behavior.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
So, I'm sure we'll find out more.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:49.000
But just hearing that, it turns my stomach. It's the worst.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Let me ask a difficult question, and I don't particularly like these topics because I try to talk about how games are a good thing.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And these stories, they're not really about games, but they are about the people in the industry.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Yeah, these people contributed to gaming culture.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000
But let me ask this difficult question. Can you still play Counter Strike after this?

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Well, I don't like Counter Strike anyway.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Let's say it was something you did like.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Let's say it was Animal Crossing. Would you still be able to play Animal Crossing?

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I would for the sake of the other people that worked on it.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I think that's a fair perspective. Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at, too.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It's much more than just one guy that did this, and there's, you know, there's gonna be assholes at every company.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And I don't think it's fair to throw the company under the bus for what one person did.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Because I've been there personally, and I don't like it.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Which is not the situation, obviously.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:50.000
But I mean, if it was one designer that worked on the whole game, and that designer, you know, raped a ten-year-old,

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
it would soil the game for me.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I mean, that's why there's just certain bands I can't listen to without just having my stomach twist a little bit,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
or why I have trouble watching any of Joss Whedon's stuff anymore.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Well, speaking of movies, you know, there was a lot that came out about Uma Thurman and Quentin Tarantino over this past weekend.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And it kind of ruins Kill Bill, which is like one of the greatest movies.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But then when you hear about, like, how Quentin Tarantino really—and if you guys haven't, like, read about it,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:30.000
you know, basically Tarantino kind of put Uma Thurman's life at risk driving this car in Mexico,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:37.000
damn near killed her, over, you know, this shot, and was kind of—I don't know, it didn't seem like he really handled it in a tactful way.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And meanwhile, all this Weinstein garbage was going on, which just complicates the situation,

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
because one could argue, was Tarantino complicit in that or not?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I'm not going to get into that right now, but the point is, you know, after hearing all that, it's kind of hard to go back and watch Kill Bill,

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
but then you have to kind of realize, oh, but there were, like, hundreds of other people involved in the making of these movies.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:05.000
But at the same time, Hollywood's celebrity culture leads us to go, but this is an Uma Thurman and Quentin Tarantino movie.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I mean, despite the fact that, you know—

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I would watch it for her.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Yeah, but have you noticed the two of them never worked together again after that?

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I did.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I think this puts a definitive note—you know, people always wonder, is there going to be a part three where she takes on the daughter of—

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:28.000
He talked about doing one, you know, he wanted to do another one with her where the little girl came back and was hunting down Beatrix.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
But I don't think that's going to happen.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Not without maybe a different casting.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Or without a lot of talking.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Ass-kissing.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.000
A lot of talking. A lot of—yeah, I don't even know what else to call it.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Anyway, I don't mean to deviate too much, but it's just one of those—

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000
and I think maybe in some ways this makes me very glad that we don't have a celebrity culture in gaming,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000
because I am able to say, well, Counter-Strike, I mean, this guy sucks, period.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
There's no arguing with that.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
But Counter-Strike's not ruined, because there were tons of other people that pitched in with that game.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
There, though, you call it celebrity culture, but really it's business culture.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
And it does exist in video gaming.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
What do you mean? Can you elaborate?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:20.000
A lot of—well, not just in the celebrity world, but in terms of business decisions, in terms of lead programming,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
has to do a lot with networking.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And there are—especially in, say, voice acting, in stage acting, in anything,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
but also in the tech industry, there is a lot of it's who you fucking know.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Oh, sure.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And if someone wants to do you a favor, you have to do them a favor.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000
And especially—it's really difficult, especially for women.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000
We are—especially that's why there's a big push on STEM.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:59.000
But we tend to still get kind of shafted in these things, unless there's a little bit more incentive.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I guess my point is that it's more like there's not the same name stuff that goes into video games.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Now, granted, there's some.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.000
There's Miyamoto, there's Cliffy B, there's some developers that kind of have that.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
For better or for worse, right?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000
There's also a guy that did Fable. Peter Molyneux.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
There's also these guys too, for better or for worse.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
But I feel like it's not like it is in movies.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
In movies, sometimes the only reason you go to see a movie is because of who's in it.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
You know what I mean?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Well, Cher, right.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Yeah, we were talking just before the show.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
The only reason Mamma Mia 2 is acceptable is because Cher is going to sing for them.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I didn't even see the last one, so I'm going to see this one because of Cher.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Exactly.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Well, because she is a goddess.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Oh, bitch.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
That was a little bit more Chad and a little less Cher.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I tried.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Somehow I got the picture in my head of Mr. Ed singing that.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Oh, bitch, it's just a sprain.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
That's what Cher is going to sound like in retirement home.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
But you know her tweets also read like her voice.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I fucking love.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Cher on Twitter is a blessing.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
It is a blessing.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000
It is a privilege to be able to read this divine message from her.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
There are two things I am so thankful for in this world, and I wouldn't be able to live without it.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Cher on Twitter and Falafel.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
You went to Pita Kitchen.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I did go to Pita Kitchen.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Bitch.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
No.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
You also look closer than I do.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
By the way, AkumaJP and Chad is yelling out Kojima.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Kojima, absolutely.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Yes, of course.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Absolutely a celebrity name.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
But I mean.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Sorry.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Sorry.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I don't mean to cut you off.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
But bringing that since you mentioned Kojima, bringing that celebrity culture into kind

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000
of Death Stranding a little bit with the Norman Reedus, with the Guillermo del Toro and,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
you know, Mads, Mick and Hannibal, whatever his name is.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:54.000
But so you get a lot more now of that crossover in video games and in the celebrity thing.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Those names are big names.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Their likenesses are what's selling, you know.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I mean, you know, they've even said in some cases not getting licensed to, you know, someone's appearance.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Like that hurt.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:16.000
From what I remember reading, it hurt the initial sales of the Back to the Future pinball table because Michael J. Fox wouldn't license his likeness to it.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000
You know, I mean, that's just an example.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000
But I mean, I think that the same sort of behind the scenes things happen in any industry.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And so people are going to talk, people are going to network amongst themselves and someone will go, oh, don't hire this person.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
They did this or they're like that, you know, wink, wink.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
You know, that does still happen.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
You know, it is who you know and what people are saying about you.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Well, you know, we're in a very interesting shift right now in culture in general with all these movements that are going on.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
So it's just going to be very interesting to see what gaming looks like five years from now.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Accountability is happening and it's past fucking time for it.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Hold them accountable. Throw out the garbage.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
All right.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Let's move on. We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I didn't mean for rapid fire news to take so long, but you know what?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Sometimes sometimes you got to dive deep into a topic.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Let's go around the world and check out the U.S. Loki.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Yes. So we have a game called Marooners coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Shadow of the Colossus coming out on PlayStation 4 on PC.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
We've got Civ 6 Rise and Fall that's coming out.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Octogeddon on PC.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Rust looks like it's coming out of early access on PC, Mac and Linux.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Dragon Quest Builders on Nintendo Switch.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.000
The Seven Deadly Sins Knights of Britannia on PlayStation 4.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.000
And finally, Under Night In-Birth EXE Late State.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
What the hell is that?

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Late something. It's got to be a Japanese game.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
PlayStation 3, 4 and Vita. That's it.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
All right. We got some Japanese releases this week. Quite a few of them.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Shin Sangoku Musou 8 comes out in Japan on PlayStation 4 this week.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
As well as Wanda 2 Kyozu comes out this week.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet and Dragon's Crown Pro.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
That's the one with the boobs.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I actually kind of want to play this on PlayStation.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Sometimes things are so over the top they're funny.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
It's like a John Waters movie, right? John Waters of games.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Let's see what else we have. Under Night In-Birth EXE Late.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
That whole thing is also...

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Yeah, I think it's Late or Latest.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
That's what it's supposed to be.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And then it's a busy week in Japan this week.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Actually, no. I think that's it on PlayStation 4.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I wanted to see what Shin Sangoku Musou was.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
That's the Dynasty Warriors.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Is that Dynasty Warriors 8? Oh, it sure is.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I think it's Dynasty Warriors 9.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Wait, does...Sangoku is like Three Kingdoms?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Is there a Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I keep forgetting that.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
I only thought it was Dynasty Warriors because that's next week.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
You have Dynasty Warriors 9, so...

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Got it. All right. So, lots of that.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Nothing on the Vita this week.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Okay, I was right. IkumaJP said I was right.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Yay, okay.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
It's nice. I'm glad you're able to listen this week, IkumaJP.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
I know you've been very busy lately, so it's always nice to have you here

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000
when we really, really badly misrepresent what's going on in Japan.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I don't mind being corrected. I want to get it right.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000
On Nintendo Switch in Japan this week, we have Cave Story Plus

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
gets its Japanese release, as well as Gal Metal comes out in Japan.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
That sounds cool.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
On the Switch. And then on the 3DS, nothing.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
3DS, I think, is somewhat slowing down,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
although we have a Radiant Historia chronology coming out in the coming week.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
How about the UK, DarkSocker?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I wish we'd get an Animal Crossing on Switch.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Cross your fingers and your toes. There's a lot of people with you.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Right. On the 6th, we have Civ VI Rise and Fall for PC.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Well, I know that makes you happy.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Yay.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
On the 7th, Shadow of the Colossus for PS4.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.000
And Atomic Rungun Jumpgun on Switch. That's a fun name.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And then the 12th is Crossing Souls for PS4.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000
All right. We are going to get back into some news after we dive into the mailbag.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
It's sticky.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Yeah, there's a lot in there tonight. I think there's like three emails from one person.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
No, there's like four. Five, actually. And three of them are from the same person.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
All right. Well, we're going to get into the mailbag tonight.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
But you know what? I'm happy because we've gone like two or three weeks

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
where we had no emails. So I'm not going to go.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
We're making up for it tonight, DarkSockra.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send an email

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
to get DarkSockra's mailbag all sticky.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Yeah.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000
All right. Dive into the mailbag and pull some emails out for us, Jamie.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000
I apologize for contributing to or failing to contribute to your recent lack of content in

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
AKA he said e-mailbag. It's just mailbag.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Branding. Branding is important. Mailbag.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I'll just say that I, over the Christmas slash winter holiday stale on, stale?

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Sale on Steam, decided to finally check out the free-to-play Smash Brothers style

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000
fighter brawl holla. I'm still generally enjoying it.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And rather than play than pay the $20 or 15 when on sale to unlock all 37

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
characters, I'm just using the in-game coins from daily logins,

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000
daily missions to use certain characters play and leveling up to buy them

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
individually and we'll get more used to their relatively unique mechanics.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I might eventually support it with some cosmetics.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
This is definitely not on anyone's game of the year. It's intentionally derivative.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
The characters aren't as distinctly different as the actual cast of Smash Brothers.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Items are few and besides the central weapons, mechanics largely ineffective.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.000
And some of the signature moves, some of the signature moves central, wait,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I can't. All right.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And some of the signature move collision detection leaves me shaking my head.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
But overall, I'm very much having fun with the game for what it is.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I'm still useless at ranked one versus one as one would expect of me.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
This comes from Robert M. I had not heard of this game.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I'm actually I have the steam app open on my phone.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I'm looking at it now to put it in my queue because I like free to play and I

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
like Smash Brothers. I mean, he kind of says it's not going to, you know,

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
change the world, but it looks it looks cute from these screenshots.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I'll check it out. Next email. Yes, please. Hey, guys.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I think it's been a while, as in a couple of years since I sent a message.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
But I just heard last Sunday's classic game of the week, Bomb Jack.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Hearing the Commodore 64 soundtrack for the first time in years brought back so

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
many memories. I played that game to death on both the Commodore 64 and in our

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.000
local arcade. One thing about the game that was was that there was no real end.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
So long as you didn't lose all of your lives, it would just keep going.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
We had a few guys at the local arcade who were banned from playing the game by the

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
owner. They'd become so good at it that at it.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
At the at the I'm sorry, there's an extra thing in here.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:14.000
It becomes so good at the game and could sit at the machine for hours on one credit.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Thanks for initiating my 80s gaming flashback this evening.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000
It brought a smile to my face after a long day at work.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Still listening to the show every week. Wayne in. You're welcome.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I'm glad you had some good memories like I do. There's so many Commodore 64 songs,

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
specifically just that that SID chip just brings back so many memories.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:36.000
So but you're right. A lot of those classic 80s games never ended unless it was like

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Pac-Man and a malfunction, a glitch caused it to end after 256.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Most of those games wouldn't end. So that's really I like the story about the

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000
friends getting banned because they were too damn good at it.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Love it. Robert and actually sent the same mail twice. Oh,

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
but there's an addendum. OK. Just to clarify, in rescinding,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I left out that the twenty dollars would be to unlock all the characters that

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000
probably came through in context. Yes, it did. Also, of the major smash likes,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Brawlhalla appears to, appears exclusive to general PC and PS4 rivals

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000
of Aether to Windows and Xbox One. The heck was that?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
There was a big like boom type of thing outside.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So I'm just going to get up and make sure everything's OK outside.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
It probably didn't come through on the microphones, but there was a scary noise outside.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.000
I'm just going to take a look outside real quick. OK. Brawlout on Windows and Switch

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000
and the other consoles later, although my understanding is that one is critically

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
third place again from Robert N.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:45.000
So moving back to our last email, then, if you are already.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Hello, LR. After the mention of two games terminating service in the coming months,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I thought I'd put a different perspective on it. Perhaps when you were little,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:59.000
just as I did, you went to the arcade and there was a game that you,

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
a game there that you just had to play with your friends.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Maybe it was one of the TMNT games, maybe X-Men or Street Fighter 2 or NBA Jam

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000
or something else. You dumped quarters into them one after another.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
You played like crazy until you beat the game. And next time you went back there,

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
you did it again and again and again. Sorry. And then again.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
And you had a hell of a great time doing it. But then sometime later,

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000
maybe you weren't as interested anymore. And sometime after that,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
you went back one day and the game was gone or perhaps the arcade closed entirely.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Your time with that game was done and you spent quite a bit of money on it,

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
but you had a fantastic time playing it. So you didn't really think,

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
well, I guess I wasted my money. Even today you reminisce about how much fun you had playing it.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000
That, I think, is the mindset you need to adopt when dealing with the closing of online only games.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Think of it as your arcade getting rid of the game. True, you may have spent money on it,

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000
but you had fun while the game was there and nothing can take that away from you.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
It's a bummer that the game is gone, sure, but nothing lasts forever.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I'm going to stop one thing on that. If you pay money for a game with the intention

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:08.000
of having it in your home as long as you want it, that is where the problem comes in.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I'm going to continue. I'll just end by saying, why am I grabbing your Pikachu's ear?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
He likes it. There you go. Squeeze, squeeze.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I'll just end by saying that I'm hoping to end Super Multitasking's beta testing phase

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.000
and begin promotion this Friday. So if you are listening, if you do any streaming,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000
and you want to be one of the first to play it on stream, regardless of the size of your audience,

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:40.000
please reach out to me on Twitter at at yyr underscore or email me at yyr at yyrgames.com.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Thanks. And that's all the time we have for this email, so just remember,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.000
the next time you're at the checkout counter and you hear that beep, think of the fun

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
you could have on Super Market Sweep.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I will.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Bye bye, Aaron Yyr.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
You missed the tangent on Buzzer on Twitch, and they show all the old game shows,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
and the Buzzer on TV, because there's two of them, there's Twitch, there's TV,

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
the Buzzer on TV is getting Super Market Sweep, or just got Super Market Sweep this month.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Oh, girl, I bet you need new underwear.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
YYR saw it for the first time, it sounds like, that game show.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Oh.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Anyway.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Maybe if they, is it a new one or the old episodes?

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
It's the old ones from the 80s, the ones that were on Lifetime all the time.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
See, they should do a-

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
With David Ruprecht, was that his name?

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
They should do a new one and not have them wear those ugly sweatshirts.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Fuck yeah, they should. No, and the ugly sweatshirts are like a staple.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
But they have to, but they also have to go through self-checkout.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
All right. They have to go to one of those new Amazon stores and steal it all.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:43.000
The one thing I wanted to say is, Jamie, I think you kind of had a similar thought to what I did with YYR's little comparison there.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
And like, look, I get where you're going with that.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
And, you know, I want to see eye to eye there.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:58.000
But that's the thing is that when the pizza place gets rid of the video game, that video game goes to some other person's house.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
The video game didn't stop working.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
The pizza place chose to sell the game.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Or their distributor chose to take it to another place that it would make more money.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:12.000
So, yeah, and that's kind of where the analogy kind of loses me.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
I mean, I get it. Nothing lasts forever. Fine.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
But, you know, you got to, you got to admit the shelf life on some of this stuff these days.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Like when they almost pulled the plug on Gravity Rush 2 and it had barely been out, right?

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
No, they talked their way out of that.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000
But, you know, some of it's crazy how short of a window it is.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.000
But, you know, I think people just get frustrated spending all this money and then they're gone.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Especially when it's something that, you know what I think they should do with those games?

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Is they should have the ability like Phantasy Star Online had.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
You could run private servers.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Actually, let me just ask you directly because I'm sure what started this email and the whole talk last week, you missed it.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Miitomo is closing and you're the biggest fan of that here. How are you handling that?

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
No, no, no. Mr. Smoosh.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Okay. Mr. Smoosh hopped up on the mixing board.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Hopefully we're still coming through. I don't think he knocked any of the...

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Okay, I think we're fine.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000
So, um...

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Wow, that's pretty impressive. Sorry, anyway, Miitomo.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I just shrugged.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Yeah.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I kind of, I'm like...

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I mean, I have spent a little bit on Miitomo.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000
And I keep up with a few people that way that I haven't talked to in a while.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
And I like certainly all the characters that I've made on it.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Excuse me.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
But...

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I've, I'm...

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I don't know. I kind of don't care.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Okay.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I was just curious because, you know, as Loki and I were talking about it last week, I was like,

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000
it's a bummer that Jamie misses this week when it's, you know, a game that I know she plays more than us, so...

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.000
I look, I check it once a day. I make outfits. I've made Jessica Jones in it. I'm happy.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Fair enough.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I've made E. Honda.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I made Petsch and Lonk.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Uh, SSJ...

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
SSJ...

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Oh, and I made Katya and Bianca Del Rio.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
SSJ and Hunter Matt and our chat at live.vogue.com says,

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Mr. Smoosh is harnessing the essence of Drunami attacking the mixing board like that.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Yes, he did.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And since other daddy just got home,

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Mr. Smoosh hopped up on the mixing board while Dark Soccer was trying to talk about Miitomo.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
What did you teach him how to do, Alan?

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
What?

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000
All right. Anyway, he's denying responsibility for that.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
All right.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Thank you YYR for the email and I am very excited.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I hope to be the first person to stream Super Multitasking.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I'm ready.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Is your body ready?

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
My body is totally ready.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I've still been playing the game.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I haven't really been talking about it during my gaming week because it's not out.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
But I still play, I don't play it for a long, long time,

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
but I'll play like five games or so.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Here and there.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
So, I'm still playing it.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Anyway, was that it for email?

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Yeah, it was.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Okay.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
If you want to send us an email for a future week,

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some news, starting with Loki.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Let's talk about movies.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000
So, we've talked about this a while back when I think they made the announcement

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
that they were thinking about doing this.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000
So, Sleeping Dogs was a game that came out from Square Enix not too long ago

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000
and it is still going to be a movie apparently.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
So, Donnie Yen is, I guess, starring in the movie

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000
and said that, yeah, sometimes great things take a bit of time

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000
and Sleeping Dogs is in motion.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
You guys are ready for this.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
So, I guess it's still being worked on.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
I'd be curious to see how it turns out.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It was an okay game.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
So, look forward to that, I guess.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:47.000
And then we already talked about that there was talks about Mario becoming a movie as well

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:54.000
and basically they're partnering now with the producers of Despicable Me to make the game.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Why did it have to be the fucking minions? Why, why, why?

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Well, I know why.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Because it's an animation studio.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Well, it's Universal's animation studio.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Well, yeah, it's Illumination's.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
And clearly Nintendo and Universal have a little something-something going on

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
because of the theme park thing.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:19.000
So, it would seem to me that the theme park, if it's going to open in 2020, might just be timed with this movie.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
They're an okay animation studio.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I don't think it's going to be...

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
It's all about who writes the story and who directs the movie.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Really, at the end, the animation studio, they're just making it come to life.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I know, I just have an admittedly irrational hatred for minions.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.000
But do you think Nintendo, they're going to let their prized property get fucked up?

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Like, you know, well, there was the Super Mario movie, I guess, that came out a long time ago.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
But that was a different time when shlock like that was kind of okay.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Not so much anymore.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I am glad they're going animated with it.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
It seems to be the right, you know, course for Nintendo.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I think a real live movie just...

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
It's not going to work with Bowser and Goombas and shit.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Yes, I know, we tried once before, we all know, we tried once before.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
And like I said, it's good they're going animated with it this time.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:19.000
What if they went the whole Super Mario Odyssey route where he could be just walking around the real world and it's all weird and shit?

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Um...

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
New dog city.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Nah, I love Odyssey, but I'm curious to see what they do with the traditional...

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Assuming that maybe it will be an Odyssey type thing.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Who knows?

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
We'll see what they do with it.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I really hope, like they're saying in chat here, S.G.O. 100 Matt says, Goombas are voiced by the minions.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Yeah, that's what I don't want to happen.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
S.G.O. 100 Matt, that's why I don't want to happen.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Goombas don't need to be the new minions.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Alright, and S.G.O. 100 Matt says, it's going to be a few years out.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Illumination has projects in production until 2021.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
And besides, we know that the Rabbids are the new minions.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Alright.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Well, if Mario isn't your Nintendo thing, maybe Pokemon is.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Okay, the only reason I'm bringing this up, the only reason I'm bringing this up is this ridiculous fucking headline.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Here's the headline.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Pokemon for Nintendo Switch, still scheduled for 2018 or later.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
So, in other words...

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Anytime!

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.000
It's not 2017, because that involved time travel.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And Nintendo hasn't figured out online and god forbid they touch time travel.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
That's correct. So, seriously, that headline says,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Pokemon for Nintendo Switch has not been cancelled.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Time travel would explain why they don't have online yet.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Because they could just go back in time and fix all that shit and then it's like not a problem.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Anyway, this is all coming from, I guess there's a list out there of upcoming Nintendo titles.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:59.000
And Pokemon RPG for Nintendo Switch is on it as 2018 or later.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000
And that's on the official release or whatever.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
So, I mean, it's going to happen.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Now everybody's just hedging their bets on, will it be a holiday 2018 release?

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Which I think a lot of people are hoping for.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Or are they going to end up inevitably pushing it back?

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
You know what?

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.000
It would be nice if it happens this year, but I just want it to be good.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000
So, don't take it out of the oven before it's done.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:28.000
If they need to push it to March to make the fiscal year, then push it to March, for God's sake.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Let's move on. I just thought that headline was so funny.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Moving on, Darsagra.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Well, you know what they say, pirates gonna pirate?

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Wait, is that how it goes?

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:46.000
But, yeah, pirates have said, yeah, that Assassin's Creed Origins, we got that.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:52.000
The announcement came from CPY, which is an Italian hacking group

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.000
that finally cracked Assassin's Creed Origins DRM protections

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
and are ready to put it out there to everybody.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Because, again, pirates are going to pirate.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
And pillage and burn the village down.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Does that mean that gyrates will gyrate?

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Perhaps.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
I don't even know if that's a word.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Well, gyrates, but anyway.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:23.000
So, anyway, you know, usually it takes a few days, but this one took them a few months.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
But they still did it.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
So, yeah.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Not surprised, not surprised.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Yeah, the new, what is it, Denovo 4.8 DRM is supposed to be, like, the one to stop everybody.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Oh, of course, of course. They always say.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
That's what they always say.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000
We've been doing this show 15 years.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Every year somebody puts out a game on PC and says, this, this is going to end piracy.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:02.000
It was cracked with Sonic Forces, but Assassin's Creed Origins still had some unique things to bypass

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
because it also used VR Protect and Uplay.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
So, yeah, they got it.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Good job, cheaters.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I have to go back to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
because they're still talking about this Mario movie.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
And Tigerclaw in chat says there's only two good voice actors for Mario.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Charles Martinet and Captain Lou Albano, the latter no longer with us, unfortunately.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000
And SSG100Matt follows that up with Kristen Wiig for Princess Peach.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Kevin Hart for the voice of Luigi.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Who should voice Mario?

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
In my opinion, there's only one choice.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Danny DeVito.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Danny DeVito.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Clearly Danny DeVito should be voicing Mario.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Clearly.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:46.000
If he's not going to voice Pikachu, then he needs to do Mario.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Would there be another choice?

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Anyone?

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Anyone.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Well, Charles Martinet, of course.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Oh, honey.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I just...

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
I'm going to say this just because it's going to piss people off,

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
but it is a move that this kind of studio would do.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Will Ferrell.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
No.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I hate that so much.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I hate everything about that sentence that just left your mouth.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.000
That wasn't even a sentence.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000
It was just two words.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
So much power.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000
AkumaJP in chat suggests Liam Neeson.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
No.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
He would have to play like someone more...

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Bowser.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Bowser.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Bowser, yeah.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
No, he shouldn't act in anything because he's an asshole.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000
He's one of those garbage people that defends other garbage people.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Oh, boy.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Ryan Reynolds.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000
I mean, it's got to be Ryan Reynolds.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Why not just have Ryan Reynolds back?

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000
All right, let's move on.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Let's move on.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Loki, what do you have for us?

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
You're going to take us to porn, right?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I'll take us to porn.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Let's go to porn.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
So there's a game...

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
From Danny DeVito to porn.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
It's a short jump.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
So there's an indie game that's come out called NSFWWare,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
or I guess it's NSFWare, if you will.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
It's like a WarioWare game with porn in it.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
I mean, granted, it's very like...

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
I want to say artistically done.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.000
It's implied.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
It's not like full graphic porn, although it's pretty graphic.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.000
So like WarioWare, you have one word come up on the screen.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
It kind of gives you a hint on what you need to do,

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
and you have to figure out how to use the arrow keys to be able to do that.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Anal.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
No, it's not anal.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.000
So like, they'll have like, for example, some of the mini games.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:34.000
There is Swap, and it's basically three guys in like a daisy chain type thing, or girls.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
I don't know.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
You can't tell because they're just colors.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
So you can't really tell what they are.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
But basically, they want you to swap.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000
They're like iPod commercials.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Yeah, it's like an iPod commercial having sex.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.000
So they want you to swap the colors to match the little triangle in the corner.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Or there's one that's like, you know, edge.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Or, you know, there's tickle or slap or, you know, finger.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
It's like those love dice.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Yeah, sort of.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
So if you...

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Lick her elbow.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
The game is basically available.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
It's on itch.io for pay what you want or nothing.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
You can pay nothing to get it.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:14.000
So if you're interested in checking it out, it's at p-i-e-r-r-e-c dot itch dot i-o slash

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
n-s-f-w-a-r-e.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
And it's hard.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
I bet.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000
It's a challenging game, but it is very much like Mario, except if Mario had porn.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
So, you know, be careful.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
And then, of course, you know, to go along with that, one of the big things that's kind

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
of been in the Internet news lately has been deepfakes.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
And it has to do with this app called Fake App.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:49.000
So what Fake App is, it is a artificial intelligence machine learning way to swap faces on videos.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:55.000
So, for example, people have put Nicolas Cage on, you know, Harrison Ford and stuff like

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
that.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
It's sometimes it can be pretty convincing.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:04.000
The other not so dubious things that they've been, or not so, I guess, ethical things that

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.000
they've been doing is putting pictures of actresses on, you know, non-porn actresses

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
on porn actresses' bodies.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Oh, boy.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
And, you know, and actually it's in video form.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
So what, of course, are people going to do?

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Why?

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
They're going to take video game characters and put their faces on porn stars.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000
And it's kind of creepy.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Just going to put that out there.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
It's kind of creepy.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
But it's something that people are doing.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Fake celeb nudes have been rotating around for forever, though, as far back as Photoshop

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000
1.0 existed.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.000
But this is more, this is in motion, though.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:42.000
This is like it maps it to like you basically take, you train it by giving it a bunch of

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
pictures of, you know, the celebrity you're looking for and then pictures of whatever

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
person you're trying to put it on there.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000
And then the computer does the rest and it trains itself how to map that onto the body.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
When the PP tapes inevitably leak, the president's going to claim it's this.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Technology.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Well, that only does the face.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
It's still good.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
All right.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Anyway, one more story for us tonight.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Oh, no.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
This, this website.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
I need to ban this website from being used on our show because it doesn't load on this

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
computer for some reason.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I wouldn't suppose it works for you, Loki.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Do you want to steal this from me?

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Sure.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I kind of spoiled it already about, uh, let's talk about Cas.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.000
It's probably that it's probably that wonderful, uh, windows XP computer that you're running

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
off that I really need to bring you.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000
My Mac has loaded it right away.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Go, go, Jamie.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Well, um, the president of Sony and the CI cause will here I has stepped down.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
I'm going to miss him.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I think it's effective.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000
April 1st it is.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
And it's not a joke.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Not a joke.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Yeah.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.000
It's that CEO Casarai also was stepping down.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000
You remember he made the announcement, the fake Twitter account.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Like he knew.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I know.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Right.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
They're really the same guy.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Anyway, the transition in management is going to the Sony nominating committee.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Um, uh, so, uh, I'm trying to see, he will become a director and chairman of Sony corporation.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
So he's still involved in the business.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Um, just not as, you know, CEO and it's been approved, so we don't know who is going to

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
take over from here.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I'm trying to see if it was in the article cause I'm just looking at this.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I think it was like midway through it.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.000
There's a statement from the person that's taking a Yoshida.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
That sounds right.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Yeah.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Is going to be a taking over for Cosmo here.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I, so good for him.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Good for them all.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.000
May they continue to have success and pass on that helmet and crayons.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Sony's a giant enemy crab.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Sony's been doing all right lately.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
I always forget Sony still like makes a lot of movies.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I, I went to the movies again today.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
I saw another Oscar nominee.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
So you took me to say this, see the shape of water.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
A couple of weeks ago, by the way, while you finally see lady bird, while we talk about movies,

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
a Skype line is open, orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Um, no, I saw call me by your name and yeah.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
And at the very beginning it's Sony pictures classics.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
So it was a Sony movie.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
So here's the thing.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Everybody I know that seen it said it was like amazing.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Incredible.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
I liked it.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I didn't love it.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I thought it was a little dry.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I think it's one of those things where if you read the book, which I haven't,

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:33.000
but I imagine there's a lot more in the book of probably like thoughts and feelings that doesn't translate the same way on screen.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
And some of that might've been lost on me a little bit.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Like I didn't get the same thing out of it.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Like some of my friends are like, I'm seeing this multiple times.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
This speaks to me as somebody who is like a repressed Catholic person.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
I get a lot.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000
But for me, I was kind of like, God, it really takes an hour for this movie to go anywhere.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Let's go see Lady Bird next weekend.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I do want to see Lady Bird.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
We can do that.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I found this Sunday mornings are a great time to go see movies.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I don't know if it was Super Bowl Sunday or what, but we went.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
I've been, I've been seeing the sleeping movie.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.000
We went to the 10 30 this morning and it was like 10 people in the theater.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Cool.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
So anyway.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Next weekend though is by Panther.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Oh, movies are going to be packed 24 seven for that one.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
I know so many people excited to see it.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.000
I probably won't see that right away just because it's nothing against Black Panther.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
I'm sure it's going to be awesome.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
It's something against other humans.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Do you know how many Marvel movies I've missed?

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
I just haven't seen comic book movies in forever, but I'm sure that one's going to be fantastic.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Um, we'll see.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Anyway, I want to get to the phones.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
It is a ringing.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
So let's get to it.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Who's this?

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Hey buddy.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
It's been a while since we heard from you.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Did you hear about, we actually had some DDR content the past couple of episodes.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
I don't know if you heard it.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Yeah.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Was it related to that arcade championship over in Japan?

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Uh, no, there was a DDR freestyle tournament, kind of like freestyle coming back that happened

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
in San Jose on the 20th.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
And they, I actually got to be a judge, Zaku.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000
It was fun.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Oh damn.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Well, if only the East coast had that.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Well, be careful what you wish for because I know they, they're not going to stop here.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I know.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Try getting that scene back up.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
We'll see.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Well, what's on your mind tonight?

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000
I didn't mean to derail you.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Oh, nothing much.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Just, uh, I'm in the midst of a move right now.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I recently got engaged to my girlfriend this past December out in Tokyo.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Congrats.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
That's great news.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Yep.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000
All the way, all the way in Japan again, you know, as we went out there again.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Oh, so it was like your girlfriend's from Japan.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Oh no.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000
You guys traveled to Japan.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.000
You proposed to her.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
We traveled.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
We traveled to Japan.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Is there, this was our second time.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Third time for her.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Okay.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.000
And then we just, you know, I need you to sit down for a minute and, and, and not talk

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000
for a minute because I need to, I need to talk with my co-host about something.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Zaku has been calling into the show for a long time.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Right.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
And it's like, Oh my God, he's getting married.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
How old are we?

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Zaku is getting married.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
All of us have gotten married.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000
There's going to be a baby maybe if that's what you guys want, but Oh my God.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Oh my God.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
All of us have gotten married over the course of the show.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I know.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
That's true.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
But congratulations.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
You get to be as miserable as we are.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
You can talk again.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
You can talk again.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Congrats.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Yep.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:16.000
So yeah, we, we basically took the engagement photos in Asakusa in Tokyo.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
That was fun.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000
You know, aside from work getting in the way, but that's another story.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.300
How did you do it?

02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:23.300
Where did you propose that?

02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:24.300
Did you propose over dinner?

02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:27.300
Was it at the temple in Asakusa?

02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:30.300
Yeah, right there, right there with the big lantern.

02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:32.300
Oh, that's gorgeous.

02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:33.300
Good call, Jamie.

02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:37.300
Well, I mean, if I was going to be proposed to, that's where I'd want to.

02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:42.300
Either that or in front of the, um, the big theater in Kyoto.

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:46.300
For me, it was the castle at Disneyland, but things have a funny way of working out sometimes.

02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:49.300
Well, I was watching Weird Al and eating spinach dip when I got engaged.

02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:50.300
I know.

02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:54.300
For us, it was, oh my God, Trump just got elected.

02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:56.300
Do you think we should get married before they take the ride away?

02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:57.300
Yeah, probably not a bad idea.

02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:58.300
Cool.

02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:00.300
But you were saying?

02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:01.300
Anyway, sorry, Zaku.

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:02.300
Yeah.

02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:07.300
So aside from that, just, uh, you know, now that we're getting, now that we're engaged,

02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:10.300
you know, we have to start moving in together and whatnot.

02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:15.300
And so I managed to, I managed to close the lease this past, uh, almost a week ago on

02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:19.300
a place, uh, in Chappaqua condo for, you know, for a year.

02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:23.300
But yeah, I've been in the process of, you know, not only burning through my wallet,

02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:28.300
but also moving things from my room upward outside of the Bronx.

02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:31.300
And I've been to Westchester, you know, north of the city.

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:32.300
Wow.

02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:33.300
Moving, moving on up in a way.

02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:38.300
So, well, what did you, I, I congratulate you on the engagement, but, uh, what did,

02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:41.300
was there something on your mind that you called in to talk about tonight?

02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:45.300
Uh, aside from that, like, I just want to say Cuphead is really hard.

02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:46.300
I don't care.

02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:47.300
Yes, it is.

02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:48.300
Yeah.

02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:49.300
It's a nightmare.

02:12:49.300 --> 02:12:50.300
It's so fun though.

02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:56.300
I know it's fun, but Jesus, it's like, it brings me back to 8-bit NES days, but with,

02:12:56.300 --> 02:13:01.300
but with the whole, like, you know, 1930s cartoon literally right there.

02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.300
And it's just ridiculous.

02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:08.300
Like, it's deceptive because you think, oh, it's going to be a cartoon, a cutesy game.

02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:09.300
It's Mickey Mousecapade.

02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:10.300
No, bitch.

02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:12.300
It's a hard game.

02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:17.300
Makes Contra look like, uh, goddamn, they got to help me out here.

02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:19.300
It makes Contra look like what?

02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:23.300
Uh, something makes it look like Super Mario Brothers.

02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:27.300
Yeah, it makes Mario Brothers 2, which I think is an insanely easy game.

02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:28.300
Yeah.

02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:33.300
And, you know, it's not even that, like, like the Hotline Miami series was just as bad and

02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:37.300
I managed to get through that recently and I, I was trying to escape away from it and

02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:43.300
then, you know, lo and behold, I buy Cuphead and now back in that whole, uh, you know,

02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:47.300
having to deal with like dying every few minutes and like taking an hour to beat a stage.

02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:50.300
Are you playing Cuphead on Xbox One or PC?

02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:52.300
PC through, through my Steam link.

02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:53.300
Yeah.

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.300
Oh, good call.

02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:55.300
Good call.

02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:56.300
Yeah.

02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:59.300
Cuphead's one of those games that, uh, I think a lot of people might've overlooked last year,

02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:02.300
maybe because there's not a lot of Xbox owners or at least comparatively to PlayStation or

02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:03.300
what have you.

02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:05.300
I mean, there are several people that own Xbox, but I think there's a lot of people

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:06.300
that overlooked it.

02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:11.300
Um, so if you don't own an Xbox One, I would still encourage you to seek out Cuphead on

02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.300
PC.

02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:13.300
Um, check it out.

02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:14.300
It's a good game.

02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:15.300
Yeah.

02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:16.300
It was, I got it on sale.

02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:17.300
Nice.

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:18.300
That was, it was really worth it.

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:19.300
Uh, yeah.

02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:23.300
And then just, you know, getting back into Flight Simming, but also managed to get this

02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:26.300
little gem right here, Windows MR, uh, headset.

02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:27.300
Oh.

02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:32.300
So at least I have VR now on Flight Simming and, uh, you know, other random stuff.

02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:36.300
I never thought about VR for Flight Sims, but I bet that's pretty cool.

02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:37.300
Oh yeah, it is.

02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:40.300
Like you, you pretty much immerse yourself in the cockpit.

02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:43.300
Like, you know, I also play like combat flight sims.

02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:47.300
So one of the ones I played DCS world has like full VR support.

02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:54.300
And because Windows mixed reality works with a Steam VR, I'm able to use that very seamlessly.

02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:56.300
So it like works right out of the box.

02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:57.300
Nice.

02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:01.300
Well, installing, you know, installing the software from Steam, but that's it.

02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:05.300
You know, we have a mobile VR thing and we've used it maybe once.

02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:10.300
Like there's just not a lot that we practically use on a regular basis, but the flight sim

02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:11.300
stuff, I could see that.

02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:14.300
And on one of these days I'm going to break down and get a PlayStation VR finally, but

02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:16.300
I'm just kind of waiting for the right moment.

02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:18.300
The must, the must must have game.

02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:21.300
Sorry about that.

02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:22.300
That's all right.

02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:23.300
All right.

02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:24.300
Well, Zaku, I'm going to let you go.

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:25.300
I'm going to congratulate you one more time.

02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:28.300
Uh, and, uh, you know, good luck with the move.

02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:30.300
Moving is a bitch, but it'll be worth it in the end.

02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:37.300
Yeah, especially if you're moving with like, you know, someone who doesn't drive as often

02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:38.300
almost at all.

02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:42.300
And now I have to move to the suburbs where I definitely need a car now.

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:43.300
Ah, you'll make it work.

02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:44.300
We always figure it out.

02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:45.300
All right.

02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:46.300
Take care of my friend.

02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:47.300
Yep.

02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:48.300
Have a good one.

02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:49.300
You too.

02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:50.300
Bye.

02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:51.300
Bye.

02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:52.300
All right.

02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:53.300
We'll open up the Skype line one more time.

02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:54.300
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:56.300
Checking in for any last minute stories that we might have.

02:15:56.300 --> 02:15:57.300
Nope.

02:15:57.300 --> 02:15:58.300
No.

02:15:58.300 --> 02:15:59.300
Oh boy.

02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:00.300
All right.

02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:01.300
We'll open it up for the Super Bowl.

02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:02.300
Super Bowl.

02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:03.300
All right.

02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:08.300
Uh, you don't chat, uh, telling me that, uh, Skyrim VR is a must have job.

02:16:08.300 --> 02:16:11.300
Sim is a must have rec room is a must have super hot VR is a must have.

02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:15.300
So cause you're just saying there's plenty of must have games already.

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:16.300
I'm just sleeping.

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:17.300
And I forgot.

02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:22.300
And I was reminded the other day when I booted up my PlayStation four cause my son wanted

02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:28.300
to play like Marvel Avengers two that accounting plus is out now.

02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:29.300
I totally have to get that.

02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.300
What's that one?

02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:31.300
I don't know.

02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:35.300
It's, it's a VR game by the guys that did Rick and Morty and it's fucked up.

02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:36.300
All right.

02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:38.300
We're going to take one more call.

02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:39.300
Hi.

02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:40.300
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:41.300
Who's this?

02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:42.300
It's the one, the only raging here.

02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:43.300
Hey raging here, buddy.

02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:44.300
What's on your mind tonight?

02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:46.300
I'm not a whole lot.

02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:54.300
Um, you know, I, I know no one listened to the show or any of the three of you are into

02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:55.300
sports whatsoever.

02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:58.300
It depends on the sport.

02:16:58.300 --> 02:17:05.300
But I only bring it up sports up cause it's kind of tangential, tangential relate to

02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:07.300
what, you know, my point.

02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:15.300
Um, I saw part of the Superbowl, your suit, your super owl tonight and um, call it the

02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:16.300
Superbowl.

02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:17.300
Call it the Superbowl.

02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:18.300
I don't give a fuck.

02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:19.300
Let them sue us.

02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:22.300
We're talking, we're commenting on something that happened in the real world.

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:24.300
It's news.

02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:28.300
But, uh, no, no, no.

02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:34.300
The reason I bring it up is because, um, you know, I mainly was hoping to see some of the

02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:41.300
commercials and they actually showed the trailer to the Han Solo movie.

02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:45.300
Um, and it looks actually quite good.

02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:52.300
Um, you know, I can't remember everything, uh, that w you know, was in the trailer.

02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:55.300
I saw a little, I saw a little snippet of it on Twitter.

02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:58.300
The only thing that looked good about that was Lando.

02:17:58.300 --> 02:17:59.300
Mike drop.

02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:00.300
I don't know.

02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:01.300
What about you?

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:02.300
Loki?

02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:03.300
You looked at, said you were into it, right?

02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:04.300
It looked okay.

02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:05.300
Yeah.

02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:06.300
I'm going to wait and see what the critics have to say.

02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:10.300
Not that critics always, I mean, rogue one wasn't too bad.

02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:11.300
I was all right.

02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:13.300
One was, I haven't seen rogue one.

02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:14.300
I still haven't seen episode.

02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:16.300
Rogue one was all original people.

02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:19.300
This is dealing with a legend in the series.

02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:20.300
Yeah.

02:18:20.300 --> 02:18:23.300
I just, I want to see what some of the early takes are because I'm hearing that's, you

02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:27.300
know, and it could just be all a bunch of bullshit, but I'm hearing that there's some

02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:30.300
troubles and that like the actor apparently is not very good.

02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:33.300
And so I just kind of want to see what some of the early hot takes are before I make a

02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:34.300
decision.

02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:35.300
If all the critics come out and say, Oh, it's great.

02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:39.300
It's must see, you know, Ron Howard saved the day or whatever, then maybe I'll check

02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:40.300
it out.

02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:42.300
But I'm, I'm already like two star Wars movies behind.

02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:46.300
So I'm kinda, you know, but that's nothing against star Wars.

02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:49.300
Again, I always feel like I'm such a hater, but it's just, no, I only have so many times

02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:52.300
so much time to do so many things.

02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:58.300
And so I chose to go see another Oscar film today instead of seeing star Wars, whatever.

02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:06.300
Well, well, the only thing I might be iffy about regarding the movie is that obviously,

02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:13.300
you know, having grown up watching the original trilogy and now with, um, Harrison Ford playing,

02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:18.300
uh, Han Solo for those, no, I kind of used to him playing the role of Han Solo.

02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:25.300
So I see anyone else play their role just seems a little odd to me, but I will give

02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:27.300
the movie a try.

02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:29.300
So that's one of Jamie's takeaways.

02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:30.300
She's not so keen on either.

02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:31.300
I don't know.

02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:33.300
Like it just depends.

02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:38.300
I mean, like how many guys have played James Bond, you know, but I get it's different,

02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:43.300
but you know, like Daniel Craig is a pretty good James Bond and Pierce Brosnan wasn't

02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:44.300
bad.

02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:46.300
It really depended on the movie, you know?

02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:48.300
So it just, it just depends.

02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:50.300
Actors can play the same role.

02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:51.300
It could be.

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:52.300
Here's the one that doesn't make sense to me.

02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:55.300
The dude from the office playing Jack Ryan.

02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:56.300
That's the one where I'm like, what?

02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.300
But he's all ripped now.

02:19:57.300 --> 02:19:58.300
So it's fine.

02:19:58.300 --> 02:19:59.300
Yeah, whatever.

02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:00.300
Whatever.

02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:03.300
I, you know, I'd be fine if him playing.

02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:05.300
So what's his face playing?

02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:07.300
Chris Pratt playing Star Lord.

02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:10.300
And he was on his, on the show was kind of.

02:20:10.300 --> 02:20:11.300
That's yeah.

02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:14.300
When he was on parks and rec, he was kind of, you know, from not so good.

02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:15.300
That was his character.

02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:16.300
That was physically.

02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:17.300
Yeah.

02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:18.300
Yeah.

02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:19.300
No, I get you.

02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:20.300
I get you.

02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:21.300
Um, it could be worse.

02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:26.300
I mean, remember Indiana Jones son was played by none other than Sheila.

02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:28.300
Uh, imagine, Hey, let's see.

02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:31.300
That looks like a young, young Harrison Ford.

02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:34.300
Let's use him as a young Harrison Ford in this movie.

02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:35.300
Half day.

02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:36.300
All right.

02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:37.300
I'm sorry.

02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:38.300
I'm sorry.

02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:43.300
But as far as I'm concerned, that fourth Indiana Jones movie doesn't even exist.

02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:44.300
Yeah.

02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:47.300
I mean, no, I think I heard they were going to do another, they are doing another one.

02:20:47.300 --> 02:20:52.300
And aren't they doing with a, with a female protagonist like Harrison Ford's in it.

02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:55.300
But this time I thought there was a female protagonist for the last one, a daughter or

02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:56.300
a niece or something.

02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:58.300
That was his love interest from the first movie.

02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:01.300
No, it was really, Oh, maybe I'm thinking of the female villain.

02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:03.300
I thought there was a female villain.

02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:04.300
Cate Blanchett was the villain.

02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:05.300
Wouldn't she?

02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:06.300
Yeah.

02:21:06.300 --> 02:21:09.300
I might be mixing it up with Thor, but anyway, anyway.

02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:16.300
Oh, well, uh, before I, uh, you know, uh, clear up the line so someone else can, uh,

02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:17.300
call in.

02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:18.300
Yep.

02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:26.300
Uh, now it, at least in passing during, um, the classic game of the week, uh, you have

02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:34.300
briefly meant, uh, I think, uh, Doc Sorkin had briefly mentioned, uh, 1942 or 1943.

02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:38.300
Rob mentioned it because it had stuff in common with SkyShark by planes.

02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:39.300
Yeah.

02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:40.300
Yeah.

02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:51.300
Which reminds me, I think, uh, 1942, 1943 and 1943 Chi are in, um, Capcom arcade cabinets.

02:21:51.300 --> 02:22:00.300
Um, it technically is an older game, but it's new to me because I just recently got an Xbox

02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:07.300
360 for the second time and I just tried, tried, uh, recently picked up, uh, uh, cap

02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:08.300
count.

02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:13.300
I'm also pretty sure that game is part of that infinite Microsoft library collection

02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:14.300
thing.

02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:15.300
I think that game is in there.

02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:18.300
So yeah, those two games are, and correct me if I'm wrong, Jamie, there was a 1941 at

02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:21.300
some point too, but that was like on a later system or something.

02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:22.300
Yeah.

02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:23.300
It wasn't like the NES.

02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:24.300
And at a 45.

02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:25.300
Was it 45?

02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:26.300
I thought there was a 41.

02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:31.300
I have to go back and look and see what's on the, um, the Capcom collection that I've

02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:34.300
got on Saturn, but we've got like the 1940s, blah, blah.

02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:35.300
That's true.

02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:39.300
The one that's on Xbox, uh, Xbox 360 slash PlayStation three.

02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:44.300
That's not the first, uh, that they've done to that, but that, uh, that makes sense.

02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:45.300
Yeah.

02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:47.300
So that's the first time some people are discovering it.

02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:48.300
Yeah.

02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:55.300
Well, uh, you know, no, like I said, well, I play some of these games, uh, during this

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:57.300
collection on other systems in the past.

02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:03.300
Uh, um, I think there was collections for, uh, like PlayStation two and whatnot, but

02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:09.300
I've just recently got this collection for, uh, the 360 and, uh, at least in my opinion,

02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:11.300
you know, a pretty good collection.

02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:16.300
Uh, have any of you tried this particular collection on the 360 or no?

02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:17.300
I have.

02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:20.300
Um, I didn't, it was all kind of piecemeal, the games.

02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:24.300
So I didn't play all of the games, but I did play that back when it first came out.

02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:28.300
And, um, yeah, it was a good way to revisit some of the, you know, classics that are on

02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:33.300
ultra-cade machines and things like that, including like, I think gun dot smoke was

02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:34.300
in there.

02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:39.300
I seem to remember, uh, the Hijomaru, the pirate game, the old, uh, Hige Maru, that's

02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:40.300
it.

02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:41.300
Uh, that was there too.

02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:45.300
And, uh, yeah, several games, by the way, I wanted to point out, I pulled this up to,

02:23:45.300 --> 02:23:46.300
to figure this out.

02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:53.300
So here's the complete 19XX series by Capcom, 1942, 1943, which then had 1943 cops.

02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:56.300
1941.

02:23:56.300 --> 02:24:00.300
And then there was straight up a 19XX, the war against destiny, which was great.

02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:03.300
There was 1944, the loop master.

02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:06.300
And then they came all the way back and did 1942 joint strike.

02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:08.300
That's the last one that they did.

02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:13.300
And 1942 joint strike was an Xbox 360 arcade game.

02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:16.300
So it was kind of like a re envisioning of the original 1942.

02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:17.300
Yeah.

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:20.300
And joint strike was also on PSN.

02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:21.300
Um, yep.

02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:29.300
I, I remember having that on PSN when I saw on the PlayStation three, you know, I particularly

02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:30.300
enjoyed that one.

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:32.300
So it's a solid series of shooters.

02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:35.300
I'm glad people can discover it no matter, uh, how the way.

02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:36.300
So, all right.

02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:37.300
Well, space, uh, rage nator.

02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:38.300
I'm gonna let you go.

02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:39.300
Okay.

02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:40.300
Take care.

02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:41.300
Sure.

02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:42.300
Have a nice night.

02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:43.300
You too.

02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:44.300
All right.

02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:46.300
Uh, we'll see if any more calls sneak through orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:49.300
I used to play 1942 at the yogurt shop.

02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:51.300
They had the cocktail cabinet and it was 1942.

02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:53.300
I love cocktail cabinets.

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:54.300
They're not appreciated enough.

02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:55.300
We don't see them anymore.

02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:59.300
I just had a mental flash to what was in my arcade at my college.

02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:01.300
Right when you walk in the door, you had dark stalkers.

02:25:01.300 --> 02:25:02.300
Yeah.

02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:06.300
Which they upgraded to a vampire savior before I moved out.

02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:10.300
Then we had, um, fatal fury special.

02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:13.300
We had a favorite riding DX.

02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:21.300
We had killer instinct, which my friend Marcy and I would just like, just hand people their asses all day.

02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:27.300
Um, we had world cup soccer 94, which is why I own one now in my house with the color led nonetheless.

02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:31.300
Oh, we Dan found that one of our ramps, uh, need needs work.

02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:33.300
He's talking about getting the brass plated ramp.

02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:34.300
Oh, fun.

02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:35.300
Okay.

02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:36.300
So we, we had a discussion about that.

02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:38.300
We had cyber sled.

02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:39.300
You remember cyber sled?

02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:40.300
I do.

02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:43.300
We had, um, crap.

02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:49.300
Oh, we had a street fighter alpha last call orange launch radio, all one word on Skype.

02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:50.300
Sorry.

02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:51.300
I didn't mean to.

02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:52.300
Oh, I thought you said we had a caller.

02:25:52.300 --> 02:25:53.300
Sorry.

02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:54.300
I was getting that last thought out there.

02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:55.300
I'm trying to remember what else we had.

02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:59.300
Cause Oh, we had a, um, crap.

02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:04.300
What was the, the SNK game that had Rio and mr karate?

02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:05.300
Was that world heroes?

02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:06.300
Not world heroes.

02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:07.300
Art of fighting.

02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:08.300
Art of fighting.

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:15.300
Uh, I, I still do distinctly remember here at Sac state going into the arcade there in

02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:19.300
the mid nineties when I was in like junior high and they had street fighter two and it

02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:20.300
was always like off the hook.

02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:22.300
I went to an arcade this week.

02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:27.300
I went to the golf land, play all their, the, see the latest in redemption technology.

02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:32.300
They have some really ridiculous games there, but there was a giant Tetris.

02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:35.300
Uh, I didn't see the giant Tetris.

02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:40.300
I saw they have like the stupid, like, like redemption machines have gotten so huge now.

02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:41.300
Like they take up all the space.

02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:47.300
Like they have one that like is almost, it's like at least eight feet tall and it drops

02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:48.300
a ball into a hole.

02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:49.300
I'm like, you don't need that.

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:52.300
Cause like you would literally walk around the corner and they have a smaller version

02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:53.300
of that ground.

02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:54.300
One of those.

02:26:54.300 --> 02:26:55.300
Yeah.

02:26:55.300 --> 02:27:00.300
But, um, I did see they had a star Wars arcade game that was in like a cockpit type thing.

02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:02.300
The one that starts off on the hoth battle.

02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:05.300
I don't know, but it's like projected onto a big sphere.

02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:08.300
Yeah, that actually is pretty fun.

02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:10.300
It reminds me a little bit of battle tech.

02:27:10.300 --> 02:27:13.300
I certainly have the kids to play with anyone to the battle technique.

02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:19.300
I did respect though that Nintendo and Namco and whoever else makes the Mario Kart GX games

02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:23.300
is smart enough to know that, Hey, the kids that might be interested in your games can't

02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:25.300
always reach the foot pedals.

02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:31.300
And so if the foot pedal isn't pressed, it goes in the auto acceleration, which is fantastic.

02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:37.300
I was like, that's an absolutely amazing feature that not anybody really thinks about.

02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:40.300
So I wish more games did that.

02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:41.300
All right.

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:45.300
Well, no more calls came in, so we're going to wrap up the show.

02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:48.300
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show this week, especially cause I know there

02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:50.300

Don't forget to check into the show.

02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:58.300

Don't you want to be cool and have points?

02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:07.300
Yeah.

02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:08.300
Anyway, all the cool kids have points.

02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:09.300
That's right.

02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:10.300
All the cool kids have points.

02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:13.300
So check that out over at vognetwork.com and uh, Hey, if you liked what you heard here

02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:16.300
Help us spread the word.

02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:20.300
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to, uh, amplify

02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:25.300
a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google or wherever it is you found this

02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:27.300
show is greatly appreciated.

02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:33.300
So we will be back to do this again in seven days, which, uh, is not yet a long weekend.

02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:37.300
We have a long weekend in two weeks, but, uh, cause president's day is coming up.

02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:40.300
So, uh, yeah, but next weekend, next week is just any old weekend.

02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:44.300
Uh, but we'll be here to do it again and cover whatever news comes out until then.

02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:46.300
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:48.300
Um, I'll start with my final thought.

02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:52.300
My final thought is I'm still finding lots of pumpkin spice stuff.

02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:56.300
I have some pumpkin spice almonds I was eating earlier and they're not bad for almonds.

02:28:56.300 --> 02:28:57.300
For almonds.

02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:58.300
Anyway.

02:28:58.300 --> 02:29:01.300
Uh, Jamie, since you have the mic, your final thought.

02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:04.300
I miss pinkberry and I really want some.

02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:05.300
Can you have like a little bit?

02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:07.300
I can have a mini mini.

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:08.300
There you go.

02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:10.300
And last one to get the sample and walk out.

02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:12.300
And last but not least, Loki.

02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:16.300
They needed like a pumpkin spice equivalent for like other seasons.

02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:20.300
So then that way they can flood the shelves with that sorta.

02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:23.300
They got red velvet seems to show up around this time of year.

02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:28.300
You know what, you know, if you want kind of the pumpkin spice flavor in spring, they

02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:30.300
should do carrot cake.

02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:33.300
I've seen that around Easter that remember the carrot cake M&M's.

02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:34.300
You know, that was an Easter thing.

02:29:34.300 --> 02:29:37.300
Well, I mean, you know, carrot cake is like my favorite cake in the universe as long as

02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:42.300
there's no fucking raisins in it because raisins are liars and terrible things.

02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:43.300
Okay.

02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:45.300
I feel about raisins the way you feel about mayonnaise.

02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:46.300
That's fine.

02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:47.300
That's a harsh statement.

02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:50.300
Actually I feel about ketchup and mustard the same way, but I will say there's been

02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:55.300
one dish I've enjoyed raisins in and that is the salad that they serve at strings.

02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:56.300
The garbage.

02:29:56.300 --> 02:29:57.300
Well, okay.

02:29:57.300 --> 02:29:59.300
It's good in the garbage too.

02:29:59.300 --> 02:30:00.300
Raisin bran.

02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:02.300
But no, raisin bran is disgusting.

02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:04.300
I only eat the cereal out of the raisin bran.

02:30:04.300 --> 02:30:08.300
I would pick out all the raisins, throw them away and just eat the cereal.

02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:09.300
Interesting.

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:12.300
But keep in mind when I was a kid, I ate grape nuts and total.

02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:14.300
Grape nuts are fucking good.

02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:15.300
Total is gross.

02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:16.300
I love me some total.

02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:17.300
But you know, you know.

02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:18.300
Okay.

02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:19.300
Delicious winter time.

02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:20.300
Wonderfulness.

02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:21.300
And I miss eating it.

02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:25.300
Total makes me think of colon blow from early Saturday night live.

02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:28.300
I also like crackling oat bran.

02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:35.300
But, um, you take, you take your, um, your grape nuts and do maybe half as much milk

02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:41.300
and you add, um, cinnamon icing after you heat it, after you heat it up.

02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:47.300
My favorite old people breakfast cereal is like, it's not frosted mini wheats.

02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:49.300
It's just the fucking giant wheat.

02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:51.300
Like the one giant square.

02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:52.300
The biscuit.

02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:53.300
Yeah.

02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:54.300
It's like this ain't a mini wheat.

02:30:54.300 --> 02:30:55.300
This is the wheat.

02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:56.300
And it ain't frosted.

02:30:56.300 --> 02:30:59.300
You can get, you can get wheat a bit cause it's almost the same thing.

02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:00.300
Oh, okay.

02:31:00.300 --> 02:31:01.300
The British thing.

02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:05.300
But I mean, frosted mini wheats though are probably my favorite ever cereal.

02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:06.300
Uh, Crispix.

02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:08.300
So if I have to eat like a normal cereal.

02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:09.300
Kids love that shit.

02:31:09.300 --> 02:31:10.300
That's not sugar coated.

02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:12.300
It has life cereal while I can't eat it.

02:31:12.300 --> 02:31:13.300
And I'm mad.

02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:14.300
What an asshole.

02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:15.300
I know, right?

02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:16.300
Why did I marry an ass?

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:18.300
Not because, I mean, probably because he is an asshole.

02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:20.300
Love you, Dan.

02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:23.300
Anyway, enjoy your breakfast cereal this week and we will be-

02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:24.300
Did you do a final thought?

02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:26.300
I thought so.

02:31:26.300 --> 02:31:27.300
I will just say we did.

02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:28.300
Okay.

02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:29.300
Okay.

02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:30.300
Then that's it.

02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:31.300
Let's go get some cereal, Rob.
