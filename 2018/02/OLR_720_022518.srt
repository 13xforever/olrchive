00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,760
This week Death Stranding News continues its slow trickle as the latest cast members

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,280
have been announced, inadvertent as it may have been.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,800
Once the news is out it's near impossible to take back, so let's press on with episode

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,000
720 of tonight's show, where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,800
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet,

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,680
welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:45,440
It is Orange Lounge Radio for tonight, February the 25th, 2018, episode number 720 of our

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
show.

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,640
We are now an HD show, we are 720 episodes wide.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
There you go.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Anyway, hi I'm Rob Roberts and you can of course hear me on this show every week talking

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,940
about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts over there,

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,560
DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,520
I was regaling the chat room about the time that was you, me, Chris, and Megzi staying

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,240
at a hotel and we decided to wake you up with loud lesbian porn and you slept through it.

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,680
What a way to start the show.

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,440
Okay, here's the thing though.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
First off, I miss those two.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I really do.

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,720
They were a lot of fun to have on the show.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,600
For those that don't know, they moved far away.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
They moved to a far away distant land called Wisconsin.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Wisconsin.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,800
So, unfortunately it's hard to get them on the show anymore, but here's the thing.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,200
I used to live right next to train tracks.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,260
When I went to school in Chico, California, I lived on this apartment complex that was

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,920
right next to the railroad tracks.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,400
Was it the wrong side or the right side?

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,560
One way to find out.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,000
So anyway, the train would just come roaring through and they blew the horn and everything.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,520
So I would have to sleep through that.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,600
So because of that, I sleep through a lot, but the one thing, so you can do whatever

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,800
porny noises you want.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,960
It's not going to wake me up.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,240
But the one thing that does wake me up without fail, Mr. Smoosh snoring in my ear.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Yeah.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Go figure.

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,860
And that's Mr. Smoosh is the cat if you weren't already aware.

39
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,160
Also say hello, joining us every week to Techmaster Loki.

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Hello.

41
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
How are you, Loki?

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
I'm good.

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Good.

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Awesome.

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,520
What'd you bring for the show tonight for dinner for the folks that like to play the

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,800
OLR food betting game?

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:28,360
Oh, I just got tacos from a place called Cafe Rio that has a Barbacoa pork tacos.

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,440
So it's like kind of like flavored and stuff, but their rice like that they make on the

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
side though.

50
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,640
Like, I don't know if they know how to cook rice because it's just like, I don't know

51
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,680
if it's actually cooked.

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
It's very crunchy.

53
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Oh yeah.

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Oh yeah.

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
I don't like no.

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Sounds like it's reconstituted.

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,120
It's like, do you not know how to cook rice long enough?

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Rice is very important in the Mexican.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not my dinner.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I ate it anyways.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But yeah.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What?

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was like, is not my dinner equally important?

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,400
You know, your dinner is important, but we were talking about lesbian porn.

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Oh yeah.

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
That is true.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
I don't know.

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,040
I could smell those tacos when I stepped into the room and I was like, oh my God, that smells

70
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
amazing.

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,240
Let's go to the chat over at live.vognetwork.com where of course we do tape live every Sunday

72
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,480
night, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,920
And you live chatters are here to help us through the show and offer your commentary

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,880
because it's not just about us here at OLR.

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,400
It's about all the gamers, including those of you in chat and those of you on the Skype

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,840
line a little later on at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,540
So I'm not alone in my loud noise stuff.

78
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,760
Brad from pod culture in chat saying I used to live on the Ohio river, used to have loud

79
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,800
barges go through in the wee hours.

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Yikes.

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,240
I don't know if like a party boat came through who, uh, let's see, uh, Dr. Ken, hi Dr. Kim

82
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,520
from starboard power coupling.

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,160
Shout out says, grats OLR with a heart.

84
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Thank you.

85
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,900
I don't, I didn't think anything was particularly notable about seven 20, but I guess that means

86
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,320
we've gone around the sun twice.

87
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Right.

88
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Is that what that means?

89
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
I reckon close close.

90
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,080
No, cause three 65 and actually seven 30.

91
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Math is not my strong suit.

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,880
Uh, I'm just sure on the podcast to look pretty.

93
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,800
Uh, and this is two and a hundred, Matt says taco every day.

94
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
I agree with that.

95
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
You don't have to.

96
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Those are good.

97
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
You don't have to wait for Tuesday for tacos.

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Absolutely not.

99
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,720
I didn't have enough time to get a poke again, so, uh, that's, that's the new trendy thing,

100
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
huh?

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
I don't, I don't.

102
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,920
It's just, it's like if you want, if you want sushi, but you don't want it in sushi form,

103
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,840
you just want to kind of just disassemble poke to me is like sushi inside out, except

104
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,080
that there was, you can already get chirashi, which is basically sushi on top of sushi rice

105
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,880
in a bowl.

106
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,280
Yo dog, I heard you like sushi.

107
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,800
It's sashimi on the rice.

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Okay.

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
That's delicious.

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
I don't dislike poke by any means.

111
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,760
In fact, funny, when I had the pokey stop podcast show, like there was a pokey place

112
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,120
that wanted to like work together and so I got to try some of their poke and it was really

113
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
good.

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,560
Um, but I just, you know, I don't know, like I feel like when I'm in the mood, I not a

115
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,120
big fish person, but I will eat sushi.

116
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,480
So if I get in the mood for sushi, I'm going to have sushi.

117
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,640
I've never had poke.

118
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Not sushi in a bowl.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
I don't really like sushi.

120
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,480
I normally will have like a, well, I guess it's sort of sushi.

121
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,840
It's a McGrew, which is basically tuna draped over some rice.

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Oh sure.

123
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,520
It's basically you just chop that up and we got poke now.

124
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
It's very basic.

125
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
You like your nigiri.

126
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
Sashimi.

127
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Yes.

128
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Yeah.

129
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Well, because I can't eat as much rice as I used to, pretty much all I get anymore is

130
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,000
sashimi or my new standby, which is not sushi at all, but agarashidofu.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,120
I love it.

132
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
So good.

133
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
It's what I ate that night.

134
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,960
I was gonna say that night cause we went out after OLR once to go get food.

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,600
I remember it was like really late and one of the, there's a sushi bar around here open

136
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,760
till past midnight or till midnight.

137
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,720
So we were just mad that the last two places I went to had no Saba, the mackerel, which

138
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,760
is like my favorite cause it is the fishiest smelliest tastiest of all fishes.

139
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
So bad.

140
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
All right.

141
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Anyway, believe it or not, it's not a food podcast.

142
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,360
It's a video game podcast.

143
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,320
So let's get into some gaming discussion and I want to kick this off.

144
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,520
Loki, I'll kick it to you if you want to, uh, with some E3 news cause believe it or

145
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,220
not, we're staring down what, four months I think about till E3 actually probably less

146
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,080
than that cause E3 is in like early June, so about three and a half months till E3.

147
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,040
We know the public tickets went on sale.

148
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
Yeah.

149
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,120
Um, I don't, I hadn't heard if they sold out or not.

150
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,200
Um, I know last time it took them a little while to sell out.

151
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:41,280
But E3 in the year 2018, very different from E3 when the show first started in 2002.

152
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,720
And I think what the first show we all went to was 2004, right?

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,600
So E3 is very different now than it was then.

154
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,440
So tell us a little bit about what's, uh, what's going to be going on at E3 this year,

155
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Loki.

156
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,280
Well, pretty much the same thing as the last few years, EA is not going to E3.

157
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,640
They're doing their own thing just outside of E3.

158
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,160
Um, so they're going to have their own event where they can try out the new battlefield

159
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,120
game that they're supposed to be showing off and of course Anthem.

160
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
And yeah.

161
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,720
And then you, you can go check that out and that's between June 9th and 11th at the Hollywood

162
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Palladium.

163
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,200
Sports, sports, and more sports as well.

164
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
I'm sure with EA.

165
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:29,120
You can try, try the Madden's and the FIFA's and the NHL's and all the EA Sports as well,

166
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,080
which I'm not, I'm not poo-pooing those games.

167
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
They're huge moneymakers, cash cows for EA.

168
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,740
They've probably made EA the big company that it is, but you know, um, I, I think here's

169
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
the thing.

170
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,160
I think people kind of know what to expect out of a FIFA game, out of a Madden game.

171
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,060
Now granted, they sometimes do new modes.

172
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,400
They do things that will kind of throw a curve ball in the formula, but generally, you know,

173
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,560
you're going to get a football game, either British rules or American rules in those two

174
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
series.

175
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Right.

176
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,600
What you don't know what you're going to get right now is Anthem, right?

177
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,040
Anthem's a big wild card.

178
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,160
I know those of us that have been long-time Bioware supporters, well, I should, some of

179
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,920
us, not all of us, but Dark Soccer and I are on the side of, we're a little salty.

180
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm not exactly ready to turn cartwheels for Anthem, um, because I kind of feel like EA

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,920
gave the finger to the Mass Effect series in a really nasty way.

182
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,880
And so, um, especially hearing that Anthem has been delayed, but it will come out in

183
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
this fiscal year.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,560
I'm already worried for Anthem, but I suppose EA3 is the place to prove me wrong and show

185
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,400
me what a kick-ass game Anthem might be.

186
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,840
You know what Anthem better be?

187
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,600
Another Mass Effect.

188
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
In the Mass Effect universe.

189
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,760
It's just Mass Effect Anthem.

190
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,960
So you want, you want basically, was it the Volition version of, no it wasn't the Volition

191
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,760
version, it was, um, I can't even, see, my mind has already blocked out their terrible

192
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
game that they released, so I'm not even going to try to reference that.

193
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,400
Basically, hopefully, they're not going to implement too much Mass Effect, make it its

194
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
own thing.

195
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,080
I think it's going to be more Destiny, though, than anything.

196
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,280
I would forget, well Destiny's not EA, Destiny's Activision.

197
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
I understand.

198
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,040
I understand it's Activision, but they want a piece of that money.

199
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
I get it.

200
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
I get it.

201
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,840
Um, I would, I would forgive EA quite a bit if they would just give us the fucking Mass

202
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,680
Effect remaster already.

203
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,440
Like, I know EA is really skittish about remastering their games, however, I'm sure

204
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,360
some of you have heard, and we have a news story coming out later, looks like EA's changed

205
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,640
their mind on that a little bit, so, it's possible, who knows.

206
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,400
Well let me- Other than that, all we have are mods, which,

207
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:49,000
by the way, Mass Effect 3 high-res mods look really good, so it should be fucking easy.

208
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:57,240
Uh, let's see, go into our chat at live.vognetwork.com, um, let's see, uh, sg100matt says Mass Effect

209
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
Kart Anthem Edition.

210
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,240
Uh, let's see, uh, let's see- I gave two fingers up for that.

211
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,000
Also, uh, bobbyblackwool says Anthem is just a Mass Effect game and they'll name it Mass

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,560
Effect at the very end, who knows, who knows.

213
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Uh, megamanx400 suggests Mass Effect Trilogy Definitive Edition for Switch.

214
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Let's go.

215
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,680
So when he's saying Anthem is the- You know why?

216
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
I only play console.

217
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,480
I want a Definitive Edition also released for- But Switch is a console.

218
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
I mean not console, I mean PC.

219
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,200
Oh, so whatever they do needs to also be on PC.

220
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
And I want a Mac version, so that I can play it on my Mac.

221
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
Our list of demands.

222
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,880
So, um, so basically bobby's saying the Anthem should be like, you know, Metal Gear Solid

223
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,280
5, the Phantom Pains, where it's gonna be, what, Mass Effect 4 Anthem?

224
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,400
The Phantom good game.

225
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:55,440
Yes, it was much better than some other shit that certain Konami companies decided to put

226
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,320
out recently that, we can do this ourselves!

227
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,760
No, we can't!

228
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Let me back up, let me back up a little bit, and, and, uh, MegamanX clarifying his, uh,

229
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,440
dream statement there saying, well, it would obviously come out for all, not just Switch,

230
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,720
but doesn't want Switch to get left out.

231
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,600
Um, let me ask this question, a little, little bit of a different question, you know, enough

232
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,640
about Anthem, we'll, we'll see more in the coming months at E3.

233
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,520
But, you know, I mentioned when we started this discussion is that E3's changed a lot

234
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,720
in the past few years.

235
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,640
And I think the show that it's become is not the show that we remember.

236
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,880
Now, granted, there might be a question if E3 could ever go back to the show that we

237
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,520
remember.

238
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,960
I mean, keep in mind, when we were going to E3 in 2004, 2005, uh, we didn't have the internet

239
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,000
as prolific with video as it is now.

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,800
I mean, when this, when this show first started on live 365, we were dial-up friendly radio,

241
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,120
right?

242
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Anyone remember dial-up modems?

243
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,360
They were still a thing in 2002.

244
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
That was right around the, that was right around the years where that was starting to

245
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,280
change.

246
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Like, you know, DSL, I think was a big thing a lot of people had, and then, you know, cable

247
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,560
really came in a few years later.

248
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,960
But anyway, I digress a little bit, but my point is, is that, you know, a lot of the

249
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,520
experience that we were getting at E3 some time ago, you just go on to Twitch, you go

250
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,560
on to IGN, you go on to YouTube, you're seeing a lot of the stuff that you used to have to

251
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,000
wait in line, get a ticket, go into theater to go see.

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So let me ask you guys this.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,240
If you were in charge, and I open this up to chat as well, and reasonably please, if

254
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,400
you were in charge of E3 now, what would you do?

255
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,960
What would be the show that you would do?

256
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,120
Do you think that the ESA, do you think they're doing the right thing right now?

257
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
Or how would you run E3?

258
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,840
You know, and, you know, make it reasonable, but at the same time, I'm not going to draw

259
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,120
many more boundaries on it.

260
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,320
You know, we won't, we will assume that money is not a factor in things like that.

261
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
Jamie, I'll start with you.

262
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
What would you, how would you run E3 if you were the boss?

263
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,240
I would seriously seriously want to put it back to like it was the first year I went.

264
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,400
And I want to see more, the whole thing for me was that Cantia Hall, you know?

265
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,440
It was seeing the indie developers, the smaller developers, and having, I loved the little

266
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,960
video game museum that they'd have there.

267
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,960
It was something that's like, yes, here's the future over here, but here's also where

268
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
we came from.

269
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,480
And I loved having, like, seeing the dev units for older systems.

270
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,680
And I loved going in and trying new technology that even if it wasn't going to come out,

271
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,120
you know, like that one sphere thing, you know, where you put your hand on it and it

272
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,000
gave you the feedback.

273
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,040
Like you could touch what was in the game through that thing.

274
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,920
That was cool.

275
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,600
And it was seeing just the innovations that were coming out there.

276
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,440
I'd really like a lot of focus on the innovators, you know?

277
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
And yeah, the swag was great.

278
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,720
I mean, I have a few things to this day I still use, you know, but in the long run,

279
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,560
you know, the big thing was the going and seeing and the tactile part of, you know,

280
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,720
the experience, getting to put your hands on new, new things.

281
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
And of course, sitting in a skyline wasn't that bad.

282
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
That year they had the skyline there at the whatever the racing thing was.

283
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,440
Oh, yeah.

284
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,280
That was fun.

285
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,360
I think that's great that you call out Kensha Hall.

286
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,160
I mean, that was from the earlier years of E3.

287
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,320
You know, that was a lot of the especially like foreign developers really seem to be

288
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,040
in that area.

289
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,920
You know, things that folks from this show might remember when we talked about dance

290
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,760
based games, like In the Groove was shown there.

291
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,440
Red Octane probably showed the Guitar Hero thing first in Kensha Hall before that really

292
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
blew up.

293
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,280
It's also where you could like go to the Natsume booth, you know, some of the other,

294
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
I would say, like medium developers overseas, you know?

295
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,720
But it was also, was it in Kensha Hall?

296
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
No, it might have been in one of the bigger ones.

297
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
They had like that dragon flying game where you have to get and flap your arms with it.

298
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,160
I don't even know if I played that.

299
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,000
But I liked just seeing the stuff like that, the interactivity, you know, again, technology

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,840
that may not even come out anytime soon, but you get to see it sort of nascent, you know,

301
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,560
version of it.

302
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,920
Let me get to some comments in chat because some great discussion in chat at live.vognetwork.com.

303
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Bobby Blackwolf says, the problem is I fully believe that the gaming industry needs an

304
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,520
expo for the industry.

305
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,200
I know consumers would be upset because they feel they are the most important part of the

306
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,040
industry, but every other industry in the world has a trade show for just themselves.

307
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,880
But the gaming industry is special and that the consumers feel more connected to the industry

308
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,960
more so than you see in other industries.

309
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,640
There are still trade shows and expos that I go to that aren't gaming, that have all

310
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,440
the swag and the types of stuff that you saw at early E3s.

311
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,680
But consumers of business software don't necessarily want to go to a business software trade show

312
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,640
for industry people.

313
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,160
JD in chat says, I would cancel E3 and make it GamerX instead.

314
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,280
I do miss GamerX.

315
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,880
We need GamerX to come back.

316
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:03,040
MegamanX400 says, I would like to see more developers launch an online E3 on their consoles.

317
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,000
For example, whatever games are being featured at E3, you can download a time-limited demo

318
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
at home and try it out for a fee most likely, somewhat of a virtual pass.

319
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,600
I love that idea because that's a really good idea is that embrace the online.

320
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,720
Doesn't Blizzcon do that to an extent?

321
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,360
To an extent.

322
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
I mean, they have their DirecTV coverage that they sell.

323
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,160
They don't really let you play demos.

324
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,240
But I remember back in the early days of the Xbox, you could download the same demos they

325
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,040
were doing.

326
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,840
That was a big thing that they had online.

327
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,320
The only thing is, though, and I think where game companies get a little cautious is that

328
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,080
people will make up their mind on the games based on said demos.

329
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,760
And I think that might be why you don't see it as much anymore.

330
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,360
But maybe game companies should really consider doing that for titles that are going to be

331
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,840
coming out in the next couple months anyway.

332
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,400
I think that should be something they should do because we are looking at a more year-round

333
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520
release for games.

334
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
It's not just the fall anymore.

335
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,880
Is fall the most important?

336
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,080
Sure, it still is.

337
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,400
But you see games released in January, February, all times throughout the year that still succeed.

338
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
And I think we are moving to a more global calendar.

339
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
It's just like movies.

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,760
Movies used to be summer, summer, summer, and the holiday break.

341
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,040
But now Black Panther came out in March and that's what it's like the fifth highest grossing.

342
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,960
Clearly I need a calendar.

343
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,460
Thank you.

344
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,880
It came out in February, which was not, you know, you don't think big block releases in

345
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,840
February, right?

346
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,400
And what?

347
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,520
Fifth highest grossing opening movie of all time, right?

348
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
So you don't have to.

349
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,680
Was it fifth?

350
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,040
But it's up there.

351
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,200
We know that movie made a shit ton of money, right?

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,320
That was the official figure actually was shit ton of money.

353
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,680
Going to chat for some more comments at live.vognetwork.com.

354
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Oh, and great comment by Bobby.

355
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,400
Who the hell releases a console in March?

356
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,680
Good point.

357
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,880
Maybe that's why I was thinking Nintendo, because they've done it a few times already.

358
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,000
That was the tongue in cheek joke.

359
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,000
Dungeon.

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,040
Who the hell releases a console with no online support?

361
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,080
Nintendo.

362
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,280
Who succeeded anyway.

363
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,720
Dungeon Buster says E3 used to be focused exclusively on industry members from retail

364
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,080
to corporate shareholders.

365
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Now it needs to cater to a new audience to stay relevant, which is going to change that

366
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,580
dynamic.

367
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,160
So 200 Matt says, step one, make the holodeck.

368
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,000
Step two, make an E3 holodeck where there are no lines and people can play what they

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,480
want.

370
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
Step three, charge money for it.

371
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
Step four, profit.

372
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
Are you sure you're not Franky?

373
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Since you said the holodeck, we may as well go there.

374
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,560
Loki, your dream E3.

375
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,160
What would you do if you were inside?

376
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,920
I mean, honestly, wow.

377
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
It's just it's take it out back.

378
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,400
Well, no, it's just because it's everybody's doing their own thing anyways.

379
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,040
And it's just, I think, easier to get access to stuff when it's split up like at different

380
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,840
events instead of having all one thing.

381
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,280
E3, I remember when you go there, it's very chaotic.

382
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,320
And I feel that staying home, you actually see a lot more than you do at the show.

383
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,480
And I know for like a lot of people have never gone.

384
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,920
You know, it's probably pretty exciting to be like, you know, part of the public to go

385
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,760
there and experience that.

386
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,520
But it gets old fast.

387
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,200
And I just can't imagine now that it would be that exciting to go to E3 and check out

388
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,680
all that stuff.

389
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,440
It's just I don't know.

390
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,800
I can I can enjoy it just fine on TV or streaming and stuff and check it out.

391
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,640
I do wish they used to do more demos and stuff like they used to do.

392
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,840
But I understand that that's a big strain on developers to actually put out a demo that's

393
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,680
not running on test hardware and stuff.

394
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,600
And it's that's hard enough.

395
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,640
So I'll just accept.

396
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,480
Just let it let it go wherever the way it is.

397
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,400
Honestly, you know, I don't want to reward the USA any more than I have to being that

398
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
they're defending these companies with the practices that they're doing now.

399
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,680
And they've got their backs for that.

400
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,280
So it's not like they have the consumer in mind anyways when it comes to a lot of this

401
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,600
stuff.

402
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,720
They're clearly signing with developers.

403
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,520
So just let die.

404
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,880
Let them do whatever they think needs to make the show successful.

405
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
But inevitably, it's just going to just going to die.

406
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,520
A harsh but realistic answer from Loki.

407
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,000
But let me let me poke you on this point, though, because Bobby said that, you know,

408
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,240
the gaming industry needs a trade show and you've been on the very trade side of things.

409
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,920
Some people don't remember, but you used to work in video game distribution.

410
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,360
So you've been to E3, not as an OLR host, but in the shoes of a video game distributor.

411
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,840
Doesn't the gaming industry still need something like that that caters to that crowd?

412
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,280
Not necessarily.

413
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,440
That's more of like they'll go and make deals about different things, you know, especially

414
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,280
upcoming titles, trying to secure allocations and stuff like that.

415
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,760
But they have other shows that they go do that at that are specifically for trade.

416
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,720
Like, for example, they have Destination PlayStation, which is a strictly industry

417
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,480
event that it's all Sony.

418
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,560
They have the Xbox.

419
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,200
I don't remember the Xbox one's called, but they have some Microsoft Xbox show that's

420
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,560
along the lines of that as well.

421
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,320
That's also just industry.

422
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,840
Nintendo doesn't fucking do anything.

423
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,320
They don't care.

424
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,280
They play by their own rules.

425
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,760
But those two companies do that.

426
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,880
And a lot of the other people, because you have reps that you're talking with, they come

427
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,040
out to your company and they make deals as well.

428
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,280
You don't necessarily need to do that at E3.

429
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,560
It's just it's exciting.

430
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,600
E3, all the stuff is announcing like new consoles are announcing stuff.

431
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,760
It's like, oh, OK, let's secure our allocations and sit down and talk with these people that

432
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,240
we haven't met with in a while to discuss what we're going to do to make sure that we're

433
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
getting enough, you know, enough product in for these things.

434
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,040
But then again, independent stores are kind of dying anyways because these companies don't

435
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,600
fucking care.

436
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,120
They want to do a, you know, a preorder bonus with GameStop or Walmart or Target or Best

437
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,880
Buy and they're going to Amazon.

438
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,280
They're going to do deal with those companies and fuck everybody else.

439
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,960
I mean, honestly, that's kind of the way they treat everybody.

440
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,680
So, yeah, I don't think I don't think it's necessary.

441
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,800
They have those events.

442
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,360
That's what I'm saying.

443
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,320
It's like just because you haven't heard of them because not a lot of news leaks out from

444
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,880
them doesn't mean that they don't exist.

445
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,840
It's just there's a lot of shows out there already available and there's this PAX.

446
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,280
And I mean, there's plenty of shows to see games.

447
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,360
Bobby Blackwell points out GDC is probably a better industry trade show.

448
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,240
Where the people who make the games also get together to learn.

449
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,040
Sia Tabiri in chat says if it's becoming more and more like a show than a trade show, why

450
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,600
not start a new trade show and break off of E3 to be more like a convention, especially

451
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,880
if E3 is being seen as catering increasingly to the general public.

452
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,160
These are all good questions.

453
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
Let me get into my answer to this.

454
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,760
So how I would envision E3.

455
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,520
First off, I just want to say I really like what Delvin Mega Man X 400 suggested in chat.

456
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,440
The whole like online experience so that people that are playing the home game have something

457
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,720
to do.

458
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,800
And I think that's like getting there because you see like the press conferences or something

459
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,320
you can kind of watch throughout the day.

460
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,560
You see these companies like Jeff Keeley doing stuff with his online networks and IGN and

461
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,920
so forth building these 24-7 experiences out of it.

462
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,160
It would be nice to see something maybe of an official capacity, but maybe they don't

463
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,600
need it because they have these other companies.

464
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,520
But I like the idea of some of E3 being a little bit more of an online experience for

465
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,640
people around the world.

466
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
So everybody gets excited about E3.

467
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,400
Well remember like PT?

468
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,760
Remember when that was?

469
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,840
Oh yeah, but that was Tokyo Game Show, wasn't it?

470
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,040
I think that came out of Tokyo Game Show.

471
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,160
I don't remember, but still, I mean, that's basically the E3.

472
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,120
That's great.

473
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,760
Anyway, okay, here's my thought.

474
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,440
I love the idea to reopen Kensha Hall as more of like an indie showcase.

475
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,280
Except it's a parking lot, but you know.

476
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:01,520
Well, you know, okay, but downtown LA has been through a lot of changes and surely they

477
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,560
have more parking somewhere, especially with the freaking Staples Center down there.

478
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,840
And people just have to start taking transit or find other ways to get to, especially with

479
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,240
Uber and Lyft being more prolific.

480
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
People have to find other ways if they take a few parking spots out of E3.

481
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,280
Okay, so anyway, I would say turn Kensha Hall back into an indie showcase.

482
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:28,080
But I would like to see E3 kind of embrace gaming and gaming culture, because I think

483
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,560
that's a lot of what's changed in the industry in the past few years is that you have more

484
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,040
and more for gaming culture.

485
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,440
Because so much is digital, look at where like GameStop's going is that they want to

486
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
sell a lot of these things that are gaming culture.

487
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,800
But not just that is what I mean by gaming culture and like the things that are kind

488
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
of secondary to the video games.

489
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,400
But I mean things like how Twitch TV is growing and people are watching online with streaming

490
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
stuff, that is gaming culture.

491
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
YouTube, you know, whether I love them or hate them, they are still a part of gaming

492
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,480
culture.

493
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,440
And a lot of these online things, esports, that's gaming culture.

494
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,840
I would like to see E3 kind of looked at a little differently about how it's laid out

495
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,680
strategically, have an area that really embraces and involves gaming culture.

496
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,680
And that is the part that would really appeal to the public for some time.

497
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,720
And I would say the part of it that then is left for the gaming, I would say maybe a similar

498
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,840
to the Tokyo Game Show.

499
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,200
For a day or two, it's just the trade people only.

500
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,960
But then like on the third day or what have you, they open it up to everybody.

501
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,280
Having been to E3, you know, even in the early years, I felt like you could get a good chunk

502
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,640
of stuff done in the first two days.

503
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,760
Then by the third day, it's like, okay, I'm tired.

504
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,520
Let's go get a recap of, you know, things we enjoy to go do it again or whatever.

505
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,800
So I kind of feel like they could still do a lot with, you know, just even a day or two

506
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,320
if it was like trade only.

507
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,600
But have other stuff that celebrates the culture of video games that would be something that

508
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,120
the public has for them, if that makes sense.

509
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,920
That's my idea.

510
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,080
And Bobby Blackwell says they had an art gallery, Rob, an art gallery.

511
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,000
That's a start.

512
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,760
But that's not, that's maybe 1% of what I wanted to do there.

513
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,160
Bobby Blackwell also bringing up E4ALL as a follow up to Sia Tabiri's comment about

514
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,320
why don't they split it up into a public show and a trade show?

515
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,160
Because E4ALL flopped.

516
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,320
But I think they did not succeed in drawing the right talent into E4ALL.

517
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,000
They had maybe one big publisher there each year they did it.

518
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,960
Like one year they had Nintendo, one year they had Microsoft.

519
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,040
You know, I think they've really got to draw in the talent to make something like E4ALL

520
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,320
work, which is why, you know, it didn't end up working.

521
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,520
Bob C. points out that downtown LA has good public transit and LA Convention Center is

522
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,760
getting too small for even Anime Expo now.

523
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,240
So anyway, let's see.

524
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,120
Dungeon Buster says, yeah, first two days, rush, rush, rush.

525
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,080
But by the third day, I just go back to play the games I wanted to spend more time with

526
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,360
or collect more swag.

527
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,480
So anyway, I hope the folks that put on E3 will look to change the X, whether they take

528
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,600
these ideas or not, I hope they do look to modernize and change the expo for the year

529
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,640
2018.

530
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,520
You know, I'm not going to expect to see that this year, but if the attendance numbers start

531
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,560
dipping, they're going to really have to probably look at doing something.

532
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,600
So, yeah, we'll see.

533
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,480
All right.

534
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,520
Anyhow, well, let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we

535
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,880
have been playing this week.

536
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,400
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

537
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,960
I didn't really play much of anything I was supposed to stream, but I was pretty sick

538
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,840
at the beginning of the week.

539
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
So I really just haven't touched anything.

540
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,600
You know, just Animal Crossing on my phone, a little Ingress, a little Pokemon Go, still

541
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,280
playing the wrap up of Miitomo.

542
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:00,800
I've been playing the new Bust-A-Move game that's on iOS, but it's not...

543
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,040
I hate how they're taking all of them from just the old school gameplay to the, oh, you

544
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,840
get bombs if you pay this many points.

545
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,520
I'm like, no, that's boring.

546
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
I just want to play fucking Bust-A-Move.

547
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
So I'm mad.

548
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,680
That's it.

549
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,800
I haven't really been playing much.

550
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
All right, let's check in with Loki.

551
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,600
How was your gaming week?

552
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,800
I really only...

553
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,600
One last, wow.

554
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,960
I really didn't play too much this week, except for, of course, Dance of the Revolution

555
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,000
Extreme, and then a little bit of mobile stuff.

556
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,120
I did play a little bit of Ingress, a little bit of Pokemon Go when I was at places near

557
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,560
that stuff, and then a little bit of my Office Space game, although I only played that very

558
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,440
sparingly.

559
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,400
So that's about it.

560
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,200
I wanted to play more.

561
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,280
Just, I don't know.

562
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,160
I was working on stuff.

563
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Unfortunately, not games.

564
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,880
All right.

565
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,400
Learning HTML5 and CSS3.

566
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,160
Fun stuff.

567
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,560
Well, I feel like I played a lot this week, so get a chair.

568
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,560
I'll take up for the time then.

569
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,520
So I've also been playing the phone games, the Ingress, especially the Pokemon Go, since

570
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,880
they did the community event yesterday.

571
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,080
Yes, I got a shiny.

572
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,760
Yeah, I got three shinies.

573
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,200
But I didn't get enough to get a dragon.

574
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,240
Oh, bummer.

575
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,280
Yeah, I went out with Shane from Ranger Pride, which came back this week, by the way, you

576
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,520
guys.

577
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,640
So check that out at VOG Network.

578
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,720
Shane from Ranger Pride, myself, some of our other buddies.

579
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,600
We went over to Capitol Park here in SAC, and it was lit up with lures, as you can imagine,

580
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,520
and we walked around the entire three hours.

581
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,200
We walked around the park, and I probably caught easy, like 150 Dratini's.

582
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,160
I caught three shinies, which was the minimum I wanted.

583
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,240
So that way I could have a Dratini, Dragonite, Dragonair.

584
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
I could have each one of them in a shiny form.

585
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,920
I got that.

586
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,800
So I'm happy with that.

587
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,800
But yeah, lots and lots of Dratini candy and just a good time and good exercise, which

588
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,040
is good.

589
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
A good excuse to just get out, walk around.

590
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,560
And I'm telling you guys, and I'm using my quotey finger, dead game.

591
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,640
And I realize less people are calling it that now because they end up embarrassed, but it's

592
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,440
not a dead game.

593
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,080
Like looking at Capitol, there was a lot of people there, and it was to the point where

594
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,840
the police were kind of coming around going like, what is going on?

595
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,600
And then when somebody was like, Pokemon, there's a lot of Pokemon stuff going on.

596
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,800
Oh, okay.

597
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,640
Because they were showing up because they're like, what is this unpermitted event that's

598
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,480
happening at the Capitol right now?

599
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
Like, they thought it was a protest.

600
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,520
How dare people use our parks?

601
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Which ironically, there was a protest because we walked by.

602
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,280
There were two guys there on the state Capitol with a mega horn talking about the California

603
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,960
seceding for the nation, that whole thing.

604
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,440
California being the whole separate.

605
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,400
Yeah, right.

606
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
So that is what was going on.

607
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,120
I'm sure those guys were confused, too.

608
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,280
Like, why would these people look up for their phones?

609
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,840
We got a great turnout here, right?

610
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,960
We're not here for you, bitch.

611
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,400
There's a shiny here.

612
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,900
All right.

613
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,680
So anyway, that's how you get us to succeed.

614
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Or you just, you know, but I'll wait now.

615
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,400
That wouldn't work.

616
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,320
I don't know if we can succeed and join Canada.

617
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,040
That would be great in the nation of California.

618
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,640
Shiny Dragon Knights for all.

619
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,140
Yay.

620
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,920
All right.

621
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,160
Anyway, all that political stuff aside.

622
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,640
So that was just a quick side note.

623
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,760
Super multitasking is listed as one of the featured games on Steam right now.

624
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,480
Is that just your library?

625
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,440
Because it's tailored to you.

626
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,800
It might be tailored to you because everybody's playing it.

627
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,760
But it's on there.

628
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,000
All right.

629
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,360
Well, since you brought it up.

630
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,520
Spoiler, Jamie.

631
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,800
Geez, I was going to get to it.

632
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,520
But I wasn't saying it to spoil it.

633
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm saying that it was.

634
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,540
It's fine.

635
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,480
Congrats to Aaron or YYR.

636
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,200
His game Super Multitasking officially released on Steam on Friday, Thursday.

637
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,080
I think it was Friday.

638
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,880
So it's officially out there and you can buy it.

639
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,120
It is still $4.49.

640
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,280
It's 10% off the $5 price.

641
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,120
And you've heard us talking about this game a lot.

642
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,880
You know, please consider going to support Aaron.

643
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,560
Best way I can describe the game.

644
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,080
It's similar to WarioWare, but obviously kind of different types of games.

645
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,960
And the fact is you play four of them all at the same time.

646
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,520
Sometimes.

647
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,640
Sometimes it's one, it's two.

648
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,800
It gets harder and harder as it moves along, right?

649
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,520
So just honestly, go look at YouTube.

650
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
Go look at Twitch.

651
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,240
Go watch somebody play it.

652
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,880
Because it's just a lot of fun.

653
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,320
I think the best way to sell quote unquote the game is to watch.

654
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,320
And if you're a streamer, I would really urge you to pick up Super Multitasking or contact

655
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,080
YYR underscore on Twitter.

656
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,520
Because if you're a streamer, he may just straight up like, you know, help you out with

657
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,800
getting hooked up with the product.

658
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,120
Because I think they make for a very fun stream.

659
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,600
Because I did a stream of Super Multitasking on Friday and people were, you know, I was

660
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,720
getting really mad because those challenges get hard.

661
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
And you know, it's just like over and over and over again, you're doing it.

662
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,520
And then finally you get through and it feels really, really, really good.

663
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,520
So yeah, that's great.

664
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,040
So congrats to Aaron or YYR on his release of Super Multitasking and check that out on

665
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,280
Steam.

666
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,520
Other stuff I played this week.

667
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,080
So today with my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness, we did a live stream.

668
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,240
So I didn't do a post OLR stream because we're doing something else after OLR tonight, which

669
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm going to get to in a minute here in housekeeping.

670
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,880
But I did a pre-OLR stream tonight with my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness.

671
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,480
And we played 20XX or as I call it 20XDX.

672
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,800
That's the Mega Man-esque type of game.

673
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,200
But it's more like a roguelike, I guess, where you try to gather as many items as you can

674
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,880
and it carries over into the next game.

675
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,440
And that was a lot of fun because you can actually play that co-op online.

676
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,520
So that's something that you can't really do in Mega Man.

677
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,720
So that was really fun.

678
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
And then we played Mario Kart.

679
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,120
You know, we had to have that standby game that other people could join in.

680
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,080
And that was a lot of fun.

681
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,200
And it was funny because Bobby kept coming in last place.

682
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,000
And then all of a sudden, like the last ones, he whooped our butt in the 200cc.

683
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,400
And I was like, Bobby's not going to play 200cc.

684
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,160
And then that's the one he murders us at.

685
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,600
So congrats to Bobby.

686
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,120
And now he can't complain about that.

687
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,720
But that was a lot of fun that Mario Kart stream.

688
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,600
So you can follow me on Twitch if you want to see more of that at Rob Roberts on Twitch.

689
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,320
And of course, a shout out as well to Delvin at VG Realness over on Twitch for doing the

690
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,600
co-streaming with me today.

691
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,320
And congrats, of course, to VOG's very own Bobby Blackwolf for getting affiliate this

692
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,480
week.

693
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,520
So you can check him out on Twitch at Bobby Blackwolf.

694
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,400
And he just finished up Police Quest 2.

695
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,360
He is streaming on original hardware.

696
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,400
He is not no emulators, no good old games.

697
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:24,880
No, no, no.

698
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,960
That is the original Pentium computer with his Roland MT-32 card that he is streaming

699
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,520
these games on.

700
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,160
That's a lot of fun.

701
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,640
So well, the streaming doesn't happen on that machine, but the machine is running the game.

702
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,920
You know what I mean.

703
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,080
One other thing I want to mention.

704
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,440
No, I lied.

705
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,400
Two other things I want to mention.

706
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,680
One, I want to give a quick shout out to Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 on the Switch because I did

707
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,240
play Bayonetta on the Switch this week for a little bit.

708
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,680
It's a good port and just love and play in that game again.

709
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,680
By the way, you remember the story last week about how some of the codes for Bayonetta

710
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,880
2 for the original Bayonetta were bad.

711
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,000
Hey, guess what?

712
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,080
I got a bad code for Bayonetta.

713
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,200
So I actually had to call Nintendo on Monday, I think it was, and talk to the guy about

714
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,680
getting a replacement code, but they were very good.

715
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,080
All I had to do was give them the code that I did have.

716
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,840
And it sounded like they had a program on their side that was like translating the codes

717
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,600
from the bad code to a good code.

718
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,200
So I don't know where the screw up was, but they were able to fix it pretty quick.

719
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,360
Waiting on hold was the hardest part.

720
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,040
So I guess props to Nintendo for at least.

721
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Waiting is the hardest part.

722
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,720
And then lastly, lastly, the last thing on Switch that I played this week was Pac-Man

723
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,360
Championship Edition 2 Plus.

724
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,480
And you're probably thinking, Rob, haven't you played this game before?

725
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,320
Yeah, I own it on PlayStation 4 and PC and now Switch.

726
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,960
But in my defense, I bought it on PC as like part of a bundle where it cost me like $2

727
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,520
on PCs.

728
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,280
Like it was nothing on PC.

729
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,600
The reason why I got the Switch version was A, for the portability of it and B, there's

730
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,280
actually a brand new mode now that is a two player mode.

731
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,840
And what might not be obvious, which I think is unfortunate, but what's probably not obvious

732
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,240
in the marketing material for the game is that you can have the computer control the

733
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,360
second character.

734
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,280
Now, obviously, it's going to be way more fun if you actually have a second person doing

735
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,760
it.

736
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,520
But it is kind of cool that you can play with your computer as the partner and you can still

737
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,000
kind of experience the new mode because it is different.

738
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,720
It's very different from the regular game because in the two player game, you each are

739
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,240
eating the pellets and you can kind of help each other or you can kind of stick to your

740
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,200
side of the maze.

741
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,160
But once you're finished eating the dot, you don't reset to the bottom to pick up the fruit.

742
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,840
You actually have to kiss.

743
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,840
The two Pac-Man's have to kiss because they're each holding, they're holding the fruit and

744
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,320
bubbles.

745
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,520
And then when they kiss, they make the fruit and then you go to the next level.

746
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,360
So it does add a new element to it.

747
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,920
And then when the ghosts are on rails, when you are in the power pellet mode, it's kind

748
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,760
of the most controversial switch in Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 is that they put the

749
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,480
ghosts on rails during that part.

750
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,440
But what happens is that one Pac-Man has to eat the head and the other has to eat the

751
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,760
tail.

752
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,560
But once one of you hits the head, it freezes for like 10 seconds.

753
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,400
So it gives you an opportunity to grab the tail.

754
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,680
So I mean, these little twists really kind of change it up a bit.

755
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,280
So it almost feels like a different game.

756
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,720
So if you're into the Pac-Man Championship game, it's worth checking out, especially if

757
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
you missed it on all the other platforms.

758
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,400
I would say the Switch version is now probably the definitive edition.

759
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,920
However, one thing I do have to read it for, the game works really well in handheld mode.

760
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,400
It seems like it's optimized for handheld mode.

761
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,160
In console mode, I did notice some frame skip and some bad optimization, which considering

762
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,320
this game is not exactly new, it's been out on PlayStation 4, it's been out on PC.

763
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,080
That's a bit of a no-no.

764
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,080
So I do hope Namco will look at this issue and address it because it was something I

765
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,040
definitely noticed.

766
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,720
And if you've seen Pac-Man Championship Edition 2, it is a little bit graphic intensive.

767
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,000
So especially during some of the transitions, like if you notice, like with the Pac-Man

768
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,640
floats off one board down to another board, which is a very money shot you see in the

769
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,600
trailers, that's where I noticed the frame skip the worst.

770
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,800
And that's kind of a bummer because that is a very cool visual flare that the game has.

771
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,280
So yeah, there you go.

772
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,240
But I would say check that out for those of you guys that are on the Nintendo Switch and

773
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,360
maybe have not played Pac-Man Championship Edition yet.

774
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,720
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

775
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,160
Brad from Paw Culture says, got to get the Xbox version and complete the set.

776
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,600
What do you think this is?

777
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,320
Mass Effect?

778
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,480
No, no, I'm done.

779
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,240
I'm not going to buy this Pac-Man game anymore.

780
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,720
The only reason I bought it on the Switch was for handheld and the fact that it had

781
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,880
like this whole new sub game in it that I think is important to check out.

782
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,080
So, um, which also, you know, not to humble brag, but I think I will a little bit, probably

783
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,120
because not a lot of people are playing this game on Switch right now.

784
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,760
I have a top 50 score in the base board.

785
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,480
I have the 40th highest score, uh, out of like maybe 4,200 players.

786
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,200
So what's cool is that if you're in the top 50, you can actually watch a replay.

787
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,240
So if you look for Rob, I might still be, I might've got bumped off by the time you

788
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,240
hear this, but if you look at the top 50 for just the basic beginner champion board and

789
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,320
you see Rob, you can actually watch my replay and see that I did have some imperfections

790
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,080
in my run, but I'm going to try to get better.

791
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,160
Cause I, I really enjoy the game.

792
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,360
Um, even though the ghosts on rails, you know, it's a little bit of a shortcoming.

793
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,040
I wish they'd kind of done that a little bit differently, but I love the music too.

794
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,440
The music just like gets, it's like the Pac-Man Championship Edition games have great soundtracks

795
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,640
and this one's no different.

796
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,160
So anyway, I have blabbed enough about my gaming week.

797
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,880
Let's move on.

798
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,120
I want to go to some housekeeping here cause I've got something big to talk about tonight.

799
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:54,320
Um, over at the voice geeks network, vog network.com, we have introduced a brand new show and we

800
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,320
want to give a warm welcome to this show has actually been existing for a little while.

801
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,000
But they've just joined up, partnered up with the voice geeks network this week.

802
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,560
So we want to say hello and welcome to the far away nearby, which is a new podcast on

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,160
Um, I, and DJ star Sage is actually in chat, uh, saying hello and such a privilege to be

Appreciate that.

820
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,280
So check that out.

821
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,080
We're going to check out their latest episode, passion, privilege, and peril tonight after

822
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,120
orange launch radio.

823
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,800
So welcome far away nearby.

824
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,360
You can follow them on Twitter at T F N DJ.

825
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,720
I hope I did not screw that up, but I'm doing that off the top of my head.

826
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,520
I'm double checking myself on the website right now.

827
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,400
I think I got it right.

828
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,200
If I got that wrong, just holler at me and chat DJ star Sage.

829
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,700
All right.

830
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,660
Um, that's all I have for housekeeping.

831
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,500
You'll follow us on Twitter at OLR.

832
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,700
We're also on Facebook at orange lounge radio.

833
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,460
Let's get into some gaming news.

834
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,260
Loki.

835
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:46,660
Yes.

836
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,820
So apparently square Enix has plans for final fantasy 15 that go on through 2019 as far

837
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,260
as the download content schedule that they have.

838
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,500
So they're going to keep adding different things to it.

839
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:05,540
Um, including actually, um, with the launch of the PC version, they have a skin that is

840
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,700
half-life themed as well.

841
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,820
So yes, you can actually, um, dress up like Gordon Freeman if you want.

842
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,460
I hate this.

843
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,260
Like I, I just, I hate it.

844
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,460
Thanks.

845
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,020
I hate it.

846
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:26,180
But it is, it's any less, is this more ridiculous than, um, you know, the whole cup noodle stuff?

847
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,700
I mean, come on.

848
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,060
I guess not, but I just, I hate it for multiple reasons.

849
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:38,580
For one, like really like half like, like stop shoving half-life in our face.

850
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,460
If you're not going to fucking make half-life three, like just stop it.

851
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,260
It's fucking rude.

852
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,660
It sounds like a valve problem.

853
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,300
It is.

854
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,700
And I'm, I'm giving him, giving him shit for that.

855
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,020
But then at the same time, it's like, you know, I just, I feel like this is such a weird

856
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,100
out of place addition, but then at the same time, and I know somebody is going to call

857
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,340
me out on chat on it, so I might as well just say, I know they did the Mass Effect

858
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:05,460
costumes in Final Fantasy 13 too, but I was okay with that.

859
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,620
No, they were kind of ridiculous there too.

860
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,700
They were, they were kind of ridiculous.

861
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,420
I'm kind of okay with them going ridiculous.

862
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,340
Let's make it even more ridiculous.

863
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,980
I mean, might as well, because you know what?

864
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,820
That's, hey, there we go.

865
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,100
It worked for Volition.

866
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,740
Let's do that.

867
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,740
You know, let's take Final Fantasy in the, in the direction of Saints Row.

868
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,740
Let's put Johnny Gat in the game.

869
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,140
Why not?

870
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,380
Like everybody wants fucking Johnny Gat and stuff.

871
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:31,860
Over the top.

872
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,980
Throw Johnny Gat in there.

873
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,060
He can be another member of their team.

874
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,420
And actually I'd be fine at that actually.

875
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,100
How do you feel about Final Fantasy 15 continuing on into 2019?

876
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,500
Because I kind of wish they'd let it go and let the team work on some, like Final Fantasy

877
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,940
16 or something new.

878
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:57,380
Like, I just, I feel like I played and I finished Final Fantasy 15 and I'm getting irritated

879
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,300
that it keeps saying, nope, you got to come back and play through the whole game again.

880
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,220
Cause we changed this one little thing or we did this one, you know, new thing that's

881
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,260
different or now there's this one character you can play as or something.

882
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:13,060
It's like, okay, if you're going to like, then I'm just going to check out until you're

883
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,180
done releasing all this shit and then I'll play the game again.

884
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:16,820
You know what I mean?

885
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,420
Yeah.

886
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,140
It was funny.

887
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,340
Like I was actually talking to my son about, I was like, oh yeah, I need to finish that

888
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:22,500
game.

889
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,940
Cause he was asking me, he's all, what was that game that you're playing?

890
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,660
They had a guy at the large sword and, and you got food out of eggs.

891
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,860
I'm like, geez, you know what?

892
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,420
That could be like a billion different things.

893
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,740
I like, I have no idea what you're talking about.

894
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,780
And I still don't know what he, what game he was referring to, but I was like, Final

895
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,140
Fantasy 15, maybe.

896
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:46,020
I mean, like, I don't think I ever saw me playing that game, but, uh, but I'm like,

897
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,180
oh yeah, I do need to go play that.

898
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,980
I mean, I guess for the people that really enjoy Final Fantasy 15 and are really, you

899
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,740
know, into the game and the lore.

900
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,460
I mean, it is cool that the game is continuing on.

901
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,020
I mean, I guess it would be similar to, you know, that continued DLC they did for the

902
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,700
Mass Effect games for a while worse.

903
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,580
They could make spinoff games like they did with seven.

904
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,580
Final Fantasy 15 was a spinoff game.

905
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,300
Remember?

906
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,300
It started as a spinoff game.

907
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:11,800
True.

908
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,620
This is true.

909
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:13,940
Yes.

910
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,700
Now that I think it, um, but like, you know, I'm talking about like, you know, they could

911
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,020
do a dirge of Severus or something like that.

912
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,520
Cerberus.

913
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,820
Uh, Jamie, I, are you, I don't think you really got into Final Fantasy 15, but how do you

914
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,140
feel about the, the life till 2019 of this game?

915
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,100
I don't care.

916
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,300
I'm not going to play it.

917
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,620
I hope they actually make that stupid VR mode that they actually were showing off originally

918
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,020
that was going to be the VR modes instead of the fishing bullshit.

919
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,300
Oh, so angry.

920
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,140
I, it's just so ridiculous.

921
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,820
I mean, I'll be honest.

922
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:55,380
I haven't really enjoyed a Final Fantasy game past other than the MMOs.

923
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:00,980
I mean, like the last one I played any significant amount of was eight and I don't think it was

924
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,860
as good as seven.

925
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,300
I barely touched nine.

926
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,660
Ten was fun.

927
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,620
And after that, I mean, it's just, it's just lost me.

928
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,740
Twelve though, girl.

929
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,780
Twelve's so good.

930
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,700
I don't like twelve.

931
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,300
Eleven and fourteen.

932
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,180
I hate the draw system.

933
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,860
She said besides MMOs.

934
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,980
I hate the draw system.

935
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,900
Draws not in twelve, draws in eight.

936
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,380
Well, I mean, not eight, but the targeting system.

937
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,060
Oh, it is a little, it is a little different.

938
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,380
Yeah.

939
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,500
It's annoying is what it is.

940
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,420
Twelve wasn't, see that was the one I was supposed to play was twelve because it was

941
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:36,020
similar, the combat system was similar to like look like eleven almost where you kind of

942
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:36,900
get near something.

943
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,060
Actually, that's almost like Parasite Eve even, but I don't know.

944
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,260
I kind of, I wouldn't mind if they remastered thirteen, honestly.

945
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,260
I know that's the one people love to hate on, but I liked thirteen well enough and I

946
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:52,980
think that trilogy deserves a nice little, you know, boost into the PlayStation four

947
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,340
and Xbox one era.

948
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,420
But, you know, I'm not going to hold my breath.

949
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:56,920
First one.

950
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,900
I mean, cause I have this ending spoiler and I'm like, eh, what's the point now?

951
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,540
I think Final Fantasy thirteen is one of those Final Fantasy games that actually had a

952
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,460
good ending, I think.

953
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,780
I mean, it was, it did not go on for a half hour.

954
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,980
It was like a five minute.

955
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,380
Well, it depends on what you look at as ending.

956
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:19,300
If you want to look at just from when final boss dies to directed by so and so in the

957
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,620
credits, it's like maybe five and a half minutes.

958
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,500
You know, it's, it's pretty succinct, but it's a, it's a really good five and a half

959
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,000
minutes.

960
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,820
So anyway, uh, okay.

961
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,580
I guess we'll move on other stories.

962
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,140
I just want Final Fantasy six in Final Fantasy fifteen's engine.

963
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,060
I could go for that, but you know, we're getting Final Fantasy seven.

964
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,340
Yeah, I'll settle for seven, but like after we're done with this and they run out of ideas

965
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:49,380
again, which will be like five minutes later, the best six, the best Final Fantasy story

966
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,060
right now is in Final Fantasy fourteen.

967
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,980
And it's just a bummer that so many people are going to miss it because of the multiplayer

968
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,180
slash MMO slash monthly fee elements are getting bored with it.

969
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,100
And I, well, I mean, what part of the game made you bored?

970
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,860
Pretty much anything having to do with not being able to jump to the next quest because

971
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,980
of a level cap.

972
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,380
Okay.

973
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,980
That's, that's fair.

974
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,820
Um, they have an end game.

975
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,020
They have done some reduction on the experience you need.

976
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,100
So hopefully it would help, but I'm already paying for a while, so I'm not going to pay

977
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,660
for another major course with 11 was the whole level cap system.

978
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,020
Do you have to do like level breaks?

979
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,500
Do they have that system in 14?

980
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,540
Oh, thank God.

981
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,220
Well, wait, I take that back.

982
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:36,020
Um, well, it's nothing like it wasn't, I'd have to grind for days just because I would

983
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,780
not have enough experience or not be a high enough level to take my next quest.

984
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,620
Stupid.

985
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,860
Especially in the beginning, it can be.

986
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,380
And the story unfortunately doesn't get like really good until like level 45.

987
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:52,580
Well, and I mean, I've got a higher level character already, but I mean, the thing

988
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:58,340
that I really liked with what world of Warcraft did is now you've got the scaling leveling

989
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,740
and that has been working out amazingly.

990
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,740
Did they fix the old dungeons ever?

991
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,460
Cause that was the part.

992
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,420
I just walked into the one in Orgrimmar by accident and it's, it was a level 20 dungeon.

993
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,780
So, and I, um, my character is like 35 right now.

994
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,820
My, uh, night born.

995
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,180
Interesting.

996
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:21,700
So yeah, I think that if you did it in a dungeon finder, it would scale, but if you just walk

997
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,940
into it, it's, it's native level.

998
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:25,380
All right.

999
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,100
Well, let's move on to some news about Nintendo.

1000
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,980
Nintendo bringing something that, you know, a lot of other companies did a long time ago,

1001
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,580
but they're finally introducing it.

1002
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,060
And it could be interesting to see how it works out for them.

1003
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,940
This has to do with user reviews.

1004
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,420
That's right.

1005
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,620
Nintendo.com now has a user review system.

1006
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,900
So if you have ever played a Nintendo switch or a Nintendo 3DS game, and this of course

1007
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:54,660
is all going to be noted by your play history, um, you can actually go into your, my Nintendo

1008
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,500
account and you can actually find a game that you've played either on desktop or mobile.

1009
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,580
And there should be a review this game prompt, or you can actually review the game.

1010
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,060
Now, in order to actually leave a review, you have to have played the game for at least

1011
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,340
two hours.

1012
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,100
If you've played the game for two hours, you can give the game a one to five star rating,

1013
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,060
do a headline, and then fill out a review box.

1014
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:20,500
And you can use some pre-made tags, including kid appropriate, challenging online play and

1015
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,300
so forth.

1016
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,740
And then there's a spoiler box.

1017
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,180
And then you also get to identify what type of gamer you are.

1018
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,700
Are you a Nintendo fan, a core gamer, a casual gamer, and a parent?

1019
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,340
That's interesting how they have both.

1020
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,140
Because parents can't just be, you know, any of them.

1021
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,420
I'm assuming you're not limited.

1022
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,540
Oh no, it says you can't pick more than one of those.

1023
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,940
So if you're a casual gaming parent, Nintendo fan, I guess you have to pick the one you

1024
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,580
are the most.

1025
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:51,700
Anyway, reviews will be moderated, but it will not be modified, uh, just because they

1026
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,500
give a negative evaluation of a Nintendo product.

1027
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,980
Uh, it says that reviews will go live within three to seven business days, assuming it's

1028
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,700
for all ages.

1029
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,540
So I'm assuming you can't go in there and write a review that's, fuck this fucking piece

1030
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,660
of fuck garbage.

1031
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,380
You know, you can't, sorry, Loki.

1032
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:13,700
Um, anyhow, this is just interesting just because Nintendo is doing this after so long.

1033
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,780
Why are they just now adopting this?

1034
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:21,380
My thought is, is that it's because of the Switch's library, because so much of the

1035
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,220
Switch's library is online and there's so many indie titles.

1036
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,180
And I think a lot of them get lost because, you know, for all the, we, you didn't have

1037
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,900
any software talk, there's like four or five games a week coming out on Switch.

1038
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:39,060
Now, granted, most of them are online indie titles, but that doesn't mean they're bad

1039
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,300
stuff.

1040
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,380
In fact, there's a lot of really good stuff in there.

1041
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,380
I see tons of people playing that Celeste right now, which I admittedly don't know much

1042
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,660
about, but I know that's something that came out on Switch, but maybe through user

1043
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,420
reviews, I would get to hear more about it.

1044
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,860
Loki, what do you think about Nintendo rolling out user reviews?

1045
00:51:53,860 --> 00:52:01,140
This is a good thing or only worked so well in Steam and as long as they moderate it,

1046
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:06,580
you know, I think that's because people will try to abuse the system, but it couldn't

1047
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,580
hurt or at least, you know, even they have like something basic, like ratings, like one

1048
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,540
to five stars and stuff in the PlayStation Network, although it's hard to see what people's

1049
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,740
feedback is on that stuff.

1050
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,780
I think that's a good thing.

1051
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,180
Mm hmm.

1052
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:24,180
Bobby Black Wolf in chat suggests that what they're going for with the tagging is what

1053
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,340
voice are you rating that review?

1054
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,500
So you might be a casual gaming Nintendo fan parent, but they want you to focus your review

1055
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,060
on how it is for your kid since you're their parent.

1056
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,100
That's a good perspective.

1057
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,580
I hope they call that out as such in the rules, but that's a good way to figure out what tag

1058
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:44,180
would be most appropriate is what voice are you using to talk about it.

1059
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,740
So, um, yeah, pretty, pretty interesting to see Nintendo get on board with that.

1060
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:54,820
Could this be because they have closed Miiverse and maybe Miiverse was a way that you got

1061
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,500
the user experience before?

1062
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,060
I don't know, but that's one other suggestion that's out there where as to why now is the

1063
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,780
time for Nintendo reviews because Miiverse is unfortunately no more.

1064
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,540
So, all right.

1065
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,460
Well, I think we are good to move on to Dark Soccer, even though she's got Mr. Smoosh in

1066
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,020
her lap.

1067
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,460
I was giving him good scritches and he was like, oh, this is great.

1068
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,820
Yeah, he's up to no good today.

1069
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,020
He's been, now he's stepping on the Pikachu pillow over there, making his way back to

1070
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:20,500
the chair.

1071
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,660
Did you see my photobomb from the other day?

1072
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:22,900
No.

1073
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,820
I was taking a selfie and Midna's butt was in it.

1074
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,780
Oh no, I didn't see that.

1075
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,060
This cat, that's the best, you know, the best photobomb is cat butt.

1076
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,260
You didn't hear me, but Mr. Smoosh jumped up on the mixing board again.

1077
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,980
That's something he likes to do to disrupt the show.

1078
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,820
Luckily he hasn't figured out how to move the switches yet.

1079
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,900
Why are you not paying attention to the cat?

1080
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,220
Pretty much.

1081
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,140
The cat is the most important person in this room.

1082
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:41,860
Pretty much.

1083
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,580
Seriously.

1084
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:49,940
So, well, speaking of Warcraft, since I had brought up my wowing earlier, Warcraft 3,

1085
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:55,220
which is arguably the best of them, had gotten a patch.

1086
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,020
Patch 1.29 was released.

1087
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:03,540
It has some balance changes for the heroes, puts in widescreen support and updates to

1088
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,500
the map pools.

1089
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,620
I also was reading on the update that they're allowing now like a 24 player thing.

1090
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:18,900
But anyway, but the thing about this is that it seems like it's leading up to something.

1091
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:28,100
The last update that Warcraft 3 got was in 2017 when it was, you know, I guess just more

1092
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,980
fixes and everything.

1093
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:36,500
But the other thing too is that the thought is that when you install Warcraft 3, this

1094
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:43,380
time, and this is actually pointed out by r__eazy on the World of Warcraft subreddit,

1095
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:50,100
that when you install it, it opens a new launcher that's similar to the battle.net launcher.

1096
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,900
And it's been replicated by other places by installing Warcraft 3, the Frozen Throne.

1097
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:05,780
And the launcher was previously used to update the game while the installer was still legacy.

1098
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:10,260
So what's going on right now is the theory is that this is going to lead to a Warcraft

1099
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,220
3 remaster, kind of like how the Starcraft remaster went last year, which would be nice

1100
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,540
because I mean, Warcraft 3 is actually still a really solid game.

1101
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:23,300
I mean, yeah, it's kind of similar to Starcraft in the fact that people are still playing

1102
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:23,700
it.

1103
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,340
Yeah.

1104
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:30,100
Well, on top of that, too, I mean, if you're, you know, a lore whore, you know, it's basically

1105
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,700
everything that led up to the start of World of Warcraft.

1106
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:38,340
You know, you had the whole, you know, the Frozen Throne itself was the whole, you know,

1107
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,940
Lich King story and all that.

1108
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,540
So it's pretty, pretty crazy.

1109
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:53,380
But yeah, there is a Warcraft 3 Invitational Tournament also to be held on February, tomorrow.

1110
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,660
Sorry, not tomorrow, February 27th and 28th.

1111
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,860
So that's just next week.

1112
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:06,900
That will be hosted by the people from Back to Warcraft and it's going to be on Twitch.

1113
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:12,180
It includes free for all, four versus four, friendly competitions, stuff like that.

1114
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,100
So who knows?

1115
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:19,780
I have the theory that they're going to make the announcement at this thing, so it'll be

1116
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,260
pretty nice.

1117
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,860
But I wonder if they're, you know, if it's that they're going to charge again for a new

1118
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:29,140
version of Warcraft 3, or if they'll like have some deal that if you launch it through

1119
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,660
your original disc, you get like a special something or.

1120
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,780
Yeah, I'm trying to think of how they did the Starcraft remaster.

1121
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,980
Well, ultimately with the Starcraft remaster, they never got rid of the old version.

1122
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,540
So the old version, in fact, became free.

1123
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,740
And I think it was to drum up interest in the remaster, which I think they were charging

1124
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,780
15 bucks for.

1125
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,660
It's not terrible.

1126
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,300
It's not terrible.

1127
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,740
It's enough to pay the artists back, but they didn't necessarily have to reinvent the game.

1128
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,540
I would just kind of hope, though, that they'd have like some sort of legacy adoption or

1129
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,180
something like, yeah, you have the old, you know, who has discs anymore?

1130
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,220
You know, if they catch like.

1131
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,660
Was it all serial keys too?

1132
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,660
Like you have the serial key on your account?

1133
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:10,100
Like, so if you have like the serial for having purchased, you know, the game, then maybe

1134
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:15,060
you get like some bonus thing for like a legacy account or something.

1135
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:19,940
Let us not forget Warcraft 3 is where basically MOBAs were born, right?

1136
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,460
You know, Dota 2 was a mod of Warcraft 3.

1137
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,820
Dota is 2 because Dota was a mod of Warcraft 3.

1138
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,540
That's been often.

1139
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:31,300
And that's where you now you have Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends and all this

1140
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,180
really have Warcraft 3 at its core to thank.

1141
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:34,980
So kind of neat.

1142
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,900
And then on top of it, I mean, you know, again, great stories.

1143
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:44,740
And it's where I guess the for the people who play WoW today who maybe not have played

1144
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,300
that, that's where these big characters come from.

1145
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,100
I mean, sure.

1146
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,580
I would say specifically most of the big names come from Warcraft 3.

1147
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,540
A few from 2.

1148
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:56,180
Like I think Deathwing was the plot of 2, wasn't it?

1149
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,660
Well, yeah.

1150
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,980
But I mean, but you know, and what is old is new again.

1151
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,460
And who doesn't who doesn't want to move the peons around?

1152
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,100
Zug, zug.

1153
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:05,940
Jobs complete.

1154
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:11,220
And I love I was actually just doing because the whole thing I like about the whole level

1155
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:16,180
scaling right now in World of Warcraft is that I've gone back and do content from.

1156
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,900
Cataclysm that I'd never done because I didn't play Horde at the time.

1157
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,460
All right.

1158
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:25,940
So but I love like how it's like the same, you know, kind of peon voices.

1159
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,180
Yeah.

1160
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:26,660
Yeah.

1161
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,060
I think they like totally lifted it from the original game.

1162
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,340
I think it's just so funny.

1163
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:30,580
Yeah.

1164
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,220
Super fun.

1165
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:31,540
Yeah.

1166
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,140
So that's a Warcraft 3.

1167
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:33,620
Who knows?

1168
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,060
We'll we'll find out this week.

1169
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,540
Well, let's move on.

1170
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,060
Loki was something else.

1171
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,380
Yes.

1172
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,740
So let's talk a little bit about that brand new mode that they have in Mario Odyssey.

1173
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,900
Remember, they teased it a little bit where you hide balloons and find balloons and stuff

1174
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,400
like that.

1175
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:54,100
So like all good things, people have to fuck with it.

1176
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:01,140
And so we're getting issues where people are actually taking the balloons and hiding them

1177
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:08,740
in places that are very hard to get to or are out of bounds in the map, because of course

1178
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,220
they are.

1179
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:14,500
So there's people glitching through walls and stuff and hiding them within buildings

1180
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,700
and stuff like that.

1181
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:17,780
It's kind of funny.

1182
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:25,300
You know, hopefully Nintendo patches that out, but it's it's interesting to see that

1183
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,620
it might be a little bit frustrating to get some of these balloons because they are in

1184
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,460
places that you can't really get to.

1185
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:37,700
Yeah, I hear a not a lot of people are a big fan of this new patch for Mario Odyssey, but

1186
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,260
I mean, it's nice that they kind of did something new that's free.

1187
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:44,180
But I guess this was a little maybe a little rough around the edges, it sounds like.

1188
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:50,580
Yeah, especially if you're going to play with people that are going to put the balloons

1189
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,940
in not so easy places.

1190
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:52,980
Yeah.

1191
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,780
All right.

1192
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,060
Well, another game that I think some folks are looking forward to on the Switch is the

1193
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,900
Mega Man Legacy Collection.

1194
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,380
Now, Mega Man Legacy Collection, of course, this already released on PlayStation 4 and

1195
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,380
Xbox One, I think the PC as well.

1196
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,340
But that doesn't stop people from wanting to buy it again, especially when you can have

1197
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,460
it on the go.

1198
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:12,740
And maybe some people never got it the first time around because Switch is your primary

1199
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,460
console.

1200
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:19,140
So it was confirmed that Mega Man Collection 1 plus 2 is going to be released for the Nintendo

1201
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:19,460
Switch.

1202
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,820
So, yes, it is being bundled together that will have Amiibo support for the Mega Man

1203
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,300
Amiibo.

1204
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,060
I think it just unlocks some things.

1205
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:31,940
And apparently the way it works is that you will actually be purchasing apparently Mega

1206
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:38,820
Man Legacy Collection 1 is on the cartridge, but then you get a DLC code for Mega Man Legacy

1207
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,860
Collection 2.

1208
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:43,940
It's very, very similar to what they just did with Bayonetta 2, having the digital code

1209
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,860
for Bayonetta 1, except it's the other way around.

1210
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,780
So that's pretty cool.

1211
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,060
So you can check that out.

1212
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,620
And what was the release date on this?

1213
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,180
Release date is May 22nd.

1214
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:01,380
You can buy the two games together for $39.99 retail.

1215
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:08,980
Or you can get them DLC $14.99 for Mega Man Legacy Collection and $19.99 for Mega Man

1216
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,180
Legacy Collection 2.

1217
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,860
That's interesting because it's actually cheaper to buy them digitally than to buy the

1218
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:14,420
cartridge.

1219
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:20,020
But I guess that's because of, A, the cost of the cartridge and, oh, maybe that exclusive

1220
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:24,820
Mega Man 30th anniversary cleaning cloth that comes with it.

1221
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:25,380
Oh, geez.

1222
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,620
That is interesting, though, that you're really seeing a direct, like, nope, going to be

1223
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,540
cheaper to buy this one digitally.

1224
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:33,860
So interesting how they're kind of doing that.

1225
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,700
But, yeah, we'll see how that works out.

1226
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,180
I'm starting to have storage issues on my Switch.

1227
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:43,140
I had to archive so much stuff in order to be able to fit Bayonetta and Pac-Man.

1228
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,660
Like, I had to go...

1229
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,460
Now, granted, the stuff I was able to archive was really easy.

1230
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,020
Like, I archived the old Splatoon demos and stuff.

1231
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,580
But still, I mean, it was weird that I was running out of space.

1232
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,860
I think I actually did have to move, like, something I'd actually been playing a little

1233
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,260
bit, but just hadn't touched in a few months.

1234
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,260
So I might need to buy more memory for my Switch.

1235
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,140
Yikes.

1236
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:08,500
By the way, Mega Man fans, there are some new Mega Man toys that we're showing off at

1237
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,020
the New York Toy Fair.

1238
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:15,940
There are some new 66-action minifigures for Super Mega Man, Star Force Mega Man, Cut Man,

1239
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,820
and Vile.

1240
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,100
$8 each for those.

1241
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,580
You can actually get some Ride Armors.

1242
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,700
X and Vile Ride Armors will be $50 each.

1243
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,180
And that was all, again, being shown at the New York Toy Fair.

1244
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,540
So those of you guys that really like to collect can check that out.

1245
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:30,900
I like the Cut Man figure.

1246
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,100
That's kind of a deep cut, too, because not everybody remembers the bosses from the very

1247
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:34,900
first game.

1248
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,780
But I certainly remember that stage and what a pain in the ass it was to beat.

1249
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,740
Because that game was hard.

1250
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,340
The original Mega Man was hard.

1251
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,900
I mean, the other ones were hard, too, but they did kind of dumb down the second game

1252
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,420
a little bit when they released it here, as opposed to Japan.

1253
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:50,900
But the first game-

1254
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,740
I didn't think the first one was that hard.

1255
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,900
It was kind of hard.

1256
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,420
Like, try to go back and play it now.

1257
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,860
Well, I have not too long ago.

1258
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:04,260
Like, 12-year-old you versus now you is going to be very different.

1259
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:09,060
Keep in mind, I didn't beat the first Mega Man until I was 18.

1260
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,560
Huh.

1261
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,700
So, I started with Mega Man 2.

1262
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,200
Okay.

1263
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:15,940
So, anyway.

1264
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:16,900
Fair enough, fair enough.

1265
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,700
What do you have for us, Dark Soccer, before we get to the classic game of the week?

1266
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,740
More Blizzard stuff.

1267
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:25,620
There is a rumor, and you know how we are about rumors.

1268
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:29,460
So rumors, bolded, underlined, slow news week, salt.

1269
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,540
It's in italics.

1270
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:31,860
All of it.

1271
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:32,820
With quotes.

1272
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:33,320
Yes.

1273
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,180
That Blizzard is working on Diablo 3 for Switch.

1274
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:43,460
Which Diablo, who knows.

1275
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,340
It got better, didn't it?

1276
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:45,300
It did.

1277
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,580
Diablo 3 is a lot of fun.

1278
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:47,380
It would be-

1279
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,180
Oh, go ahead.

1280
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:52,340
Well, just that they want to implement local play with multiple Switches.

1281
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,300
So you could have the local co-op on-

1282
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,780
I guess you could just play it on the handheld.

1283
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:04,420
What's kind of rad about this, I'm of two mindsets, because there's part of me that

1284
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:09,380
says Diablo 3 is like- how old is Diablo 3 at this point?

1285
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:09,880
At least-

1286
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,220
Five years?

1287
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,020
Five years old?

1288
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:12,740
Six years old, maybe?

1289
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:18,180
Diablo 3 was- you got it for- it was like a thing during Cataclysm.

1290
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:19,860
I want to say it came out almost like 2012.

1291
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,340
I think it was coming up on six years old pretty soon.

1292
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:25,060
I thought it came out right after Cataclysm.

1293
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,060
Well, anyway, regardless, it's kind of an older game.

1294
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:31,380
Now, to be fair, so is Skyrim, and Skyrim's been doing very well on the Switch, and people

1295
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,660
are really excited about that.

1296
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,500
Here's what I think is neat about Diablo 3.

1297
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:40,900
What the PlayStation and the Xbox can't do is that if you're playing multiplayer in the

1298
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:46,180
same room, you have to basically share the loot drops, and you can't run off the screen

1299
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,500
because you only have one TV, right?

1300
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,700
So you can't run off the screen.

1301
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:57,220
If Diablo 3 launches for the Switch, and you are not beholden to be online all the time,

1302
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:01,060
which I wouldn't think you would be because the Switch is a portable system, and Diablo

1303
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:05,220
dropped that requirement with the console games, not the PC version.

1304
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,580
PC is still always online.

1305
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:13,540
But my point is, Diablo 3 on the Switch is going to be the closest thing to the LAN experience

1306
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:18,820
from the old Diablo days than even necessarily the PC versions which are always online.

1307
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:19,460
Think about that.

1308
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:23,140
The Switch is now, if you have Diablo 3 on the Switch, it's basically going to be a LAN

1309
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,180
game, right?

1310
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,940
And you have your own thing going on, and so do your friends, and you don't have to

1311
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,260
be confined in the same part of the level.

1312
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,300
That's kind of rad.

1313
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:41,140
So, but I just, I wish it was Diablo 4, or a new Diablo expansion at least for 3, because

1314
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,140
the story kind of didn't end.

1315
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:48,020
They left it wide open for more, so I kind of wish it was a new Diablo thing.

1316
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:51,700
But I really like the idea of this game on Switch.

1317
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,260
I think it could be a very good console game.

1318
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,420
Atdeftinchat at live.vognetwork.com says,

1319
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:01,540
I want Overwatch on Switch, dammit.

1320
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,740
I almost said over swatch.

1321
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,380
Overwatch on Switch, dammit.

1322
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:12,100
I mean, it makes a lot of sense if it can handle the graphics, which, you know, Overwatch

1323
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:16,580
can be played on a pretty, you know, a PC that's a few years old.

1324
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:19,780
I mean, it's gonna take some, you know, it's not gonna look as good as it does, you know,

1325
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:25,380
4K on, you know, a PC and some things, but, you know, you can run it.

1326
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:30,340
But I think the only problem with Overwatch is that a game like that kind of always has

1327
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:35,540
to be online, so you can't really have the portable element.

1328
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:42,980
However, it would be pretty fucking cool if you could, like, take a Switch to a convention

1329
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,980
and just do, like, a local area network Overwatch game that isn't ranked or anything.

1330
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,260
You don't get points, it doesn't rank.

1331
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:51,940
Just a, just a brawl that you could do offline with friends.

1332
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,300
That would be kind of rad.

1333
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,140
So, I'd like to see it.

1334
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,200
We'll see.

1335
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:57,800
Anyway.

1336
01:06:58,580 --> 01:06:59,080
All right.

1337
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,180
Anything else with the Diablo story?

1338
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:06,260
I didn't want to miss anything, but I know it is a rumor, so there's probably not a lot

1339
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:06,760
else to say.

1340
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,820
All right, let's move on then.

1341
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,460
Loki, just a few more stories for our classic game of the week.

1342
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,180
All right.

1343
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:16,580
And so, this used to be a game I played quite a bit, Star Control.

1344
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:24,340
And as you remember, there was a lawsuit between the developers and Stardock as to who has

1345
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,260
the rights to the game and that type of thing.

1346
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,620
So, there's a little bit more to go along with this.

1347
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:37,300
So, apparently now, the developers are filing a counterclaim against Stardock, who had originally

1348
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:46,020
filed the claim, and basically saying that, you know, they filed, Stardock had filed a

1349
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:52,020
complaint in federal court against us, personally alleging, among other things, that we are

1350
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,500
not actually the creators of Star Control.

1351
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,940
This is news to us.

1352
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:04,420
Are we clones of the original Fred and Paul, just now learning of our squelchy vat birth?

1353
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:07,540
Unfortunately, Stardock's complaint is not a prank.

1354
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:13,060
So, today we took an action, filed a response in federal court, answering Stardock's false

1355
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:13,540
claims.

1356
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:18,820
Of course, we also filed a counterclaim against Stardock as the original Fred and Paul would

1357
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,300
have wanted.

1358
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:24,180
So, I guess they're alleging that they're not the people that they say they are.

1359
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,540
What a mess this whole situation is.

1360
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:32,100
It is, and I would really like a new Star Control game, but, you know, we'll see.

1361
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:37,540
First, we have to, like, figure out copyright law and trademark law.

1362
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,260
There's something that needs to be reformed, man.

1363
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:41,540
It's that.

1364
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,300
All right.

1365
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:49,380
Well, something that's getting reformed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for a new generation,

1366
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,700
I suppose, is Burnout Paradise.

1367
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,180
That's right.

1368
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,060
It has been confirmed.

1369
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:56,820
We had a rumor about this previously, but it was confirmed this week that a remaster

1370
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:59,140
will be arriving on March 16th.

1371
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,820
It will set you back 40 bucks.

1372
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,980
It will run in 4K.

1373
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,260
That's pretty awesome.

1374
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:08,180
60 frames a second, and of course, online mode is going to be there.

1375
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:15,140
When you buy the game for 40 bucks, all 150 cars, all eight expansion packs, including

1376
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:21,140
Big Surf Island, it will run in 1080p on PlayStation 4 and Xbox hardware, and apparently,

1377
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:26,740
4K resolution and 60 frames a second on the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X.

1378
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,220
I don't know how they're going to do that on the PlayStation 4 Pro.

1379
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:34,260
It was really intended for gaming at 4K, but that'll be impressive if they do it.

1380
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,020
PlayStation 4 Pro?

1381
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:36,340
Yeah.

1382
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,140
That's what they're saying.

1383
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,820
They could do 4K in Pro.

1384
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,740
In 60 frames a second?

1385
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,220
Probably.

1386
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:41,540
Wow.

1387
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:41,940
All right.

1388
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:42,900
That's that's great.

1389
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,700
Old game.

1390
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,300
I mean, all right.

1391
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,100
Yeah, no.

1392
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,060
Hey, I'm all for it.

1393
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,100
I'm down.

1394
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,460
That's day one for me.

1395
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,020
Yeah.

1396
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,780
And what's also really cool about it.

1397
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:56,100
They did confirm, even though there was a screenshot out there that had an in-game

1398
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,060
purchases optional thing, they did confirm on Twitter.

1399
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,660
There are no microtransactions.

1400
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,580
There's no additional paid for content.

1401
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,100
So pitchforks down.

1402
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,420
So because all of that old stuff is being included.

1403
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:11,380
Also, the game's soundtrack is returning in its entirety.

1404
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,260
Yes.

1405
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:18,660
So any of the licenses you were worried about from before, you will get the whole welcome.

1406
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,580
No, is it Take Me Down Paradise City?

1407
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:21,060
Has to be.

1408
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,580
Was the intro song to that game?

1409
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:22,900
Yeah.

1410
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,780
Take me down to the paradise city.

1411
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,820
That you're going to get all that.

1412
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:27,860
Nice.

1413
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,820
Excellent impression.

1414
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,300
Thank you.

1415
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,020
Yeah.

1416
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,700
Now you just got to be more of an asshole.

1417
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,660
He's just screaming in pain.

1418
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:38,580
Honestly, for the remastering, it doesn't all it looks less bloomy.

1419
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,420
I don't know that anyone can be as big of an asshole as Axl Rose.

1420
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,220
Couldn't tell you which one is the new version or not.

1421
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,660
Yeah, I'm excited.

1422
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:49,860
Bobby Blackwell says people are excited that the Avril song is in it.

1423
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:50,900
Well, why shouldn't they be?

1424
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,860
Which Avril song was in it?

1425
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,340
I forget.

1426
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,020
Is it complicated or is it one of the other ones?

1427
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,060
Sk8r Boi?

1428
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,260
Which girlfriend?

1429
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:03,700
Hey, that song is so bad, but I love it.

1430
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,100
All right.

1431
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,940
So this is coming out on its PlayStation 4 and Xbox.

1432
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:10,820
What about PC?

1433
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:12,020
Are they doing a PC version?

1434
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:12,500
I don't know.

1435
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,100
I have the original PC one.

1436
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,340
I don't know if I saw PC in the list.

1437
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,420
Let me look again at the list that I'm looking at here.

1438
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:24,260
They're just saying PlayStation 4 and Xbox one is where you can order it right now.

1439
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,100
So not seeing anything on PC.

1440
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,780
I bet that comes later.

1441
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:28,900
I bet they're going to go.

1442
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:29,400
Hold on.

1443
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:30,340
Sorry.

1444
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,380
I bet they're going to go Grand Theft Auto style with it and do the PC version later.

1445
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,940
Yeah, because that'd be really nice.

1446
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:40,340
Act F in chat actually confirms PC is coming.

1447
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,580
But later, if I recall correctly.

1448
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,100
So those look nice.

1449
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,300
I do want it.

1450
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,260
I don't want it.

1451
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:46,660
All right.

1452
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:53,140
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1453
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,820
use the passphrase page.

1454
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,460
Well, let's take a trip down memory lane.

1455
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,980
Let's go back even further.

1456
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:01,460
You know, why stop at like 10 years of Burnout Paradise?

1457
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:06,580
And we can go back like 30 years with the classic game of the week.

1458
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:12,980
Every week, Dark Sakura picks a classic game from the gaming vault and says, hey, hey,

1459
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:15,300
hey, you, you go and play this video game.

1460
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:21,220
Dark Sakura on this very special episode.

1461
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,420
What did you pick as the classic game of the week?

1462
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,940
I picked 720 degrees.

1463
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,340
I see what you did there.

1464
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,260
Because of reasons.

1465
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:31,700
It's episode 720.

1466
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,020
So why not pick 720?

1467
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:34,520
Right.

1468
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:39,140
So it came from 1986.

1469
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,620
It's a skateboarding game done by Atari Games.

1470
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,580
It has to keep the game going.

1471
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,180
You have to keep scoring points.

1472
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:53,060
So as a little bit of a timer on it as well.

1473
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:57,460
So that's how you get it to take more of your money.

1474
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:57,960
Right.

1475
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:08,260
But anyway, you are playing as a skateboarder going around a middle class neighborhood.

1476
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,620
You have to do tricks.

1477
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:14,980
You do jumps and you have to acquire enough points to go compete at a skate park.

1478
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,940
I'll read this story.

1479
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:23,460
It's just you, your trusty skateboard and a hundred bucks as you skate, jump, slide,

1480
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:28,820
spin and move through four levels of difficulty, picking up loose cash, earning money through

1481
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,740
events and finally earning a ticket to one of the big skate parks.

1482
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:38,180
If you're lucky, you'll get to buy some rad equipment to make you the coolest skateboarder

1483
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:38,820
alive.

1484
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:45,620
So you start off with a number of tickets that get you admission to one of four skate parks

1485
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,700
or the events in Skate City.

1486
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:55,380
And so your ticket is used at that point and you go and you do tricks.

1487
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:03,780
But, you know, if you're not in an event, you see a countdown bar that starts sending

1488
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:07,220
bees after you with the word skate or die.

1489
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,060
Fuck those fucking bees.

1490
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:09,700
Right.

1491
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,500
Fucking bees.

1492
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,860
Why does it always have to be bees?

1493
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:18,100
But once the bees arrive, you have a very small amount of time not to get to the park.

1494
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,900
Not the bees.

1495
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:26,180
I remember watching the first X-Files movie and we wouldn't say the future is out.

1496
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,300
They would say the bees are out there.

1497
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:33,700
But anyway, you have to keep doing stunts and, you know, bees.

1498
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:41,380
So you have your ramp, you have downhill, you have a slalom and you have jump.

1499
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:46,340
So those are your four events.

1500
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:53,060
And then you have different power ups that you can buy starting from $25 going up to

1501
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,260
$250.

1502
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,540
So you get shoes for higher jumps and faster acceleration.

1503
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:02,500
You get a board for higher speed, pads for quicker recovery from wiping out and a helmet

1504
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,980
so you can be more aggressive.

1505
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:09,940
So you spin faster to get that famed 720 degree jump.

1506
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:16,020
The cabinet, I always thought the cabinet was cool because the speakers were put on

1507
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:21,700
top of it kind of like a boombox, you know, so it just kind of fit that whole theme.

1508
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:28,020
And it was one of those large ones that they use for Paperboy, the large monitors.

1509
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:35,380
Your joystick was a circle, a circular motion instead of just your standard, you know,

1510
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,020
regular D-pad style.

1511
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:43,380
And then you had two other buttons, one for kicking, you know, to push off instead.

1512
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,740
And then you're the one for jumping.

1513
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:50,420
So it was a great popular game.

1514
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,940
It did have many ports.

1515
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,420
There was Commodore 64, got two ports of it in 1987.

1516
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:01,380
The Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum came out in 1988.

1517
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:05,940
NES version came out in 1989, Game Boy Color in 1999.

1518
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:09,140
There's an unreleased port for Atari Lynx.

1519
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,540
Unfortunately, the bees got to it.

1520
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:14,580
Yeah, the bees got it.

1521
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:15,220
It didn't skate.

1522
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:15,860
It just died.

1523
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:26,020
And there was on side two of the game cassette, I guess this one would be for one of the other

1524
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,060
computer versions.

1525
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,380
I had the soundtrack from the original game on it.

1526
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:34,980
There are emulated versions included in Midway Arcade Treasures, Midway Arcade Origins,

1527
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,780
and Lego Dimensions in 2015.

1528
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:47,460
But also that phrase, Skate or Die, was used to inspire another game, EA's Skate or Die,

1529
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,180
which spawned a sequel called Ski or Die.

1530
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,660
And there you go.

1531
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,340
Which is also known as Ski Free.

1532
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:56,900
Is it really?

1533
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,420
If I was skiing, it would just be die.

1534
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:01,380
No, because, you know, the bomb little snowman would come after you.

1535
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,260
Oh, Jesus.

1536
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:02,820
That's right.

1537
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,700
That's right.

1538
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,420
All right.

1539
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,100
I didn't play Ski or Die, really.

1540
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,380
I played Skate or Die.

1541
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:10,740
I feel like there was a Skate or Die 2 at some point.

1542
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:11,300
There was.

1543
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,500
There was Skate or Die 2.

1544
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,780
But these games are very different.

1545
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,100
It's very important with 720 and Skate or Die.

1546
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:16,660
Very different.

1547
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,700
Skate or Die was fun.

1548
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,980
I really should put it.

1549
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,300
I like 720 a lot.

1550
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,220
I think I like 720 more as a game.

1551
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,900
But the problem is you would never get more than, like, two minutes before the fucking

1552
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,300
bees killed you and you had to put in another quarter.

1553
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,620
Like, it's very hard to be good at that game.

1554
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,500
Even, like, the Nintendo version was very hard.

1555
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:39,300
Yeah, I was not a fan of really any of the skateboarding games.

1556
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,500
I really didn't like Skate or Die.

1557
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,620
I didn't really care.

1558
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:47,380
I mean, 720 I probably played a bit more because we had one at my arcade, but I don't know

1559
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:47,620
why.

1560
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,140
I mean, a lot of people would play them.

1561
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:54,820
A lot of people would just be all into them, but it was never really my Cup of Joe.

1562
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:55,700
That's all right.

1563
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,180
It happens.

1564
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,820
You know what game I also didn't care for?

1565
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,100
California games.

1566
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,140
Not very good.

1567
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:07,140
California games was a spinoff of summer games and winter games and Epics like Olympics.

1568
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:11,220
But I played it on Lynx and it just wasn't all that great.

1569
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:13,700
Well, our trip spent playing that game on Lynx.

1570
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:17,140
I bet the Lynx port wasn't as good as it probably was.

1571
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:20,660
It was the surfing part just I hated.

1572
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:21,860
Oh, I love the surfing.

1573
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,700
I don't remember California games.

1574
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,420
And then it had the town and country gorilla.

1575
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:27,380
Wasn't it the gorilla?

1576
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,540
The mascot for the TNC?

1577
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,540
Uh, that was surf and skate.

1578
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,660
I turned off 720 music because clearly we've gone tangent.

1579
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:38,420
Yeah, I remember like they had BMX, so that was for like downhill BMX.

1580
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,260
And so that was cool.

1581
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:45,140
And then they had surfing, hacky sack, TNC, surf and skate, which wasn't great.

1582
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:51,940
I might be getting California games and TNC, surf and skate mixed up.

1583
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:56,900
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says I have the VCR California games board game.

1584
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,340
I didn't even know they made that.

1585
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,020
That's pretty awesome.

1586
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:00,980
Does that even work?

1587
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,260
I don't think somebody took the license.

1588
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:03,220
You played hacky sack.

1589
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,980
Well, two points.

1590
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,580
No, cause it's a VCR game.

1591
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,780
So you probably had to watch people playing the sports and then

1592
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:12,740
you probably something to do with those VCR games.

1593
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,820
No, the clue VCR game was bomb.

1594
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:19,460
The clue VCR game was so awesome.

1595
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,980
And I know I've talked about this on the show before because the first magfest I went to,

1596
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:27,060
they screened some documentary about the clue VCR game.

1597
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:30,020
And like the fact that, you know, all the people, all the act, all the

1598
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:34,740
bad actors and actresses in that, and they weren't really bad.

1599
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:40,020
They were all like theater people up in the Northeast that, that just did this on a whim.

1600
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:45,780
The only mixed game like that, that I've played was a quest for the rings on the Odyssey too.

1601
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,700
And then we just never played the board game part of it.

1602
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,220
We just played the game.

1603
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:55,540
What was the one, what was the VCR game where like it would be silent the whole time.

1604
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:58,740
And then all of a sudden this like monster would come up on the screen and go,

1605
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,660
maggot, maggot.

1606
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:04,980
There was, I'm not somebody who knows VCR games.

1607
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,340
Bobby's got to know this game.

1608
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:10,100
It was some like scary VCR game and it was ridiculous.

1609
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:10,900
I wouldn't play it.

1610
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,900
It was ridiculous.

1611
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:15,460
Is it a nightmare?

1612
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,580
That sounds right.

1613
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:17,140
Nightmare.

1614
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,100
I think it might've been that.

1615
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:24,820
Oh, Bobby, Bobby has the receipts with a YouTube.

1616
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,500
That's probably, that's yucky.

1617
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,460
I think that's probably it.

1618
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:27,860
Let me see.

1619
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:28,580
Wait, hold on.

1620
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,300
I've got it.

1621
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,500
Usually I don't click on YouTube links randomly, but I trust Bobby.

1622
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,980
Which has nightmare game video.

1623
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,980
Oh, let's see.

1624
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:39,300
Hold on.

1625
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,020
Let me see if I can.

1626
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:41,060
Okay.

1627
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:44,260
So here's, here's one of his little taunts coming up here.

1628
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,060
Who's standing next?

1629
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,260
Who is just about to roll the dice?

1630
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,820
If you fail to answer.

1631
01:20:58,820 --> 01:20:59,140
Yes.

1632
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,420
My gatekeeping time.

1633
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:05,140
You must roll time before you can play again.

1634
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,580
You must run a six before you can play again.

1635
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:08,820
All right.

1636
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:12,660
Anyway, I'm getting up.

1637
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:17,380
We need to remake nightmare using Loki.

1638
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:23,220
Hey, all right.

1639
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,540
We're going to take a break when we come back.

1640
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,940
Plenty more of orange launch radio to come, including rapid

1641
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:32,100
fire news, release dates, some emails, and, uh, your calls

1642
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,620
at orange lounge radio.

1643
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:35,460
All one word on Skype.

1644
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:36,100
Don't go anywhere.

1645
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,740
We'll be back after this quick break with more of orange

1646
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:39,700
lounge radio.

1647
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:45,940
Welcome back, everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight,

1648
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:51,140
February the 25th episode number 720 of our show, a very

1649
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:54,020
appropriate choice for our classic game of the week.

1650
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,540
Just before we took that break.

1651
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:58,900
And now we're back to get into some rapid fire news.

1652
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,540
Loki, why don't you start us off getting some rapid fire

1653
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:01,940
news?

1654
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:05,140
Yeah, we got more video game movie news.

1655
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:08,260
Yeah, we got more video game movie news.

1656
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:13,300
So they're apparently going to make Sonic the Hedgehog, the

1657
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:18,900
movie confirmed to be in production with Paramount and

1658
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,940
supposed to be coming out in November 2019 because the

1659
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:25,140
minute they heard that a Mario movie was happening, somebody

1660
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:28,420
had to make a fucking Sonic movie and his shitty friends

1661
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,620
better stay away from it.

1662
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:30,660
Who's making it?

1663
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,660
Paramount Paramount.

1664
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:33,140
Who's there?

1665
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:34,340
What anime is the anime?

1666
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,580
My friend calls them poop amount.

1667
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:37,780
It better be animated.

1668
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:42,260
I don't know who they're if it's a live action star, if it's

1669
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:46,820
a live action Sonic movie starring David Vito as Sonic.

1670
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:47,380
Let's hope.

1671
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:48,420
Oh, my God.

1672
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,700
Starring, you know.

1673
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:54,500
Yeah, Ron Jeremy is Sonic the Hedgehog.

1674
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:56,340
I'd love that.

1675
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:01,860
Um, yes, apparently it's going to be directed by Jake Fowler

1676
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:06,980
who apparently had an Academy Award for his work on the

1677
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:12,980
animated show Short Gopher Broke and Tim Miller, who was

1678
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,260
the director of Deadpool.

1679
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:17,540
Another I guess he owned.

1680
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:20,980
He's the owner of an animation and CG production company

1681
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,340
called Blur Studios.

1682
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:23,780
I don't know if they're going to be the ones that are

1683
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,940
actually doing it, but yes, it'll be a mix.

1684
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:27,220
Oh, no.

1685
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:35,460
So it's scheduled to come out November 15, 2019 is a mix of

1686
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,220
live action in CGI.

1687
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,780
Oh, no, no.

1688
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:48,100
Oh, yes, it's going to have Sonic in the real world alongside

1689
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:48,900
humans.

1690
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,780
Oh, God, like Sonic Adventure.

1691
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,460
So this is already terrible.

1692
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,740
This is already terrible.

1693
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,220
I don't know.

1694
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:00,020
It could have the whole Roger Rabbit vibe to it.

1695
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:06,660
Because that works so well for Peter Rabbit, the Smurfs, the

1696
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:10,420
Chipmunks, Sonic 2006, the next Chipmunks movie, probably

1697
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,980
another Chipmunks movie, another Smurfs movie.

1698
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:15,940
Um, Woody Woodpecker.

1699
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,020
Those have all been smashing successes.

1700
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:20,740
Hard pass.

1701
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:28,660
So look forward to that in theaters next year, you know, or

1702
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:32,660
not, because, you know, what am I judging?

1703
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:36,260
Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about games of gold.

1704
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:39,940
So Microsoft has announced what the next lineup for games

1705
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:43,540
of gold is going to be starting March 1st on Xbox one, you're

1706
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:46,340
going to get trials of the blood dragon, and that's going

1707
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,540
to run for the entire month.

1708
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,300
And then for the second half of the month, you're also going

1709
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:53,620
to get, um, or I should say from March 16th to April 15th,

1710
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:54,180
super hot.

1711
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:59,940
And then on Xbox 360 or the compatible games with Xbox one,

1712
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,980
you're going to get brave the video game, you know, because

1713
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,020
that movie tie in games, totally current.

1714
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:09,060
And then how many years ago did that movie come out and then

1715
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:10,340
quantum conundrum.

1716
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:14,180
And that'll be the second half of March, March 16th through

1717
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,900
the 31st, honestly, having played super hot and super

1718
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:19,460
awesome trials of the blood dragons kind of, eh, it's all

1719
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:19,860
right.

1720
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,580
It's a trials game.

1721
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,540
Trials games are all right.

1722
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:23,540
All right.

1723
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,180
Check this out.

1724
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:24,820
If you have gold.

1725
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:29,140
Well, um, you know, once something is on the internet, it

1726
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,580
doesn't really go away.

1727
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:35,380
That's because of an Instagram post that actress Emily O'Brien

1728
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:39,140
made that said, quote, honored to be working aside these two

1729
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:43,220
fine lads on Hideo Kojima's new project, death stranding.

1730
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:44,500
I'm a lucky gal.

1731
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,140
And it was a poster that had Norman Reedus, which we already

1732
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:50,260
know is in the movie, Emily O'Brien, which we didn't know

1733
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,380
in the movie in the game.

1734
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,180
Sorry.

1735
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:52,820
I thought poster.

1736
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:55,940
My head immediately went to movie Emily O'Brien, which we

1737
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:58,180
didn't know is in the game, but we do now.

1738
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,100
And Troy Baker.

1739
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,420
Well, then that's an instant purchase because I buy all the

1740
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,700
games of Troy Baker in it.

1741
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,180
What game isn't Troy Baker in these days?

1742
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,860
Sonic the Hedgehog.

1743
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:09,700
Now, now.

1744
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,940
So confirmed, I suppose, thanks to Instagram.

1745
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,620
Because, you know, even though she deleted the post, she

1746
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,340
probably feels terrible.

1747
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:19,060
But the reality is once it's out there, it's out there.

1748
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:22,500
So it's confirmed that Emily O'Brien, Troy Baker in the game

1749
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,740
as well, of course, Mads Mikkelsen, which we know about

1750
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:30,020
before, and Guillermo del Toro as an actor, very, very, very

1751
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:33,860
distinctly, possibly a best director, Oscar winning actor.

1752
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,340
And the races show him in the leads.

1753
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,340
I did love shape.

1754
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:38,740
I see.

1755
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,020
I want to go so good.

1756
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:42,660
I know I want to go like I'm rooting for Greta Gerwig, but

1757
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,180
can I be mad if he wins?

1758
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,300
I really can't.

1759
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,460
Like that's the thing about the Oscars and why I don't like

1760
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,060
the huge race that it turns into.

1761
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:52,420
Like there's so many good people that, you know, and good

1762
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,820
movies like out of the movies I've seen that have been

1763
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:55,220
nominated.

1764
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,020
None of them were bad.

1765
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:01,700
So yeah, I wouldn't be mad if he won because that movie was

1766
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,060
amazing and deserves it.

1767
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:06,980
I mean, I would love for Greta Gerwig to win for the women

1768
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:09,940
power and, you know, seeing more women win those awards.

1769
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:14,420
But, you know, he made a hell of a movie.

1770
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,300
It's going to be hard.

1771
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,300
So, but I'll be happy if either one win.

1772
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:17,540
Yeah.

1773
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,180
Yeah.

1774
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:18,500
All right.

1775
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,940
Anyhow, it's a privilege just to be nominated.

1776
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,340
That's right.

1777
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,940
It's a privilege just to be nominated.

1778
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:27,300
The nominations are important, I think, you know?

1779
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:31,940
So anyway, also important is your music library, because

1780
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,700
I know it's what gets you through the day at work and why

1781
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,220
many of you listen to podcasts.

1782
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:38,900
Well, if you use Spotify or of course iTunes and, you know,

1783
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:42,500
other places that you can find music, you can now check out

1784
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:47,940
over 3000 music tracks by Zuntata.

1785
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:51,860
That is the sound team who made Taito Games.

1786
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:56,420
So over 3000 music tracks by Zuntata on Spotify.

1787
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:01,540
That would mean, you know, Bubble Bobble, Arcanoid, Darius,

1788
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,140
Ninja Warriors.

1789
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:06,100
Oh, Arcanoid, boom, boom, boom.

1790
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:09,300
Well, there was music in some later ones, but Groove Coaster.

1791
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:12,820
I know those games are not the rhythm-based ones, but

1792
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:16,100
probably the ones that were on phones and stuff.

1793
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,020
So you can check out all those cool soundtracks all over Spotify.

1794
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:20,660
Very, very cool.

1795
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:22,340
Also on Amazon.

1796
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,460
That was the store I left out.

1797
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:24,500
So, all right.

1798
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,460
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us before we get to releases?

1799
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:31,780
Japanese Splatfest, which is, I don't know how many people are

1800
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:34,260
familiar with the phrase Hanayori Dango.

1801
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,900
There were also anime and manga called that too.

1802
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:43,940
But it basically means dumplings over flowers for people who are

1803
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,820
more practical versus people who are more aesthetic.

1804
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:53,780
So the Japanese Splatfest coming up is Hana, which is flower,

1805
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,020
versus Dango, which is dumplings.

1806
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:57,620
And they're delicious.

1807
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,140
Yeah, Team Dango all the way.

1808
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,220
And see, as Sakura, I might have to go with Team Hana.

1809
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:04,340
Just because.

1810
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,500
So that is going to be...

1811
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:10,180
We won't get anything as classy here.

1812
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:14,260
We're going to get like Team Fartjoke versus Team Boobs.

1813
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:16,340
Like that's Team Boobs.

1814
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,020
That's what we'll get here in the States.

1815
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,500
We're not going to get anything as philosophical.

1816
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:26,020
Team Jake Paul versus Team Logan Paul.

1817
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:29,140
Fuck all the way off.

1818
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:35,140
But the thing is, I mean, we do get things that are more specific

1819
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:36,420
to our culture or show.

1820
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:37,300
So whatever.

1821
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,860
You know, we should have like...

1822
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,580
Team Chicken versus Team Egg.

1823
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:45,060
But I feel like they did that before.

1824
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,660
Like which came first, the chicken or the egg?

1825
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,860
That's a saying you hear in our culture.

1826
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:52,020
Team Carnivore versus Team Merbivore.

1827
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:55,220
Oh, Carnivore is going to have such an edge.

1828
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:59,780
You know, Team Media...

1829
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:03,460
Oh, oh, oh, Team Round Earth versus Flat Earth.

1830
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,900
No, because people with intelligence wouldn't want to even be associated

1831
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,780
with that type of up to stupidity.

1832
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:15,380
Team Flat Earth versus Team's vaccinations are harmful.

1833
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:18,740
That's not even funny.

1834
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,300
That is not even funny.

1835
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,460
I couldn't help myself.

1836
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:23,940
I'm sorry.

1837
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:26,100
Well, if it's not funny, you better throw another story out there

1838
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:26,980
before I think of more.

1839
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:30,180
Team Tide Pod versus Team Differently Colored Tide Pod.

1840
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,940
There we go.

1841
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:39,620
Team Tide Pod.

1842
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:43,940
She's laughing whether she's trying to show it or not and rubbing her head.

1843
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,820
I see a smile underneath that when we said Tide Pod.

1844
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:49,140
Just because I can't even right now.

1845
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:53,140
You know, we should have Team Llama versus Team Malpaca.

1846
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:54,900
What about that?

1847
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:59,940
I'm sorry, I just I just love too much the whole, you know,

1848
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:05,860
philosophical dumpling or flour versus Team Tide Pod versus Team Broken Glass.

1849
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:08,180
This is America, land of the stupid.

1850
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:12,340
Wasn't another like terrible eating trend thing.

1851
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,660
I mean, they've got a cinnamon challenge.

1852
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:15,460
Cinnamon challenge.

1853
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,060
Yeah, that's not deadly, though.

1854
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:17,780
So we got it.

1855
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:18,580
No, yes, it is.

1856
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:19,700
Really?

1857
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:20,500
It is.

1858
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,100
Cinnamon is very thermogenic.

1859
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,180
It blocks your people have died from it.

1860
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:24,820
Yeah.

1861
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:25,620
Team Cinnamon Challenge.

1862
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:31,780
What if they did like Team Cinnamon versus Team Ice Bucket?

1863
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,140
But Ice Bucket was for a good cause.

1864
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:37,620
See, that was the whole Lou Gehrig's disease awareness.

1865
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,060
So that's hard dumb things.

1866
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,900
Team Dab versus Team Plank.

1867
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:41,540
I don't know.

1868
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,700
OK, that's that's good.

1869
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,060
Team Dab versus Team Plank.

1870
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,060
Anyway, still stupid.

1871
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,500
Betty White dabbed.

1872
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,060
So automatically Team Dab.

1873
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:52,260
Anyway, can we move on, please?

1874
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:56,260
So there's going to be another Dungeons and Dragons movie.

1875
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:03,540
And it is being actually the rumor as who the director is

1876
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:05,620
would be Chris McKay.

1877
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:10,500
He is in negotiations for the Dungeons and Dragons movie,

1878
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,780
which, first of all, Krul was originally supposed to be

1879
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,300
a Dungeons and Dragons movie.

1880
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,380
And I saw that shit in the theater and it was great.

1881
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:20,100
And then they did a Dungeons and Dragons movie.

1882
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:22,420
And it was not great, but it was fun.

1883
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,860
And it had Tom Baker in it.

1884
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,060
So I love that movie because Tom Baker was in it.

1885
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:29,220
That was the one from like the late 90s, right?

1886
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:30,820
Early 2000s.

1887
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:31,140
Was it?

1888
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:34,820
OK, maybe mid 2000s, because but I just I just remembered

1889
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:36,980
I only cared to watch it because Tom Baker was in it.

1890
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:39,780
Bobby Blackwell says Team Dungeon versus Team Dragon.

1891
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:42,100
No, I got it.

1892
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,060
Team Fantasy versus Team Sci-Fi.

1893
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,380
I they had to have done that one.

1894
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:48,980
I'm most positive they did that one.

1895
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,260
Yeah, maybe that or it was sci-fi and something.

1896
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:56,420
I like I know they did that team elf versus team orc.

1897
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:00,100
Maybe we need no collusion versus team.

1898
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:06,020
No, too topical, too topical, too soon, too soon.

1899
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:06,740
All right.

1900
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:07,300
Let's try.

1901
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:08,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

1902
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:09,380
Is there more?

1903
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:10,020
I'm sorry.

1904
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:13,300
It was a little bit, but I forgot.

1905
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,260
So, yeah, let's go.

1906
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:17,060
It's as it's a Dungeons and Dragons movie,

1907
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:21,140
which already means we're a little afraid, which means I'll probably see it.

1908
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:25,380
But if Tom Baker is in it points, Tom Baker, though, is getting on.

1909
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:28,100
Well, Tom Baker was just in that Dr.

1910
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:31,140
Who thing not that long ago, a year and a half ago.

1911
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,260
OK, it wasn't that long ago.

1912
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:34,020
Maybe two years ago.

1913
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:34,260
All right.

1914
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:36,260
Anyway, let's move on.

1915
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,980
We're going to travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.

1916
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:40,340
Loki, what's coming out in the US?

1917
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:42,260
It's like what's old is new again.

1918
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:46,740
So we've got the blob to remastered the remastered that nobody asked for.

1919
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,780
That's coming on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1920
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:54,660
We have girls and Panzer dream tank match.

1921
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:57,780
That sounds weird.

1922
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:00,420
I'm sure it involves anime girls in tanks.

1923
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:01,300
I can only imagine.

1924
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:03,060
We'll say no more.

1925
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,220
Is it a dating sim where I can date a tank?

1926
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:10,100
Because let's hope that sounds like it could be team anime versus team tank.

1927
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:13,700
Tank Girl, the anime series.

1928
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:15,700
I would watch that.

1929
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,420
Gravel on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1930
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:27,700
Heroin Anthem Zero on PlayStation four and Payday two on Nintendo Switch.

1931
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,140
And we have Darkest Dungeon on Xbox one.

1932
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:39,220
And one week from today, Death End Request on PlayStation four.

1933
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:40,580
Well, that sounds pleasant.

1934
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:43,220
All right.

1935
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:48,660
Let's hop on a plane and go to Japan and check out the releases this week in Japan.

1936
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:50,820
Actually, I'm not seeing a lot this week in Japan.

1937
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:57,220
The only things I see is that there is a Dragon Ball FighterZ arcade stick that's coming out.

1938
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,340
So if you want to check that out.

1939
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:03,700
Also coming out in Japan, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Advanced Edition.

1940
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:05,380
That is coming out in Japan this week.

1941
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,140
That's at least in on the PlayStation four.

1942
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:07,860
There must be something.

1943
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,940
Is there something on the Switch this week that is the reason?

1944
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:13,540
Well, Doom gets its Japanese release this week.

1945
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,740
That's a pretty big deal.

1946
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:19,140
As well as Dragon Quest Builders gets its Japanese release this week as well.

1947
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:21,460
You know, that game came out on the Switch not that long ago over here.

1948
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:27,940
And then on the 3DS, Doraemon Nobita no Takara Jima comes out this week.

1949
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:29,540
So there it is.

1950
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,700
That's really it for the Japanese releases this week.

1951
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,900
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1952
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,060
A few things.

1953
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:42,500
On the 27th, we have Apocalypsis, Harry at the End of the World on Mac and PC.

1954
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,300
And DeBlob 2 for Xbox One.

1955
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,260
On March 1st, we have Subsurface Circular for Switch.

1956
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:50,100
That's kind of a cool name.

1957
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:51,060
I name a band that.

1958
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,000
All right.

1959
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,980
I think it's now time for us to dive into the mailbag.

1960
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,740
It smells funny.

1961
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:02,740
DarkSakura is going to get on her skateboard in 720.

1962
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:03,700
Is this Anthrax?

1963
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:04,900
Right into the mailbag.

1964
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,980
And find some emails.

1965
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:08,340
Every week you guys can email us.

1966
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,060
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1967
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:15,220
If you want to have your email read here on air or deleted on site.

1968
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:15,860
No, I'm just kidding.

1969
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:16,580
We don't.

1970
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:20,100
The only time we've ever not read emails was either like they were just mean.

1971
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,540
Like they were like, not nice.

1972
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:22,260
We don't read those.

1973
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:26,980
Or we would just press for time, which that does happen once in a while.

1974
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:30,020
Like the one week, like some weeks, nobody will email us.

1975
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,940
And then one week we get 10 emails.

1976
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:34,180
Dear DarkSakura, I love you forever.

1977
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,860
Here's 50 million dollars.

1978
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:37,140
Why thank you, stranger.

1979
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:37,780
I'll take it.

1980
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,160
No.

1981
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:42,260
This one's just labeled correction.

1982
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:45,460
So I don't know what the correction's about, but it comes from Robert M.

1983
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:52,980
Harmonix beats sports, which seems to me more related to Rhythm Heaven than to Wii Sports.

1984
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:54,820
Is not an Apple TV exclusive.

1985
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:56,980
Well, not since it's released on the Switch.

1986
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:58,980
I really ought to check it out sometime.

1987
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,180
And it's from Robert M.

1988
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:03,140
Already investing this week's vog points from the podcast checking.

1989
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:08,980
And don't forget to check in every week to spend your points on nothing.

1990
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:11,780
But it makes you look good at vognetwork.com.

1991
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:13,380
You can check in if you're live.

1992
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:14,980
You can check in while you're listening live.

1993
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:19,220
Or, of course, you can use a passphrase hidden somewhere in the episode to check in that way.

1994
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,820
As far as the email goes, yeah, it came up last week.

1995
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:24,020
I don't remember the discussion.

1996
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:26,660
We were talking about Apple TV and like the limited games that were on it.

1997
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,020
And I mentioned the harmonix game.

1998
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:30,820
I had no idea they ported that to Switch, actually.

1999
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:36,660
See, that's an example of a game that got lost amongst all those Switch releases is I had no idea.

2000
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:40,100
Everybody's talking about when it comes to harmonix these days, everybody's talking about drop

2001
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:41,220
mix, right?

2002
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:45,540
You know who super got into drop mix is Shane.

2003
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,860
He has like every single card you can get.

2004
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:49,540
I think he might be missing one.

2005
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:51,220
But yeah, like, but that gives a lot of fun.

2006
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:56,580
So well, also speaking of Shane and from the same email or another email.

2007
01:37:56,580 --> 01:38:00,420
Just to add, kind of disappointing to see that Ranger Pride hasn't updated since July.

2008
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:03,380
Unless I'm missing something, you are.

2009
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:06,500
I would love to hear Shane's take on the Toy Fair announcement.

2010
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:10,740
Well, funny you should send that email in, because probably the day after you sent that,

2011
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:13,540
Ranger Pride came back with a brand new episode.

2012
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:18,580
And they actually, they really explain why they've been gone for a few months.

2013
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:24,500
And it's very honest and kind of brave for them to be very blunt and upfront about what's going on.

2014
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:27,700
So check it out, Ranger fan or not, honestly.

2015
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:31,380
But they talk about some of the things that have been missed.

2016
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:36,740
Another one that came through our website from Shash OG.

2017
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:38,420
Hey, OLR.

2018
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:41,700
So many characters is allowed when sending you an email.

2019
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:44,020
I typed what didn't seem to be that long of an email.

2020
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:46,740
A couple paragraphs at most, and it says it's too long to send.

2021
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:49,860
I'm trying to send from orange.radio.com.

2022
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:50,740
Love the show, by the way.

2023
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,220
Just email us directly.

2024
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:56,340
Yeah, honestly, I would say 10 times over,

2025
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:59,860
just send directly an email to participate at orange.radio.com.

2026
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:05,140
The website is there to try to make the process easier, but obviously it's not.

2027
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:10,500
Also, I am well aware our website is extremely out of date.

2028
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:14,900
I mean, we're so thankful to Dekeman and VX JasonXV

2029
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,060
without who we wouldn't even have a website.

2030
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,460
And in Jason's case, we wouldn't have an intro every week.

2031
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:25,060
But the reality is that websites get old and we know ours is growing mold.

2032
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:25,700
It's pretty old.

2033
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,060
Hey, I rhymed.

2034
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:31,780
So, yeah, we just need to give that whole stuff a kick in the butt.

2035
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:40,340
Well, to bring a point to that, when I finish my current WordPress project, it can happen.

2036
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:41,620
Awesome.

2037
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:45,700
Just be sure to team up with Mr. Jason, because without Jason, I would...

2038
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:52,340
Here's the thing, the podcast feed came in from an old PHP Nuke run website

2039
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:56,340
into the Joomla thing that is there now into whatever you're going to build.

2040
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,900
The beauty is like it still fucking works.

2041
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:02,420
And I almost feel like Jason like wrote it from scratch at one point.

2042
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:06,900
So just make sure you work with him to not break the most important part of the site.

2043
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,300
Have time to make it happen in the next couple of months because

2044
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,740
I'm still working on one for charity I'm involved in.

2045
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,740
But a new website would be rad.

2046
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:15,300
I'm not gonna lie.

2047
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,620
So last email.

2048
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:18,100
Yep.

2049
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,060
Hello, LR.

2050
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:20,100
We know who this is.

2051
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:20,820
Oh, boy.

2052
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,420
That sounds like a YYR email.

2053
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:23,060
You are correct.

2054
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:27,700
I come to you with a couple of rebuttals from last week's Skypline segment.

2055
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:28,900
Yes, rebuttals.

2056
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:30,580
Also, I just made you say butt.

2057
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:31,460
No, go away.

2058
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:32,660
Buy super multitasking.

2059
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:33,620
End of email.

2060
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:34,420
Okay.

2061
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:35,060
You know what?

2062
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:39,220
I said cat butt at the start of the show, which is the best kind of butt that can exist.

2063
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:42,900
So cat butts are the best butts.

2064
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:44,260
I'm just gonna leave it at that.

2065
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:50,580
The first is for Kai Judo, who was talking about a game he felt could be the VR equivalent

2066
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:51,300
of Wii Sports.

2067
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:55,860
The problem is that, in at least my opinion, there will never be a VR equivalent of Wii

2068
01:40:55,860 --> 01:40:57,460
Sports for one simple reason.

2069
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:01,460
Wii Sports attracted people when they saw other people playing it and then thought,

2070
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:02,420
wow, that looks like fun.

2071
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,540
I want to try it.

2072
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:09,460
The simple and sad fact is that there's no way to get even an approximation of what a

2073
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:12,820
game is actually like in VR until you physically play it.

2074
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:16,740
This is, I think, one of the main things holding VR back from the mainstream.

2075
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:21,700
I really think that the best way for VR producers to combat this is to load up Dave and Buster's

2076
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:25,060
VR experiences, but that's another discussion for another time.

2077
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:32,100
My second response is for Actdeft, who insisted that Super Smash Brothers Melee needs to die.

2078
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:37,700
Beyond the fact that it was a fantastic game when it was released in 2001, if you're looking

2079
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:41,460
for the reason Melee was and continues to be so popular, look no further than Super

2080
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:42,340
Smash Brothers Brawl.

2081
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:47,700
Brawl released in 2008, it brought new character stages and items and looked better than ever,

2082
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:53,060
but the core gameplay was changed quite a bit, mostly to appeal to casual players.

2083
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:56,980
Several changes were made to the physics to slow down the speed of the game, making it

2084
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:59,780
more accessible but lowering the intensity of the action.

2085
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,940
Also, elements of chance were added.

2086
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:06,020
I'm not sure if you remember, but characters could actually trip while running, render

2087
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:07,940
them temporarily helpless.

2088
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:12,980
This was actually 100% random, and most serious fighting game players would agree that the

2089
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:15,940
elements of luck do not belong in a skill-based game.

2090
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:22,420
For these concerns, Super Smash Brothers Brawl was completely rejected by the fighting game

2091
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:23,460
community.

2092
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:24,340
So what did they do?

2093
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:25,860
They went back to Melee, of course.

2094
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:31,300
Other than the official Project M, which was a fan-made mod of Brawl to make it feel more

2095
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:35,380
like Melee, there was no version of Super Smash Brothers that was taken seriously by

2096
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:38,900
the tournament scene until Smash 4 released in 2014.

2097
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:44,180
By this point, folks had been playing Melee for 13 years, so had gotten very used to it,

2098
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:45,220
and guess what?

2099
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:50,500
While Smash 4 was a big improvement, many would argue that it still is not as faster

2100
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,860
intense as Melee.

2101
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:56,100
With the exception of the mediocre character balance, Melee still holds up very well in

2102
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:00,420
2018 as a competitive game, and that is why people still want to play it, watch it, and

2103
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:01,540
enjoy it in general.

2104
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:02,820
So, um, sorry?

2105
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,300
That's all I've got for this week.

2106
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:09,140
Now excuse me while I continue to look for new Twitch videos of people playing challenge

2107
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:12,980
mode of super multitasking so I can laugh at them when they fail.

2108
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:15,380
BobbyBlackWolf may have been right.

2109
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:19,940
I guess I am a bit of a sadist after all, or perhaps more than a bit, maybe.

2110
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:21,620
Happy gaming, AaronYYR.

2111
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:27,700
Alright, so we have rebuttals to the rebuttal in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2112
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:33,140
Kaijuto says, not correct, people can see you playing in the living room AND watch the

2113
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,980
TV, so I call BS.

2114
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:39,940
It sounds like it would depend on which VR experiences, you guys might be thinking of

2115
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:44,820
two different VR experiences, whereas something like I believe Oculus Rift does not really

2116
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,020
let you do that.

2117
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:46,980
PlayStation VR.

2118
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:47,460
You can.

2119
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:48,180
Oh, does it?

2120
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,140
Yeah, you can do that.

2121
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:49,620
Oh.

2122
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:54,180
Well, I know PlayStation VR does, like you can do the VR thing and see what's on the

2123
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,980
TV, but I don't, I didn't think every VR headset let you do that.

2124
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:57,540
Yeah, you can.

2125
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,660
Okay, well then I stay graphic.

2126
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:01,620
And they even have some where it's more advanced where you can actually set up virtual

2127
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:06,020
cameras, so you can actually put yourself in a green screen in the middle of the environment,

2128
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:10,420
and you can actually see yourself interacting like you were a character there.

2129
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:16,340
But I do, I do understand to some extent the point that Aaron's trying to make where it's

2130
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:23,460
like, and because I was in the same boat, you don't get VR until you do VR, right?

2131
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:27,300
Because I didn't get VR until Bobby was like, hi, you're in my hometown.

2132
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:28,500
We're at a convention together.

2133
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,540
You're gonna fucking play this.

2134
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,620
He didn't put it that way, but that's essentially what it was.

2135
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:36,100
And I did it and I was like, alright, I understand why you are obsessed.com with VR.

2136
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:37,540
This is a lot of fun.

2137
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:38,580
This is great.

2138
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:45,220
So I kind of get that to an extent, but at the same time, you could kind of say the same

2139
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:49,060
thing about Wii Sports even is that it's one thing to watch Wii Sports, but then when you

2140
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:51,540
kind of actually get in there and do it, it's different.

2141
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,820
So I don't know.

2142
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:56,980
I'm Switzerland in this debate, but I appreciate the spirited argument.

2143
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:03,540
Also, we have a rebuttal to the rebuttal from Act Deft, who says that's the thing.

2144
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:05,300
We have Smash 4.

2145
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:10,500
Brawl was awful for the competitive scene, but Smash 4 fixed all the problems Brawl had.

2146
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:13,700
So it sounds like Act Deft is kind of taking issue to the fact that we kind of glossed

2147
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,740
over the fact that we do have the Smash 4.

2148
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,260
He brought up Smash 4, though.

2149
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:18,500
Yeah.

2150
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:21,940
And so the problem with Smash 4 is that it's still a little bit slower and doesn't have

2151
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,860
the same level of intensity.

2152
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:29,220
But to be fair, that's not quite the criticism the Brawl got in that.

2153
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:31,060
I think it's a little slower.

2154
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:34,820
I mean, again, I don't want to take sides.

2155
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:36,100
I appreciate all you gamers.

2156
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:36,660
I really do.

2157
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,100
But yeah, I get both sides.

2158
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:40,420
I do.

2159
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:41,560
All right.

2160
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:43,460
So I think that's that.

2161
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:45,380
I think that's it for the emails.

2162
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:45,940
Was that it?

2163
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:46,660
Last one?

2164
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:47,140
That's it.

2165
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:47,860
All right.

2166
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:52,740
You can send us an email to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send

2167
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:56,100
us an email if you want to send that in a future week.

2168
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,060
But we have some more news to get to, starting with Loki.

2169
01:45:59,060 --> 01:45:59,380
Yes.

2170
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:05,700
So this is kind of a weird little game, but, you know, you may remember there was actually

2171
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:09,700
a Mario game that came out on the system as well, the Sharp X1 computer.

2172
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:14,100
So it was a game that's actually published and developed by Hudson Soft.

2173
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:20,020
This is Donkey Kong 3, the great counter attack.

2174
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:24,740
And it's definitely a lot different from most Donkey Kong games.

2175
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:28,820
You actually play this character named Stanley and you're shooting.

2176
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:36,820
I guess a gun or something up at Donkey Kong, who is falling down, holding some parachutes

2177
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:38,660
and there's birds and stuff flying around.

2178
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:40,020
You have to shoot as well.

2179
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:43,220
And the goal is to get Donkey Kong up to the top of the stage.

2180
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:51,940
And apparently this recently sold for, I guess, $415 on a Yahoo Auction, which I forgot that

2181
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:53,860
even Yahoo Auctions was a thing still.

2182
01:46:55,380 --> 01:47:00,420
But apparently now there's some actual screenshots and video of the actual game as well.

2183
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:06,740
But yeah, I remember there was a Mario game, too, that got released on there that was kind

2184
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:10,180
of different that someone then later created.

2185
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:14,420
And yeah, Super Mario Brothers Special was the other one that they also released.

2186
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:17,700
That was on the PC-ABI.

2187
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:22,260
Interesting.

2188
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:22,740
I don't know.

2189
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:23,700
I watched the gameplay.

2190
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:30,580
It looks kind of boring, but it's neat to find these unique games that we probably didn't

2191
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:31,540
even know existed.

2192
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:37,380
Yeah, honestly, as much as I appreciate the old computer history and stuff, I totally

2193
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:40,660
forgot about this whole Sharp had the license stuff.

2194
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,020
So I didn't even...

2195
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:46,900
When I first heard new Donkey Kong game was unearthed, I thought they finally got that

2196
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,900
music game that was originally...

2197
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:52,180
It's in some of the promo material for the Japanese Nintendo Entertainment System.

2198
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:54,100
You know how there's Donkey Kong Junior Math, right?

2199
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:57,940
There was a Donkey Kong music game that showed up in some ads recently.

2200
01:47:57,940 --> 01:47:59,060
I've been seeing floating around Twitter.

2201
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:00,500
I thought that was the game they unearthed.

2202
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,900
And then when I actually kind of went into the article and read about it, I was like,

2203
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,340
oh shit, I didn't even realize.

2204
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:08,260
So they just kind of recycled Donkey Kong 3's assets in another game.

2205
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:12,660
Because Donkey Kong 3 was so different.

2206
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:16,980
I think it's one of the few YouTube videos I did some years ago was about...

2207
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,740
I don't think I've ever played Donkey Kong 3.

2208
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:22,980
It's just different, because whereas Donkey Kong 1 and 2 are like platformers, Donkey

2209
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:24,580
Kong 3 is basically a shooter.

2210
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:25,780
Yeah, that's what this is too.

2211
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:28,420
So I guess I didn't realize that that was what the game was.

2212
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:31,940
But it keeps shooting Donkey Kong in the testicles until he flies away.

2213
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:32,820
That's exactly what it is.

2214
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:33,940
That's what you do in Donkey Kong 3.

2215
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:37,140
It's basically you're shooting him up the vine to try to get rid of him because he's

2216
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:38,900
a pest and you're trying to shoot the other bugs too.

2217
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:41,700
And then that guy never showed up.

2218
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:44,500
Stanley, the exterminator, whatever his name is, never showed up again.

2219
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:46,820
You would think he'd be perfect for Brawl.

2220
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:48,260
New Smash Brothers character.

2221
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:51,460
I would think, or I say Brawl, but you know Smash Brothers, you think he'd be a perfectly

2222
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:54,260
Smash Brothers character, like from deep from the archives.

2223
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:57,060
No, they need to be like Captain Rainbow before they do that shit.

2224
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:59,860
If they can do fucking Duck Hunt, they can do Stanley.

2225
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:01,860
That's my thought.

2226
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:06,100
Did the power pad have any sort of like mascot characters or anything?

2227
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:12,340
Not really, because both those games, the world-class track meet and the bandai, or

2228
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:16,500
whoever did the power pad in the first place, like stadium events, you know, the very rare

2229
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:17,140
power glove.

2230
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:18,260
We'll just have the power glove.

2231
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,660
But that also was not Nintendo.

2232
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:24,660
That was the third party peripheral.

2233
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:28,260
So they have to do, well, I mean, it's not that they can't ever get third party stuff,

2234
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:31,300
but you know, it's harder when that comes into play.

2235
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:32,420
All right.

2236
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:37,300
Well, let's move on to talk about something that Sony has rolled out this week for those

2237
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:40,180
of you that enjoy sharing your PlayStation stuff online.

2238
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:44,340
You can now share PlayStation profiles online.

2239
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:47,700
PlayStation has put user profiles on the web.

2240
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:52,500
If you go to the PlayStation website and use a tab in the upper right that says My PlayStation,

2241
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:56,980
you can see what a classic, basically a classic PlayStation page would look like.

2242
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:58,900
There's a lot of white space in it.

2243
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:03,940
You can't really customize a lot online, but you can get a sense on your desktop or on

2244
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:08,020
your mobile what the profiles are going to look like on a PlayStation.

2245
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:11,620
You can only change the headers on an actual PlayStation and all of that stuff.

2246
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:13,780
But at least it's something.

2247
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:17,540
It's a little more minimalist than what is on the Xbox side of things.

2248
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:22,420
But I think some people think the Xbox website's a little cluttered, so it works.

2249
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:26,820
So we'll see how this develops as it gets refined and so forth.

2250
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:29,860
But I think that's kind of neat that PlayStation profiles are on the web.

2251
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:34,900
I don't know how many of you guys actually look at other people's profiles online on

2252
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:38,500
these types of websites, but once in a while, I go to like a Steam profile, maybe.

2253
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:44,820
I leveled up on Steam today because all the 20XX streaming, I was able to make a new badge.

2254
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:47,140
So fun.

2255
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,940
All right, let's move on to Dark Sakura.

2256
01:50:50,740 --> 01:51:00,340
Well, one of our favorite Twitters, the Kazurai CEO, is going to discontinue the Twitter as

2257
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:04,100
of June 15th, so right after E3 this year.

2258
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:08,340
But the person doing it wants to go out with something important.

2259
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:10,740
And I'll just read what the quote says.

2260
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:15,860
Like the PlayStation Network, my Twitter account has provided a free online service to gamers

2261
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:16,900
for many years.

2262
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:20,020
But just like the PlayStation Network, I've decided to change that.

2263
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:24,900
Kazurai's CEO is moving to a free-to-read business model with microtransactions for

2264
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:25,460
charity.

2265
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:32,820
So basically, he hopes to collect 599 pounds for SpecialEffect, which is a British group

2266
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:39,380
that helps people with physical conditions play video games that they might not otherwise

2267
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:39,940
be able to.

2268
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:47,060
So it's adaptive technology that helps people, you know, whether using customized controllers

2269
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:49,300
or letting people use eye movement tools.

2270
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:58,420
So, but already he's, well, at least as of what, a day ago, he's raised about 37% of

2271
01:51:58,420 --> 01:51:58,900
that goal.

2272
01:51:58,900 --> 01:51:59,940
Oh, that's great.

2273
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:05,300
So I'd say go ahead and join in, try to help out because it's for a good cause.

2274
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:08,180
And well, it'd be nice to see it go out with a bang.

2275
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:10,820
Do you think this person is going to reveal themselves on the way out?

2276
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:11,380
Who it is?

2277
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:17,220
I mean, I imagine the author is not somebody that is from a AAA gaming website or something.

2278
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:19,220
I imagine it's just somebody, you know, who's...

2279
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:21,540
I think it's going to be like V.

2280
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:23,620
Meaning?

2281
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:24,580
It's not the name.

2282
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:25,380
It's the idea.

2283
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:25,700
I see.

2284
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:28,180
All right.

2285
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:29,540
They're not the face or the person.

2286
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:33,700
It will be like the masked magician who reveals all the secrets and then finally reveals who

2287
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:34,340
they are in the end.

2288
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:36,740
We've already got Penn and Teller for that.

2289
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:38,660
All right.

2290
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:42,980
Just a few more stories before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all

2291
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,180
one word on Skype.

2292
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:45,860
Let's get to it.

2293
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:48,020
Loki, I like this story that Loki's going to get into.

2294
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:49,300
So yeah, this is kind of cool.

2295
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:57,300
So there was a 14 year old fan of the game Firewatch who was inspired after playing the

2296
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:01,220
game to kind of go visit some of these fire watch towers.

2297
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:08,260
And so actually, you know, traveled quite a bit with his dad around the country.

2298
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:11,540
Just, you know, says travel almost 1200 miles.

2299
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:18,580
And finally, I guess one of their last trips, he found a...

2300
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:20,740
What was that?

2301
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:23,940
There was a watchtower that was in Wadley Mountain.

2302
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:27,620
And when they got there, they'd stay there quite late.

2303
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:32,740
And apparently some of the other trips they were talking about, they basically just visit

2304
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:34,020
all these different places.

2305
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:38,180
Well, there's one actually in particular, though, that is kind of run down that they're

2306
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:43,220
looking at, you know, actually kind of helping bring this back.

2307
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:46,340
So I guess there's this...

2308
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:50,020
I didn't even realize that they had this whole associated with the FFLA.

2309
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:57,540
Basically, they have this several chapters across both the North America and United States

2310
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:07,060
and with that, they're talking about like, I guess, bringing back one of these towers,

2311
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:11,860
which honestly, compared to like the game, these are pretty basic.

2312
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:14,100
It's not like actually enclosed and nice like that.

2313
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:17,700
It's more of just like, you know, open air tower or whatever.

2314
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:25,460
But yeah, basically he's been inspired to try to help restore one of these towers.

2315
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,220
That's pretty rad, though.

2316
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:32,660
Even if it isn't exactly like the game, that's pretty cool that the game kind of inspired...

2317
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:36,180
We always hear such negativity about video games and so forth.

2318
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:39,620
And video games cause these horrific things to happen in the world.

2319
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:41,620
And I'm so sick of that narrative.

2320
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:43,460
It's really nice to hear that.

2321
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:48,420
Oh, but video games also have inspired people to get into history, which is essentially

2322
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:52,980
what a lot of this with the fire towers and so forth is before we had satellites to do

2323
01:54:52,980 --> 01:54:53,780
a lot of this.

2324
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:56,100
Apparently, yeah, there used to be a lot more of these towers.

2325
01:54:56,100 --> 01:55:01,700
But like a lot of them have been just run down, either have been burned by wildfires

2326
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:04,900
themselves or just been disassembled or whatever.

2327
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:08,340
And so kind of looking to kind of preserve some of these things are kind of neat.

2328
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:09,300
Which is weird.

2329
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:11,620
There was more to the game, too.

2330
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:13,780
The game wasn't really about the tower.

2331
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:16,500
I mean, it was because it was kind of like your base of operations.

2332
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,020
But there was obviously a whole nother layer.

2333
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:21,460
I mean, I guess minor spoiler alert, but it's basically...

2334
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:23,140
I don't...

2335
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:25,860
It's basically a how did this person die type of mystery.

2336
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:28,260
Type of thing is what the game basically boils down to.

2337
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:37,220
But, you know, it's cool that this kind of inspired somebody to, you know, maybe save

2338
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:38,820
one of these somewhere else.

2339
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:39,140
Yeah.

2340
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:39,640
Neat.

2341
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:41,060
All right.

2342
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:45,300
Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com says kid needs a girlfriend bad.

2343
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:46,100
Don't be mean.

2344
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:49,620
Just because you have a hobby doesn't mean you don't have girlfriends.

2345
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:49,780
Yeah.

2346
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:52,660
Would you say that to every boy scout out there or whatever?

2347
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:56,980
You know, people get into interesting causes and so forth.

2348
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:58,100
So, all right.

2349
01:55:58,100 --> 01:55:59,060
I like this.

2350
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:00,020
At least it's doing good.

2351
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:01,320
Okay.

2352
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:06,660
One more thing before we get to the Skype line tonight at Orange Launch Radio.

2353
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:12,740
And that has to do with a new Pokemon Go-esque type of game coming out.

2354
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:16,260
And this one is based on Ghostbusters.

2355
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:17,300
That's right.

2356
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:19,780
Ghostbusters World is coming.

2357
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:25,220
It's a collaborative effort between Sony Pictures Entertainment, Ghostcore, and publisher

2358
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:26,820
433, Inc.

2359
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:28,820
You'll notice Niantic is not involved with this one.

2360
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:30,820
So, it's different companies.

2361
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:33,460
I'll try it, but like, I don't know.

2362
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:36,180
Neither is the company behind Garfield Go.

2363
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,940
So, it is not out yet.

2364
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:39,140
They just have a teaser trailer.

2365
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:41,140
I see Loki getting his phone, but it's not out yet.

2366
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:47,380
No, my phone was starting to dig against my keys and that's how the screen gets cracked.

2367
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:51,060
There's a teaser trailer, but it really doesn't show any gameplay.

2368
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:54,980
But neither really did the Pokemon Go teaser trailer and that didn't seem to stop that.

2369
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:58,340
So, anyway, you're apparently in this game going to be able to catch specters, ghosts,

2370
01:56:58,340 --> 01:56:59,700
and apparitions with your phone.

2371
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:01,540
It uses AR.

2372
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:04,500
So, you see the ghosts over, you know, your usual things.

2373
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:09,700
So, I'm assuming it isn't going to use like real world landmarks, which is what, you know,

2374
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,220
Pokemon Go and Ingress do.

2375
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:14,500
Instead, it's going to use the world around you to be able to, you know, have the ghosts

2376
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,860
appear and so forth.

2377
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:17,300
So, let's see.

2378
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:22,500
They don't say when it's coming out, but I guess in the next year or so.

2379
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:27,380
Probably whenever Harry Potter Wizards Unite comes out, because we know that is coming

2380
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,900
and Niantic is involved.

2381
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,020
Here's the bandwagon.

2382
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,060
Let's jump on it.

2383
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:31,700
Might as well.

2384
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:32,900
Might as well.

2385
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:34,740
How's Draconis going these days?

2386
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:36,500
That was the real big knockoff.

2387
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:39,860
It's like the same fucking game, but with these different characters.

2388
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:41,140
All right.

2389
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:41,640
It's...

2390
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:44,100
I'll still check it out.

2391
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:44,820
You know what?

2392
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:47,780
Pretty much any like AR based game.

2393
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:48,580
I've checked it out.

2394
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:49,060
Try it out.

2395
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:49,540
Delete it.

2396
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:49,860
Whatever.

2397
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:50,420
Exactly.

2398
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:54,820
I played Garfield Go for two minutes and then I was like, garbage.

2399
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:56,020
It's absolute shit.

2400
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:56,820
All right.

2401
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:57,860
Orange Lounge Radio.

2402
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:58,980
All one word on Skype.

2403
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:02,340
If you want to give us a call and say hello and talk about anything we've talked about

2404
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:06,100
tonight, or maybe there's something else you want to get into while we wait to see if any

2405
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:06,740
calls come in.

2406
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:09,460
Let me check in with the Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

2407
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:09,700
Yeah.

2408
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:14,580
So, even though Melger Survive is a big pile of shit, you may remember that

2409
01:58:15,460 --> 01:58:18,100
Konami has some trouble thanking Kojima for some stuff.

2410
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:24,420
Well, the developers of the game hid some stuff in Melger Survive to kind of pay homage

2411
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:29,140
to Kojima, including there is a list of some of the different combat units.

2412
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:34,980
And if you look at the initials of the last word in each one, it says KJP Forever or Kojima

2413
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:36,580
Productions Forever.

2414
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:42,820
And then, of course, it has Yoda and Yuji at the bottom there, which are the designers

2415
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:47,540
of the Melger Survive game kind of, you know, paying homage to him.

2416
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:49,300
So good for them.

2417
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:54,580
And I know they sort of paid homage to they said, you know, like credit to the, you know,

2418
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:56,340
Melger team or something like that.

2419
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:00,580
But yeah, it's it kind of sucks, the whole situation.

2420
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:03,620
But it's neat to get that hidden in there.

2421
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:04,980
I wonder if someone's gonna get in trouble now.

2422
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:08,260
I it's too late now.

2423
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:10,100
The game's out there and people have it.

2424
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:14,020
I guess that would be extreme.

2425
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:15,860
I would be like really surprised.

2426
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:16,740
Be a big dick.

2427
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:18,180
That would be a very big dick move.

2428
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:21,060
But then again, so would be delisting PT completely.

2429
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:22,180
And here we are.

2430
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:24,100
So I know it also.

2431
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:26,260
Let's talk about why Melger Survive is shit.

2432
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:30,340
Ten dollars a save slot in a game.

2433
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:32,580
Ten dollars a save slot.

2434
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:33,700
You have one character slot.

2435
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:35,300
If you want to unlock the other three.

2436
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,060
Ten dollars each one.

2437
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:39,220
Oh, hey, my more inventory slots.

2438
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,700
Those are going to cost you three to five dollars each.

2439
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:42,740
Is it a cell phone game?

2440
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:47,220
No, it's a it's an it's an well, because it sounds like a cell phone game.

2441
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:48,820
And then what else do they have?

2442
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:52,980
They also had, of course, you can buy boost packs to do different things in the game.

2443
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:54,820
So they have their own microtransactions.

2444
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:59,780
And in like additional throw it in loadouts or whatever additional loadouts, I think,

2445
01:59:59,780 --> 02:00:01,780
cost like five bucks each as well.

2446
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:04,820
If you want loadout slots, throw it in the trash.

2447
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:05,940
Well, absolute garbage.

2448
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:10,980
J.D. with a counterpoint saying, to be fair, MMOs charge for character slots.

2449
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:15,700
I think EverQuest may have back in the day, but OFAVS11 did.

2450
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:17,780
I know OFAVS11 did charge for character slots.

2451
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:18,660
Wow, doesn't.

2452
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:20,420
Yeah, well, with that, though.

2453
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:24,580
And I understand like, OK, you want to charge for that because of like server space or whatever,

2454
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:25,300
which is dumb.

2455
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:26,100
It's an excuse.

2456
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:28,100
But this is a single player game.

2457
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:32,820
Yes, I know they force online connectivity all the time, but it's mostly a single player game.

2458
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:37,700
No, I appreciate the trying to find a reason why.

2459
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:40,660
But no, Konami is just being douches.

2460
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:41,880
All right.

2461
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:44,660
Oh, Guild Wars does this a lot.

2462
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:49,300
Guild Wars doesn't charge a monthly fee, so they pay for the servers in other ways, right?

2463
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:51,460
And do they charge for their expansions, though?

2464
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:53,860
They do charge their expansions, but so does any other.

2465
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:55,460
So does WoW, so does 14.

2466
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:56,180
Any of them do.

2467
02:00:56,820 --> 02:01:02,260
So anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

2468
02:01:03,620 --> 02:01:07,940
Akuma JP in chat says, Loki, don't you know how hard it is to make a memory slot?

2469
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:12,420
I thought you would just take the first one and just kind of copy that.

2470
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:19,460
JD points out, is this a one time cost or recurring is a one time ten dollar cost, right?

2471
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:20,820
One time for each slot.

2472
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:21,780
One time for each slot.

2473
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:24,340
So thirty dollars.

2474
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:24,840
Wow.

2475
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:29,620
Dungeon Buster says the division from Ubisoft gives you four character slots for free.

2476
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:31,300
Destiny two gives you three.

2477
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:35,540
Yeah, it's also it's also just kind of dirty that it's one character slot for free.

2478
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:36,820
One.

2479
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:38,740
That's a little that's a little silly.

2480
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:42,340
Well, they're assuming that you're going to want to replay through this game more than

2481
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:45,940
once anyways, which no, I don't think so.

2482
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:48,740
I have a feeling the phone is assuming you're going to want to play through it once.

2483
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:52,260
I have a feeling the phones aren't going to go off tonight.

2484
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:57,380
I don't know if that's a Celebrity Big Brother finale or if that's the Olympic closing ceremony.

2485
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,700
I thought Celebrity Big Brother was already over.

2486
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:00,980
No, Big Brother ends tonight.

2487
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:05,300
Oh, because I was like, didn't Courtney Act already win that?

2488
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:05,700
Oh, no.

2489
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:07,140
Celebrity Big Brother US.

2490
02:02:07,140 --> 02:02:07,460
OK.

2491
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:08,660
The one that who's left.

2492
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:10,340
It's I don't watch it.

2493
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:11,380
So it's all those.

2494
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:11,880
Yeah.

2495
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:14,180
Omarosa is not going to win the whole thing.

2496
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,780
It's going to be and I haven't watched.

2497
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:16,500
I haven't watched.

2498
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:17,620
I said this a week ago.

2499
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:20,180
I think Marissa was playing the best game out of anybody.

2500
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:21,860
So that's who I get.

2501
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:23,780
Marissa Janae Whitaker.

2502
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:24,280
Who?

2503
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:29,300
Oh, she she won the Tony for Hairspray.

2504
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:29,800
She was.

2505
02:02:31,140 --> 02:02:32,660
Good morning, Baltimore.

2506
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:33,620
Tracy Turnblad.

2507
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:34,260
Is that her name?

2508
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:34,740
OK.

2509
02:02:34,740 --> 02:02:35,240
Yeah.

2510
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:36,040
Anyway.

2511
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:38,420
If it's the new Hairspray, I didn't see it.

2512
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:39,060
All right.

2513
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:43,220
Let's go to the Skype line where we have a call.

2514
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:44,260
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2515
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:44,760
Who's this?

2516
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:45,860
It's Ron.

2517
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:47,540
I hear you're not getting any calls tonight.

2518
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:48,580
Yeah, well, we do.

2519
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:49,220
You fixed it.

2520
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:49,940
Thank you so much.

2521
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:50,660
What's up, my friend?

2522
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:51,700
Not much.

2523
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:55,540
I only called because I needed to correct you on something you said on last week's episode.

2524
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:57,460
Oh, well, please.

2525
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:58,660
I live for getting corrected.

2526
02:02:58,660 --> 02:03:00,020
This is episode rebuttal.

2527
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:03,320
OK.

2528
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:09,060
You know, just as much as you do, I love my 80s shows, my 90s shows.

2529
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:13,060
There are times I sit there and listen to the full theme to growing pains because it's

2530
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:13,940
friggin awesome.

2531
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:17,940
But you talked about the Hogan family last week.

2532
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:18,440
I did.

2533
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:19,640
Yes.

2534
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:21,620
You said that was Valerie Bertinelli.

2535
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:25,460
It was the other Valerie, wasn't it?

2536
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:26,580
Valerie Harper.

2537
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:27,220
God damn it.

2538
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:28,980
You're right.

2539
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:30,020
You're right.

2540
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:32,660
Why was I thinking that in the moment that it was Valerie Bertinelli?

2541
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:32,900
You're right.

2542
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:34,340
It was Valerie Harper.

2543
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,260
Because you were talking about one day at a time.

2544
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:39,060
Drag me, expose me.

2545
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:43,860
I believe you denied if you deny it.

2546
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:45,160
What?

2547
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:48,580
I will only drag you if you deny it and say that you're still correct.

2548
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:50,820
No, I'm not going to deny it because you're absolutely right.

2549
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:54,900
It was Harper because the show was originally Valerie's family.

2550
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:56,980
But the name Harper came into it somewhere.

2551
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:58,420
I should have known better.

2552
02:03:58,420 --> 02:03:59,940
It was called the Hogans.

2553
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:01,940
Then they changed it to the Hogan family.

2554
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:02,440
Yeah.

2555
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:05,940
And it was kind of a mess of how they wrote her off the show.

2556
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:06,900
They did.

2557
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:09,300
Didn't they, like, kill her in a car crash or something?

2558
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:11,860
Well, she died from brain cancer.

2559
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:12,660
Oh, that's...

2560
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:16,580
But so they just basically, like, killed her off screen, right?

2561
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:17,080
Yeah.

2562
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:20,740
Which is sad.

2563
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:22,100
Rhoda was a fun show.

2564
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,460
That's what she was also in.

2565
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:26,020
That's what you do to your difficult actresses, I guess.

2566
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:28,820
So at least back in the 80s, that's what they did.

2567
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:34,020
So, I mean, now if you tried to do that, how did they kill off What's Her Name on Grey's Anatomy?

2568
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:35,220
I'm assuming they killed her off.

2569
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:37,620
Maybe they just moved her, but I never watched that show.

2570
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:40,420
What's Her Name, that actress that everybody says is difficult to work with.

2571
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:42,260
The blonde girl.

2572
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:43,940
So her show was called Valerie.

2573
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:45,080
Right.

2574
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:47,460
Not the Harper family or anything.

2575
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:50,660
No, it was Valerie's family, but she did have a show called Valerie.

2576
02:04:50,660 --> 02:04:55,460
Yeah, but that was when she had the dispute, the salary dispute with NBC.

2577
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:57,860
So she was fired from that show.

2578
02:04:57,860 --> 02:05:00,900
I thought they had called the show Valerie's Family the whole time.

2579
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:01,780
No, it was called...

2580
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:05,780
It was renamed to Valerie's Family and then the Hogan family.

2581
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:06,500
Okay.

2582
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:09,380
So they said that they just continued the...

2583
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:11,220
I'm checking the thing about the page.

2584
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:12,500
So, yeah.

2585
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:13,220
So that's what happened.

2586
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:16,740
What is the name of that actress on Grey's Anatomy?

2587
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:17,940
Or she was on it.

2588
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:21,380
And, like, everybody in Hollywood says she's difficult to work with.

2589
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:23,620
And she left Grey's Anatomy to go have a movie career.

2590
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:25,700
And she's made nothing but stinkers.

2591
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:27,780
And I think she finally came back to television.

2592
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:29,940
The one, the first girl that...

2593
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:30,820
Or she...

2594
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:34,180
Didn't you have cancer in the show or something like that?

2595
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:35,460
Apparently, this is a trope.

2596
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:39,220
But for the record, it was Valerie Bertinelli on One Day at a Time.

2597
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:40,580
Katherine Heigl.

2598
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:41,460
That's who I was trying to think of.

2599
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:42,180
Yeah.

2600
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:43,940
But it was Valerie Bertinelli who was on One Day at a Time.

2601
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:46,100
It was Valerie Bertinelli on One Day at a Time.

2602
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:47,700
And it was different Valeries.

2603
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:51,460
But in my mind, so many years had passed between the two.

2604
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,980
I didn't realize they were different.

2605
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:54,580
So I made a mistake.

2606
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:55,540
You corrected me.

2607
02:05:56,180 --> 02:05:56,680
Whatever.

2608
02:05:57,780 --> 02:05:58,980
That's because we love you.

2609
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:00,340
I know.

2610
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:00,660
I know.

2611
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:02,820
At least you're not coming on here screaming at me.

2612
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:03,860
So I appreciate it.

2613
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:07,780
You're having a nice, calm, rational, you know, you made a boo boo.

2614
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:08,500
And here's why.

2615
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:12,900
And you need to sit down and watch One Day at a Time on Netflix.

2616
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:14,260
The reboot is really good.

2617
02:06:14,260 --> 02:06:17,300
Everybody is telling me that One Day at a Time on Netflix is great.

2618
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:21,540
And then with the exception of Loki, everybody's telling me that the new Queer Eye is fantastic.

2619
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:22,580
It's not fantastic.

2620
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:23,380
It's all right.

2621
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:23,940
I'm not gonna.

2622
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:28,900
But most of my other people are like, like the new Queer Eye is amazing.

2623
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:31,780
I'll take that word for it.

2624
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:32,580
All right.

2625
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:32,820
All right.

2626
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:37,620
Well, Rama and also the Joel McHale or the Joel McHale show.

2627
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:38,580
Oh, that's right.

2628
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:42,260
He kind of replaced Chelsea Handler because basically it's just the soup.

2629
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:43,540
It's basically the soup.

2630
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:45,140
But that's the soup was funny.

2631
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:46,980
So that's yeah, it's good.

2632
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:49,220
Yeah, they don't have mankini anymore.

2633
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:52,900
It's like one piece man or so.

2634
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:56,260
Because, you know, it's kind of what they have to do.

2635
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:57,780
They get around the trademark.

2636
02:06:57,780 --> 02:07:00,420
I really wanted to like the Chelsea Handler show.

2637
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:04,180
And I did in the early episodes, but it kind of became a mess.

2638
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:07,300
Like, was it a sit in the studio show?

2639
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:09,220
Was it a dinner party episode?

2640
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:11,700
Was it this like the Chelsea show was just a mess.

2641
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:13,700
And I hate it when they reduced it to once a week.

2642
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:15,460
It didn't make sense anymore.

2643
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:19,140
Anyway, sorry, I'm just going on a tangent, but I hate when I get invested in shows.

2644
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,820
And then they just like they fuck up.

2645
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:23,220
Yep.

2646
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:23,780
So.

2647
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:24,420
All right.

2648
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:26,580
Uh, Rob, I'm going to let you go to see if anyone else calls in.

2649
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:27,620
But thank you so much.

2650
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:28,260
Hey, no problem.

2651
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:29,460
I like the plan and take care.

2652
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:32,660
Have a good whatever Sunday and all that and drink the rest of the wine for me.

2653
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:33,300
I will do that.

2654
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:34,260
Happy rebuttal.

2655
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,420
All right.

2656
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:37,300
Orange launch radio.

2657
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:38,260
All one word on Skype.

2658
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:40,020
Do you have any other last minute stories to get to before we?

2659
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:40,980
I certainly don't.

2660
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:42,900
Oh, I thought there might have been a few others.

2661
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:45,780
You know my favorite thing about the old Queer Eye other than Carson Kressley?

2662
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:48,100
The soundtrack.

2663
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:49,380
Yeah, the soundtrack was great.

2664
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:50,740
I bought that soundtrack.

2665
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:52,260
We used it in spin class.

2666
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:55,220
It was here back when we did that cage match on O.L.R.

2667
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:57,620
Probably every track on that CD was in the cage match at some point.

2668
02:07:57,620 --> 02:07:57,940
Right.

2669
02:07:57,940 --> 02:07:58,440
Yeah.

2670
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:00,980
Oh, so long ago.

2671
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:03,780
How many how many episodes ago did we finally get rid of cage match?

2672
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:04,580
It was a while ago.

2673
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:07,380
I'm not a fan.

2674
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:08,980
I don't keep track of this shit.

2675
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:11,860
It's on the wiki, so I am not one of your fans.

2676
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:13,780
It's on the wiki, I'm sure.

2677
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:18,180
But it was it was we'd moved it to after birth because

2678
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:23,140
when we started podcasting the entire show, we had to take the cage match out of the show

2679
02:08:23,140 --> 02:08:25,300
because it makes it you can't have that in the podcast.

2680
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:27,620
So we had it in the afterbirth and then we finally got rid of that.

2681
02:08:28,580 --> 02:08:30,100
Or in the 400s, I feel like.

2682
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:32,900
Every so often, you know, I'll listen to something.

2683
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,820
I'll be like, that'll be fun in the cage match.

2684
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:37,460
You know, we made a Tumblr for that and we never used it.

2685
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:39,620
We have like a F yeah cage match or something.

2686
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:41,700
Yeah, because everything on Tumblr is fuck yeah this.

2687
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:43,380
I think there's F yeah cage match or something.

2688
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:44,500
We never used it.

2689
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,500
So you should you're the Tumblr queen.

2690
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:47,540
You should fire that up.

2691
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:50,100
And I don't think it's actually a part of my Tumblr,

2692
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:52,820
but I might maybe I'll remake it or something.

2693
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:53,220
I don't know.

2694
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:55,700
Ragenator in chat says Rob Roberts.

2695
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:58,820
Any chance the cage match will come back on your life?

2696
02:08:58,820 --> 02:09:01,780
Never, never say never, but never.

2697
02:09:03,380 --> 02:09:08,260
No, there's no no plans at this time.

2698
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:10,900
So, all right.

2699
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:13,860
Well, our phone lines aren't aren't ringing up.

2700
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:15,220
So I guess we're going to close up shop.

2701
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:17,540
It's a little early tonight, but it was a slower news week,

2702
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:20,100
probably because the Olympics and, you know, other stuff going on.

2703
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:22,900
Just not as much games news to get into.

2704
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:26,580
So we'll we'll just wait until next week.

2705
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:29,620
But thank you guys for being here and thank you for listening to the show

2706
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:31,620
and spending the last two hours with us.

2707
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:34,500
Not quite three tonight, but thank you guys for being here.

2708
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:35,300
Appreciate it.

2709
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:37,140
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

2710
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:39,300
a nice five star review goes a very long way.

2711
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:41,940
So please leave us a nice five star review.

2712
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:43,620
Tell a friend or five about the show.

2713
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:46,980
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2714
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:52,100
But we can only spread those voices if they're here to air.

2715
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:55,700
And then some folks in chat talking about Twitch streams.

2716
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:59,940
Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says bringing back the cage match means getting rid of the post show

2717
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:00,820
Twitch stream.

2718
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:04,740
Yeah, essentially, although I'm not always the best at doing the post show Twitch streams,

2719
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:07,300
but somebody's been doing it lately and that's really good.

2720
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:11,300
And then tonight we have a new podcast to play for you all right after the show,

2721
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:13,140
at least live on the Voicegeese network.

2722
02:10:13,140 --> 02:10:15,940
If you're listening on the podcast, you can go to vognetwork.com

2723
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:19,140
and listen whenever you want to our newest show, The Far Way Nearby.

2724
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:20,260
Anyway, that is it.

2725
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,820
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2726
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:23,940
I'll start tonight.

2727
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:28,980
My final thought is I really should play some more Overwatch

2728
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:32,260
because I have completely missed out on that holiday event.

2729
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:34,900
I need to get some of my loot boxes in Overwatch.

2730
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:36,740
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2731
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:42,260
My final thought is I hope to play some more games this week.

2732
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:43,700
Yes, please do.

2733
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:45,460
That's your homework assignment.

2734
02:10:45,460 --> 02:10:47,620
Play a game or make a game.

2735
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:48,120
You choose.

2736
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:49,940
I do want to do that.

2737
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:56,100
I've been just working on stuff for work because we have to switch systems.

2738
02:10:56,100 --> 02:11:00,660
And my old macros that I wrote for terminal stuff doesn't work anymore

2739
02:11:00,660 --> 02:11:01,620
because they're shutting it off.

2740
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:03,060
Work is important.

2741
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:06,420
And it's not really, this isn't, this is kind of above and beyond stuff.

2742
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:10,580
Well, last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought?

2743
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:16,900
I want a banana covered in chocolate.

2744
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:19,220
I was going to say, I just saw Alan bring back bananas.

2745
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:20,340
If you want a banana.

2746
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:25,060
No, I want a specifically, I want a banana covered in chocolate in the middle of Pinkberry.

2747
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:27,780
Oh, well, I've been to Pinkberry at an age.

2748
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:29,860
I can help you with one of the three of those things.

2749
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:31,620
They have the new Pink Beast chocolate.

2750
02:11:31,620 --> 02:11:33,060
It's made with Ghirardelli.

2751
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:33,620
It's all right.

2752
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:35,940
I haven't been to Pinkberry in a long time either.

2753
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:38,340
I'm actually going to be going to hang out with Becky.

2754
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:41,700
Now it's not Yogurtland, but now there's a new one.

2755
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:42,660
Meet Menchies.

2756
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:43,380
I think that's it.

2757
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:45,860
That's the one that Alan likes to go to now.

2758
02:11:45,860 --> 02:11:46,580
And I like it too.

2759
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:48,180
So they have all the crazy.

2760
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:50,420
Isn't Menchie the dog from...

2761
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:53,220
I might be saying it wrong, but I feel like that's the name of the place.

2762
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:54,260
Call it Munchies.

2763
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:54,660
Munchies.

2764
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:54,900
All right.

2765
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:57,860
Anyway, that needs to be a fast food joint right there.

2766
02:11:57,860 --> 02:11:58,340
Munchies.

2767
02:11:59,220 --> 02:12:01,060
I think that's Jack in the Box's specialty.

2768
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:01,700
All right.

2769
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:02,500
That's it.

2770
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:03,700
Good night, everybody.

2771
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:04,420
That's a show.

2772
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:05,860
We'll see you in seven days.

2773
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:06,180
Bye.

2774
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:09,540
