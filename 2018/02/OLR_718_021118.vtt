This week, as each new game in the shooty-crafty genre welcomes a new pool of players, Fortnite claims the record concurrent player's crown from player-announced Battlegrounds. This is just one new battle for the gaming ages, stay tuned for the rest of the week's news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back. It's another week at the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 718 for this, February the 11th of 2018.

00:44.000 --> 00:57.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and sadly not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but she will be joining us by phone a little later in the show. Here in studio we have, as he usually is, Techmaster Loki.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hello.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm fine.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Good to see you, good for you to be here.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
What's new with you? How's life?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Nothing really new.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
How's the DDR machine?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
It's still DDR-ing.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah, are you actually still using it?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, for at least 30 minutes a day.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Nice. Is it like, is it like weight? You didn't notice an effect on that? Like getting that extra exercise?

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
No, I'm still working on the diet part of that. But I've been pretty good about like eating, what's that for?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Well I was going to say, bringing 12 breadsticks to OLR.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I did not eat all 12 breadsticks. I didn't have like six of them.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
You did very good. I was supposed to start a diet today and I still ate a breadstick.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
And to be fair, I mean, yeah it's not the best way to do a diet, but like I'm still well within my calories even though I ate those six breadsticks.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Because I really didn't eat it. I had like, this is like a small thing of cereal in the morning. Like very small.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
And then like nothing the rest of the day. Which is not the way you're supposed to do it.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
No, you don't want to starve yourself. That's not the way to do it.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
But weekends for me like throw off my rhythm anyway. Like if I have to diet, I have to fix my weekday routine.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Like I have to eat a better breakfast. I have to not buy candy bars from the vending machine at work.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
I have to, you know, not eat out all the time at lunch. Or if I do eat out, you know, make better choices.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
That's where I can really make changes. The weekend is always weird, you know.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
And I, often times I find that I'm traveling a lot on the weekend and that screws up stuff too, you know.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, so I mean I've been good for the most part. I've been pretty good. So we'll see how it works out.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Alright. Well I want to introduce our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
So if you are joining us in chat, a big hello to you guys.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Which I think we have some faces who I haven't seen in a while. We have some new faces as well.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
So we've got a whole lot of kind of a different mixture of folks tonight.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
I see the Rob D, who I haven't seen in a long, long time, is listening to the show again tonight.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
How are you doing? Hope you're doing good, Rob. We missed this day in gaming. Or was that the name of the show?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I don't know, but he had a great radio voice on that show.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
And then PJ Reno, who I think is newer to the show, is listening saying,

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm going to play Civ 6 while I listen. Civilization 6 got a new expansion just this past week.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
I need to check it out still. I've barely scratched the surface on Civ 6.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I mean, I played a couple games right when it first came out.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
And of course I love the new Christopher Ten song that's in the introduction, because those songs set the mood.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Right? Baba Yetu for Civ 4 set the mood.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
He didn't do the song for Civ 5, but the music in Civ 5 wasn't bad. It just wasn't the same.

03:34.000 --> 03:42.000
It kind of sets the mood of, those songs really say to me, like Baba Yetu, or the meaning of flight,

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
or whatever it translates to, the dream of flight. It's translated in Italian.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Those songs really say to me, like, prepare to lose your entire evening to this bullshit.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
It really sets that mood of, you know, kiss your evening goodbye.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
You're going to be up until 3am tonight because you don't know when to quit.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
That's what those very epic Grammy-winning and nominated songs say to me.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Are there a lot of Civilization streamers?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh sure, over on Twitch. I've seen a few.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, I mean, it's an intensely strategical game, so there's some people that will, you know, yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
And especially for the people that really like to find that mix between IRL streaming and Civ 6,

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
you don't have to think a lot while you're playing Civ 6, but it's not action-oriented.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
If you sit there and take a long time taking your turn, you're not really going to get penalized for that.

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
So people that like to interact with their audience a little more probably actually favor a game like Civilization,

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
where you're not, you know, when I'm playing something like Overwatch, I'm going to have to focus on the match the whole time,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
because you don't really get a chance to stop and catch your breath. You know what I mean?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
So I think that's why Civ does pretty well over there.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
It's not, I mean, it's not in the top 25 games, but there's an audience for it. There sure is.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
Let's see, over in our chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm looking at some other comments.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh, Rob D. corrects me on the name. This Day in Gaming. I apologize.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
It was a long, long, long time ago. TDig.

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
Let's see, also in chat, PJ Reno saying, my hubby's playing Monster Hunting World.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
He rented it from a red box.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
I wanted to play Monster Hunter World, but I don't, I watched, we did the SharePlay thing.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I did the SharePlay thing with Shane, because he has it and he's really into it right now.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
And I wasn't, I wasn't feeling it. Like I remember playing the demo on the Wii U, and I thought it was awful.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Like I just wasn't into it. And then I was kind of watching Shane play it.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And I was like, I don't know, these battles don't look like my kind of thing.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Like I kind of see the Phantasy Star Online element of it that looks really fun.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
You know, you know, I love me some Phantasy Star Online, Phantasy Star Universe,

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
but I didn't like the whole, like, you know, you're, you're whacking on the monster over and over and over again.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
And then it kind of runs off. And I don't know, maybe, maybe if I explored more of the classes,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
you could play in it and found something I like, I'd probably be into it more.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
I like the Final Fantasy ripoff Monster Hunter game they did on 3DS, Final Fantasy Explorers, I think it was called.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I like that one, but I could be like a black mage and stuff.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
And, you know, I didn't necessarily have to like actually like chase monsters in melee range or any of that.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
So, but I know Monster Hunter World has its fans, so I'm not, I'm not dogging your game.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
It's just, you know, not everything's for everyone. I couldn't really get into it at first.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't want to drop 60 bucks on a game that I don't feel really, really good about.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
If that makes sense.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
Let's see, also looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, see the bestest man in chat says,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
civilization is the closest I get to referring to a game as crack.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Yep, pretty much. Those games are, you know, there's a reason why the just one turn quote,

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
one more turn quote is pretty infamous out there because it's very easy to think,

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
oh, the next turn is when I'm going to get some big science discovery that's going to change the game

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
or, oh, one more turn until I invade that capital city and it's just, you know, one more

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
and then suddenly it's 4 a.m. and we're, look at your life, look at your choices.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
All right, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about another video game franchise.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
I know we are really into, so a lot of news coming out this weekend about Loki.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Kingdom Hearts 3. So the epic guest, I didn't know that they had an expo in Japan for D23.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I didn't either.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
So apparently that's a thing.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
It makes sense though. I mean, Disney's huge in Japan. The D23 expo does very well here in the States.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
So it makes sense that Japan gets their own version of it.

07:37.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah, so they had, you know, a new trailer for Kingdom Hearts 3 and they even still says it's 2018.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
So I'm hoping that that stays true. But the big thing that they showed off, of course, was one new world

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
and it's Monsters, Inc. world. So they have, you know, Sora, Donald, and what the fuck, Goofy.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Goofy looks fucking nuts.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, they're all monsters basically, but cute Pixar-ified monsters.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
Right, exactly. So it's cute. Like the trailer, they have, one of the gameplay trailers I saw was, you know,

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
Boo calling Donald Mike Wazowski because healing has one eye in that world as well.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I was like, no, but I'm Mike Wazowski.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
So it looks like Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be a lot of Pixar-influenced stuff, right?

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Because we have, what, Big Hero 6, we have Toy Story, we have Monsters, Inc.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
There's a lot of the Pixar-

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I think Hero 6 is in Pixar though.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh, I thought it was.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
No, that was just Disney animation. And same with Tangle, that's also Disney animation.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
It's just now all the Disney animation is not social.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
That's right. Princess and the Frog was their last traditionally animated movie, right?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah, that's exactly the best way to go out, but yeah, that was.

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
I like that movie, come on. Tiana's one of my faves. I like Tiana because she wasn't just born into the princess-dom.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
She worked her way there.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, I give it that. It's just the story's kinda meh. I don't know.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

09:05.000 --> 09:13.000
It was alright. But yeah, I mean, it looks good. See, the problem is, like, for me, like, I never really played a lot of the Kingdom Hearts games.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
I played a little bit of one, and, like, I'm so lost in what the story is right now.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, yeah, it blows me away that the story is intended for, I guess, children. I'm using my quotey fingers.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
God, God, my children would never be able to follow this.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah, right? I was like, maybe it's not really for kids. I guess maybe it would. But even adults have a hard time understanding it.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
So, sometimes it's just not about the plot, but it's about, ooh, it's pretty, and ooh, I'm in Tron World, yay!

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
You know, it's just kinda the little throwbacks to your youth. Although, I mean, I would go for some real deep cuts.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Like, I wanna see, like, Muppet Baby's world, where we have to dodge Nanny.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm still waiting since now.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
And then Skeeter just disappears halfway through.

09:59.000 --> 10:08.000
Now with, you know, everything, we're gonna have Star Wars World and Avengers World. I mean, that's gonna be pretty amazing at some point.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Hmm.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
And you were talking before the show, maybe Bad Movie World would be a lot of fun.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
Yes, I would love to see a whole new game. It's not necessarily Kingdom Hearts, but it's just like going through terrible movies.

10:19.000 --> 10:28.000
So instead of, you know, having the classics like, you know, I don't know, Cinderella and stuff, it's just like The Room or Manos Hands of Fate.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Showgirls.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Showgirls.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Yes. Keeping an E for everyone rated game. That would be a really good time.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, like Goofy's like, why am I wearing fishnets and heels?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Plan 9.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Eraserhead, I don't know.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
That'd be fun. I don't know if that would be a Kingdom Hearts game, but maybe that's another game somebody could make someday.

10:50.000 --> 10:58.000
Somebody did make a game based on The Room, actually. There was, like, some Newgrounds, one of those types of games.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Was there like a point and click adventure game?

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, one of those types of things. But it had like the Super Nintendo looking graphics and stuff.

11:04.000 --> 11:12.000
So there was a game based on The Room, but it wasn't Kingdom Hearts style. It was more 90s PC game, I suppose.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Ah.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
So something else I guess we learned about Kingdom Hearts was that there is a new Utada Hikaru song.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Well, we knew she was gonna do one, but now we got more details on it, right?

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, they actually have clips of both the English and the Japanese versions of the song.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Well, I'm sure many of you ran out to find those clips as soon as it was announced they were out there.

11:32.000 --> 11:40.000
But just in case you haven't heard yet, here's the song in Japanese, which is called Chikai, which is like oath or vow.

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
I like the scene that they're showing in the trailer here, which I don't know the character's name because, like I said, I don't play a lot of these Kingdom Hearts games.

11:59.000 --> 12:08.000
But he's there with Mickey and he's talking about how he's gonna leave his keyblade behind and Mickey's just like, huh? What? I'm not paying attention, what?

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
That's all the dialogue that Mickey has, like, huh?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
King Mickey.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Huh? Yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
It's like, are you fucking paying attention? You're standing right here. Are you not listening to anything that I'm saying?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Here's the English version.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
I don't wanna know, baby. I don't wanna know everything. It's just fine.

12:35.000 --> 12:48.000
So it sounds a lot like, you know, her other works. It doesn't have that same kind of intensity of something like Simple and Clean, at least the Planet B remix or whatever that was that they used in the opening of the game.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
I feel like the original Simple and Clean was a little bit more of a ballad and then, you know, so her songs have been ballad-y for those games.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
So it'll be interesting to see, though, maybe if that song gets remixed and maybe they use that for an intense intro or whatever they choose to do.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
But Utada's sounding great.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Well, they have all those collections now on PlayStation 4, so I guess I gotta get those.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, if you wanna catch up, there's like an Uber, Ultimate, all the things collection on PlayStation 4.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
What I like that they do is that they take some of the side games and they just made them movies, basically.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
They just did a bunch of the cutscenes, they made them movies.

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
I think it would be worth it before Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out to do like a movie that just catches you up on the freaking story.

13:30.000 --> 13:39.000
I don't know, maybe it'd have to be a mini-series or something, or an entire Netflix binge season of 22 episodes or something.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Last time on Kingdom Hearts!

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, I mean, honestly, there's enough story there, they could do it.

13:45.000 --> 13:53.000
But obviously that would take a lot of work. It's not just as easy as recording all the cutscenes and putting it on television.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
If you want that, go to YouTube.

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm so surprised, though, that something that they would dedicate a lot of time to at a D23 event still doesn't have a big presence in Disneyland somewhere.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
You know, it's just kind of... I don't know.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
No, it is surprising. Well, I think it's because at the end of the day it's still Square Enix's thing, even though it has the Disney characters in it.

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
But in Japan, I know it's a little more mainstream, but it's not like you have a Sora Blacklight ride or anything like that.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
But I think you see some of the stuff for sale in the shops and things like that.

14:25.000 --> 14:33.000
I think I said it to this day, the one thing I absolutely regret was the one time I ever saw something Kingdom Hearts-related at Disneyland, I didn't buy it.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
And that was that store at California Adventure, the Off the Page, that has more of the art-based things.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
You can actually buy art that's on the wall, and they have sculptures, and they had a Sora sculpture.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
And so at the time it was a little bit out of my price range, but looking back I'm like,

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
I should have tried to make it work, because I've never seen anything Kingdom Hearts in the parks again since then.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah, that's too bad.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Except kids dressing up as Sora. I did see that.

15:01.000 --> 15:10.000
So I'm totally gonna dig when people are gonna be cosplaying, you know, Monsters Inc. Sora, so that'll be interesting.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com with some of the comments, Fantaz in chat says,

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
I'd be down for a Kingdom Hearts movie. In Act F degrees, I'd be down for that.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
TheRobD says, Kingdom Hearts' big flaw is that it tried to make its own continuity.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
The villains of Kingdom Hearts should be Disney villains.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
They kind of are, but I get that it's more complicated than that. There's a lot going on.

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
Because the Organization XIII is not a thing in the Disney universe.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
But when you're first playing the game, it sure feels like Maleficent and Hades and all that.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
But yeah, it did try to establish its own continuity and its own characters,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
but that was probably a little bit for Square Enix's benefit too.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
So, and Bobby Blackwell says, I think they reference it more in Tokyo Disneyland.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
And also bringing up this was done at D3, or D23 Japan. So Disney did acknowledge it over there.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
And to be fair, I seem to recall last year was when we got the announcement Toy Story would be in the game,

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
was at D23 America. So Disney hasn't completely ignored it.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
It just sometimes feels like Frozen gets a fuck of a lot more attention. Right?

16:23.000 --> 16:30.000
Um, yeah. Yes, Disney's grip on that movie. They need to let it go, let it go.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
Tiger Claw says, if they did a Kingdom Hearts movie, you know it won't be exactly like the game.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
They would probably change things around to make it work for the average audience.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm strangely okay with that, because I feel when it comes to the Kingdom Hearts story,

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
I may need it dumbed down for the average audience. So, anyway.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
So are you going to pick up Kingdom Hearts 3 when it comes out?

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
I mean, it looks interesting. The trailer is kind of like, it's like, yeah, this looks kind of cool.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
But it's just, I don't know. I'm not versed in Kingdom Hearts, unfortunately.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
I used to play, I played the original game when it first came out, because I was like, oh man, this is awesome.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I was like, way back in 2002 now.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
Right, yeah, I kind of just like, ehhh, and I never really finished it. My sister is more into it than I was.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
But, um, yeah, I never finished the original game, so I don't know.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
Bobby Black Wolf and Chad also following up, I do not believe the 2018 part of the trailer.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I'm guessing it gets delayed to March or April 2019.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Right, and it's just more wishful thinking. It'd be nice.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
I think Square's going to need a tentpole this holiday, and if it's not this, then it's going to be the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
And I would see this coming out before the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Although, the Final Fantasy 7 remake is supposed to be in episodes.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
But, if they push it back because it's not done, then, you know, fine, I support that.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I don't want them putting out a half-assed product.

17:56.000 --> 18:03.000
I'm going to try really hard to never be that guy again that gets pissed off at a delay ever since what happened to Mass Effect Andromeda.

18:03.000 --> 18:10.000
So, um, yeah, I mean, if they have to push it back for quality reasons, then fine, let it get pushed back.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
It would be nice if it was fourth quarter this year, but if it's not, you know, whatever.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
There'll be plenty of other stuff to play. Whatever Nintendo's going to put out fourth quarter.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
Oh darn, I'll just have to spend more time in Red Dead Redemption 2. That would be so tragic.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Which got pushed back to fourth quarter, right?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Yes, well, for now.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
For now.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I mean, that game looks like it's almost done.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Kingdom Hearts. Kingdom Hearts is what they showed.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It really has work in progress.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It looks pretty complete to me.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Yeah. Well, they've been working on it, god, how long?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
A very long time.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
They've been working on that game a very long time.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
So, I think we're all ready for it, but it's got to be done right.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
That's the important thing.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
So, usually at the top of the show, we like to talk about a little bit of our gaming weeks.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And how was your gaming week?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
What types of games have you been playing this week, Loki?

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I wish I played new things, but it's been basically the same stuff.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
So, a little bit of Stardew Valley.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I did play a little bit more Pokemon this week.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Have you romanced anyone in Stardew Valley yet?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
No, I haven't.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
But, because all the characters kind of irritate me.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Like a lot of them do.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It's honestly fair.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Shane's back, or he's kicked his alcohol problem, so way to go, Shane.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Congrats.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
But, like, I forgot to mention this last week, actually.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
So, because I've gotten...

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
You know me, I like to cheat in games.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
And so, I, of course, am playing with a trainer just to stop some of the...

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Because you have limited energy and stuff, and it's just a pain.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
I have to keep running back to the house every few minutes just because you're out of energy.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm young and invincible. I have limitless energy.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
Exactly. So, with that, I bumped all the relationships up to max and stuff.

19:55.000 --> 20:03.000
So, the only downside to that, though, is that I get cutscenes all the fucking time.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Like, every time I go near a house, it's like four cutscenes.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Or go into another place that's like four more cutscenes.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
So, finally, that's kind of died down a bit.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
But, one of the cutscenes I got to when I went to the beach was one of the...

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
I don't remember the guy's name, but he has this long, blonde hair or something like that.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Kind of looks like a Fabio type guy. He's a writer.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Anyways, and so, he's like, hey, you want to go rowing on my boat?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm like, uh, okay.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
And so, the dude tries kissing me on there. I'm like, dude, what the hell?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
It's like fucking Dennis because of the implication.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
You can't say no because what are they going to do?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
They're going to dump you off the side of the boat.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
They have to say yes because of the implication.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
So, it's just weird. All these characters trying to romance me. I'm like, dude, okay.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Well, maybe next time you'll set the boundaries with Fabio before you do.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Dude, Fabio, listen.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
It ain't like that.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
I understand you're living in your shack on the beach, writing.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I don't fucking care.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It's like, whatever.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
But, no, it's a silly game.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
And actually reading up on it, there's actually a lot more to it.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Once I've finished some of the stuff, there's more questing stuff in there that you can do.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's alright.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
So, I've been playing that a bit.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
And then, of course, I've been doing my routine of Dance Dance Revolution every day.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
So, it's been slowly getting easier to do stuff.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I still can't do the things I used to be able to do.

21:27.000 --> 21:35.000
Every now and then I'll try to, hey, let's play Aeon Heavy and see how well we can do that.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Nope, can't do that still.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
Or my kids, God bless them, will decide, hey, I'm going to pick this song.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And so, I'll just leave it on whatever.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And they hit random.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And I didn't get a chance to play it.

21:50.000 --> 21:58.000
So, it's like I'm playing Orion 78, the 2MB remix or whatever, Civilization remix.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I'm like, dude, what the hell?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And they're playing on beginner.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
And they're like, okay, this is easy.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Keeping you in the game.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
Esther 200, Matt in Chat says, do you still remember the step charts for most of the songs?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
No, because I used to play doubles.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
So, now I'm playing singles.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
And so, I don't remember most of the step charts for the songs.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Now I'm starting to recognize them more because I'm playing some of the same songs over and over.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
But I don't.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I don't remember any of them.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Like, Dynamite Rave, I even went and played basic on that.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Just like, I don't remember this anymore.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
So, it's alright.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Yeah, so I've been doing that.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
And then, what else?

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
I played a little bit of Lego Marvel's Super Heroes 2, just on the grind, unlocking everything to 100% the game.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
But that's what it feels like right now. It's just a grind.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
It's kind of not really entertaining anymore.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
It wasn't really that much of an entertaining game to begin with.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
The earlier games are much better.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
And then, a little bit of Ingress.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Just normally when I'm playing Pokemon Go or whatever, it's both Ingress and Pokemon Go at the same time.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I've done that, yeah.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
So, that's what I did today. I was down at the Arcade Creek Park, which has a ton of portals there.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
So, I was able to do both and stock up on Pokeballs because I was getting low.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
That's about it.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I feel like I've barely played any Ingress this week, actually.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I know, I just was throwing really long links to things.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Whenever I had keys available, I'm like, eh, who's gonna yell at me?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
If it throws, it goes.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Exactly. What are you gonna do? Yell at me? I don't have the app on.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I don't have notifications on. I don't care.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
I honestly think in your part of town, garbage links are encouraged, I think, over where you're at.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
So, it's all good.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Anyway, let's see, my gaming week. Well, then I'll piggyback off that.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
So, even though I haven't been playing a lot of Ingress, I played a shit ton of Pokemon Go, like, yesterday.

23:52.000 --> 23:59.000
And that was because the reason why I was playing a lot of Pokemon Go is because I'm able to use my Bluetooth, you know, catching device to catch stuff.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
Because yesterday, I had a friend from out of town who was visiting and he didn't know a lot about Sacramento because he's just recently moved here from back east.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
So, we were going to the Capitol, we were going to Midtown, we were going to Old Town, we were going to the Art Museum.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
We walked, like, everywhere. I probably walked several miles yesterday.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
But the nice thing about having the Bluetooth is I was catching Pokemon, like, everywhere I went.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
And because they're doing that Gen 3 event right now, I'm catching nothing but the Gen 3 stuff.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
Which, you know, like the Trapinch, there's a lot of those downtown because Capitol Park's the nest for Trapinch right now.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
And then, you know, just a variety of different stuff.

24:34.000 --> 24:41.000
So, that's cool because I don't know what's going to happen when it goes back to, you know, Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
How much these newer Gen 3 things are going to show up because there's only so many limited spawn points.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
I have to admit, I really like this whole, like, one Gen at a time type of thing.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And I hope Niantic kind of does this stuff a little more often.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
And they should feel free to do it even with just Gen 1 and Gen 2, like, go back to old school.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Don't do it forever, but just for a couple days.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Or even just mix it up where stuff normally spawns, like, you know, hey, let's put water.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
I like the water Pokemon event they did because we don't really live near a lot of water.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
So, it was nice to be able to, you know, catch Dratini's and all sorts of things everywhere.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Well, and I always thought one thing they could do, and they have a model for it from Ingress,

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
is because Ingress divides the world into different cells, you know.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
So, for example, Sacramento is in one cell. It's like a scoring cell in Ingress.

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
And you start to move west, and somewhere between Sacramento and Davis, which a lot of people know from the university there,

25:33.000 --> 25:39.000
there's a line that separates. So, Davis is in a different cell that it's shared with San Francisco.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
So, my point with all that is that, you know, it would be cool if maybe monsters,

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
because I'm sick of this, like, region-locked shit, as I think a lot of us are, where it's like,

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
now there's a new one that's only in Africa, you know, and it's like...

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Oh, right, let me hop on a plane.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Hop on a plane.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
You know, I understand the desire to do region exclusives.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
I understand that as a mobile game that needs to have years and years long longevity,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
they need to make some of these things really hard to catch.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
But at the same time, like, why not, you know, mix it up?

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
I think the one they're doing the best is the Mongoose, Zangoose, and Seviper. Is that it?

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
Where they were exclusive in some places for a little bit, and then they switched.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
And then during this event right now, they have the minus one that's usually in Asia.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Little Pikachus that are plus and minus. Plus hole and...

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Yeah, I got the minus one.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah, because you weren't supposed to get that in Quiddifingers because that was exclusive to Asia,

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
but during this Gen 3 event, they are having minion everywhere.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
And I like stuff like that. Like, that makes it cool and that gives you incentive to go out, like, every day and do stuff.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
And they still have four more generations of Pokemon to catch up on before they're current, you know.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
And then even after that, then they'll be Gen 8 at some point, you know what I mean?

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
So, I still feel like there's a lot of ways Niantic can kind of better divvy this up.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
But for the time being, I really like the Gen 3 exclusive event and I hope they do more stuff like that in the future.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
I talked a lot more about Pokemon Go than I planned to.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Other stuff I've been playing is a lot of the same old samples.

27:12.000 --> 27:19.000
Probably because of Pokemon Go, I was like, I should go find my copy of Pokemon Alpha Sapphire and I'm going to play that again.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
So, in my rush to clear out my file in Alpha Sapphire, I was like, oh, wait.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
But I have, like, legendaries that I got through codes or through the download thing.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I don't want to get rid of those. I don't want to delete them off my file.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
So, I'm going to transfer them into the Pokemon bank.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
So, I had to download the Pokemon bank and get that up and running.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
So, I did that and then I was like, oh, but the Pokemon bank, oh, that's right.

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
That's how you get the stuff from Pokemon Crystal or Silver, well, and Crystal, and Pokemon Yellow and stuff on virtual consoles.

27:45.000 --> 27:52.000
I was like, I want to go back and play Pokemon Yellow on virtual consoles so I can bring, like, Pikachu and shit into my new Alpha Sapphire game.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.000
And now it's, here I go again where I'm never going to have the attention span to just play one fucking Pokemon game from start to finish.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
I never do. I even, like, I, you know, Shane's a good friend of mine and plays a lot of Pokemon.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
So, I even sent him a picture of my save file in Alpha Sapphire where I have six badges.

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
And I was like, Shane, I don't know if I should start over because I have six badges. I'm, like, this close to the end of the game.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
He's like, just start over. You'll catch up.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
So, I guess I'm going to start over. We'll see.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
Let's see, I'm looking for comments over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
It looks like they're talking about DDR tournaments in the chat room.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
I guess there was a couple of those this weekend.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Yeah, there was the international one, I think.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Didn't they, like, debut a new song or something like that?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Oh, probably. I'm so out of the loop on that stuff.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
But you know what I did like was the, what's the new name of the game? The Dance Rush.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
As some, Dancing Stage Rush.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Dance Rush, yeah.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
Remix, the third, Lupin, I don't, what, whatever that game is called.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Dance Rush.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Dance, well, no, it has a new name now.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
It has dance, no, it has dance and rush in it, but it's, like, dancing over rush.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
I thought that was just a specific version that was, like, because it was linked together.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Oh, is it?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I thought that's what it was. That's how I interpreted it.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
I don't know. Well, whatever that game is, where now it's, like, the whole floor is, you know, like, what you dance on.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
That game looks really cool and I want to check that out when it inevitably comes over here.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
Yes, and it'll be nice because by the time it eventually gets out over here, hopefully I'll be back in shape enough to where I can actually play it.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Yay!

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
That's the spirit.

29:25.000 --> 29:34.000
As far as other games I've been playing, I'm still playing an unhealthy amount of Final Fantasy XIV, but that game just got a patch a week ago, so there's, like, more things to do in that.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
I just did the primal, the new primal fight, the Jade Stoa, or what's the monster's name, Byako.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I did that for the first time and that was cool.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And then I've been playing Heroes of the Storm.

29:44.000 --> 29:53.000
I ended up getting a stim pack and one of my loot chests, which will double the amount of experience you earn, so it just makes you want to play more Heroes of the Storm, so I've been doing that.

29:53.000 --> 30:02.000
And I find that I'm really, my favorite character to play, I think, right now in that game is Lieutenant Morales, who's kind of a healer, but the other players really love you when you play Morales.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
And Morales is the one that has one of the skins that's totally Samus.

30:06.000 --> 30:14.000
They can't say it's Samus, they have to say it's Space Explorer or something Morales, which, she's from fucking StarCraft, of course she's a Space Explorer.

30:14.000 --> 30:22.000
But, you know, they have to do a wink and a nod that it's not really Samus, but it's an orange and yellow suit with the green vibe, like it's fucking Samus.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Just not in name.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Not Samus.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Yeah, not dash Samus.

30:27.000 --> 30:35.000
Alright, so yeah, that's been my gaming week. A lot more MMOs and Heroes of the Storm and a little bit of Pokemon.

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
Some housekeeping, so follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
And no shows that we're canceling in the near future.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Next week is President's Day weekend, which is a three day weekend for me, but I don't think it is for everybody.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Not for me.

30:51.000 --> 30:58.000
Yeah, so, but we will be here on Sunday night, so I'm looking at maybe taking a quick trip, but we should be back by Sunday night in order to do the show.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
Maybe have some guests, if it works out the way it's supposed to. Some of my pals in the Bay Area were supposed to go on a trip with me.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
So we'll see, I don't know. We might have some guests next week. That would be fun.

31:07.000 --> 31:18.000
And then, what else? Oh, at the end of March, though, we will be missing a show, but I'll remind you guys about that as it gets closer, because I am going way out of town in March.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
So, meanwhile, let's get into what else is going on in gaming. So, some more gaming news. Loki.

31:24.000 --> 31:32.000
So, Twitch has added some new policies for sexual content and harassment on its platform to try to clean things up.

31:32.000 --> 31:42.000
Mainly because there's been quite the, quite the trend in what some people call titty streamers.

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
Where they basically are dressed very provocatively and kind of using that to get, you know, bits and other donations.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
Kind of, you know, oh, I'm gonna bend over and stretch or do yoga or whatever the hell it is.

31:55.000 --> 32:05.000
You know, playing my game with my top. I mean, that's fine. You can dress like that all you want, but you know what? There are, y'all are gonna pay it and they're not.

32:05.000 --> 32:14.000
I don't see the quote unquote problem with that, but I get, I mean, but I get that Twitch doesn't want their reputation to be that that is what they are.

32:14.000 --> 32:22.000
There's a difference between, it's just that it keeps getting pushed, I think, more and more. Like, who's gonna argue? Well, you can't wear that. No one's gonna make that argument.

32:22.000 --> 32:36.000
But until it keeps getting pushed further and further. So, they now have, you know, a little bit more policy, including, you know, that attire is, that you cannot wear an attire that tended to be sexually suggestive.

32:36.000 --> 32:43.000
Oh, darn it. That's what I was gonna wear tonight. No fishnet top for me tonight.

32:43.000 --> 32:50.000
Undergarments, intimate apparel or exposing slash focusing on male or female genitals, buttocks or nipples.

32:50.000 --> 32:58.000
Wait, I thought they banned a lot of this stuff a long time ago. I thought you weren't, like, there were a lot of dudes who streamed shirtless, and I thought you weren't supposed to do that anymore.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I thought they did that a long time ago.

33:00.000 --> 33:15.000
I thought that what was happening was that these streamers that were doing this were actually being treated more kindly than, you know, by the Twitch staff than other streamers because they were getting away with more of this stuff.

33:15.000 --> 33:28.000
Because, you know, they thought they could gain favor with them or some nonsense. But whatever, that it's, it makes sense. This is like, you know, this is a platform where I don't know if they have really age gating in this stuff.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
So, I mean, kids are gonna be exposed to this. You know, we gotta think of everybody. Think of the children.

33:32.000 --> 33:46.000
Also, they're saying that, you know, attire in gaming streams and most at home streams and all profile slash channel imagery should be appropriate for public street, mall or restaurant.

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
As a reminder, we will not tolerate using this policy as a basis to harass streamers on or off Twitch.

33:53.000 --> 34:07.000
Sorry, sorry. Have you all been to Kentucky Fried Chicken? Sometimes, like, some of the things, I mean, I'll never forget. It was before going to Rocky Horror, which, yeah, it again is a whole lingerie clothing thing of its own.

34:07.000 --> 34:21.000
My pal Victoria from Shaking Your Crying, when she lived up here, and I, we went to a KFC in South San Francisco, and we saw some choices in the outfit department there. Some real choices.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
And then, of course, you know, along with that, they're saying that in addition to these, they also mentioned...

34:28.000 --> 34:36.000
I'm sorry, I have to cut you off. Bobby Blackwell says, have you been to Walmart? Thank you. You're right. There's a whole website, thepeopleofwalmart.com. That's a mall in Walmart Mall.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
It's not a mall. It's a shopping...

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
Yeah, but they have subways and vision centers. It's a mall.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
Okay, sorry, I won't cut you off again.

34:47.000 --> 34:58.000
Anyways, then they were saying that, you know, we're also looking at Twitch list emotes, stream titles, camera angles, as contextual elements as well they'll be monitoring.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
So, you know, if you have a crotch cam, maybe not the best thing to be, you know, putting on Twitch.

35:03.000 --> 35:15.000
You know, of course, along with that, they're saying that with that, you know, the camera angles, emotes, panels, attires, overlays, chat moderation, offering access to prohibited sexual content,

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
such as ludes on Twitch also remains prohibited.

35:20.000 --> 35:31.000
And basically saying if someone gets reported for breaking our community guidelines based on sexual content, we will take a holistic look at the channel.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
So meaning that...

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
We're gonna bookmark all of those channels.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
I think that means that they have to take... they're really trying to figure out what's the intent.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
If your intent is to sell sex, they don't want that on Twitch.

35:44.000 --> 36:01.000
If your intent is to show off the game and you just happen to be a very attractive person who wears very attractive clothing and maybe incidentally had a camera shot that you didn't realize was pointed at your chest or at your crotch or something, then, you know, they're not gonna... they're not gonna question that.

36:01.000 --> 36:12.000
Don't get me wrong. Like, I watched a lot of Twitch during... I had a thing for work that we were studying esports and streaming and Twitch and stuff like that.

36:12.000 --> 36:23.000
But we watched a lot of Twitch streams and stuff and we did encounter quite a few Twitch streamers that, you know, they're women and they're using their looks to, you know, get more people interested in the channel.

36:23.000 --> 36:31.000
And that's not a terrible thing, but there are some people that take that too far and to the point where they know that's bringing people in, getting people to donate.

36:31.000 --> 36:41.000
And it's kind of like, hey, where are you across the line between this being, you know, Twitch and Chatterbait or, you know, just... you have to draw the line.

36:41.000 --> 36:50.000
I think that's what it is. I see in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Harry Chestman, who I guess is streaming and is fishing at top right now, says Twitch is for gaming.

36:50.000 --> 36:58.000
Twitch is blurring a little bit. I mean, Twitch is for cooking and competitive eating and Twitch is for IRL streams.

36:58.000 --> 37:07.000
But I get it. Like, Twitch is... I think it would be more accurate to say Twitch is not for sex. And so that's why Twitch is trying to have to draw a line here.

37:08.000 --> 37:16.000
Right. Yeah. So why? And so if your intent is to be a titty streamer or, you know, and there's dudes that do the same.

37:16.000 --> 37:23.000
You know, go to some of the, you know, like gay oriented or even straight oriented. There's enough women that watch Twitch.

37:23.000 --> 37:31.000
There's some dudes out there that are selling it just the same, although it may not be, you know, they don't have titties in the same way.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
They sit there shirtless or they do other stuff.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
No one wants to see me sit shirtless and play a game.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
No. I don't want to see me do that.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Even though that may be a way, I do play games a lot, but no one's going to want to watch it.

37:42.000 --> 37:49.000
That's a private thing. When the cameras aren't on, when I'm not doing OLR podcasts or I'm not doing...

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
I'm probably on the couch without pants playing a particular game, you know?

37:54.000 --> 38:01.000
And I will say this. I do remember doing one livestream where I wasn't wearing pants.

38:01.000 --> 38:08.000
I was wearing like a snuggie, a blanket over my legs, but you can't see that part.

38:08.000 --> 38:14.000
And I made sure the whole time I kept reminding myself, don't stand up to get to the restroom or anything like that.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Like if you do, turn the camera off to someone like that, but you can only see...

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Oh, and now Rob's on stream fails.

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah, right. No, I don't know that. Well, I mean, I'd be wearing something so you wouldn't see everything, but you know what I mean.

38:25.000 --> 38:33.000
You fill in the blanks. But that's actually a trick that they use in regular television too, at least.

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
I don't think it works as well in the age of HD, but I know back in the day when I interned for a TV station,

38:39.000 --> 38:46.000
like the weatherman, when he would do his report and stuff, he was wearing a nice suit top and all that stuff,

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
and tie and stuff, and then jeans, because you didn't see anything below the waist.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
So you couldn't tell that he wasn't wearing slacks or a full suit outfit or nice shoes.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
It was like they had a nice top and then jeans and sneakers.

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
I can't trust that man. He doesn't have floral pants on. He doesn't know anything about weather.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
But I think now in this day and age, it doesn't matter.

39:06.000 --> 39:13.000
That's kind of like the thing though. That's pretty common to wear kind of like a formal top and jeans.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
Yeah, but on the nightly news, you're supposed to look totally formal for whatever reason.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
On the nightly news, anyway, if you're on one of those talk shows, Ellen doesn't really dress up for her show.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
She doesn't have to, so it just depends on what you're doing.

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
I thought there were other Twitch guidelines about if you got reported, they were going to look at some of the things.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I know this was the really controversial thing.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
They were going to look at some of the things you weren't necessarily just doing on your channel.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
They were going to look at what you were doing on your social media and what you were going to be doing outside of that.

39:48.000 --> 39:58.000
I think the intent is that if you are bullying people on social media or you're being a real asshole outside of Twitch,

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
if you're an affiliate or partner, you're still kind of representing Twitch.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
They said that they are not monitoring other platforms.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
It means when finally a report, users can provide documentation that illustrates harassment.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Oh, we'll not be monitoring those platforms.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
So, yeah, if they're finally a report, they can include stuff from other platforms.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I guess, I don't know.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
Looking in chat at live.vognetwork.com, the Rob D says,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
It very much sounds like they're trying to avoid specifics.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I kind of agree.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
I really do think they're trying to keep it vague from a legal perspective.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
They probably kind of have to, especially if somebody gets really mad.

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
Somebody who does make a lot, a lot of money suddenly gets shut down by Twitch.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I'd imagine there's going to be a little bit of pushback there.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
But look at what's going on right now with that guy.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I don't even remember his name and I don't even want to say it.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Logan Paul.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
But the guy who went to the forest, and we all know that was terrible what he did there.

40:59.000 --> 41:07.000
But now, in the past week, YouTube has pretty much, they haven't banned him, but they kicked him off the ad network.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
He fucking liked animal cruelty on a mouse or something.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
He tased a dead rat.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
I heard he gave mouth to mouth to a fish or something like that.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I cannot.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
He's a douchebag. What are you going to say?

41:22.000 --> 41:27.000
I can't fucking believe after what he went through in Japan and with all that,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
and he comes out this boohoo, I should have learned my lesson.

41:30.000 --> 41:36.000
I cannot believe, cannot believe after all that he thought it would be a good idea or a funny idea.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
To fucking taser rat.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Here's why. Because that controversy got him more followers.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
He ended up in the positive on the whole thing with that.

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
And he probably, I mean, he's making money off YouTube, but he's making, he, if you watch any of his videos,

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
and I don't, I watch other people that talk about his videos.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
They, he just pimps out merchandise.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
They're selling merchandise and that's where they're making their money is off merchandise.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
He just bought a seven million dollar mansion.

42:05.000 --> 42:12.000
You know, and so he's doing well off and he figured any controversy gets him more views

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
because the people that follow him don't give a shit.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
It's the people that are, you know, in an outrage aren't watching him in the first place.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
I don't want to hear stop stupid people from being famous ever again at the Kardashians

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
when there's guys like this in the world.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
The Kardashians are nothing.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
At least the Kardashians know how to make a movie.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
It's like you look, you look at, but you look at like what the Kardashians do

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
and it's not as irritating as fucking Logan Paul.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
It's just in their whole family is like that.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Like their dad came out defending Logan Paul and he's a douchebag as well.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Like he was in one of their videos.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
He was making out with some like teenage girl or something like that is super, super cringy.

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
It's terrible, but like it, the whole family is like that.

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
And it just, the sooner they like get wiped off of, you know, the internet, the better.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Bobby, Bobby just reminds me of an important fact here.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
Yet YouTube kicked us off their network.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
Well, you know, to be fair, Bobby, we were, we're producing a ton of videos for, you know, VOG,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
but I totally get the point.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
Like it does feel like kind of like a whole, like how the fuck are guys like that successful

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
and other hard, so many other hard working people are.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
So like, okay, so the Logan Paul thing, he was basically taking a break from YouTube for a while

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
because they let the heat die down or whatever.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
So by accident, YouTube somehow sends out notifications to people

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
that aren't even subscribed to his channel or following him

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
that, hey, Logan Paul's back, go check out his videos.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
And then people are like, what the fuck is this shit?

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
And they're all, Oh yeah, sorry. It was a setting.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It was a glitch setting thing.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Why is YouTube playing into that hype?

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
I don't know because it makes them money, I guess.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
They're making money off of it because of the views and ads.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
I, you know, I am getting to this point where I'm more and more like,

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
fuck YouTube with a capital F and a capital Y.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
I just want to like strip all my videos off their site.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I was looking at trying to put shaking and crying up on YouTube

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
so that more people could find it to download it.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
And I'm at, give me this point where I'm like, no,

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
I mean, I'm just going to tell those other people they need to find a better other way

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
and stop supporting YouTube because YouTube is so much garbage all over the place.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
So much. And it's not even just like this Logan Paul,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
but clearly when they send out emails like this, it's like, Logan Paul's back.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
Like, you know, that just shows they're working with him and they want.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
It's just, it is, seriously.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
And the hard part about this is you have this douchebag

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
that's causing all these site-wide changes because of the shit he's doing

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
and it's affecting other YouTubers that are doing this stuff.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
There'll be guys, there was a guy that did an experiment just for sillies.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
He took, he took his pee, I guess, and he let it like dry out

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
and got the nitrates from it and made black powder from it,

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
which it took like, I think like 18 months or something to do that.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
And he put the video on the, oh, because he's making explosives,

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
you know, that's a strike against him or something.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
It was just like a science thing.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
It's not like anyone would actually use that to create a bomb.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
I'm going to store all my pee from like several years

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
and make bombs out of that.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It's just, it's silly.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
Uh, yeah, we need a decent competitor to YouTube, we really do.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
And the Rob D points out a good point,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
is that Twitch isn't trying to do the same thing

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
and Dailymotion and Vimeo don't cut it.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
Twitch is inching closer and closer to that direction though,

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
because they are trying to do more like with the videos on demand,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
but they have to just have a premiere live on your channel or something,

45:45.000 --> 45:49.000
you know, but I mean, as a primarily gaming content creator,

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
I wouldn't have a hard time moving all my stuff over to Twitch.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
Um, but I would wonder how is Twitch going to police all this stuff?

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
I mean, it sounds like it's,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
it's requiring more of their moderation team and their moderation.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
They're going to do the a word algorithms.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I sure as fuck hope not.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I really, cause that's where it's all going to break down.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
That's where it's all going to break down.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
Um, let's see, act deft and chat brings up some good points.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I use YouTube for my podcast.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
I depend on YouTube to make it work.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
Uh, but people being turned off on YouTube,

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
like Rob is going to hurt our podcasts in the long run.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Good thing we're now on iTunes and all, but still,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
and I would agree with that.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
That's why you want to kind of put your show as many places as possible.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
And that's why I was looking to put Shaking and Crying,

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
the new show over on YouTube, because I was like,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
okay, well maybe there is an audience there.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
You know, they can, uh, even though we don't really do video,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
at least they could have the audio with maybe like a waveform

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
in the background or something.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
But the more YouTube does this shit,

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
the more I'm like, well, maybe not, maybe not.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
We did, I, that is a Shaking and Crying is the first show though

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
that I've had that's on iHeartRadio.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
So that is, you know, I was like,

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
where are all the podcast apps we're going to,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
so we're on iHeartRadio with that.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
So I might put this show on there too.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I'm trying to, I want to see how it works.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
So Shaking and Crying first before I go that length.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
We'll see. Yeah. So, because you know, they,

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
they are tied to corporate radio, which is interesting,

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
but that can be, that can be for better for worse.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
Uh, let's see. Let's move on, I guess.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
We'll move on to some more news.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Uh, let's talk about, let's talk about Space Channel 5.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
This is a series that's been dormant for a while

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
that I love this series.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
And it sounds like it may be coming back in a way in VR.

47:31.000 --> 47:37.000
Uh, it was recently announced at the Niko Niko Tokagi Festival.

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
Uh, uh, this past week that Space Channel 5 VR,

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
Arakata Dancing Show is, uh, going to be demoed there

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
and that the game will be seeing a release in spring of 2018 for the HTC Vive.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
Now a little while ago, we had talked about a Space Channel 5 thing in VR.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
That was called Uki Uki Viewing Show.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
And that's where you threw confetti and helped Ulala to improve the viewership counts.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
But this new game will be, you're going to dance and do the same poses.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
I suppose it's a little more similar to what you were doing on the Dreamcast

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
where you were doing it in, you know, up, left, two.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
And you probably have to do, like, you know, that type of thing with actual motion

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
since it's going to be in VR.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
So I'm here for that because I love Space Channel 5.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
So I'm just excited they're doing a new game in the series.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
I'm a little surprised it's only Vive and they're not talking PlayStation 4,

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
you know, which is usually where I see a lot of gamey stuff,

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
you know, that I remember from consoles and up.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
But, okay, I mean.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Maybe it's just the motion control stuff.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Yeah, it could be. It could be.

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
Because you're not required to have a move stuff on, I don't know.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
A lot of people do, though.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Yeah, it's free.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Can you have a game?

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
You kind of have to have to.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Okay, you can have a game that requires the move stuff, right?

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Yeah, there's a lot of them.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Yeah.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
What was that?

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Was there a noise in the background or was it just me?

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
I think it was just you.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Maybe it was his website. I don't know.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
All right.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Anyway, maybe Mr. Smoosh knocked something over. I don't know.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
All right. Well, anyway.

49:02.000 --> 49:07.000
So Space Channel 5, in VR, I would be very excited to play that.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
I still need to get something that does VR already,

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
besides just the little cell phone VR.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
Maybe over the summer.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Maybe with a tax refund. Who knows?

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
They have some pretty good PlayStation VR bundles.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Okay, thank you. Yeah, the chatters heard that noise, too.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I'm sorry, guys. I don't know what that was.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I think the website I was on might have one of those autoplay videos or something,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
so sorry about that.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
All right. Well, moving on.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
All right.

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
So Google is looking to possibly get into the video game streaming business.

49:40.000 --> 49:47.000
So they've got a company that they are working on a service called, what is it, Yeti,

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
which allow people to stream games to them online,

49:51.000 --> 49:56.000
and I guess it allows you to avoid having a console or high-end computer or something like that.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
So kind of like all those other streaming services that they had out there for a while,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
like PlayStation Now and stuff.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
They have Phil Harrison hired on now.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
You may remember him from such companies as Microsoft and Sony.

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
And now they're working on possibly this service.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
They haven't really said what the pricing is going to be or what the details are on this yet.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
Still kind of early, but it is something that's being worked on.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
So I guess we'll have to see what happens with this.

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
Maybe cool, though, like if they're saying that like you could work with like Chromecast or something like that.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
You know, that'd be neat to see how that works out.

50:34.000 --> 50:41.000
I just don't I'm not really turned on to the idea of like paying a subscription service to like something like that,

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
where you can play all these different games because I have a library of steam games,

50:45.000 --> 50:51.000
like five or some games that I can play and probably all very entertaining and same on my PlayStation.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
And I just don't do that.

50:53.000 --> 51:02.000
So unless you can like get me something, it would be hard for me to want to do something like that.

51:02.000 --> 51:10.000
Yeah, I kind of feel like nothing has really hit that level of GameTap back in the day,

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
which was like game streaming in a way.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
I don't think it really streamed per se. It was like you're kind of downloading a copy of the game temporarily.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
But, you know, is that the whole like rich library on demand?

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
But GameTap was really good at having a rich library of retro stuff, too.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
So I don't know. I guess it would really depend on what the game offerings look like.

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
But I find that also playing a lot of PC stuff on my TV just doesn't like I don't know the SteamBox.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
I'm not getting as much use out of that as I thought I would when I first bought it.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
I thought I would use it a lot to play stuff on the TV.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Oh, the SteamLink?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
I'm sorry. Yeah, SteamLink. Sorry, not SteamBox.

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
SteamBox is the computer. SteamLink. I really use SteamLink, but I know other people that use it a lot.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
So maybe that's just...

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I still haven't hooked mine up. I need to do that.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
You should do that. Test it out.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
Well, it's because you need to have your computer on, right? To do it.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
So I have my laptop on. It would just be kind of silly.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
It's like, well, I can play on my laptop, which is right in front of me.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
Or I can play on my TV that's a little bit more in front of me.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
It's like, I don't know. I should try it.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
Yeah. So, I don't know. It depends on what's in the library.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
That's what it's really going to boil down to.

52:12.000 --> 52:20.000
And if there's a really rich retro library, that was something that GameTap did very well that I didn't mind paying for.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
Especially another thing that I think GameTap did well back in the day was the leaderboards and some of that stuff that they did.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
I think if a game streaming service can incorporate more of that, that'll be really cool.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
You know what you want to bring people back with if you want to do something? One versus 100.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
Oh, don't get me on that rant again.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
Man, why did Xbox ever have to get that?

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Well, now everybody's crazy about HQ.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
What's HQ?

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
It's that phone app, which is like the live game show that's like 10 or 15 questions.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
And if you answer them all, you win real money. You win a share of the pot.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
They just started one at 6 o'clock. That was because I was getting all the notifications.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
But they do them at 6 o'clock every night, so obviously when OLR is going on, we start at 6 o'clock.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Like in the middle of my drive.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Well, no. It's in the middle of the show.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Well, that too.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
Oh, at nights when you're commuting home. Yeah, it's in the middle of your drive. You got it.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
But during the weekdays, they do them at noon and 6, I think, for our time.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
I realize East Coast is different hours, but it's noon and 6 for us.

53:18.000 --> 53:24.000
I think tonight they were giving away $15,000 or something like that, but it's split between all the winners.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
So if 100 people win, they're really only winning 150 bucks each.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
That's still $150 you didn't have.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
For what's essentially a free app that I don't even think is running ads still.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
I think all of the money that's funding that app came from investment money.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
I mean, they probably could start selling ads and make it decent, because they've got like...

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
I haven't played it in a while, but there was at least 80,000 people in each game when I would go check it out.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
But it's one of those games where the first few questions are easy, but then they get really fucking hard.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
So that's why most people don't make it to the end.

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
And you only have, as he reads the question, when he starts reading the question, you have like 10 seconds to answer.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
So you can't Google it. If you think you can sit there and Google it, you're not going to have enough time to do it.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
I've tried. You don't have enough time to do it.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Voice search.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
It's still not going to work, because usually by the time he's done reading the question, you have like 3 seconds left.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
And that's not enough time to wait for the search results.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Is it multiple choice? You have to type it in.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
It is. A, B, or C. Or D. I think there's 4 answers.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
It's harder than you'd think.

54:31.000 --> 54:37.000
Bobby Blackwolf says HQ trivia equals 1 vs. 100. They use the same concepts. Live host, etc.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
Yeah. HQ's probably the closest thing.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
I just don't care for HQ.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
It's a really basic-ass trivia show.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
It's nothing but 4-question multiple choice.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
And for me, it's been very buggy.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
The video gets really shitty.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
I haven't played it in a while, and I know they've done a lot of patches, so maybe it's better now.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
But in my experience with it, it was a lot of frame skips, a lot of missing stuff.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
It kind of was clunky.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Maybe that's better now, I don't know.

55:10.000 --> 55:16.000
But there was a certain flair that 1 vs. 100 had on Xbox 360 that I just liked so much better.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
So anyway, thanks for getting me on that rant again about how much I miss the Xbox game shows.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
I shouldn't bring up Classic Game Room then, should I?

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
No, let's not. Let's not do that. Let's do another story instead.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Alright.

55:29.000 --> 55:39.000
So, there was a guy that created a mod for The Division that was used for doing kind of cinematic screenshots, I guess.

55:39.000 --> 55:46.000
So, the modder, he put out this thing. It was a set of tools called Cinematic Tools.

55:46.000 --> 55:53.000
And I believe that it allowed you to kind of do a freecam and move stuff around.

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
But apparently, I think it used Cheat Engine as well to kind of do this.

55:58.000 --> 56:07.000
And because of that, Ubisoft detected that he was doing this and basically banned him for life from the game.

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
And what's ironic, though, is there was an update.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
Actually, some Ubisoft, you know, let's see here.

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
We had a creative director, Julian Gerdy.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
Looks like he reached out to him saying, hey, yeah, I love your stuff.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
I mean, it worked. I'd like to see more of it.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
You know, he's going to look into the whole situation.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
Because I guess he was tweeting Ubisoft these pictures that are really amazing.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Yeah, no, I don't even play the game.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
And I was looking at those pictures when, you know, I was looking at the news for this week.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
And he goes, look at those pictures and, man, they're beautiful.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
And that's the direction that video games are moving into looking more and more alike.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
Although, of course, that takes a lot more art and all that stuff.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
But, man, it looks incredible.

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
I can see a happy medium where they reverse his ban and maybe work with him to build a cinematic mode or something into the game.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
Well, yeah, and it also seems to me that algorithms probably detected what he was doing and ended up banning him.

57:10.000 --> 57:17.000
Which, you know, technically he probably did, you know, but Ubisoft should try to work with this guy, I think.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
There's exceptions to every rule, right?

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Yeah.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Absolutely.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
All right, well, let's talk about Ages of Mayhem, which was a game that you kind of skipped, right, Loki?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Oh, yes. Totally skipped.

57:28.000 --> 57:36.000
Yeah, and it sounds like a lot of people skipped it because I don't think this game did as well as they were hoping for being a, you know, Saints Row spinoff game.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Well, that's my problem is the Saints Row spinoff game.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
You wanted it to be its own thing.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Well, it was its own thing at one time.

57:42.000 --> 57:50.000
Like, in the very beginning, when the very first trailer, they announced it, it was just its own game and they, like, kind of hinted a little bit that it might be in the same universe as Saints Row.

57:50.000 --> 58:01.000
And then by the time we get to the end of it, they have fucking Johnny Gat in there and, like, they're putting, like, Pierce and fucking just, like, Kinsey, all the fucking people from, like, Saints Row practically in there again.

58:01.000 --> 58:09.000
It's like, dude, what the hell? You couldn't make this game stand on its own? You just had to borrow from Saints Row and then make it some underwhelming piece of shit?

58:09.000 --> 58:22.000
Well, it may be getting another life in a board game form, of all things, and the way people found this was through Academy Games' website, which they do a lot of, I guess, more historical-based type of games.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
For example, they have a game called Freedom the Underground Railroad, which is about the Underground Railroad.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
They have a game called Conflict of Heroes, which is about World War II.

58:30.000 --> 58:37.000
But apparently, there's a Kickstarter campaign link for a game called Agents of Mayhem, Pride of Babylon.

58:37.000 --> 58:43.000
It's a 3D tabletop game based on the game and you, it is a real Kickstarter campaign. You can go check that out.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
It's on Kickstarter.com and it's already met their goal four times over.

58:47.000 --> 58:53.000
So apparently, there were enough fans of Agents of Mayhem or at least board games where this thing got funded.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
You can still get in on it. There's 15 days left to back it.

58:56.000 --> 59:03.000
Depending on how you feel about Kickstarters, I don't always like to talk about Kickstarters on this show anymore because I realize a few of them come to full fruition.

59:03.000 --> 59:10.000
However, this does seem to be a company that has kind of proven themselves through these other historical-based games.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
And they probably have other stuff too. I'm just not as up to speed on board games as other people are.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
But anyway, so through the Agents of Mayhem, Pride of Babylon game, it's a board game for two to four players.

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
It's on a module 3D board that is fully destructible. That sounds like fun.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
Like maybe you get to build things up and then destroy them. That's kind of fun.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
That's a neat little concept.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
Knock it over. Aren't all board games fully destructible?

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
When you're losing Monopoly, fuck this and you flip it over and it's destructed.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
Although, did you hear about the Monopoly that's like the cheaters Monopoly?

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
No.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Because you know how there's a million versions of Monopoly, right?

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
You could get like Golden Girls Monopoly, Scooby Doo Monopoly.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Like Cheaters as in the show?

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
No, no, no. Cheaters.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
Oh, not the show. Not even Cheaters the show.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
That would be hilarious.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
That would be great.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I don't like this community chest. Next.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
No, it's none of those dating shows.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It's like you are encouraged to steal money from the bank and do things that people do in regular Monopoly that try not to get caught.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Like they steal money from the bank or they, you know, will draw extra cards or try to steal a property.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Haven't you known somebody who's tried to cheat at Monopoly?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
No.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I totally know, yeah.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Anyway, I got a little bit distracted from the topic at hand.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So, Ages of Mayhem, board game, but it looks like you're going to be able to build multi-level buildings that can be destroyed.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And that part's kind of cool actually, I gotta say. That sounds kind of fun.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You can either play Legion or Mayhem in the game and yeah, so folks I'm sure are getting in on that.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So, very cool. And it sounds like $90 is the minimum pledge for a reward and that will get you the 3D board game.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
No thanks.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And an expansion and so on. So, neat.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Yeah, I'll play the video game when it comes in one of those Humble bundles or something like that.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Or when it's inevitably on PlayStation Plus.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Oh, it's going to be marked down. Like they marked down all the Saints Row games to like dirt cheap.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It only took four years for Knack to come to PlayStation Plus.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
It's just a matter of time, Loki.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It's just waiting game.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
That's right.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Yeah, I bought Saints Row on console because I got the bundle with that and Johnny got out of hell.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Bobcoffee in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.000
When's RuPaul's Drag Race Monopoly? Hey, wait. I'm sure there's going to be something where it's like, go directly to jail.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You better sissy that walk to the cell.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Hey, you know, it's still in review right now to be a Lego set.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Yeah, so the Lego set might happen. That's going to be awesome if it does.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But I think there's no way it's going to lose to that Christmas Story house.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And that Christmas Story house is going to be the winner.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
No, you don't understand. It's not a voting thing. They're not picking one out of there.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
They look at all of them. They approve multiples.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I thought out of each group of eight, only one ever got approved.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
No.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Oh, I thought that's how it worked.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
That's the case at all.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
So it's whatever ones they think that they can work into a set and get the licensing and everything for.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
So it could very well do.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Well, if there's a Lego thing out there, fucking do it. Do the drag racing.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000
They have, and y'all know how I feel about the pop vinyl figures, you know, and here's the thing.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I'm trying not, I'm really not trying to hate on the pop vinyl thing.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I get why they're really popular. I get why people collect them.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But they're everywhere.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
They are everywhere.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
You go to conventions, it's every other booth.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
You go to the mall, it's every other store.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Every store has them.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
But despite what I'm saying about all that, look over there.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I got RuPaul, Alaska, and Trixie pop vinyls that I found at a Hot Topic when I went to the DDR thing in the Bay Area.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Because our malls didn't have them, but that mall did.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
So I was like, you know, and it dropped like 45 bucks on those fucking dolls.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
But my love for-

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Try and find more of them. I bet they've got them stocked down in San Francisco.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Those are the only three for drag race that are out now, but I'm sure there'll be more.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It blows my mind there's not a Bianca Del Rio doll, but maybe they just couldn't get the rights for it.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And, you know, I don't know.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Maybe they just drag it out and make sure they sell all of them.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Maybe. That could be part of it, too.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
So we'll see.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
You got a story about Fortnite, right?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Yeah, so Fortnite Battle Royale's been pretty popular, especially that, you know, that portion at least is free to play.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
So now they've got, they've hit a new record.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Apparently 3.4 million concurrent players at one time.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
And so the previous record was held by PlayerUnknown's Battleground at 3.2 million.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But now they have smashed that record, and it's only gonna go up from here, right?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So, yeah.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Pretty awesome that they're doing well.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I mean, those Battle Royale games are definitely popular, so I'm sure we'll see a lot more of that.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I heard, was it even, that they're talking about that there's gonna be a Battle Royale-type game in Red Dead Redemption 2.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Yeah, I think a lot of games are looking at doing a mode like that now.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So, it's...

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Meanwhile, the creators of PUBG are coming out saying,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And you have us to thank! I made you, and I can break you just as easily!

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Or H1Z1, King of the Kill, had that fucking first.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You missed the joke, because PUBG was...

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I know, PUBG is...

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
A little salty at this whole thing to begin with.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Wasn't it like Capcom and do something like that?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I don't know.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Capcom has sold oodles and oodles of Monster Hunter World.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
They have nothing to be upset about right now.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Like, Capcom has no reason to complain, at least this week.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I just, like, the PUBG guys, like, you know,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I'm sorry that your game is not the most popular game anymore.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Darn, you'll just have to settle to be the second most popular game in the world.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It's like...

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I feel so terrible for you.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Minecraft couldn't be number one forever. No game's gonna be number one forever.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Minecraft's not number one, but it's got fucking feet, so make your game have feet.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Make people want to keep coming back and playing. Give it long legs.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Alright. Let's move on.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Other big games that have cooled down a little bit.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Alright. And then...

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Let's see here. So, other stuff.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
We can talk about, you know, one of the not very popular games.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And that being, you know, Pokemon Go. No one plays that anymore.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
But Pokemon Go, they have...

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
There's a rumor that there's gonna be some story-based quests coming soon.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Thanks to data miners who have taken apart the latest version of the game to see that.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So, with that, apparently there's gonna be both short and long-term goals with these.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
They're gonna include different characters from the franchise, including, like, Professor Willow.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
They're saying that according, I guess, the website, Silph Road,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
these characters are gonna be given animations and facial expressions and stuff like that,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
so you'll be able to see them emote and stuff.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And then also, they're noting that...

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
What else?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
They're gonna basically...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Yeah, different, I guess, indicators about the quests and stuff.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And then, of course, the actual patch notes they're talking about.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
You know, that they'll let trainers...

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I guess you'll be able to search your Pokemon collection using terms like shiny.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So, if you wanna look at all your shinies, you can do that.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Then, improved in-game news feature, which...

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Swear to fucking God, I've been playing, like, today.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I swiped it away the first time.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
It's like, hey, did you know there's Pokemon from Gen 3?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And I'm like, fucking, I'm trying to play this game.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
This, like, pop-up is getting in my way.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Yeah, I mean, it looks a lot better, but it's...

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Yeah, I get alerts all the time from it, too.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It's like, dude, no shit.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Is that where all these Gen 3 Pokemon are coming from?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I don't need to know that.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Well, I think the story mode could be really cool.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I think it's something a little different, so it's not just, you know,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
catch all the nests and raid all the things.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I'm wondering if it's gonna be like, you know, the missions that they do in Ingress.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I mean, that wouldn't be bad.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Oh, God, I'd love that, like, where you get little mission badges.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
That's, like, the best thing in Ingress right now.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I'm so bored of the fielding game.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's just, I like doing the missions.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Like, maybe it could be, like, they could have,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
instead they can't capture anything.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I doubt they'd have you capture a gym,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
because that takes a long time.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I, like, did that during, I was watching my kid do gymnastics or whatever,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and, like, I sat there hacking away at their gym,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
and it's just, it takes so long.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
For those that don't know missions in Ingress,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
and what I'm referring to is that in Ingress,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
you can, like, you know, you'll go to places,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
and you can hack, like, they are user created,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
and they're in the game once they're approved

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
by the moderation board or whatever,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
and it's, like, you hack these six portals in a park,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
and you'll get a permanent badge on your profile

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
that shows you completed this mission,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
and, you know, so it's just a nice way to show that you visited this park.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
For example, and some of them have, like, banners,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
so instead of just one mission, it's, like, 18 missions,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
but when you put them all together,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
it does a nice little banner on your profile.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
For example, when I was in Atlanta for Dragon Con last year,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I did an 18-part Ingress mission that took you around the hotels

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
and around that part of Atlanta,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
and now I have a permanent copy of the old carpet at the hotel,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
the infamous, you know, carpet, on my profile.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
So that's really cool, because they actually took that carpet out last year,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
so, but it's really funny that now that's on, you know, my profile in Ingress.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
That would be kind of cool if they did something like that.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I mean, I guess they could have it, like, be within distance of this portal,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
or not portal, Poke Stop and catch a Pokemon or something like that,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
or I don't know.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
But, yeah, the cool things with Ingress missions, too,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
it's, like, aside from just, like, you know, hack this, destroy this,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
upgrade this or whatever, they also have walk to this spot

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and answer this trivia question, you know.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Yeah, those can be cool.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
They can also be annoying when the source of the question is gone.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Like, I did a mission in Seattle.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It was when they were newer,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
we didn't have a lot of the multi-part stuff yet.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I did one in Seattle at the Pacific Science Center there,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
and I had to hack, like, 40 portals, I swear.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And then, finally, I got to, like, the last one.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
It had a trivia question.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
The board with the trivia question was gone.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I could not answer the trivia question.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I could not finish the mission.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I was so irritated.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
So, when it works, it's great, but when it doesn't work, it's fucking annoying.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
So, yeah.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Anyway.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Let's move on.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and this has to do with Crash Bandicoot.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And, of course, Crash Bandicoot had the N. Sane Trilogy,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
which did pretty well on PlayStation.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I don't know if you guys know, but it did pretty well on the PlayStation.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Apparently, there was an article that came out on the, what,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Licensing Sourcebook Europe apparently mentioned that

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
there's going to be an N. Sane Trilogy Switch port was mentioned in the article.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And that also a new entry in the franchise was going to be coming out next year.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Well, that would make sense that if the trilogy did so well,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
they're probably going to revisit this franchise at some point.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
But the trilogy coming to the Switch?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Huh.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Well, the article was edited to remove all the mentions of those details.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Hmm.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Could this be something we hear about at E3 or maybe a little sooner?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I don't know.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
But that's very interesting that Crash Bandicoot was mentioned for the Switch,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
because I think most of us think of that as very Sony-related property,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
even though it's an Activision...

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I guess. I mean, I don't know.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
They had Crash games, I think, on the Wii.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Did they? I don't remember.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I want to say that maybe the racing game was on the Wii.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Oh, you might be right.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Or the 3DS, I feel like, had something.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Something, yeah.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
The DS or 3DS had something.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
All right.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Well, it's time for us to get to the classic game of the week.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
We're going to take a trip down memory lane to a time

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
when we were all playing Crash Bandicoot for the first time.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And we are going to be joined by Dark Soccer at this point in the show,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
so let's try to get her on the line here.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
And she's going to take us on a trip down memory lane

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
to find a classic game that we're going to look back on this week,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
as she's going to step into the gaming vault

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and find a game that she wants to talk about tonight.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And we are calling the actual phone,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
and I think we have her there.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You there, Jamie?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Yes.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I forgot that I changed your ringtone.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Well, but we're calling from the computer.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I'm not calling from my cell phone.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Yeah, but it still comes through.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I mean, I didn't like your ringtone, but my ringtone in general.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
My new default ringtone is the Dark World theme from Link to the Past,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
and it used to be the Doctor Who theme.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Oh, okay.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So you didn't realize there was a phone call coming through at first.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
No, I knew.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I heard it, and I looked at it, and I'm like, what?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Because my brain's all addled because I had an accident.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Well, I hope you're feeling better.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I missed you tonight, but I understand.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So if you're not okay to drive, then don't drive.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yeah, I wasn't okay to walk.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Well, feel better.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Feel better.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Are you okay to do the Classic Game of the Week?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Oh, yeah.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Well, then let's get to it.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
What is the Classic Game of the Week, Darth Zagara?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
It is the arcade stage.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Good choice.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I'm going to play some of the music loud here at first

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
so people can hear the awesome Eurobeat in this game,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
but I'm going to take it way down so that you can talk over it.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
All right.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Well, the game is in the initial arcade stage,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
which has spawned many other games,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
and I'm half talking about the first game

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
and half talking about the whole series.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
So the first game came out,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and, you know, I had the date on here a moment ago.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I think it was 2002.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
No, I'll take that back.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
2001 in Japan and 2002 in the English version.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
So, you know, basically it was based off the manga and anime,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
which is basically all street racing and drifting and cars.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Ooh.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And cars that kind of exist.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Ooh.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000
So anyway, you have different types and modes to play through.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
It's all, you know, one-on-one racing.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And there are some interesting things about the arcade versions themselves.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So basically the arcade stage,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
which we only just got it over here as just initial D,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
and then they started putting out the version numbers and all that later.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But you can save your progress with a magnetic card system,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
and you can save your customized card and your progress,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
or you lose your progress,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000
but with those cards you have to play only on an initial D cabinet with the same version,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
and you have to renew every 50 plays,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
so that way you can get their money.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Yay!

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And of course they're not backwards compatible,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
like a version 2 card cannot be used on a version 1 machine.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And if you upgrade it on another machine it's a permanent upgrade.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So that's how the card thing works.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
As far as the games in the series,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
there was arcade stage and then version 2,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
version 3, arcade stage 4, arcade stage 5,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
and those were all the arcade ones.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And then there were three home versions.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
There was initial D special stage for PlayStation 2,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
which I have it,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
initial D street stage for PSP,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
which I don't have it,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and initial D exchange stage for PS3, which we have it,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
because Hubby is kind of obsessed.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
So as far as the different modes for the first one,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I mean first of all the cabinets themselves,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
they look like standard racing cabinets,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
but they play all the Eurobeat,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and you get to pick which songs you start off with,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
which was pretty much for me,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
it was always Heartbeat,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
because I love that song.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
So as far as the first version that you had three different modes,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
you have Legend of the Street,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
which is your main story mode

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
where you go against different opponents who are in the manga

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
or in the anime,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
and you have to go against them.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
And then there's Time Attack,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
which is basically racing against other players

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
or at the current machine or across the internet,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
you rank that way based on your time.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And then Battle Mode,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
which is I guess just the one-on-one race.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You had four different courses,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
you had Miyogi,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
you had Usui,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
you had Akina,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
and you had Hapagahara,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
which the cool thing about this is that

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
it actually has two different versions of each track.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
So for Miyogi and Usui,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
you had Clockwise and Counterclockwise.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
For Akina you had, since it's a mountain drive,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
it's downhill or uphill.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And then for Hapagahara,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
you had Inbound and Outbound.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So it actually had technically eight different ways you could race.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And then later versions,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
if I remember right,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
brought in Time of Day and different weather conditions.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Version 3, which was the 2003 one that came out,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
had different tracks,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
like Irohazuka,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
which was one of the expert modes,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
the new export one.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You had Akina Snow,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Shomaru,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
and Shisaka.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
So you had a bunch of different ones.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I just want to jump in real quick,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
because the chat room is lighting up,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
saying the Initial D went up to,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
they actually are past Initial D8.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I guess they did a game called Initial D0,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
which is kind of like the ninth game,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
but there's more than five.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
They're up to like nine.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Yeah, they're up to Arcade Stage 0,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and then there was Special Stage, Street Stage,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
and Extreme Stage.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And there was also,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
6 was Stage 6 AA,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and 7 was AAX.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I'm sorry, I was going between two different lists of the games.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
So the one I had hasn't been,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
the first one that was going off hadn't been updated in a while,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
but I know that all of them exist.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
In fact, Stage 0 is actually pretty neat.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And that was on the SEGA New 2 Arcade board.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
It came out just last year in March.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
And it has a six-speed gear shift,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
like the ones in One Gun Midnight Maximum 2.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
So, pretty good.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
But as far as though back to the earlier ones,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
because your rears are in the classics,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
because all up until we hit 2007,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
they of course, they all had great music.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It was all, you know,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Eurobeatle.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000
The newer games, of course, have some other music.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.000
In fact, our TV Zero brought in some rocks from,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
in fact, Jeff Smith, The Hug Me, The Vow, Gecko Green.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And it also reduced the vehicles back to the originals.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
So, you know, but the games, I mean,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I've never seen them not busy.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Even some of the older ones at arcades these days,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
they're still pretty busy.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And of course, you know, for people who were not,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
you know, para para people,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
this was a lot of people's introduction to Eurobeat, you know?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Heck yeah, Eurobeat rules.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yeah.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
So I figured that a game that kind of hearkens back to another one of our

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
big, you know, video game loves being, you know,

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
pata pata in the Devony series.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
They have that in common.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
So I figured this would be a good one to bring up for classic games.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
So yeah, there are 12 games in the series,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
nine for arcade, three for home consoles.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And I don't think it's ever going to stop even though,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
what was the last movie they brought out like three years ago?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Oh, I don't know.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I think?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I've never seen any of these movies.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I rarely play the games, to be honest.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I'm not a hater.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It's just usually these are the things I'm playing in between waiting for

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
games of DDR.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Somebody said this exact same thing in the chat room earlier,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
but it was kind of like it was that other game at the arcade that wasn't DDR.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
All right.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
So I was kind of right.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
The Legend 3 movie, hold on.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
There was, yeah,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.000
the final stage was a four episode series that came out in 2014.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And then there were the movies that they did,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
and then they did a live action initially that was, hold on.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
It came out in 2005 as well.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
So one thing I was reading about,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000
just the areas that they filmed part of the movie is that now there are

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
apparently a bunch of like figure and model car museums.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And then there are, what else did they do?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.000
They actually have like photo ops at where the races are,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
where they were the places that were modeled.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Like Akina isn't really a real mountain location.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It had a different name.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And off the top of my head, I can't remember what it was called,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
but a lot of those places, they are real places,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
but they were renamed for the series.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So anyway, you know, that's Initial D.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Lots of Eurobeat, lots of fast driving, and a car from 1986.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
All right.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
There it is, your classic.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
It has the Tofu delivery logo on the side.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Initial D.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
The whole dang series.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Although we're focusing, I guess, on the first game for this,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
since we have to name something.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
The first few,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
which is why I was going for anything that was like 2007 and earlier.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Yeah.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
All right.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
It brings back memories of playing at the arcade because, you know, again,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
it was kind of like, you know, your DDR fans had that, you know,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
your racing game fans had, you know, Initial D,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
and then your fighting game fans had like, you know, back at the time,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
like Soul Calibur 2 or, you know, continued Capcom versus SNK 2.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
You know, I know I'm dating this a little bit,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
but that was back when DDR was, you know,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
we were playing Fourth Mix and shit in the arcade.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
So good times.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Yeah.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So I, you know, it's something I haven't done before,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
and I can't believe I've never done that one before, so.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
It's like as long as we've been doing this segment,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
every week there's a new game where it's like,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I can't believe I never did this before.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
But that's the joy of this segment.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Why do we still do it?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Seriously.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
All right.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Well, I wish I could bear.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I'm sorry I was, you know, messed up.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
No worries.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
We'll get through the show.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
So we'll see you next week, okay?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
All right.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
See you then.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
All right.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Bye.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Bye.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
To register participation for this week's episode

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
use the passphrase DREAM.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
All right.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
DarkSakra here on the show,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
making a guest appearance via the telephone.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
She'll be back in the studio next week.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
We have plenty more show to come,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
including some rapid fire news.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
We're going to get into the mailbag,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
which I don't know if we have emails or not.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I'll look in there and see.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And then we'll talk a little bit about,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
oh, that debate that's going around Twitter this week

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
about Toad, and is that a hat or not?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And Nintendo made an answer,

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
and it sounds like everybody's rejecting the,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
well, not everybody.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Half the people are rejecting the answer.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
It's GIF and GIF all over again,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
except now it's Toad's hat.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
That's what it is.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
The creator has said something,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
and there are other people out there saying,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
nope, the creator's wrong.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So we'll talk about that when we come back

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
after our break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Live tonight with the 718th episode of our show

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
already in progress for this February the 11th.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Just Loki and I here tonight.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
DarkSakura was joining us a little bit via phone over there

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
for the Classic Game of the Week,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
but she's unfortunately not here in studio tonight,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
hopefully back next week.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
But in the meantime,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
we still have a lot of news to get to,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
so let's do some rapid fire news.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Let's get to it.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Let's get to it.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Let's get to it.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
All right.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
So let's talk a little bit about Doom.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
The new one or the old one?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
The old one.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Cool.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
The old one.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I like the new one, too.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Yes.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So there's been a lot of mods for Doom.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
So this new mod is actually a mod that was created by

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
a user by the name of My Name Is,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
and it's basically...

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
What?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Your name is what?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
My name is My Name Is.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
What?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Your name is what?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Funny.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Basically, it adds D.Va's mech from Overwatch into Doom,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and so the mod is called Overdoom,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
and so they have this neat little animation

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
where you're getting into the mech.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
You can even see the hairy arms of the Doom guy and stuff

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
as you're doing all that.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So it's quite funny, but looks pretty awesome.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So they have that, and then of course they also have

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
a bunch of other weapons as well

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
that they've introduced from the game,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
so lots of cool things.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So if you want to check that out,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I'm not sure which you can grab.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Oh, okay, let's see here.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
You can grab that at moddb slash mods slash Overdoom.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
So go check that out.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And then this is kind of exciting.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
So there was a LinkedIn profile for Bandai Namco

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
that suggests that they're working on a Switch FPS game.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
And Ridge Racer 8.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Speaking of racing games,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
since we were just talking about that before the break,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Ridge Racer is one that's been gone a long time.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Yeah, so apparently there was a LinkedIn profile

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
which was a developer that was at Bandai Namco

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
and made mention that it said unannounced IP,

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
first person shooter slash adventure,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
exclusive to Nintendo Switch.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And the other one just says Ridge Racer 8.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Have you heard the rumors about what shooter that is?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I'm sorry, it doesn't say Ridge Racer 8 specifically.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
It just says drift-based, high-speed car racing game exclusive

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
to Nintendo Switch is another one that they had.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So Ridge Racer 8 coming to the Switch?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Ooh, wouldn't that be something if the infamous Ridge Racer

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
were to come over to Switch as an exclusive?

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Have you heard about what the exclusive FPS is?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
No.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I mean, it's just a rumor, but Metroid Prime 4

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
that perhaps Bandai Namco is the ones that are making it,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
so be interesting.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Yeah.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I mean, quality products, quality product,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I'll wait and see what they turn out, if that's true,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
but that's what some people have been putting together.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I just want Ridge Racer,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
and please don't make it exclusive to Switch

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
because we all want Ridge Racer.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
But don't you want Ridge Racer to go?

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Handheld?

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I don't need it to go.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I just need it to be on a system that I own.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
You're so selfish.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
All right.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Oh, yes.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I'm so selfish.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
You know what?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I got Ridge Racer to go.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
It was for the Vita, and it sucked ass.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And I want a redo.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
All right.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Well, moving on, the next story I had slotted

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
was the response from Billy Mitchell

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
to the Donkey Kong high score controversy,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
except now the website that I was supposed to be using won't load.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
That's great.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Gotta love live radio.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Let's see what I can remember off memory,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
and hopefully I don't misappropriate this.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
I didn't do it.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Well, I mean, it kind of boiled down to a lot of the stuff

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
we talked about last week,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
is that one of the scores that he got was...

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
All right.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I'll help you out here.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Thank you.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Well, let me say the part I remember.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
One of the scores he got was in front of a live crowd,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
and that score didn't go anywhere.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
It's just that these higher scores that he also did,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
those did get discounted,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
although Twin Galaxies has not really formulated

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
an official response to this whole debacle as of yet.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
But the reason why I want to clarify that is because

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
last week we also were talking about the dragster guy

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
that had made up those times,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
but had never really proven that he could even get in that ballpark.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And part of why I said the Billy Mitchell story was different

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
is I was like, well, Billy Mitchell can at least prove

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
he can hang in that league.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Like, he is good at Donkey Kong.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
He's gotten a score very, very high before.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
So, I mean, who knows?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
It would be very weird to fake that.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
But, I mean, did he know that those machines were running main?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
People do weird shit with arcade cabinets all the time.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
So that's all I was saying is that, you know,

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
give him a little bit of the benefit of the doubt.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
He's not always the super villain that you saw in that movie.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
So, you know.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
But, you know, fair is fair, and if it was an emulator,

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
then it does need to be discarded.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
It's not the same rules that everybody else is playing on.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
But if I were Billy Mitchell, this would just motivate me

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
to get a higher record and do it again.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Yeah, so apparently this was from an internet talk show

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
called Eastside Dave, and he commented on the whole situation

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
saying that I've never played MAME.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I don't have MAME loaded in my home.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
The film footage that he has that Jeremy,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Donkey Kong 4 moderator who analyzed the footage has,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
shows MAME play.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Now, I contend that if he gets the original tape

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
or gets the original room shot,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
he will see that what I say is true.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I'm not disputing what he says.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
What I'm disputing is the fact that I want him

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
to have the original tape, and the fact of the matter

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
is that the original footage given to Twin Galaxies,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Twin Galaxies has it or should have it,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and that's if it's anywhere other than Twin Galaxies,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
that's the real problem.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
So, I remember the responding back saying,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
if that were for them to fake that footage,

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
like say this was a whole conspiracy

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
and it wasn't really his footage that he submitted to them,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
that they would have to mimic what he's done in the game.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
It would just be like a really elaborate thing.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So, I don't know.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
All this over fucking Donkey Kong, my God.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And then it basically said that also,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
you know, with that, that apparently...

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
What was it?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
There was another comment here.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It says here.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
From Twin Galaxy owners, Pete Bovier,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
was saying that, you know,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
when I absolutely had a good fortune to get the...

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I think he's talking about the whole thing with Todd Rogers.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
So, when I had the absolutely good fortune

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
to get the score on Donkey Kong,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I turned around and one of the people shaking my hands

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
was one of the people patting me on the back

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
was Pete Bovier, the owner of Twin Galaxies.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
So, basically saying, hey, when I got those scores,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
it was a witness of the guy that runs Twin Galaxies.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
So, this shit's never gonna end.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
The advances in technology are gonna make people

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
really analyze those footages.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Right.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And, like, I would be more on the side of believing Billy Mitchell

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
versus definitely the other dude, you know,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
that has all these impossible scores

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
that they have proved to be impossible to get.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Whereas, you know, Donkey Kong,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I mean, he's definitely got the skills to do it.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
It's just a matter of, like, getting this whole thing straightened out.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
And, like, I have to wonder, like, with, you know, VHS,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000
like, how, like, could any of that have been caused by the VHS?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Mm-hmm.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Like, if, I mean, obviously,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
every screen readjaw's not gonna be, but, I mean,

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
VHS is exactly the most high-definition format out there.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I can only imagine that'd be pretty hard to get into the details on that.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Rob D. in chat says,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I actually watched King of Kong again this week after hearing the story

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
and it bothers me so much.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
You say that Billy Mitchell isn't always a supervillain how he appears,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
but he's so much scummier with the knowledge that those runs were emulated.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I feel so much worse for Steve Weeby.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Well, I mean, I'm saying is that, you know,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I met him at Dragon Con this last year

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
and he's pretty much a normal freaking person.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
You know, he's not, like, ego all the time,

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
but when the cameras are on, I think it's part of the persona.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And could he go that far to try to one-up the next guy?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I mean, in line, maybe.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I don't know him that well, you know.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
People are capable of crazy shit,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
but there's also that part of me that doesn't want to give him the benefit of the doubt

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
of, well, maybe he didn't know.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Because I think of the Man vs. Snake thing

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
where the board was overclocked or whatever.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Assuming that he did do this in MAME,

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
what would be the advantage of him doing this in MAME

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
versus, like, an actual arcade cabinet?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Like, what possible ways would he be cheating in that?

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
That you would probably be able to detect,

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I would assume, like, you know, if it's scoring,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
if he's, like, giving himself a higher score for everything that he picks up,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I mean, that would be pretty detectable.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Technically, since it's emulated, it's not the real thing,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
but I get what you're saying. What advantage is the emulation giving him?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Right, because, like, that would be, like,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
the only way I would think he would do that on purpose

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
would be to gain some sort of advantage.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
I don't see why he would do that if he knew it would invalidate his run.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Like, I would think if he's gonna cheat, he's gonna cheat,

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
and it's gonna be to, you know, somehow game the system somehow,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
and I just try to figure out what he would be doing in that regard.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Rob follows up with this, saying,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
in the worst case scenario, he could replay levels over and over

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
and record his input as he goes, getting the best RNG.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
That's from live.vognetwork.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Oh, so, like, a tool assisted run?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Tool assisted, yeah, I guess.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
That comment from live.vognetwork.com.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Anyway, rapid fire news, right?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I'll be curious to see where this goes,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
but, um, I think maybe thanks to the All Games days,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I'm so over Twin Galaxies drama.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Over it, I have had it officially.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Take the damn score away, see if I care.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
None of you get the score.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
We're not playing Donkey Kong anymore.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
In fact, Donkey Kong doesn't exist anymore.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
It's off the table.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
The non-game. Donkey Kong is cooking software.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Cooking software.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
All right, let's talk about Red Dead Redemption 2,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
because that's a much newer game

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
that people will be setting records on,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
you know, when it comes out.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Apparently, there's leaked notes,

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
good old leaks, that's why I'm putting this in rapid fire,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
leaks and rumors, and what's possible and what's not.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
The leak features a slew of online modes,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
including Battle Royale,

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
a team-based shootout known as Fight and Revive,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
and Money Grab, where you race against

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
to get bag stacks of gold, return to your base,

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
and get a fortune as fast as you can.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
There's supposed to be a huge online world

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
where you can roam at will, and so on and so on.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
It sounds like they're really trying to make this

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
a little more of a service type of game,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
which I don't know how you feel about that.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
It just sounds like Grand Theft Auto Online,

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
and I want to say that they have similar gameplay modes

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
already in Grand Theft Auto Online.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I know they have like a PUBG type game

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
in Grand Theft Auto Online they can play,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
and I know one of the rumors is the first person mode,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
which that's already in Grand Theft Auto 5,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
so I wouldn't see why it wouldn't be in this.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
It seems plausible.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Oh, my favorite word, thank you.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Well, I guess, I mean, it's not like,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
oh my god, that's so shocking.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It's just, it's not.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
It's not shocking at all.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
It sounds like it's just stuff that they're reporting

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
from Grand Theft Auto 5,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
and they already have it built in the engine,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
so yeah, I can probably see that happening.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Yeah.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
It is a little bit one of those

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
safe prediction type of things.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I think there may be a Final Fantasy XVI at some point.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I think it's very possible there will be

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
a Final Fantasy XVI at some point.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Square Enix is developing Final Fantasy XVI.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
That's right.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Sources say.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
All right, moving on.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
What else do you have, Logie?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000
So after much teasing on the Steam forums,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.000
apparently Puyo Puyo Tetris is coming to PC

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
on February 27th, so they were putting out

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
these ASCII art wallpaper things

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
that were in different forms,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
like showing a Tetromino and one of the Puyo Puyos.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
So now, after all that, it's been confirmed

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
that they're gonna be releasing it,

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
so you get to check them out.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Oh, hooray.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
For those of you that have already bought the game twice

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
on Switch and PlayStation 4,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
now you can buy it again.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Yay.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
So, interesting.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And then along with that,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.000
so EVO 2018 is adding Dragon Ball FighterZ to the lineup.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
What's kind of ironic, though,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
is what's not being added to that,

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Yikes, because that's kind of a newer fighting game.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I don't think it was received as well.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Reception just wasn't there for that.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
But Capcom has good news with Monster Hunter World,

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
but just the news over here isn't as good, that's all.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Yeah, I mean, at the very least,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Street Fighter V is gonna be there,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
so that's represented, but other games,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
you know, Tekken 7, Smash Brothers Melee,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Smash Brothers Wii U,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle,

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
and then, of course, you know,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
they're saying that Injustice 2 is still on the roster,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
so that'll be there.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And then, specifically, Street Fighter V,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
the arcade edition will be there.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Well, that's, you know, the new one.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
The new one.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And then Guilty Gear Xrd Revision 2.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
So, it's disappointing,

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
but, I mean, I don't know.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I wasn't impressed by Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
All right, well, let's travel around the world

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
and check out some releases that will hopefully impress you

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
a little more that are coming out around the world this week,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
starting with the US.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
All right, so let's take a look here.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I can't imagine there's too much coming out,

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
although we are in February, and that's an okay month.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
So, let's see.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Coming out this week, we've got a few things.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Dynasty Warriors 9.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
That's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Kingdom Come Deliverance on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Uh, okay.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Monster Energy Supercross, the official video game on PC,

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Owlboy finally getting released on console.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Radiant Historia Perfect Chronology on 3DS.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000
The longest five minutes on PC, Switch, and the Vita.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And, let's see.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Legend of Heroes Trails of the Cold Steel 2 on PC.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
And then, this is interesting.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I'm curious to see what this actually looks like.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Remember, I think we talked about this a while back,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
but a certain magical virtual lawn

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and the Vita,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
but that's not actually for PlayStation VR,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
so that might be cool.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Fe, or Fe.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I remember.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
That's on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Secret of Mana on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Yeah, that's the big release this week.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Now, hold on.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Before you speak too soon there.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
The big release.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
That's going to be hard to top the Secret of Mana remake.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I'm really looking forward to that.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
How about I'll give you Bayonetta 1 and 2 on the Switch.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Oh, fuck, that's this week?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
That's this week.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Why did I think that was like March?

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Oh, shit.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
You're right.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
That is the big release this week.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Wow, and you tried to write this week off

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
at the beginning.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
It's not a big deal.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Those are two big fucking deal games.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Those might be the things that finally tear me away

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
from fucking Final Fantasy XIV for a little while.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
All right.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Great.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
And then there's a game called Long Gone Days

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
on PC, Mac, and Linux coming out one week from today.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
That's it.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
All right, traveling over to Japan.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
The releases this week in Japan include

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
on the PlayStation 4, Cyber Troopers Virtual On

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
cross Tora Majutsu no Index.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
It's that same.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Yep.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
The Secret of Mana remake.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Of course, you would notice Seiken Detsetsu 2 over there.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
That is also released on the 15th this week.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
There's also a game called Shinobi Koi Utsutsu

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Banka Aya Imakai in a regular and limited edition.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
That should not be confused just because it has the word

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Shinobi in it with Sega's big series.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
This is a different game that actually looks like it's more

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
like it based on an anime based on the various faces

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
that are there.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
That is on the PlayStation 4.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, Idol-ish.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
It's not Idol.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
It's just Idol-ish.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Idol-ish 712 Fantasia is out as well as that same Virtual On

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
and the Secret of Mana remake on the Vita, don't forget.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Like a rare Vita sighting.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
And then on the Nintendo Switch this week over in Japan,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
actually nothing sadly.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I'm not showing anything in Japan this week except that

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
same Bayonetta 1 and 2 remake is on February 17th.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So I guess that is the day before our next show.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
So the Bayonetta remake is on the Switch in Japan as well.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And the Nintendo 3DS, nothing this week.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Do you have Europe up, Loki?

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
You wanna do that?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Sure.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
So let's see.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
This week we've got Kingdom Come Deliverance on PlayStation 4,

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Xbox One, and PC.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
South Park, The Stick of Truth on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
The Secret of Mana on PlayStation 4, Vita, and PC.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
That's all they have listed.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
All right, let's get to the mailbag.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Every week you guys email us.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Participate at Orangelaungerator.com

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
if you wanna email us for a future week.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And we will read your emails live on air.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
So let's get to it.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
We have a couple of emails tonight.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I know I said before the break I wasn't sure if we had any

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
and I forgot there were a couple that came in.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
There was one earlier in the week and then one yesterday.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
So we have a couple emails to get through tonight.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
So let's start off with this first email from our pal YYR

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
who emails us saying,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Hello, LR. I'm just gonna do what I often do.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Comment on last week's episode.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Regarding the Rock Band Network songs being delisted,

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
I can tell you the most likely cause of that

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
and has nothing to do with licensing.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Guess what system powered the submission and sales of Rock Band Network songs?

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Xbox Live Indie Games.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Yep, Xbox Live Indie Games is the backbone of Rock Band Network

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
and I'm surprised they didn't both go down together.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Or perhaps they will be doing just that

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
because while all Xbox Live Indie Games were officially delisted in October,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
the system's still up

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000
and three of the games were left on sale up until just recently.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
My belief is they're finally bringing that system down this month.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
That could be.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Probably.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I think you're onto something there.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
It's surprising that they didn't just rebuild that system to support it.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
No. It is what it is.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
So if you're wondering why those songs are disappearing,

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
yep, that's the reason.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And as far as custom music in-game goes,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
that was something we talked about last week,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
personally, I barely ever do that.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
But I admit that I played both Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
on the original Xbox with a custom soundtrack.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
And not just for any soundtrack, but the best one.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
The soundtrack from Wangen Midnight Maximum Tune

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
composed by the one and only Yuzo Koshiro.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Dude, I've done the same thing in racing games.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I have done the same thing.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
You've done the Wangen soundtrack.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Gives you the edge.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Fuck yeah. Makes me...

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Here's the dangerous thing.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I've listened to that soundtrack in my car driving to LA

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
and I shit you not.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I shit you not.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
That's like when you're going down the cow towns on iFET,

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
which I know not everybody knows the west coast,

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.000
but between Sacramento and LA on i5, there ain't shit.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
It's a lot of cow towns and stuff.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I caught myself going 95 miles an hour on the freeway to LA

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
because I was listening to the Wangen Midnight Maximum Tune.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
That's one thing I liked about Ridge Racer

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
was the music in the game.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Yes.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
So anyhow, let's see.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
And by the way, if you happen to go to round one,

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
play the fifth version of that game.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
He's still doing the music and it's fantastic.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I didn't know he was still doing the music.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
That's great. I've got to find those soundtracks then.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
All right.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I'll close with a response to your response to my previous email

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
that if you acquire a game and put it in your house,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
it ought to not be ripped away from you.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
But the unfortunate fact is that we don't actually own

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
any of these network-based games and we never have.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
We never will.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Whether it's Miitomo or World of Warcraft or Overwatch

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
or any other network-based game on any platform,

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
we simply can't approach it with the mentality of I own this

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
because no, you don't and you still won't

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
when the service is eventually terminated

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
even if you spent a significant amount of money on it.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Am I wrong?

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Not necessarily, but didn't we have that whole thing

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
with the Congress, like somebody was trying to petition

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
with copyright.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I think it was one of these gaming archive sites

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
that they should be able to,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
if the official companies are not going to run the servers,

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.000
then somebody else, hackers or whoever figured out

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
how to reverse engineer a server,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
should be able to run their own servers for games

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
so that these types of games can be preserved.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Because you're right.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Everybody's fucking talking about Overwatch now

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.000
and it's at full-time fever with Overwatch League

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
and all that stuff, but it'll go away someday.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
But how are people a hundred years from now

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
going to be able to play Overwatch?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I can go back and watch Gone with the Wind,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
which was made 80-plus years ago.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Eighty years from now, how are they going to play Overwatch

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
if the servers are down?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
So, it'll be interesting.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Anyway, and yes, if you have a copy of Super Multitasking,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
you can stream it now.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Well, I plan to after tonight's show, actually,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
because I haven't streamed in an awfully long time

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
because I've been focusing on the podcasts

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
and just other stuff,

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
but I will be doing Super Multitasking tonight

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
because I've been waiting for this one.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
And if you'd like to stream it before release

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
and you have an audience of any size,

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
please reach out to me at yyr at yyrgames.com

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
and I'll send you a copy right away.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Now, if only I could find some time to sleep.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Have a great week, Aaron, yyr.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Best of luck on the release of the game, by the way.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
So, it's coming out, I think.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
In fact, I know it was the February 23rd

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
is when the game's coming out,

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
so check that out on Steam.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Or if you have an audience on Twitch of any size,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
yyr is a nice guy. He'll help you out.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Just send him an email if you're interested at all.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
All right, one more email. Let's get to it.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
This email from Midnight Dream,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
who says, dear Orange Ons Radio,

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
firstly, thank you for your podcast.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I've been enjoying it off and on since 2005.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Holy shit. Well, thank you.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Thank you. That means a lot.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
You're in the 10-year club. You get a gold star.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And I even called in once in 2015.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
You probably don't remember,

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
but I'd been playing Sega Master System games

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
and told you that I started listening to you guys

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
and I was looking for podcasts to listen to

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000
while I was getting wired up to participate in a sleep study.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I have to be honest, since I was about three years ago,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
I don't remember that specific call.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I don't remember anything that happened last week or last month,

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
so don't feel bad.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Yeah, don't feel bad.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I have a hard time remembering what happened in my own life yesterday.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Two aspects of your podcast that I enjoy in particular

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
is the friendship of you three, the hosts.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Yeah, Logie's okay.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I am.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
This is a good way for us to hang out every week.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
And the discussion of all games,

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
from retro to PC to mobile to modern console.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
In fact, I think the only genre of games you guys rarely discuss

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
is text-based games,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
though you did do Zork as Classic Game of the Week

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.000
and have discussed text-based roadlikes here and there.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I am only aware of this fact

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
because I am actually the nerd of nerds

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
and still enjoy interactive fiction and text-based games.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Well, you know, there's that witty part of me that wants to say,

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
or not so thinks he's witty part of me that wants to say

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
they're still making text-based games,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
but they really are because Twine has made it so easy

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
to make those types of games

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
and even with some limited interactions with it.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
And I know, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
but wasn't Depression Quest,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
remember the whole, you know, that was the Zoe Quinn game

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
and then that led to, you know, a Kotaku article, dot dot dot,

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
that's all I'll say,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
but Depression Quest was a text-based game, right?

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I believe so.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Yeah, and that was, you know,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
obviously it was hugely impactful in gaming culture.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
We'll leave it at that.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
So, you know, text-based games,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
oh, they definitely still have a place, you know.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Books still have a place against movies,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
so I think there's some people

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
that definitely like those text-based games.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Why did anyone ever give a shit about such like an indie,

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
whatever, okay, we're not going to go on that topic,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
but like I just like,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
why make a big deal out of something like that?

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Yeah, yeah, let it go.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
No, I understand.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
It's just pondering.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Some topics, some topics aren't worth revisiting.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000
One versus 100, worth revisiting every single week.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Classic game room, worth revisiting every week.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
That, let's not revisit it.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
There you go, Nintendo.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
You want a good idea to get people interested

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
in virtual console games?

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Just have them be able to build like your own virtual arcade

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000
with your classic NES, Super NES games.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And to be clear, I'm not dogging on Depression Quest,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
which is an important game and you should check it out

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
because it is, you know,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000
it's something I don't think we'd really seen in gaming before.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
One more brief aside,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I'm glad you guys got rid of the F.U. of the week not long ago.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Personally, while I realize this is your show

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
and it's an outlet in many ways,

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I tune into your show for the aforementioned camaraderie,

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
inclusiveness, and positivity,

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
and there is enough negativity that is bound to pop up naturally

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
without having to dedicate a pre-scheduled block of the show

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
to it every week.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I thank you for seeing the exact reasons

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
why I really pushed to have it sunsetted.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I know, I wish DarkSakura was here so she could say her piece

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
because I know the F.U.s were, you know, a lot her as well.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
But I know she agrees and she's on the same page

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
and I think, ironically enough,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
that whole topic we just brought up was around the same time

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
when we had that intense negativity in gaming,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
was around the same time we decided to sunset the F.U. of the week

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
for many of those reasons.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
But we always reserve the right to bring it back

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
because sometimes there's just going to be things we have to,

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
you're right, it is an outlet

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
and sometimes we just have to let it go.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
All right, continuing with the email.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
So, after awakening from the three-year metaphorical sleep study

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
since my call in 2015,

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I've decided to write in to ask y'all's opinions on social media.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I personally have cut social media out of my life for many months now.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
That means no Facebook, Twitter, YouTube comments or anything like that.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I am subscribed to some Discord servers and subreddits

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
that are well-moderated,

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
mostly related to my chosen trade and its related fields,

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
and built on communities based on mutual respect.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Even these, however, I don't check on a daily basis.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I find myself less distracted and more peaceful as a result of these changes,

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
and personally I find the aforementioned services

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000
to be a net negative influence for most people in most cases.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
My girlfriend, after doing some reading and noticing my example,

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
has also dropped social media.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
She held onto Instagram for a while, but eventually she gave that up too.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
We still look up cute animal photos and videos from time to time though,

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
so tell Mr. Smoosh not to worry.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I just posted a new pic of them before the show too.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Mr. Smoosh, spelled M-I-S-T-E-R, Smoosh on Instagram.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Cheap plug.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
I love that Rob has decided to focus on podcasts

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
because I find podcasts to be my favorite way to consume information through the Internet.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
They are generally long form,

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.000
which gives you the chance to flesh out an idea and go deep on a topic,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
and you get to hear people speak for themselves,

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
which humanizes the speaker and usually makes nuances in their ideas clearer.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Thank you, because you're saying it, yes,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
but I'm going to cut that out and put it on the back of the box, exactly.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Also, I'm under the impression that podcasters are generally more reflective,

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:51.000
thoughtful, and respectful than video jockeys or clickbait article writers and twitterers,

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
though when it comes to why exactly this is,

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
or even whether this is a fair assessment, I can't say for sure.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
My intuition is that it may be due to the short attention span

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
plus ad-driven nature of most of the Internet.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Shock value might get you to stop and listen to a host

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
when you are flipping through the channels while you're stuck in traffic, old time radio,

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
or browsing links online, modern Internet,

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
but it is not likely to get you to download a podcast

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.000
and sit and listen to it for 30 minutes, an hour, or even gasp three hours.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
And podcasting doesn't yet attract fly-by-night trolls

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
willing to do or say anything for views or listens.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I find that people that stick with podcasting generally value community,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
discussion, and in some cases,

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000
evangelizing about whatever it is they care about

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
much more than they do view counts and ad revenue at any cost.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I think it's harder for, this is not in the email, this is my thought,

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I think it's harder for the negativity in podcasts to kind of float to the surface

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
because there are so many podcasts out there

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
and because a lot of the algorithms are focused on what is being downloaded

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
and what is highly rated.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
It can be very difficult for all sorts of new shows to kind of rise up,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
but also people that want to get into this for the wrong reason

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
have a really hard time kind of rising up.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
In the video-based world, in the YouTube-based world,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.000
it's very easy to clip a video and show 30 seconds of something,

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
whereas with a podcast, that doesn't really happen.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I'm fully aware of things like Anchor

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000
and people that will take clips of podcasts and put them on YouTube,

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
but they don't really seem to catch that same fire

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
that I think you're kind of referencing here

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
when it comes to little bits, short attention span moments.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Well, there's a podcast that I sometimes listen to,

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
the Totally Unnecessary Podcast with Pat the NES Punk.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
So what they do for their podcast is they just have,

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
they cut out basically each story that they're talking about or each topic,

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000
and they split it down to basically like a 10-minute video,

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
and they just like for a whole week they'll have like 20 videos that go up.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
So that's one way to do it so that you have that kind of short thing.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Plus, you're uploading lots of videos,

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
so that also helps with the algorithms and whatnot.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Interesting.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
So anyways, so what are your thoughts,

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
experiences with different forms of social media?

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Has the internet really made progress since 2005,

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
when podcasts were the new hot tech and blogs were dominant?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Or have we devolved into a culture of ADD,

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
an outrage fueled by ad revenue

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
and technological manipulation of our monkey brains?

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Thanks again for the show, and until next time,

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000
may your lounges be orange and your soccer has dark.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
That's from Midnight Dream.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Great email, Midnight Dream. Thank you so much.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Thoughts on social media?

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
You know, I got to be honest.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I have come so close time and time again to just getting rid of Facebook.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
It's, it's, Facebook sucks for a lot of things.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
It's very unusable right now.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000
It's the clickbait culture and the headlines

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
and the outrage that that leads to

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:53.000
and the fact that people will say things behind a computer screen

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
that they won't say to somebody's face in real life.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.000
A lot of that shit is getting to a point where it's, it's just becoming,

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
I think a lot of people are doing what you're doing

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
and kind of reflecting like, why do I waste my time on this?

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And now that's even like doubled by,

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
we have these recent stories about people in the tech industry

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
that are kind of regretful they committed,

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
or that they created this stuff.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
You know, like what was that thing we just talked about last week

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
that, you know, Tim Cook from Apple,

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
like doesn't let his nephew use social media.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
And then there's also the part that, you know,

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
and I don't mean to get too political here,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.000
but the reality is Russia impacted our election

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
by using social media engineering.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Now, I'm not going to go so far as to say how much of an impact did it have

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
and did it tip the election the entire way.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Y'all can draw your own conclusions on that.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I'm not going to open that can of worms.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
But the fact is, because the reports are out there

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
and Facebook will tell you if you go click on,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.000
these pages were created by Russian entities

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
to try to distract what was going on basically in American politics.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
That is fact that it happened.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
And it's still happening on Twitter,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
and it's probably still happening to some extent on Facebook as well.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
And all that noise, all that garbage,

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
kind of makes you go like,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
well, why am I still continuing to use these websites?

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
But here's reality.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
If I didn't use Facebook,

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
I probably wouldn't know when certain people got pregnant.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I wouldn't know when certain people got married.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I wouldn't know so and so went on a trip lately.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
I would be so far behind on the news.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And I do have a friend that left Facebook behind some time ago,

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000
and I'm finding all the time I'm messaging her something about duh-duh-duh,

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
and I have to stop for a minute and go, shit, she never saw the post on this.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
She has no idea that I did this new thing

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
or I hosted this other show last weekend or something.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
She has no idea about any of that because she's not on Facebook.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
So it's one of those things where kind of like we all have to make a decision

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
to leave Facebook or there's going to be some of us

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
that are putting their news updates on there and others that aren't.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
And then another big reason that I stay on Facebook is Messenger

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
because the reality is that's just replaced email,

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
and there's friends that I talk to every single day on Messenger,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
and if I don't have Messenger, I wouldn't be able to talk to them.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.000
But my understanding is you can deactivate Facebook but still keep Messenger.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000
But I still kind of feel like, well, you're supporting Facebook by using Messenger,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
so I don't know.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
One other thing I want to get out with this,

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I realize it's not like completely gaming related, but I think it is.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
A lot of this stuff is very adjacent.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I do use Twitter a lot, and I really enjoy Twitter,

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
and I've met a ton of people on Twitter,

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000
some of which I consider really close friends

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
or that I have relationships that have gotten closer because of Twitter.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
It's very similar to LiveJournal.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
I met my husband on LiveJournal many, many years ago,

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
which was the social media that we were using before Myspace

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
and Facebook and all that stuff took off.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000
This community that formed OLR got stronger because of LiveJournal,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000
because of social media and all of that.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
So I realize there's a lot of bullshit on Twitter.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000
There's a lot, a lot of bullshit on Twitter.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.000
But I found that with every block I make, with every mute that I do,

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000
it gets a little easier to dodge that noise.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
I blocked Notch, I don't know how long ago,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000
and it's great because when people get mad about whatever he posts,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I don't see it, because I blocked him.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
He's not going to give a shit, he has no idea who I am.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
On top of that, I follow Notch,

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000
but even the way Twitter is with their feed and stuff,

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
even when he does post something that people are getting mad about,

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I can't see it because it sorts my feed all fucking weird.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Oh, here's the new thing I get is now on my feed

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000
because it shows a heck of a lot of what other people liked.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:49.000
I get so much softcore gay porn.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Yes, thank you Captain Spike and all the other people.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Yes, I've had to, I think I had to unfollow them or something

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000
because I'm all, okay, it's cool to like your own things,

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
but Twitter, there was no way for me to block people's likes.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I can't block people's likes, and if you're liking

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000
scantily clad photos, be it of women or men,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I can't block that. I can't view Twitter at my work

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000
because, oh hey, here comes this guy posed all seductively.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
It's like, okay, that's going to be awkward.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Yeah, no, I totally get it.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I think you can get around that by using lists

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
because I don't think that happens on lists,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000
but then if you've muted a person's retweets,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.000
it doesn't matter when you go to the list.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000
So Twitter has some bullshit that needs to really be fixed.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.000
And then, you know, there are still a lot of problems on Twitter

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000
that they have had a real hard time policing certain parts of it,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
but the good news is it's very easy on Twitter,

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
at least in my experience, to cut that out.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
It's just that you feel a little dirty being on the website

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
where all that shit is happening,

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.000
but it is kind of easy to block out that noise, if that makes sense.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
And there are a lot of people on Twitter I haven't befriended,

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
be friended, and have some good friends with them.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Yeah, and all I did, I think, for the pictures

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
is I just started blocking those people,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
not the people retweeting that stuff,

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
but the actual people whose pictures they were.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
And that's why I don't see Notch's shit,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
or the people, all the crazy right-wing guy

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
when he was still on Twitter before they kicked him off.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Like, I was able to dodge that shit

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
because I just blocked them all, or muted them.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Yeah, or just don't follow anybody that has that kind of stuff.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
It's hard sometimes, you know.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.000
So anyway, let's see, I haven't been looking at chat in a minute.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says,

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
I never like anything on Twitter anymore.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I don't want to spam people's feeds.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000
I only like tweets that are positive and to me or about me.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I can't help myself. If I see a fucking funny Drag Race reference,

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
I'm gonna like it.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Well, it doesn't make sure...

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Sorry, I do not like the thirst pics of some of the people that I follow

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:11.000
because I don't want my followers to have to confront that in their own feeds.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.000
So I hope my friends understand that it's not that I don't like your pictures.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I just don't want my followers to be subjected to it,

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
and I know how Twitter works.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Well, that's why they have retweet.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
If I want my followers to see a certain thing that someone else has posted,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
then I can retweet it.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Why do I need to have, like, if I like something, it retweets it.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
That doesn't make any sense.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Yeah, I'm totally with you there.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
That's something that Twitter needs to fix.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Anyway, here's the other thing, though, is that, you know,

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
just like there was LiveJournal before,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.000
even if Facebook and even if, you know, Twitter fade away,

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
there's gonna be something else.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
There's always Ello.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Stop it.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.000
All right, yeah, the Rob D hits the nail on the head.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
All it would take is a group of celebrities and athletes

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
to promote something else, I feel.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Exactly right.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Twitter took off when the president started using it, you know,

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
when celebrities were using it.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And the same thing happened with Myspace, really.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Now all the adults are using it. It's not cool anymore.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
All right, let's move on.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Let's move on. That was a great email.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
But, yeah, I mean, those are my thoughts,

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
is that there are still good things on social media,

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
but I totally understand where, like, sometimes it's just too much.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Like, the way, like, you will see people that know each other

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
go at each other's throats on Facebook.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
It's like, I want no part of this

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
because you're both being ridiculous right now.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Like, you both wouldn't say that to each other's faces.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000
This is dumb.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000
And I've seen some really ugly stuff go on on Facebook

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000
and some of these social media campaigns and lies.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
They get spread because somebody's feelings get hurt

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
and all this shit.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000
And it's like, I don't want any part of it.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
But at the same time, it's a really great way for me to promote,

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
hey, I'm going to be hosting this.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Like, I did a screening of The Room in Sacramento in Midtown last night.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
And, like, I wouldn't have really been able to tell people that any easy way.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
And it's something I'm very proud of that, you know,

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
I got asked to host an event that's something different that, you know,

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I'm getting more of these types of live hosting gigs.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000
And I'm very proud of that.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
And I do want people to know so they can come see me if they want.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
So, anyway, Facebook makes that easy.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
All right, let's move on.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
We do have some more news.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
And then we'll get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.000
all one word, on Skype.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
But first, Loki.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:39.000
All right, so there has been a secret ending for Metal Gear Solid 5

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
that people have found out about a while back.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
But it's never actually triggered until recently.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
And that's right.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:51.000
What is involved to get the secret ending is basically all the players

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
that have to dismantle all of their nuclear weapons.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
So, basically, everybody has to disarm the nukes,

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
and there's world peace, and yay.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000
So the nuclear disarmament ending, I guess,

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000
would have triggered and shows basically this cut scene.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Well, that happened recently on February 2nd.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
However, it was a glitch.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Whoops.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
It wasn't.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.000
They didn't actually disarm all the nukes.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
No.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
So, apparently, Konami came out and said, you know,

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
the nuclear disarmament event was triggered in the Steam version

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
of Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain on February 2nd,

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000
approximately 12 o'clock GMT,

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.000
we're still investigating, but we can confirm that the event was triggered

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000
while the nuke count hadn't reached zero.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:50.000
The thought is that hackers have been manipulating the nuke count in the game,

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000
and they got it so high that it wrapped back around to negative numbers,

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000
and that caused it to trigger.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Huh.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
That game's been out a long time,

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.000
so it's kind of funny that people are just now finding it.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Yeah.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.000
And so that was basically the thing that happened.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.000
And so everyone thought, oh, hey, is this going to trigger a new chapter in the game?

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Nope.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Just the cut scene, sadly.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Nothing else.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
And, well, that's it.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.000
I guess that's the end of that bookend for Metal Gear Solid 5.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000
For your favorite series, it's probably never coming back,

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
because remember, Kojima, no affiliation with Konami anymore.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Metal Gear Solid survivor.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
That's true.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Konami could always take the franchise and give it to somebody else,

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
but anyway.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Meanwhile, over on Nintendo Switch, I don't know about you guys,

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000
but I've amassed all these gold coins that I can't fucking spend on anything,

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
because it's just discounts on software I don't want,

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
or it's free stuff that's also things I don't want.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Well, the good news is Nintendo is going to be changing their gold point system

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
a little bit starting in March, and that's going to affect Europe,

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Japan, and North America.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
So an update is going to occur where you can use gold points

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000
to buy Switch games from the Nintendo eShop.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
So they are saying that will be something you can use in the Switch eShop.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
I just hope it's like, well, for one,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
maybe they'll offer select games and so forth,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
but the stuff they're offering on 3DS and Wii,

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000
or it's like old Wii U, it's stuff that I bought a long time ago

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
and I don't need again or what.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Based on what they were saying before, it was supposed to be one-to-one,

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000
so each coin you get in Japan is equal to one yen,

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
which is basically like a penny here.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000
So I don't know how many gold coins you earn.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
So not only will there be the Switch rewards,

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
but there's this other element of it where you could use one gold coin

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
to basically be, yeah, you're right, in Japan it would be one yen.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000
So that's nothing.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
How many gold coins do you earn at a time?

02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:00.000
You get like 5% back in gold if you get a digital version,

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.000
and it's only a 1% return for packaged Switch purchases.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:11.000
So if I buy a $50 game, I get like 50 coins.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:15.000
So that would be 50 cents from my $50 game.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
That sounds pretty terrible.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Yeah, I know.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
It's almost like I would just rather take the crappy little game

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
that I missed and cash out that way.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
But it is another way you could do it.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I have something like 200 coins in my account,

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
and if it's only worth two bucks, forget it.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000
It's not the way I want to spend those points.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
I'll just wait and hope something good or a really good discount comes around.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
All right, let's move on. Loki.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
All right, so I don't know.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
This is a big controversy, I guess,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
but apparently the debate on the Internet has been,

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Toad, is the mushroom part of his hat, or is that part of his hat,

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
or is that his head?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Which is it? Is it attached to his skull, or is it just cosmetic?

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And apparently Nintendo came out and answered that question,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:10.000
saying that yes, canon is that it is attached to his head.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:15.000
That's what the story is, and apparently even though in the cartoon

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000
he does take it off, that's just him removing the top portion of his skull

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
and not his hat.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Nintendo also didn't make the cartoon.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Nintendo allowed somebody else to make the cartoon.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I would subscribe to the theory that it is not a hat,

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
because if they're from the Mushroom Kingdom,

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
then they look like mushroom people.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:40.000
So if it's just a hat, mushrooms don't wear hats.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000
That's my perspective on it, but I guess this is going to be the new argument.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000
This is the new pineapple on pizza, which, by the way, I love Hawaiian pizza,

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
so don't try to come at me with the whole pineapple doesn't belong on pizza,

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
because it totally is fine.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Hawaiian pizza's great.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I wouldn't put it on every pizza, but I put it on that one.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Yeah, I don't know.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000
So that's how I officially feel.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
It's not a hat.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Yes to pineapple on pizza.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Gif.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Just so we're clear.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Dark Tetsuya says,

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Well, why did they animate that scene with Toad taking his hat off?

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Nintendo didn't animate that scene.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Nintendo had another company animate that scene.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Another company had the rights to do their own cartoon thingy from Nintendo.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:35.000
So technically, all of that is not official canon.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
So there's that.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I'm fine with that too.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Yes. Why doesn't Zelda or Link, I should say, in Zelda ever say,

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Excuse me, princess.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
That never once happens in any of the games.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:54.000
So, you know, who either believe the cartoon or the games?

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
I am already sick of this argument.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
All right.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Speaking of ways to get muted on Twitter, come at me with this argument.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.000
All right.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Let's move on, Loki.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
All right.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
And then finally, this is kind of cool.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000
So you may, if you've played Super Mario Odyssey,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000
especially if you've done some of these weird hat tricks where you jump to

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
No more hat talk!

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
You jump to, like, these, like, hard to reach places and stuff,

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
and you find there's coins there.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
And you think, well, why the hell did they put coins there?

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
That's kind of odd.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000
So apparently in testing this game,

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.000
a lot of the game testers were able to get to different places in the game

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000
that you normally wouldn't be able to get to.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
I guess some unexpected areas.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
And to kind of pay tribute to those testers as well,

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
they put coins in those places.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
So they hid coins in all these places that you would not normally go

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.000
to reward people that have found ways to get to those places, I guess,

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
if that makes sense.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
So that's kind of neat.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Yeah, that is kind of neat.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I don't know if this has to do with Toad's hat, though,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000
but, you know, it's neat.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
No, because Mario's hat is the item in Odyssey.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
But yes, people get to very hard to reach areas,

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
and I think that's kind of cool that Nintendo was like,

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
well, I never thought to get up there, let's put a coin there

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
so other people think to get up there.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
I think that's kind of cool that, you know,

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
they let the testers kind of find the hard to reach shit for them in a way.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
So, kind of neat. I like that.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
All right, one more story for you guys,

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
and it also has to do with Nintendo.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
And then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
all one word on Skype if you want to call in tonight.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.000
And it's about Nintendo Online,

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.000
and they're saying that it's going to be worth the wait.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000
That's right, in a Q&A session for investors,

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
the Nintendo Switch architect Shinya Takahashi

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000
says that this service is going to be, again, worth the wait.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
The question was about Nintendo Switch Online.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
The official start of service has been significantly delayed.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Has anything changed during this extended development period?

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Also, how do you plan to popularize the service?

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
The answer.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000
We view the online service as one component of our efforts

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
to diversify how our games are played

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
and get people to play more of our games.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000
That is why we want to apply substantial resources to the online service

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
with the thinking that we will devote our energies

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
to making this a for-pay service.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
As for how we plan to popularize the service,

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
it is less about the mechanism

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
and more a question of what kinds of products we can offer.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
The spread of the service will depend on whether consumers want what we offer.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Please give us a bit more time to announce more details about the service.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.000
I think that announcement will convey to you how we plan to popularize the service.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000
It does sound very clear to me from that

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
this is not just pay to play online.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000
There is definitely another component to this

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.000
and whether it is the classic game a month that you play online,

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
whether it's that whole thing

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000
or there's another twist to it that we just don't know yet,

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
there's something else there.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:02.000
It's not just 20 bucks to play online Splatoon anymore.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000
But I think we all kind of knew that was the direction it was going in,

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:10.000
but it really does sound like Nintendo is trying to push for something more

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
and that something more they really think is a big deal,

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
whether they're right or not.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.000
But the Switch is selling like fucking crazy,

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
so what do we know anymore?

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Anyway, one more follow-up by Takahashi,

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
who said we have some ideas about how to make Nintendo Switch Online appealing

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
when it becomes a four-pay service,

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:33.000
so I think our next announcement will be worth the wait.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
How about that, Loki?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
It's going to be worth the wait.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Balloon fight with your friends. Worth the wait.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
We'll see what's worth the wait.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I mean, if they are really exceeding my expectations,

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
maybe what they're even doing with the classic games,

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
like maybe they are doing more leaderboards,

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000
maybe they're infusing some of these old classic games

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000
with newer technology and it's not as simple as just emulating the old ROM,

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
maybe if they are going back and doing some crazy shit to their catalog,

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
then bring it on. Let's do it.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
For now, though, I do enjoy that I can play Splatoon Online for free.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.000
You can also do the old school phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Also in chat, more comments at live.vognetwork.com.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000
SSG100Matt says, hey, as long as they don't mess it up, they can take as long as they want.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Nintendo Arcade Room. Don't tease me. Don't tease me with that.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
We have a call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Hey, what's going on? This is Ron. I'm a long time caller, long time listener.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Yeah, great. Great to hear from you again. No, I'm kidding. It's always a delight.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.000
A couple of things. Now, one thing, I tagged you with something on Facebook

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000
and I understand you're going away from Facebook and I get that,

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:58.000
but I'm dragging you back over for one thing you have not responded to. I need to know.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.000
I have a feeling I know what this is, but go for it.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Yes. Spice Girls, are you down?

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Absolutely. Here's the thing. Here's why I didn't respond, Rama.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Because I got tagged in posts by five other people on that.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000
And although I love that people associate me with that news,

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I just didn't get around to responding to every single one.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.000
But let me just put it this way. The name of my other show, Shaking and Crying,

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.000
is not ironic at this point.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Especially when this news inevitably comes up on the show this week.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:40.000
I'm so happy. I fucking... I know people are going to laugh, but I shit you not.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.000
The Spice Girls reunion tour they did, like back in, what, it was 06 or so,

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
was seriously one of the best concerts I've ever been to.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I had so much fucking fun.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Well, I'm going to try to make it this year, because I saw Spice World in theaters,

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000
and I have the VHS tape, so you know I'm a fan.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.000
I know, and I saw Spice World in theaters, too.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I don't have the VHS tape, but I have the DVD.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
But did you play the PS1 game?

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.000
I did, and did you know that Brad from Pod Culture found a copy of it,

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
like a thrift store or something, and he sent it to me,

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
so that I could play it on my PlayStation 3?

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Because PS3 will play PS1 games.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.000
So I can go through the, let's put another girl through her paces, all over again.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000
What is this about? Human trafficking?

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
What? The Spice World game?

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Oh, the Spice World game.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:33.000
No, the Spice World game. Jesus, don't take it to a dark place.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000
But this is Loki here. Of course she's going to take it to a dark place.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
That's a very good point.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000
So yes, I'm excited about the tour. I hope they are coming to the States.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Although the excuse to go overseas, I wouldn't really complain,

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
but we'll wait and see what's going on.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.000
The only outlet that's really confirmed anything is TMZ,

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
so I am still kind of just cautiously waiting.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I would like the Spice Girls themselves to say something,

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000
because TMZ is kind of, you know, trashy news.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000
True.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
So I'm waiting for something a little more official,

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000
but it does seem like something's going to happen. I'm very excited about it.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Me too, and I did also see it linked from Entertainment Weekly,

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
so, you know, getting there.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Getting there. Well, what else is on your mind, buddy?

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
All right, so I was traveling back from Michael Charles' birthday party,

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000
so I missed parts of the show, but I spoke to Hack Def.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
That's my boy, and I appreciate that.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:30.000
So I wanted to comment quickly on the whole Twitch community guidelines thing,

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.000
because I'm starting to see some of the backlash of that on my feed.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Oh, really?

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Yes, because, well, I have friends with various cosplayers,

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
and some of them stream on Twitch,

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.000
and I know some of them stream on adult sites and so forth, you know?

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Sure.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Everyone's got to hustle, make their money, and I respect that.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Sure.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.000
And I know a few who are doing both, and it's all good.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:04.000
I mean, personally, I really don't want to see some of the titties

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
all up on my gaming screen while I'm watching,

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.000
but if that's part of the hustle, so be it.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000
But Twitch is mostly for gaming.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I mean, whether it's male or female, if you want to sexify yourself, that's fine.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Be on one side of the screen,

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:28.000
and let's see you playing through Super Metroid or another game on the other side.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
You know, that's how it's supposed to be.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:34.000
But I get why this happens, because believe it or not,

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
it's much more accessible to get onto Twitch

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.000
as it is to the various other adult sites that are out there.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I have two things to say real quick.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
To the Rob D. in chat who named Posh sporty and scary,

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
you forgot Baby and Ginger.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
There you go. Anyway, those are the five.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Then to your point, here's the thing,

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
and this is what I think everybody needs to keep in mind.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000
For everybody that's saying Twitch is gaming, Twitch is gaming,

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Twitch is gaming, y'all, not for much longer, quote me on this.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.000
I mean, ever since Amazon bought Twitch,

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:10.000
I think you've seen it inch closer and closer to being more than just gaming.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
And I realize the irony here that, you know,

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Twitch once started as a life casting site through Justin TV.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.000
But I don't think it's really, I don't think it's that Twitch is going back to Justin.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.000
I think it's that Twitch is kind of getting closer and closer

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:28.000
to answering our fucking prayers and giving YouTube a competitor

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
that can take them on at their level.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Amazon is at the level where they can compete with Google.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.000
I think that's where Twitch is headed, eventually.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000
So I just don't want people to be shocked when that news inevitably comes out

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.000
that Twitch is much more than games.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:49.000
I like that. I kind of feel as if Twitch is going back to Justin TV as part of their roots.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
It's like, you know what, this is where we started.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Let's add a little bit of this and go out there.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Because I know cosplayers who have their own creative channels on doing live streams of making various cosplays.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I know people who do art and stuff like that. I get that.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:10.000
But there are some levels of lewdness that goes on in Twitch that really shouldn't be there.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Am I going to sit there and tell someone they shouldn't do it? Nope.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Not my business. Not my monkeys.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000
But if it's my site and I see it's causing an issue, then I'm going to be like,

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000
yeah, you gotta reel that back in. Simple as that.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Yeah.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.000
And I honestly feel some are saying, you know, Twitch just opened up an 18 plus site.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000
I'm just like, well, that's not going to do you any good.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I don't think Amazon doesn't want to moderate that. They don't want to have that in their holdings.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:40.000
For whatever reason in this country, and I'm not saying it's right,

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:46.000
I'm just saying for whatever reason in this country, nobody wants to do sex-related stuff

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
and that keeps to an industry all its own.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Oh, go ahead. I was gonna say, you know, I was hearing someone talking about like, you know,

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
what they thought who could be a possible contender.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.000
They would have the infrastructure to be able to compete with YouTube.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000
And it makes so much sense. It's so easy for them to do this.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Pornhub. Pornhub come out with a video platform called like VideoHub or TubeHub or something like that.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
You know, basically like a non porn site.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000
They have the infrastructure in place to be able to do this.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.000
And they have a section off for porn already.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
They could compete, I think.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Yeah, but when you can already submit videos, it's just a matter of time of streaming live videos.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Oh yeah, and I love it when people are like, they post those videos that are like,

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:38.000
70 year old man fucks the entire country at once and it's like Trump giving the speech or something.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Pornhub is out there fighting for our internet rights and so forth.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:44.000
You gotta understand something.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Here is a site that makes money off of guys and girls getting off, fapping, all of this.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:56.000
And they're out there on the forefront fighting for your right to spank and so forth.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
And they do something like that.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I can actually see everybody just going over and then there's just tumbleweeds going through Twitch and YouTube, you know?

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Yeah, and I totally get what you're saying.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:13.000
And here's the thing, with this whole argument, it's like, I don't want to shame sex workers.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
And I don't think you do either.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.000
And I think there's a lot of, you know, people earn, make a living however they're going to make a living.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000
And that's, you know, as long as everything is consensual, that's the most important part.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000
What happens between two consenting adults is their business and that's fine.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
And I'm not out here to shame sex workers.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I think the reality of the situation aims a little closely to what you're talking about where,

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.000
but I don't want to be looking for video games and then come across that.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000
You know, there's a time and a place for that.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I get it, you know.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Yeah.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000
If I'm watching somebody, you know, they're going through a game.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:50.000
If she's wearing something cute, that's fine.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I mean, I'm cool with that.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:57.000
I mean, but if they're doing like, you know, if you tip and they pose a certain,

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:05.000
I get that I'll get more people in, but that kind of takes away from what the reason why you're there.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Yeah, I get it.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:07.000
I get it.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Yeah.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.000
And again, I mean, it's still going to be a great area.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:17.000
And I see Twitch is still trying to dance around it because if they just come down and be like, this is what it is now.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Oh, the backlash is going to be horrible.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:20.000
But you know what?

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I laugh when people say, oh, I don't like what you're doing.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:25.000
I'm going to leave the site.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I'm going to leave the site.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Go right ahead.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:33.000
For one person that leaves the site, three more people will come through and be like, I like what's here.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
That's what it boils down to.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000
I believe it's the 85-15 rule or in this case, the 90-10 rule.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.000
As long as 90 percent of the people are happy with what's going on, that's all that matters.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:51.000
And that may end up, you know, referencing the early email that goes on, that may ultimately end up being what happens with Facebook.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:59.000
You know, once enough people are tipped off about it and go somewhere else, especially when it ends up being the celebrities and so forth.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
That's when Facebook is going to be hurting.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
No.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Anyway, Rama, great call.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.000
But I'm going to let you go to see if anybody else wants to get in since we're coming up on 10 minutes.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
But thank you so much for the call.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Hey, no problem. You all take care now.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Yeah, take care, buddy. Bye.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Bye.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you would like to give us a call.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I didn't check on last minute stories because the phone's lit up pretty quick there.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Do you have any last minute stories to share?

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
No, I don't really have any. I don't remember talking about these, but there was like some...

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
I thought there was one I wasn't able to fit in. I didn't know if you...

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Oh, I didn't look at it.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Way to prepare. Way to prepare.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
All right, we do have the phone lighting up with another phone call, so let's get to it.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Hi, it's Aaron, YYR.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Oh, you're going for the two for tonight, email and phone call.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
But no, we love hearing from you. What's up, YYR?

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Well...

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Oh, yeah, that's right. My mind just totally blanked out.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:24:02.000
I've been kind of burning the candle at both ends and living, breathing, trying to fix all the little problems with the game.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Actually, JD has been a humongous help.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
He pointed out a couple of bugs I don't think I would have found otherwise,

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:19.000
including the fact that my entire routine to figure out the aspect ratio of your screen and adjust accordingly,

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:23.000
I broke it and I didn't even notice until he pointed it out.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Wow, gold star for you, JD.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Honestly, I've been playing the game, and besides the alt-tab thing, which you already knew about,

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
and I didn't get to test your workaround, but besides the stuff you already knew about,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I was really not finding stuff, so good job, JD, who found new stuff in there.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Well, actually, it's pretty funny because the alt-tab crash, I think it has something to do with the resolution,

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:57.000
and JD's fix had to do with resolution, so I just tried this new build in Steam and I couldn't alt-tab crash it,

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:00.000
so I'm wondering if it maybe is fixed now.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.000
But he's not going to be able to test for an hour and a half because he's at a friend's place right now.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Yes, it's Star Trek Discovery finale night. It's a very big deal, so yes, that's what's going on.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Well, now I feel bad for having interrupted him.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.000
No, no, no, no, no, I'm sure he's fine.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:21.000
But yeah, no, but you know what, I know making a game is hard and selling it is even harder.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Well, actually, I shouldn't say that. Making a game, making some games are really easy.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Making a game in ZZT and Twine and stuff with all the tools that are out there, easy.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:37.000
But making something that other people want to buy, that's where it gets hard.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:42.000
So, you know, props to you for these late nights, and I really, really hope you do see success with this game.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:50.000
I understand you're not going to be a multimillionaire that ends up buying Beyonce's house from a game like Super Multitasking,

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.000
but I do hope it gets people to recognize your talent, if nothing else.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
I do hope it gets people to take you seriously.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.000
I hope you get everything I could never get through this podcast, YYR.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Well, you know what, like I've always said, if this does wind up becoming big and then people are all of a sudden lining up to try to interview me,

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:17.000
I'm going to be like, okay, well, okay, so the game's coming out on a Friday, right?

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Right.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:27.000
So if everyone is all of a sudden lining up to interview me, I'll be like, okay, well, I'll start entertaining those requests on Monday,

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:37.000
but Sunday night, I'm doing an exclusive interview with Orange Lounge Radio, the longest running podcast about video games on the internet,

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
and not a thing is going to change that.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000
And that loyalty, that loyalty means a lot to me, my friends.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.000
And hey, if I bring in a whole bunch of new listeners, that's not a bad thing, right?

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I appreciate that, but at the same time, I don't want to set false expectations either.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:58.000
I get really excited about Super Multitasking, I think it could be a success, but you know what?

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000
I thought this show would be a bigger success.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Hey, you did just get an email from a very long time listener.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000
You're right, and I don't ever want to make it sound like this show wasn't a success.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:16.000
If it wasn't, I wouldn't be doing it, but the reality is, you're not hearing ads for Squatty Potty for a reason.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Oh, and actually, you know what? I missed the beginning segment of the show.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:28.000
We were visiting my folks today, and I was still on my way home, but you didn't happen to mention KAC at all, did you?

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:32.000
KAC, is that one of the DDR championships that happened?

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Konami Arcade Champion.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:40.000
We, like, tangentially mentioned it happened, but we didn't get into details, so if you'd like to bring up details, go for it.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Well, you know what? To spoil the details, I think would be detrimental to anyone who would watch it.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:28:02.000
So I would very strongly recommend, if you're into the DDR scene at all, and if you want to see some really, really great competition,

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I would definitely recommend that you go to, actually, really, the easiest way to say this would be if you go to ddrcommunity.com.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:20.000
I mean, they'll probably spoil who won on the front page, but if you scroll down just a little bit, you'll get all the links to watch everything that happened.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:28.000
And, I mean, really, just knowing the result is not going to spoil your enjoyment of just watching how everything went down,

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:37.000
and also the quality that went into the production. Like, they did a great job. They did, like, you know how, you know, before a wrestling match or whatever,

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:47.000
they always do, like, interviews, and it's like, oh yeah, I'm going to take this person down. They did all that with all the contestants for KAC also,

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:53.000
so it was pretty cool to watch. Like, they had the WWE promo videos down pat. Like, it was pretty cool.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:01.000
That's funny. Okay, I like that. I like that. I do want to just clarify an earlier statement, because the Rob D in chat makes a great point over at live.vognetwork.com,

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:07.000
saying, this show is a success for the camaraderie and community it's generated. And you know what, buddy, you're absolutely right.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Don't think I don't, you know, even though I like to make tongue-in-cheek jokes, like, if you can't make fun of yourself, who can you make fun of?

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:21.000
But it's one of those things where it's like, it hasn't been the money that's motivated us for 16 years, let me tell you that.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:28.000
But take it as a compliment that this show has lasted for 16 years without that, and I hope everybody understands what I mean by that.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:34.000
So, anyway. Oh, the other thing I was going to say with that, it's funny, because you bringing up the Konami Championships and saying all that,

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:42.000
it made me think of the DDR freestyle tournament that happened recently, which I can say, I don't think I'm stepping out of line by saying,

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:49.000
they are working on what's next. It's not going to. Freestyle will continue. But I don't have any specifics beyond that.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I'll be lucky if I can get them to do the OLR exclusive, like YYR does with me, gives me the exclusive.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Anyway, but I want to say this, because I don't think Loki's heard this. Did you know there was an earnings call with Round 1, the popular, you know, chain that does,

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:12.000
there was an earnings call, and they talked about, because this is on front page of Imani Style, as well as some other sites, they talked about what the future holds for Round 1.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:19.000
They are opening a brand new Round 1 in Hayward later this year. So the Bay Area is going to get another Round 1, which is pretty cool.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:24.000
And in the fourth quarter of 2019, Roseville confirmed getting a Round 1 entertainer.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Nice.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Right at the, they say it's at the Galleria, which I don't, I'm like, what closed?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Where?

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Yeah, that's my question. I'm like, where? But then I'm thinking across the street from the Galleria, they've had that empty furniture store for years,

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:40.000
so they do the haunted houses and all that stuff. I would bet that's where they put it.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Huh.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Sweet.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Well, their patterns thus far have been, you know, low rent in a mall, like a mall in a low rent area, so.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Yeah, yeah, the Hayward one.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Well, I've got a mall in a low rent area just down the street from my house.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Sunrise mall?

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Sunrise mall, hey, let's bulldoze all the stores, let's just turn the whole thing into a Round 1.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:02.000
They're going to turn that mall into an arena, it's doing so bad.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:10.000
That happened in Sacramento, by the way. Our downtown mall was so bad, they bulldozed it, and that's what the Sacramento Kings played out.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
It's a pretty nice mall, too.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.000
It was when they first opened it, but did you go there in the past couple years it was open?

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.000
No.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Where, like, nothing was open and you'd be walking through just these empty halls, and then there'd just be a random TCBY in the middle of it?

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
I went there when they had BattleTech.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.000
So, ooh, apparently Dark Tetsuya did not know that news. Yeah, go check out Bomani Style DT.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:38.000
And there's some other ones they announced, too. I mean, there's a few in California, which you would expect, but there's some in other parts of the nation as well.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.000
I think in the Ohio area there was one that was opening, so go check it out.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Yeah, they're really expanding all over.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Yeah, awesome news. Well, while we are, I'm going to be doing super multitasking after the show tonight.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:53.000
So, I imagine I'm not the first to stream it, but I've got to be one of the first, right?

02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:02.000
You know what? I sent codes to a few people on a message board, and they said they would be looking forward to streaming it.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:08.000
But, to be honest, I've been so busy, I don't know if anyone's streamed it yet or what.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:14.000
So, because the show is ending a little bit early tonight, I will actually be able to tune in for a bit.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:18.000
So, you will be the first person that I watch stream it.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.000
I'll fucking take it. There we go! Live with the creator.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Alright, and that'll be coming right up here. I'm going to wrap things up here pretty soon.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:31.000
So, while we are on that note, I'm going to let you go, and I am going to wish you luck with the game that is out February 23rd.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:39.000
And I'm usually not such a commercial whore for products, but those of you that have been listening to OLR for a long time know that, like,

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I like to think we've personally had a hand in pushing this game to make YYR, like, fucking motivate him to do it.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:50.000
So, now if only it could just push me into making a game.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
I'll try. I'll try.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:59.000
I'll tell you what I've been doing lately. I've been down this rabbit hole of trying to hack arcade DDR mixes to add new songs to them.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:06.000
So, there is a little piece of this baby that I do think, I do feel like we owe a little bit to.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.000
So, that's why I want to see you do well.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Thank you. Thank you. And, Loki, seriously, like, just throw Stepmania on it if you want to add songs.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:20.000
It's just going to be so much easier, and it's going to save you so much time.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I know, but I like the challenge.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:31.000
You just, you don't know him like I do. He's just, it's just, he, sometimes he has to do it the hard way to say he fucking did it the hard way.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
He's a guy like that.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:39.000
I understand, yeah, I have all the stuff that puts Stepmania on there. I have all the hardware and everything I need to do that.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I just, I want to try it this way, because it hasn't been done yet.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Alright. Alrighty. Cool. Well, enjoy.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Alright, my friend, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Have a great week, you guys.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.000
You too. Bye.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Yep. Bye bye.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Okay, I am going to close up the Skypline on that note. Sorry to those that didn't get through, but you can always send us an email.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.000
But I think with that, if there are no last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:11.000
But I want to thank all you guys for downloading the show and checking it out this week or being here live to listen, whatever the case may be.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:18.000
I know some of you all skipped the 12 hour delayed Olympics footage to come out and listen to the show tonight, so I appreciate that. Thank you.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:25.000
And yeah, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please leave a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here, we can't air them.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:39.000
So tell a friend or two or fifteen about the show. We appreciate it. We appreciate the loyalty, just like YYR has for us.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Alright. We're going to get final thoughts, and then I think we're out of here for the night. So, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I do actually need to work on a game. I've been thinking about it lately because I've been wasting a lot of time with this whole DDR stuff.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:35:01.000
And it's actually kind of fascinating because there are people that have managed on the PlayStation 2 versions to swap songs out and do the music and stuff.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:09.000
And apparently format-wise, it's pretty similar. It's just the tools that do it for PlayStation 1 stuff and a lot of that.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:15.000
It's ironic. I had it on my old hard drive, and then I was copying stuff over from my old hard drive to my new hard drive.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:21.000
I'm like, I don't need that. And I deleted it. And immediately after I deleted it, I'm like, ah crap, I did need that.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:32.000
So, it's alright. But the other day I dumped, because apparently I own most of the arcade discs from the pre-Extreme stuff.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:38.000
So, I dumped all those onto my computer to take a look at them. But I'm curious to see.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Because I know that they've hacked in Marvelous ratings in rankings into Extreme for the arcade.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.000
So, if that's possible, then what else is possible is what I want to know.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Anything is possible.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Exactly. Anything is possible.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
That was a long final thought. Jesus, alright.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Sorry.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:36:00.000
That's okay. My final thought is I think Marissa is going to win Celebrity Big Brother because I'm trash.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Goodnight everybody. We'll see you in seven days for another OLR. Goodnight.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000
But you know they were all still true.
