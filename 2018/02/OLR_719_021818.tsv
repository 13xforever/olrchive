0	27000	This week it's a potpourri of topics in gaming news, fighting games, imminent releases, lootboxes, acquisitions, cryptocurrency and more! There's something for almost everyone in the lineup of tonight's news, so let's waste no more time and get right to the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 719 for this February the 18th of 2018.
44000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts, including DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
53000	55000	Moaning and moaning.
55000	56000	What?
56000	57000	I'm so full.
57000	61000	Oh, I see. I was like, that's not usually a reference to full noises.
61000	64000	Moaning. Pain.
64000	67000	How are you? Thanks for the movie date today. That was fun.
67000	69000	Thank you as well.
69000	71000	Yeah, well you're welcome.
71000	73000	We saw Lady Bird today.
73000	75000	Yes, we finally saw the Lady Bird.
75000	80000	And I kind of want to see it again, but I might have, it wasn't quite ugly crying but it couldn't stop.
80000	89000	Yeah, not that we're a movie podcast, but I really love that movie a lot. Well, I mean, this show, as you probably know, is based in Sacramento, California.
89000	96000	And so certainly there's a certain something, I mean, obviously, like, for example, there's a lot that resonated with you, even though you grew up in Mobile.
96000	101000	You said you had a lot of similar, without kind of giving away the entire plot, you had a lot of similar feelings as the plot progressed.
101000	103000	Especially dealing with my mother.
104000	111000	Although I didn't have, you know, a stable male influence in my life like that. I didn't have a dad I could rely on like that.
111000	114000	But I still have that kind of relationship with my mother.
114000	117000	And, of course, she left and I stayed with Grandmom.
117000	123000	But, you know, just the whole, I need to get out of the place that you still know very well.
123000	127000	And then when you're gone from there, you have the shock, you know.
127000	130000	And it's like, what do I do now?
130000	138000	There was definitely pieces of it. I mean, the fact that I have lived in Sacramento my whole life, there are still like pieces that really resonated with me.
138000	144000	Like the whole, like, the first time you're driving around in your town, you know, it feels so different even though you lived here your whole life.
144000	146000	It was very big for me.
146000	149000	And then all the places were so different, you know, when I moved out here.
149000	155000	I kept going back to the, there were several scenes that show the Rose Garden downtown.
155000	156000	Oh, McKinley Park, yeah.
156000	160000	Yeah. And the thing is, is that I used to work over on C Street at the Cannery Building.
160000	161000	Yeah, yeah.
161000	164000	And so I used to walk all the way around that park every day.
164000	167000	Yeah, it is kind of awesome that there's like legit, like local landmarks.
167000	175000	Like when they do the, when, again, I don't want to spoil something, but there's a very distinct thing that happens and she's with her friend at the Tower Bridge.
175000	176000	Yeah.
176000	182000	And I'm like, I know exactly how they shot that and where that is at because that's on a walking path that I've played Pokemon Go on.
182000	183000	Yeah.
183000	185000	Several times. There's lots of PokeStops up there.
185000	191000	But it just, it makes the whole place, you know, it kind of lets you see the town in a different, through a different lens.
191000	196000	Yeah. So anyway, anyway, not to be too movie chat, but maybe there'll be a Lady Bird game someday.
196000	200000	Just kidding. I think that's one of those games where they can't really make a game out of it.
200000	208000	But then again, they somehow made a game out of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and they made a game out of the room at some point.
208000	210000	So anything's possible, I suppose.
210000	214000	Anyway, say hello to somebody who one of these days will ride a game.
214000	216000	It's Tagmaster Loki.
216000	217000	Hello.
217000	218000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
218000	219000	I'm doing fine.
219000	221000	Yeah, good. Is your mic even on over there?
221000	222000	Yes.
222000	223000	You're just really quiet for some reason. Sorry.
223000	224000	No.
224000	225000	Not hearing you back.
225000	226000	I'm not quiet.
226000	227000	All right.
227000	229000	I'm very loud. I can see myself on the waveform.
229000	233000	Yes, it is on. For some reason, I'm not hearing the same. Maybe I'm just a futz with these speakers.
233000	236000	It's just you're getting older. You're going to need to turn up a hearing aid.
236000	237000	Okay. Here's the other problem.
237000	243000	So it is February 18th and you may or may not know, it is National Wine Day, everybody.
243000	245000	Well, that explains my children.
245000	252000	What the hell does that even? Oh, not that kind of wine, Loki. Not that kind of wine.
252000	255000	No.
255000	258000	You got me good, bitch.
258000	262000	Well, the problem is where I'm going with this and you can probably already figure it out.
262000	268000	I've already had about a glass and a half of one of our favorite sweet wines here locally.
268000	270000	So, yeah, it's National Wine Day.
270000	274000	I can't really drink wine because I don't enjoy it because it makes me feel like I have a really bad.
274000	276000	It goes to my face.
276000	278000	That's what I'm feeling right now.
278000	280000	Like it feels like I have a really bad sunburn.
280000	281000	Yeah.
281000	282000	Like that's not a pleasant.
282000	284000	I feel you, bro.
284000	287000	That's what I'm feeling right now is that sunburn feeling.
287000	289000	But here I am doing a three hour podcast about games.
289000	292000	So good times.
292000	293000	But yeah.
293000	295000	So it's Wine Day.
295000	298000	But of course, everybody, if you do drink, drink responsibly.
298000	299000	Tomorrow is a three day weekend.
299000	301000	Tomorrow is a holiday.
301000	302000	It's President's Day.
302000	303000	So it's a three day weekend for me.
303000	307000	So that's why it really works out to have Wine Day be today.
307000	309000	So I can actually indulge in a little bit of wine.
309000	310000	So there you go.
310000	311000	So I don't know.
311000	315000	Is anyone drinking along in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?
315000	319000	Because we do tape live every Sunday night.
319000	321000	The Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
321000	324000	6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after.
324000	325000	Excuse me.
325000	327000	Hiccups plus wine equals bad.
327000	332000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
332000	336000	Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, I guess.
336000	339000	We're just going to jump right into it and talk a little bit about
339000	342000	Kickstarter's gone really, really wrong.
342000	345000	Loki, would you lead us a little bit on our kickoff topic tonight?
345000	347000	So I don't know if this is really wrong.
347000	352000	But basically, the System Shock remake that was kickstarted a couple years ago
352000	355000	for 1.3 million is on hiatus.
355000	359000	Thanks to, they say they had problems with development.
359000	365000	And so the company Night Drive Studios, they're an indie game developer.
365000	371000	And they were, of course, going to basically remake that whole thing.
371000	377000	That was kind of back when a lot of the games coming out were remakes.
377000	381000	Like you'd have the BioShock remakes and that kind of stuff.
381000	387000	Now, of course, as our concept grew and our team changed,
387000	390000	so the scope of what we were doing and with the budget for the game,
390000	394000	as the budget grew, we began a long series of conversations
394000	396000	with potential publishing partners.
396000	400000	The more that we worked on the game, the more we wanted to do.
400000	404000	And the further we got from the original concept that made System Shock so great.
404000	410000	So I guess right now they're just taking time to work on it longer
410000	414000	or reassess what they need to do to bring the project back to their original scope.
414000	417000	And here's why I shade all the Kickstarter stuff.
417000	422000	And look, I understand the whole if you have to delay a game
422000	425000	to make it the game that you need to make, then fine.
425000	428000	But it's a tricky balance with Kickstarter.
428000	431000	Because in Kickstarter, you're asking for people's money up front.
431000	435000	And usually, almost always, it's the full cost of the game,
435000	439000	maybe with a small discount because you're showing your faith in the game early on.
439000	444000	And yet this is just another in a long line of games that has either been delayed
444000	446000	or in some cases disappeared.
446000	450000	And there's a part of me that hears, oh, such and such game has gone on hiatus.
450000	454000	And I kind of go, well, some bands go on hiatus.
454000	456000	The Spice Girls are on hiatus.
456000	460000	You have to recognize, though, that Kickstarter is not a pre-order.
460000	463000	It's just you're investing money in a company for a product,
463000	465000	and that may not work out.
465000	470000	And so we've already told people enough to stop pre-ordering games.
470000	472000	So this is even worse.
472000	476000	You pre-order a game before it's even made, like two years before it's even made.
476000	478000	So I don't know.
478000	482000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says,
482000	484000	where I was going to go with the system's shock story
484000	486000	is that it was put on Kickstarter as a remake,
486000	489000	but now it's just a different game in the same universe.
489000	491000	Everyone on Kickstarter backed a remaster.
491000	493000	That's another good point is that things have kind of changed
493000	495000	from what it was originally supposed to be.
495000	498000	MXC says, I'm very nervous about Night Drive Studios.
498000	501000	They mostly get the licenses of old PC games and then remake them,
501000	503000	so they run on Windows 10.
503000	506000	But do they have the skill to fully remake a game even with the money?
506000	508000	I can see why they're having trouble.
508000	511000	And JD points out the Spice Girls are coming back.
511000	513000	Technically nothing official has been confirmed.
513000	515000	This is all through TMZ.
515000	517000	So there's still that part of me that says,
517000	520000	until I hold those concert tickets in my hand, I don't believe anything.
520000	522000	And don't believe those dates that are on Facebook either.
522000	524000	Read the descriptions of that stuff
524000	526000	and look who's actually inviting you to that stuff.
526000	529000	Because all that shit that's like Spice Girls tour in this city,
529000	532000	that's some frickin' lame-o concert promoter locally
532000	536000	trying to farm the likes to then push out a bunch of crap to you.
536000	539000	Just basically get your name on a mailing list, essentially is what that is.
539000	543000	Another reason why Facebook sucks, but I won't get into that right now.
543000	547000	But how are you feeling overall, Loki, about Kickstarter at this point?
547000	550000	Do you still back projects on Kickstarter?
550000	552000	Not really.
552000	554000	It's been a while for me. It's been a very long time.
554000	559000	I know one project I backed, We Happy Few,
559000	563000	spams the fuck out of their updates.
563000	566000	I get so many stupid updates from them.
566000	570000	I'm sure there's a way to turn that off, but it's fucking annoying.
570000	572000	Don't get me wrong, I like backing stuff,
572000	575000	but dude, I don't need a million fucking updates about that.
575000	579000	I think the last one I backed was one of the guys we had on the show.
579000	581000	We had the guy who made Tangledeep that was on the show.
581000	584000	But what I liked about the way he was doing it
584000	586000	is that that game was pretty much already done,
586000	588000	and was going to be done,
588000	592000	is that he was looking for this money to put the extra coat of paint on it.
592000	594000	You remember that? It was bringing in guest composers,
594000	596000	help with some of the publishing and stuff like that,
596000	598000	and I was like, okay, that's the way to do it,
598000	601000	because he already essentially had a game done.
601000	604000	He was just looking for the money to kind of elevate it into
604000	607000	this is the commercial release, or whatever you want to call it,
607000	610000	that I want it to be. I kind of liked that.
610000	612000	It wasn't something that had to be built from the ground up,
612000	615000	because hell, even Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night,
615000	619000	that game is still not out, and how long ago was that Kickstarter?
619000	624000	Now, again, take the time to get it right, I suppose,
624000	626000	but there's still that part that's like,
626000	628000	dang, I gave them money four years ago,
628000	631000	when this game was supposed to be on the Nintendo Wii?
631000	633000	No, I'm just kidding. There's a lot of games.
633000	639000	The problem is, we always focus on the games that this stuff is happening in.
639000	641000	We forget half the stuff that goes through it,
641000	643000	and it's just fine.
643000	645000	I think Stardew Valley was a Kickstarter game, wasn't it?
645000	647000	Was it? I don't remember,
647000	651000	but there's been games like that that have gone through the process
651000	655000	with Kickstarter and stuff, and have come out just fine.
655000	658000	We always focus on the ones that do bad,
658000	661000	because that's all you ever remember.
661000	662000	Fifth Dream in Chat says,
662000	665000	I back Patreons more than Kickstarters nowadays.
665000	669000	Have I ever talked in depth about why I really don't care for Patreon?
669000	672000	Maybe I'm only willing to do it tonight, because I've had a little bit to drink.
672000	675000	But here's my problem with Patreon, full stop.
675000	679000	Patreon feels very pyramid scheme-y to me,
679000	684000	because Patreon shows what you're contributing to other people,
684000	686000	as well as what they're contributing to you.
686000	690000	So I kind of feel like, okay, if I go on to Patreon,
690000	693000	and I've had plenty of other podcasters say,
693000	696000	why don't you have OLR on Patreon, why don't you do this on Patreon?
696000	700000	Because, okay, cool, then we would be getting money on Patreon,
700000	703000	but I would also kind of feel this sense,
703000	705000	because I want to promote other podcasts,
705000	708000	I would feel like, in turn, shouldn't OLR be showing the support
708000	711000	by backing other people's Patreons?
711000	712000	And then what happens?
712000	715000	You give us a dollar, now we give you a dollar,
715000	720000	so it's not even, except for the fact that Patreon has taken a percentage cut of both sides.
720000	724000	So that's the part, and I know not everybody's going to understand that
724000	728000	and think I'm being weird, but that's the part that never really sat well with me,
728000	731000	is that I feel like Patreon is this never-ending,
731000	733000	I give you a dollar, you give me a dollar,
733000	737000	and Patreon still gets a percentage of the cut off the top the whole way.
737000	740000	And that's not even getting into the other part of it,
740000	742000	which I know I've talked about before,
742000	745000	which is all still very relevant about the whole,
745000	749000	I like to do OLR because it's fun, I get to see you all,
749000	753000	and once I feel a little more like,
753000	756000	I feel like if you're giving us money,
756000	759000	and then we have to go and, let's say, cancel a show,
759000	761000	and last year we had to cancel a lot of shows,
761000	763000	because there was just a lot going on.
763000	768000	Even though I know 99.9% of the listeners were more than understanding those scenarios,
768000	769000	and I thank you for that,
769000	771000	I would still feel that kind of sense of,
771000	773000	you paid us for something we didn't deliver on,
773000	776000	now I've become one of these Kickstarters.
776000	778000	Now you're part of the whole network.
778000	780000	Yes, now I'm part of that whole problem.
780000	783000	And whether it's true or not, I'm just telling you that's where my brain goes.
783000	788000	Whether I'm being rational or not, that's what happens with my brain.
788000	793000	So that's kind of a big reason why I've never gone to Patreon.
793000	798000	And I have nothing against other shows that go to Patreon to do this stuff.
798000	800000	That is something you have to figure out for yourself,
800000	803000	and you have to do for your show, and that's totally cool,
803000	806000	and I am definitely a supporter of independent podcasting,
806000	809000	whether that's through finance, whether that's through word of mouth, whatever.
809000	812000	Well, I think a lot of the shows that I've seen that use Patreon,
812000	814000	they kind of put it this way.
814000	819000	It's like, we're doing this show, if you want to back us, that's cool,
819000	824000	but if you can't find it, if this is going to be a financial burden for you, please don't.
825000	828000	Or just, only if you want to, type of thing.
828000	832000	And so kind of making it, listen, this show's going to be what it is,
832000	835000	whether you back it or not, type of thing.
835000	838000	Getting some comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com.
838000	841000	SG100Matt says, I stopped backing gaming Kickstarters.
841000	845000	Too much nonsense happens in development where I will just purchase the game when it comes out.
845000	848000	Yeah, I'm not helping the cause, but there have been many gaming Kickstarters
848000	850000	that have gone wrong during development.
850000	854000	Dungeon Buster says, Pillars of Eternity boasts Divinity Original Sin games,
854000	857000	Wasteland 2, the Shadowrun series.
857000	861000	There's a lot of success stories, but it only takes a few to sour people on the process.
861000	863000	And some people are also bringing up other games.
863000	866000	Shovel Knight was another success, and so forth.
866000	870000	Also, Bobby Blackwolf points out Mutant Football League,
870000	872000	which I know he's been streaming more and more of lately,
872000	874000	cheap plug for Bobby Blackwolf,
874000	879000	was a failed Kickstarter, but what came out of it was a much better game, in my opinion.
879000	881000	That could be.
881000	885000	I can't really say yes or no, because I haven't played the game myself,
885000	887000	but it looked interesting.
887000	891000	JD in chat says, I can't find the Kickstarter for Stardew Valley.
891000	893000	I think it might not have been one.
893000	894000	Ok.
894000	897000	And AkumaJP says, Sky will not do well in business.
897000	899000	He is too nice.
899000	903000	I can be a dick when I need to be, but it's a fair criticism,
903000	908000	but I don't want OLR necessarily to pay the bills.
909000	911000	I have a day job that's cool.
911000	913000	I want it to pay my meth habit.
914000	917000	Oh wait, I don't have a meth habit, so I guess I don't need it.
917000	920000	I need it to pay for my cookie habit.
920000	924000	But I could develop a meth habit, and then I wouldn't have to worry about the cost of it.
924000	926000	I wouldn't have to worry about having a job.
926000	930000	I'm just thinking about this animated short that plays before Rocky Horror every time,
930000	934000	where the little dancing popcorn and that stuff,
934000	937000	but it's a death metal band with the pretzel and stuff,
937000	940000	and they go, don't stop, watch, and then they go,
940000	943000	we have all your fucking money and we're going to spend it on drugs.
944000	945000	It's pretty awesome.
945000	948000	But that's just what you said kind of reminded me of that.
951000	954000	I'm going to start streaming more, just basically,
954000	958000	the whole thing is going to be going back into whatever I happen to make on it.
958000	962000	We'll be going back into doing stuff for VOG.
962000	965000	Oh, sorry. I was going to say, ironically,
965000	968000	there was a game today that I saw that I was like, ooh, I want to back that.
968000	969000	What's that?
969000	971000	It was What the Golf.
973000	975000	This already sounds like a Loki game.
975000	978000	It's basically, yeah, it's kind of, you know, it's like,
978000	981000	this is what, you know, it's time the car should have been,
981000	984000	but it's basically this golf game by people that hate golf,
984000	988000	and it's just the most ridiculous thing.
988000	991000	It's basically the whole thing is kind of the golf controls,
991000	994000	where you point a direction and you pull back and click and stuff like that,
994000	997000	and you try to get to the hole, but they're not really counting strokes.
997000	1001000	It's more of like trying to avoid obstacles and stuff, and it's really silly.
1001000	1004000	But yeah, look up What the Golf, everybody. It's awesome.
1004000	1005000	Okay.
1006000	1007000	I will get right on that.
1007000	1009000	I'm right on top of that, Rose.
1009000	1012000	I was going to say, though, before somebody points it out
1012000	1016000	and accuses me of being a total hypocrite, which may or may not be true,
1016000	1019000	I do stream on Twitch occasionally.
1019000	1020000	I haven't been doing it as much as I'd like,
1020000	1023000	but I'm very proud of the fact that I'm juggling three podcasts a week right now.
1023000	1026000	So a pro over here, a con over here.
1026000	1030000	But when I do stream on Twitch, I do take the tips and I take the subscription,
1030000	1031000	and I'm totally fine with that.
1031000	1035000	But I also feel like a tip in that sense is a tip.
1035000	1039000	It's a one-time thanks, hi, how you doing, here's some money to support it,
1039000	1043000	and I'm literally offering you nothing for that.
1043000	1046000	Now believe me, I appreciate it deeply,
1046000	1051000	and we do pay money to have the capture card
1051000	1053000	and have the cable running.
1053000	1056000	But even deeper than that, for stuff like OLR,
1056000	1058000	obviously we need to buy new microphones probably.
1058000	1061000	We're getting to that point where these lovely microphones
1061000	1062000	that Brad used to use for Pod Culture,
1062000	1064000	some of them are seeing their last day
1064000	1066000	because they get through a lot of use around here,
1066000	1068000	so we could probably stand to have some more microphones.
1068000	1074000	We do pay a pretty good chunk of, about a video game's worth of money a month
1074000	1077000	to keep the stream up and running, and that's just what I'm paying.
1077000	1078000	Bobby's paying for the website.
1078000	1082000	So your money does get used for good stuff,
1082000	1086000	but I'm okay with that because, in a sense,
1086000	1090000	you're giving me money for nothing on paper.
1090000	1091000	And the rent's for free?
1091000	1093000	But your money is being turned around.
1093000	1095000	Brain went to dire straits, sorry.
1095000	1098000	No, no, it's all good. I understand.
1098000	1100000	Let's see.
1100000	1102000	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1102000	1104000	Dungeon Buster says, Steam Greenlight.
1104000	1107000	According to the wiki, Stardew Valley went to Steam Greenlight,
1107000	1110000	and then went into early access for funding.
1110000	1113000	I thought it was kickstarted at 1.2, though.
1113000	1115000	Whatever, it's still a great game.
1115000	1119000	ActDeftInChat says, It's not my money, it's Amazon or Twitch's Prime.
1119000	1122000	Well, but that's still, in a way, it is still your money,
1122000	1123000	because you're paying for Prime, but I get it.
1123000	1125000	I mean, it's like you get all this stuff with Prime,
1125000	1128000	and you really should, like, if you guys do have Amazon Prime,
1128000	1132000	you should be giving that free Prime a month to somebody.
1132000	1134000	Like, obviously, I'd love it if it were me,
1134000	1138000	but if it's not, like, give it to, like, I know Flaco does streaming.
1138000	1140000	Bobby's trying to get affiliate status.
1140000	1142000	Jamie did get affiliate status.
1142000	1144000	Like, give your, and even if it's not one of us,
1144000	1148000	just a streamer that you like that's working hard,
1148000	1150000	please remember to use your sub,
1150000	1153000	because they don't do a good job about reminding you, like,
1153000	1155000	oh, you have a sub to give away.
1155000	1157000	It's been 30 days. You have a new sub.
1157000	1159000	So, you know, trust me.
1159000	1162000	The people really, really appreciate it when you do use your sub.
1162000	1165000	If you're using Prime anyway for the shipping stuff
1165000	1171000	or the TV service or whatever, like, just don't forget to give those away.
1171000	1173000	If I end up getting that Visual Novel Maker,
1173000	1176000	I might stream using the Visual Novel Maker.
1176000	1178000	Why not? Why not stream making a game?
1178000	1180000	That's what I'm kind of thinking about doing,
1180000	1182000	except I still need to get the rest of my story.
1182000	1186000	And I'm actually planning on streaming doing my webcomic
1187000	1193000	when I do the existential crisis in Animal Crossing.
1193000	1196000	One more comment on the Twitch stuff.
1196000	1198000	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, you may not accept our money,
1198000	1202000	but you accept our love, appreciation, and occasional meals or drinks
1202000	1203000	when we see you in person.
1203000	1205000	Absolutely. Absolutely.
1205000	1209000	I love all that stuff, especially drinks in moderation,
1209000	1212000	as I'm doing tonight here on OLR.
1212000	1215000	Jamie, I didn't really pick your brain on the Kickstarter stuff,
1215000	1218000	but have you backed anything in a while, and if so, why or why not?
1218000	1223000	The last thing I backed was my Hataful Boyfriend plushies,
1223000	1228000	and I got them, and they're great, and that's it.
1228000	1233000	Dan backed Bloodstained, and I don't think he regrets it.
1233000	1235000	We both kind of agree that...
1235000	1238000	Actually, I think I did put that as well so I could get a copy too,
1238000	1243000	but I think we both agreed that it would, you know,
1243000	1246000	we'd rather wait for a good finished game.
1246000	1248000	Sure. That's fair.
1248000	1250000	Yeah. I don't mind. That money's already gone.
1250000	1253000	What's it going to do us now, right?
1253000	1255000	Well, but at least we still have a game coming,
1255000	1257000	but, you know, if you donated to this,
1257000	1259000	A, you're not even going to get the game you thought you were getting.
1259000	1261000	B, now it's on hiatus.
1261000	1264000	I mean, we're just hoping at this point it's still going to happen.
1264000	1266000	You know, and I'm not trying to be overly negative,
1266000	1269000	but it's just the reality is a lot of stuff that gets put on hiatus
1269000	1271000	gets put on hiatus for a long time.
1271000	1272000	Yeah.
1272000	1274000	Guys on a show technically is on hiatus.
1274000	1276000	I would love that for that show to come back,
1276000	1279000	but it just, you know, extras going through a lot.
1279000	1281000	I'm going through a lot, so I just don't know when it's going to be right
1281000	1283000	for that show to come back.
1283000	1284000	Yeah.
1284000	1287000	So that show's also free.
1287000	1289000	Well, speaking of money and things,
1289000	1293000	I would like to take a moment just to thank everyone who donated to my mom.
1293000	1294000	Yes.
1294000	1298000	She now has rent for another month,
1298000	1301000	and the GoFundMe is still open.
1301000	1304000	If anyone wants to contribute, I'll link it in the chat.
1304000	1307000	But I really do appreciate it,
1307000	1312000	and listening to my mom cry on the phone instead with happy tears
1312000	1315000	was definitely more what I wanted to hear
1315000	1318000	as opposed to, you know, when she called me after Michael died.
1318000	1320000	She just got his ashes.
1320000	1326000	So, but yeah, she wanted me to pass on to all of you
1326000	1329000	and how grateful she is to everyone that's contributed to
1329000	1332000	and continues to contribute to her GoFundMe.
1332000	1335000	So thanks, everyone, for keeping a roof over my mom's head
1335000	1338000	until the government assistance comes through.
1338000	1339000	Awesome.
1339000	1340000	Thank you.
1340000	1342000	I also want to give a quick shout-out here
1342000	1344000	since we're talking about really good fundraisers.
1344000	1347000	So this is one that I actually picked up through my Ingress circles,
1347000	1351000	which, you know, was a game we talked about about a month ago here on the show.
1351000	1355000	But this is really funny because I actually met this guy
1355000	1358000	from playing Ingress, but he's actually, like,
1358000	1361000	a fairly well-known classic game developer,
1361000	1363000	and it was one of those things where I was like,
1363000	1366000	oh, I had no idea that is, like, what you did and what you were known for.
1366000	1370000	But anyway, his name's Chuck, and he was actually the creator
1370000	1374000	and developer of a game called Chip's Challenge,
1374000	1376000	and it was on the Atari Lynx.
1376000	1377000	Another game.
1377000	1378000	So here's the deal.
1378000	1380000	There's another Ingress player who,
1380000	1382000	she's a single mom raising her kid right now,
1382000	1385000	and she found that she had an Atari Lynx, like, sitting around,
1385000	1387000	and she said in one of the Ingress hangouts,
1387000	1389000	does anyone want, like, an Atari Lynx?
1389000	1392000	And that kind of started, like, a whole conversation about it,
1392000	1393000	and Chuck was like, well, wait a minute.
1393000	1397000	Let's, you know, I'll try to, you know, give my little endorsement
1397000	1400000	or whatever to this, and let's try to, like, you know,
1400000	1402000	get you some extra money to help out here.
1402000	1404000	So they actually put up on eBay.
1404000	1408000	It's an Atari Lynx, and it has California games and Chip's Challenge,
1408000	1410000	and Chuck is going to autograph the Lynx
1410000	1412000	and autograph Chip's Challenge for you,
1412000	1414000	and you can see more information about that.
1414000	1415000	It is on eBay.
1415000	1417000	I'll have to post the link in chat.
1417000	1418000	It was recently on my Twitter earlier today.
1418000	1420000	Maybe somebody can dig that up for me.
1420000	1422000	Do you know what generation of Lynx it is?
1422000	1424000	The old one.
1424000	1425000	Is it?
1425000	1426000	It's the original.
1426000	1428000	Okay, because I can't tell from the picture.
1428000	1430000	I know because I have an original.
1430000	1433000	PAG 0201, tested with two games.
1433000	1434000	Yeah, we have the newer one.
1434000	1435000	Okay.
1435000	1439000	Yeah, but we already have all those games.
1439000	1441000	So, anyway, I will definitely,
1441000	1444000	I'm going to work to get Chuck on the show at some point, absolutely.
1444000	1445000	Cool.
1445000	1447000	You know, I wonder if he's been to Atari Party
1447000	1449000	because the name sounds really familiar.
1449000	1451000	I don't see how he hasn't been.
1451000	1454000	I mean, if they know he's in Folsom,
1454000	1456000	they know that, you know, they probably invited him.
1456000	1458000	I should have him sign my Lynx.
1458000	1460000	I need to sell it anyways because I don't play it.
1460000	1462000	Yeah, but this is for a good cause, Loki.
1462000	1464000	It's a good cause, too, for me.
1464000	1468000	Well, I'd have him sign our cartridge, but we play our Lynx sometimes.
1468000	1472000	Well, I'll ask him next time I see him if he knows about Atari Party.
1472000	1475000	So, I see him at least once a month or so for various Ingress events.
1475000	1477000	So, I'll ask him if he knows about Atari Party,
1477000	1480000	and we'll get him on the show at some point, if he's willing, which I don't...
1480000	1481000	I used to play a crap...
1481000	1482000	I think he did say he would.
1482000	1484000	I used to play a crap ton of Chip's Challenge in the,
1484000	1487000	was it the Windows Game Pack order they used to have on Windows 3.1?
1487000	1489000	Yeah, a lot of people kind of talking about that.
1489000	1491000	They kind of know the Windows version almost a little bit better,
1491000	1493000	but it was, I guess, a Lynx thing because he had a lot to do with Lynx.
1494000	1496000	So, anyway, check that out and help out with my books.
1496000	1498000	That's Windows Air Team Impact. Thank you.
1498000	1501000	All right. Thank you, Azette.
1501000	1503000	Please approve the Lynx that's in our chat.
1503000	1504000	Thank you, Azette.
1504000	1507000	She actually put that in there because Azette is also one of these Ingress folks
1507000	1509000	that knows all of these people involved.
1509000	1512000	Anyhow, cool, cool.
1512000	1514000	So, we got the fundraisers out there,
1514000	1516000	and we've got our kickoff topic all finished,
1516000	1518000	so I think it's time to get into our gaming week.
1518000	1520000	So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1520000	1522000	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1523000	1525000	Just Animal Crossing and Miitomo,
1525000	1528000	and I actually didn't play hardly any Ingress,
1528000	1534000	or actually I played Ingress today in the bathroom of the movie theater.
1534000	1538000	I had things to your portal at the movie theater.
1538000	1540000	I was going to say, what did you do, bump the portal?
1540000	1541000	Yeah, bump the portal.
1541000	1543000	I didn't even notice.
1543000	1544000	A euphemism.
1544000	1545000	No, no.
1545000	1549000	No. No bumping the portals that way.
1549000	1555000	But really, it's been kind of a weird week for me,
1555000	1558000	so I haven't really gotten to play much.
1558000	1563000	Although, I installed Secret of Mana because I wanted to stream it,
1563000	1565000	but now that 50 million other people are streaming it,
1565000	1566000	I might stream something else.
1566000	1567000	Sorry about it.
1567000	1569000	Let you know you're not.
1571000	1576000	So, I'm actually thinking of playing the original Secret of Mana
1576000	1579000	either on our cartridge, so we'd have to get up to the CRT
1579000	1583000	to keep it with no delay, or just doing it through the SNES Classic.
1583000	1588000	So, Hubby and I are talking about it, but he'd have to be my player two.
1588000	1591000	I'm the player one around these parts.
1591000	1592000	All right.
1592000	1594000	So, if that's it for your gaming week,
1594000	1597000	we'll go to Loki with your gaming week.
1597000	1599000	I mainly played...
1599000	1601000	Well, I played a little bit of Stardew Valley.
1601000	1603000	Not as much as I have been.
1603000	1606000	A little bit more of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes,
1606000	1610000	just trying to grind out the last 100% on there
1610000	1613000	so that I can finally stop playing the game
1613000	1616000	because I'm not really enjoying it anymore.
1616000	1619000	And then lots of Dance Dance Revolution.
1619000	1622000	I've been playing at least 30 minutes a day, an hour yesterday,
1622000	1625000	because I have time to do that.
1625000	1628000	And then a little bit of Pokémon GO,
1628000	1632000	a little bit of Ingress when I'm out.
1632000	1634000	That's pretty much it.
1634000	1635000	All right.
1635000	1637000	Well, I don't usually talk about the Ingress stuff,
1637000	1639000	but I did go on about a two-hour bender last night
1639000	1642000	just because we did Rocky Horror on Friday this weekend,
1642000	1643000	which isn't the usual night.
1643000	1645000	We usually do Saturday.
1645000	1647000	So, I was up until 2 a.m. on Fridays,
1647000	1649000	so I was kind of up late last night.
1649000	1651000	So, I was just like, you know, I'm bored,
1651000	1653000	and I don't feel like playing Final Fantasy XIV again.
1653000	1656000	So, vroom, vroom. Let's go make green things.
1656000	1658000	So, I did that for a little bit.
1658000	1660000	But otherwise, I've, of course, been playing Final Fantasy XIV.
1660000	1662000	I got my Red Mage up to level 60.
1662000	1664000	I've really enjoyed playing that class in the game.
1664000	1666000	I really like how the kind of like ping-pong mechanic
1666000	1668000	works in that game.
1668000	1669000	You want to jump in here?
1669000	1671000	Yeah, I just remembered I've been playing WoW.
1671000	1672000	Oh.
1672000	1674000	Me talking about MMOs reminded you of MMOs.
1674000	1676000	Well, yeah, I've been playing A Night Born.
1676000	1677000	So.
1677000	1679000	Okay. Awesome.
1679000	1682000	I have also been playing a shit ton of Pokémon GO.
1682000	1683000	Oh, my God.
1683000	1686000	Like, just having the gacha, like, I'm able to play a lot.
1686000	1688000	And Community Day is coming up this weekend.
1688000	1689000	I'll probably play even more then.
1689000	1690000	So, yeah.
1690000	1691000	What is Community Day?
1691000	1694000	So, that's where, that's kind of like what they're trying to do
1694000	1696000	instead of the whole, like, we do a big event in Chicago
1696000	1698000	and it melts down everything.
1698000	1702000	So, what they did last month is that they set like a three-hour window
1702000	1704000	and they're like, okay, for these three hours,
1704000	1707000	what they did last month is Pikachu is going to spawn everywhere.
1707000	1708000	It's going to be like a Pikachu day.
1708000	1712000	And for these three hours, it's double XP.
1712000	1714000	And I don't remember if they did double Stardust.
1714000	1715000	I don't remember.
1715000	1717000	But it was something that, it was at least double XP.
1717000	1721000	And the amount of shiny Pikachus went way up.
1721000	1725000	Like, it was more like a 1 in 64 or a 1 in 128.
1725000	1730000	I caught four shiny Pikachus in the three-hour window of Community Day last time.
1730000	1734000	So, anyway, the Community Day they're going to do this month is Dratini,
1734000	1736000	which is kind of a harder to find one.
1736000	1738000	You know, most people in these parts, you know,
1738000	1742000	even though we had the Anatolia farm the first two weeks of the game,
1742000	1743000	that's long gone.
1743000	1744000	So, anybody getting into the game now,
1744000	1746000	usually the only place to go is like Pier 39
1746000	1749000	or you might luck out once in a while in Cameron Lake.
1749000	1751000	But otherwise, you have to hatch them, right?
1751000	1753000	Like, you don't really get Dratini.
1753000	1755000	So, this is going to be great for people around the world.
1755000	1757000	Dratinis are going to spawn everywhere.
1757000	1759000	We don't know if shiny Dratini is going to happen,
1759000	1762000	but it seems like lately in Pokemon Go with all the events,
1762000	1764000	they've been introducing a new shiny.
1764000	1767000	Like, they did the Valentine's event where Love Disc was everywhere.
1767000	1769000	Well, shiny Love Disc was a part of that.
1769000	1771000	They rolled out shiny Love Disc with that.
1771000	1774000	They just did, they just wrapped up Chinese New Year.
1774000	1775000	It's the year of the dog, right?
1775000	1777000	Oh, that's why those dogs were everywhere.
1777000	1782000	Yeah, so Puchina, I think is the name from Gen 3, the gray dog.
1782000	1785000	Well, the shiny tan dog started showing up.
1785000	1787000	So, they've been releasing new shinies with events.
1787000	1791000	So, everybody expects that shiny Pink, I think it is Dratini,
1791000	1796000	will start showing up, which means Dragonite and Dragonair,
1796000	1798000	I think is the middle evolution for that.
1798000	1800000	So, all those shinies are going to start.
1800000	1802000	People are assuming that part, though.
1802000	1804000	Niantic has not confirmed that.
1805000	1808000	But that's kind of neat if they're rolling out shinies very slowly
1808000	1810000	to correspond with events, because my understanding is that
1810000	1813000	the shinies don't go away just because the event did.
1813000	1815000	So, we'll see. We'll see what happens.
1815000	1817000	Anyway, other stuff I've been playing.
1817000	1819000	I have also been playing a lot of Heroes of the Storm,
1819000	1821000	which has been my every week lately,
1821000	1825000	but I'm still just trying to get my gold so I can buy my new characters.
1825000	1827000	Been working on that.
1827000	1832000	And then this week, I did get that Secret of Mana remake,
1832000	1835000	and I did stream it, Jamie, I did stream it on Friday,
1835000	1838000	about the first hour, maybe hour and a half of the game.
1838000	1842000	I at least got up to the point where you get the girl character
1842000	1846000	to join your party, because I got to name her Jamie.
1846000	1848000	Because, well, you know, it just makes it,
1848000	1850000	if you look at the dialogue, she kind of,
1850000	1854000	she's kind of a little bit, she's kind of mean to the guy,
1854000	1855000	and I was like, oh, it's Jamie to me.
1855000	1856000	I'm not mean.
1856000	1857000	No, you're not mean.
1857000	1858000	Always.
1858000	1860000	It's that very, she's just an independent woman
1860000	1861000	who isn't here for your shit.
1861000	1862000	Yeah.
1862000	1864000	So, and that's, that's Jamie.
1864000	1865000	So I named Jamie.
1865000	1868000	And, of course, of course, when the Sprite joins the party,
1868000	1870000	I'm going to name the Sprite Loki,
1870000	1874000	although I'd like to do Loki as Tingle, but that might be too long,
1874000	1877000	so Dark Soccer has suggested on the Bobby Black Wolf call tonight,
1877000	1880000	I do Lingle, and I'm kind of liking that, so.
1880000	1882000	That's so much like Linkle, which is the character now.
1882000	1883000	Or you could do Logel.
1883000	1884000	Logel.
1885000	1886000	I like Lingle.
1886000	1887000	I like Lingle.
1887000	1889000	I think I'm going to go with that, so.
1889000	1891000	Makes me think of Lincoln Berries.
1891000	1892000	Lincoln Berries are delicious.
1894000	1895000	All right.
1895000	1898000	Anyway, so that was otherwise pretty much my gaming week.
1898000	1902000	I'm enjoying the Secret of Mana so far.
1902000	1906000	I think the redone music is actually fine.
1906000	1909000	I think a lot of the problems I've been reading on the game is that,
1909000	1911000	you know, it's just different from the original,
1911000	1914000	and I don't know, like, I'm liking it.
1914000	1917000	I get how you can kind of screw up the original when you do a remake.
1917000	1919000	Like, look at Final Fantasy VI on tablets.
1919000	1920000	Like, it's bad, right?
1920000	1921000	But...
1921000	1924000	Oh, that's too bad they have a bad version of Final Fantasy VI.
1924000	1925000	Why is that even a thing?
1925000	1926000	I don't know.
1926000	1930000	It's because they, I think they probably just got the art done really cheap,
1930000	1931000	and it shows.
1931000	1936000	I do feel like the Secret of Mana thing kind of looks like it might have been designed with tablets in mind.
1936000	1939000	I would not be surprised if this game shows up on tablets eventually,
1939000	1944000	which would be funny, because the original Secret of Mana is already on iOS, at least.
1944000	1946000	It's got to be on Android, too, if I'm not mistaken.
1946000	1949000	But I wouldn't be surprised if this shows up there, too, eventually.
1949000	1952000	My only complaint is that there's some really weird things that happen with loading.
1952000	1955000	Like, every time there's, like, a new texture or something happens,
1955000	1958000	like, there's this little pause, and you could see it on my stream when I was streaming.
1958000	1961000	It's like the game would kind of skip a little bit, and that was annoying.
1961000	1963000	Granted, this is on PC.
1963000	1966000	I have been playing the game on PC just because I thought,
1966000	1969000	well, I can probably play in a higher resolution than I can on PlayStation 4,
1969000	1973000	and it turns out you can play in a better resolution.
1973000	1974000	So I was like, all right, I'll get it on PC.
1974000	1976000	How much RAM does your video card have?
1976000	1979000	I don't know. A lot. I need to get a new video card, but my video card's not...
1979000	1981000	Remember, I totally redid my computer.
1981000	1983000	It doesn't matter. You know what? I should be able to run it anyway.
1983000	1987000	I redid my computer, like, two years ago, and it was top of the line then, so...
1987000	1991000	It's just... What it is is it's Square Enix, and they're shitty ports, is what it is.
1991000	1996000	But I don't think this is shitty. It's just that's one little hiccup with it.
1996000	1998000	Okay. Unoptimized ports.
1998000	2001000	Okay, I'll agree with that. Unoptimized. Good.
2001000	2006000	All right. I think we're going to get into some of the news.
2006000	2008000	Usually I would talk about housekeeping here.
2008000	2011000	I don't have a whole lot to say besides you follow us on Twitter.
2011000	2014000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook.
2014000	2017000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2017000	2024000	And we will not be here. The last weekend in March will be gone that week.
2024000	2027000	So... But otherwise, we should be here.
2028000	2032000	Even though it's killing us, because Dark Soccer and I just found out
2032000	2036000	that Trixie Mattel is going to be here in SAC two weeks from tonight.
2036000	2037000	Yep.
2037000	2040000	But we love y'all so much, we're going to do O-L-R anyway.
2040000	2044000	But it's Sunday, March 25th. I'm not going to be here.
2044000	2047000	We all need to go to Ready Player One.
2047000	2050000	We need to do O-L-R at the movies.
2050000	2052000	We haven't done O-L-R at the movies in a while.
2052000	2053000	We need to go see Ready Player One.
2053000	2054000	I want to see it.
2054000	2056000	We all went on a Thruple date to Avatar.
2056000	2057000	Yeah.
2057000	2059000	So let's go see Ready Player One. Let's do it.
2059000	2060000	Opening night. Yes, let's do it.
2060000	2061000	When's opening night?
2061000	2062000	I hate seeing movies opening night.
2062000	2063000	I hate opening night.
2063000	2064000	But I'll do it.
2064000	2065000	Whatever, I'm going to go see opening night.
2065000	2068000	It's the one reason I haven't gone to see Black Panther.
2068000	2070000	Yeah, we're waiting a couple of weeks to go see it.
2070000	2072000	It's like, I just saw Lady Bird today.
2072000	2074000	That movie's been out for like three months.
2074000	2075000	I'll see Black Panther in May.
2075000	2077000	For opening nights, I have to get off work.
2077000	2079000	Oh, yeah.
2079000	2080000	Because I work late.
2080000	2081000	We'll try to make something work.
2081000	2082000	Yeah, we'll figure it out.
2082000	2083000	Yeah.
2083000	2084000	Alright, anyways.
2084000	2085000	Alright.
2085000	2086000	Yeah, let's do it.
2086000	2087000	Let's get into the news.
2087000	2089000	Start us off with some gaming news, Logie.
2089000	2095000	THQ Nordic announced today that they had purchased Koch Media.
2095000	2102600	So, if you may not know, Koch owned the rights to Saints Row, Metro, and Dead Island, which
2102600	2108000	were previously owned by the old THQ, which went bankrupt and sold off all their assets.
2108000	2112000	So it's like THQ buying old THQ stuff.
2112000	2114000	So now it's back under THQ Nordic again.
2114000	2119000	So it's like they went back to the pawn shop and bought their ring that they had pawned
2119000	2120000	a few weeks ago.
2120000	2121000	Sort of, yes.
2121000	2122000	Okay.
2122000	2124000	Yeah, so it's like it's back now.
2124000	2129000	But, I mean, technically it's kind of new people, but it's just kind of interesting
2129000	2130000	how it's kind of moved in that.
2130000	2131000	Yeah.
2131000	2132000	It is interesting.
2132000	2137000	I watched a little video today about Saints Row and this guy's essay about why the franchise
2137000	2139000	just kind of died, and I completely agree with all of it.
2140000	2146000	It's basically just, especially like they're talking about, see, I can't even remember
2146000	2149000	their stupid game that they had.
2149000	2151000	Not Saints Row game.
2151000	2153000	That's whatever.
2153000	2154000	It's so, so good.
2154000	2155000	Agents of Mayhem.
2155000	2156000	Agents of Mayhem.
2156000	2157000	Thank you.
2157000	2158000	Yes.
2158000	2161000	It was so good that the name just really stuck in my brain.
2161000	2162000	Yes.
2162000	2166000	Agents of Mayhem was supposed to be this thing that was completely a brand new IP.
2166000	2169000	Yeah, they couldn't get away from Saints Row.
2169000	2174000	And really, with Saints Row, it's always been kind of like a copycat game where originally
2174000	2179000	it's like, okay, yeah, it's this game that's going to be kind of like Grand Theft Auto
2179000	2182000	San Andreas, and then it kind of went over the top.
2182000	2185000	And it's like, well, now Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5 are out.
2185000	2187000	And it's like, well, shit, what are we going to do?
2187000	2189000	Let's just go more over the top.
2189000	2190000	And it just didn't work.
2190000	2193000	It just, it kind of lost sight of what it was supposed to be.
2193000	2195000	And now that he tried to do this spinoff.
2195000	2199000	I did love the over-the-topness of Saints Row, but to be fair, I don't even remember
2199000	2201000	if I started four.
2201000	2202000	I mean, I love three.
2202000	2203000	I laughed so fucking hard at three.
2203000	2204000	No, three was good.
2204000	2206000	Three was all right.
2206000	2210000	There was some room for improvement, but it was okay.
2210000	2211000	I liked that game.
2211000	2212000	That was fine.
2212000	2213000	That skydiving sequence.
2213000	2214000	I cried.
2214000	2215000	Yeah.
2215000	2216000	I cried from laughing so hard.
2216000	2220000	Four, though, was just like, they basically slapped it.
2220000	2225000	It was the time that basically they were getting, from what I hear, it was they were getting
2225000	2228000	pressured because originally four was supposed to be DLC for three.
2228000	2231000	And it's very obvious that it was.
2231000	2234000	And they're like, well, instead of putting out DLC, you need to flush it out into a full
2234000	2236000	game and make that its own game.
2236000	2238000	And that was kind of a problem.
2238000	2243000	PJ Technomage in our chat at live.vognetware.com says, I've never finished a single Saints
2243000	2244000	Row game.
2244000	2245000	Yeah, you and me both.
2245000	2248000	But I have this problem inherently with all games.
2248000	2254000	Like if I finish a video game, that is really a testament because I am definitely the type
2254000	2256000	of person that's like, I'm going to play this game.
2256000	2257000	I'm going to play this game.
2257000	2258000	Ooh, shiny!
2258000	2259000	Something new is out.
2259000	2260000	Have you played Grand Theft Auto 5 yet?
2260000	2262000	I did, but I didn't beat it.
2262000	2263000	That's for sure.
2263000	2264000	I should play it more.
2264000	2266000	But I at least started it.
2266000	2268000	Yeah, I guess that's fine.
2268000	2269000	That's something.
2269000	2270000	That's something.
2270000	2273000	I have actually finished all of the Saints Row games, so I can say that.
2273000	2276000	But then my problem is fucking MMOs.
2276000	2279000	It's weird because I'll keep playing MMOs forever and ever, even though you can't beat
2279000	2280000	it.
2280000	2281000	But it's something about that social element.
2281000	2282000	Like, that's the thing.
2282000	2283000	The social element can't be beat.
2283000	2288000	And I think when I have played more console games, like, oh, here's a great example.
2288000	2289000	Mass Effect 3, right?
2289000	2295000	I beat that entire fucking trilogy, and that's a great testament to how good those games
2295000	2296000	were, right?
2296000	2300000	But then Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, I still played for a very long time, but that's because
2300000	2301000	I had a lot of friends that were playing it.
2301000	2303000	It was a social thing.
2304000	2306000	I remember a problem with Saints Row 3.
2306000	2307000	That's right.
2307000	2312000	Saints Row 3, I thought, was a spoiler, but it's been out forever.
2312000	2317000	They kill off the big bad guy in the beginning pretty fast.
2317000	2318000	Like he's just knocked out.
2318000	2322000	And just in a really shitty way, it's just like, and now he's dead.
2322000	2330000	And then this other guy that's not quite as good as the main bad guy becomes the big bad
2330000	2335000	guy, and then you fight him a bunch of times, and it was just kind of, eh, it's lame.
2335000	2337000	But then they tried to do too much, too.
2337000	2340000	They just threw everything together that didn't necessarily fit.
2340000	2343000	It was like, now there's zombies for no reason.
2343000	2344000	Now there's this.
2344000	2345000	Now there's this.
2345000	2348000	It's just, it didn't quite work.
2348000	2352000	Interesting conversation in our chat at live.vognetwork.com.
2352000	2356000	Vidpower says, we all have those comfort games that we keep playing despite new games coming
2356000	2357000	out.
2357000	2360000	And PJ Technomage says, civilization for me.
2360000	2362000	That's another one, though, that can be very social.
2362000	2366000	Like the easiest way to pull me back into civilization is some of my Bay Area friends
2366000	2370000	going, we randomly decided to play Civilization 4 tonight.
2370000	2371000	We did.
2371000	2372000	Cool.
2372000	2375000	And then now I'm up until 3 a.m. playing Civilization.
2375000	2378000	Those games, you know, they don't end.
2378000	2380000	I haven't gotten into Civilization yet.
2380000	2381000	Oh, they're so good.
2381000	2382000	That's probably a good thing.
2382000	2386000	Isn't Civ 4 free on Twitch Prime, question mark?
2386000	2388000	I have them in my library.
2388000	2389000	Okay.
2389000	2390000	Here in my Steam library.
2390000	2391000	I've got, I may have Civ 5.
2391000	2394000	I bought the Civilization Humble Bundle a while back.
2394000	2396000	Chatters, where's Civ 4 free right now?
2396000	2397000	I swear I saw something on that.
2397000	2398000	Is Rageinator here?
2398000	2399000	He knows where the free games are.
2399000	2401000	I swear I saw Civ 4 free somewhere.
2401000	2402000	It wasn't GOG.
2402000	2406000	I know GOG's been giving away a lot of free stuff lately, but it was somewhere else that
2406000	2407000	was giving it away.
2407000	2408000	I think it was Twitch Prime.
2408000	2409000	I really feel like it was that.
2409000	2411000	But I hope, you know, I know the new Metro game's coming out.
2411000	2412000	Thank you.
2412000	2413000	Act F confirmed it.
2413000	2414000	Thank you.
2414000	2415000	Thanks, Chatters.
2415000	2417720	The new Metro game looks pretty nice, so that's going to be something that's coming out.
2417720	2421720	And I really do hope that there is a new Saints Row someday.
2421720	2423520	Just stop it with the Agents of Mayhem thing.
2423520	2427040	That just did not work at all.
2427040	2429000	But I would like a new Saints Row game.
2429000	2432000	Well, another game that maybe folks will be looking forward to.
2432000	2436080	How about a non-EA Star Wars game?
2436080	2444720	So this is some pretty big fallout from the loot box controversy that kind of shot Battlefront
2444720	2445720	in the foot.
2445720	2448400	Now, I do want to stress this is a rumor.
2448400	2453240	I will tend to cover these a little more on a slower news week, which this week has been.
2453240	2456480	So again, take it with a grain of salt.
2456480	2462760	But the word going around is that EA is, or excuse me, I'm sorry, Disney is rumored to
2462760	2467480	be speaking with two other developers besides EA.
2467480	2471440	These developers are Ubisoft and Activision.
2471440	2475480	What I also found interesting about this is that the outlet that I saw this on that's
2475480	2478520	reporting this is My Nintendo News.
2478520	2482140	And one interesting thing they're saying about the Ubisoft and Activision partnership is
2482140	2486680	that if one of these two were to go through, we'd be likely to get the Star Wars games
2486680	2493200	on the Nintendo Switch, which I thought was a very interesting kind of tongue in cheek
2493200	2498680	little thing there because we all know that EA kind of left Nintendo at the altar with
2498680	2500180	the Wii U, right?
2500260	2503660	They got up on stage at that E3 and they're like, fuck yeah, we're going to support the
2503660	2504660	Wii U.
2504660	2509260	And then they put out, you know, some pretty shoddy ports of year old games and they were
2509260	2511660	like, wow, none of these things are selling.
2511660	2512820	We don't know why they're not.
2512820	2514940	The Wii U is a disaster, everybody.
2514940	2516020	What's going on?
2516020	2521420	And then EA just left Nintendo at the altar and EA hasn't really supported the Switch
2521420	2522420	with the same intensity.
2522420	2525460	I realize they're kind of throwing the Switch a bone here and there with like FIFA ports
2525460	2530140	and stuff, but they're not as invested in the Switch as say Ubisoft is right now.
2530220	2539140	So isn't that interesting that perhaps Disney wants to let Ubisoft make a Star Wars game
2539140	2544020	because that would mean a Star Wars game on the Nintendo Switch, which is kind of the
2544020	2545340	hot console right now.
2545340	2549240	I realize there's a lot of love out there for PlayStation 4 and some for the Xbox One
2549240	2553640	X and PC stuff as well, but certainly the Switch is growing and growing.
2553640	2556020	It's already outsold the Wii U completely.
2556020	2559700	And I think there's a lot of people that would like to see a Star Wars game on the Switch.
2560140	2563260	Nintendo doesn't have the online system to support loot boxes very well.
2563260	2568140	They want to tap that younger audience so that they can be involved in all Star Wars
2568140	2569140	things.
2569140	2570140	Sure.
2570140	2575140	So, uh, yeah, I, I'd be very interested to see what happens with all this.
2575140	2581260	And it's also kind of fascinating that EA might lose their exclusive hold on Star Wars
2581260	2582780	over what happened in Battlefront.
2582780	2587660	Like we're starting to see the results of all that bad press.
2587660	2591340	So as they should, it's been mismanaged for two games now.
2591340	2592340	Yeah.
2592340	2593340	So ouch.
2593340	2599220	Jamie, would you, would you be interested in a Star Wars game from Ubisoft on the Switch?
2599220	2602580	I haven't been interested in a Star Wars game in a very long time, Rob.
2602580	2604740	Since 1981 in vector graphics.
2604740	2605740	Not even then.
2605740	2606740	What?
2606740	2607740	I love that game.
2607740	2608740	Oh my God.
2608740	2611100	Did you know, and I didn't even know this tangent time, slow news week.
2611100	2614940	I'm talking about like super return of the Jedi tangent train pulling into the station.
2614940	2615940	Choo choo.
2615940	2616940	Okay.
2617220	2621780	Um, I didn't even know this in old town sack because, um, some friends were visiting from
2621780	2622780	out of town.
2622780	2626700	So I did the tourist thing and I went to old town sack with them this weekend, right there.
2626700	2629700	They have a classic game arcade in this toy shop.
2629700	2630820	I didn't even know.
2630820	2634380	Was there a, I didn't even know there was a toy shop in old town now be there's a classic
2634380	2635380	arcade in the back.
2635380	2638580	I remember in toy shop being there, but I didn't know they had a, it's small.
2638580	2644020	It's like one tiny little room, but the reason why I bring it up, they had a star Wars machine,
2644020	2646620	original vectors, graphics, right?
2646620	2648580	50 cents a play.
2648580	2653540	And tiger claws entirely wrong says that I'm more of a star Trek fan than a star Wars fan.
2653540	2654540	You are wrong.
2654540	2660080	They have a classic arcade down in, uh, I am a doctor who fan and that's classic doctor
2660080	2662080	who.
2662080	2666660	And also for the record, star Wars was the first movie I had ever been taken to.
2666660	2668860	I was nine months old.
2668860	2673700	So you cannot say that star Trek is bigger in my heart than star Wars.
2673700	2675060	You can say that about me.
2675060	2680260	I like, I prefer Star Trek assumptions when you know nothing Jon Snow, but I don't, I
2680260	2681820	don't hate star Wars by any means.
2681820	2682820	I like star Wars a lot.
2682820	2686620	I still need to see episode eight, but again, I just saw lady bird today.
2686620	2688620	So maybe we'll go see episode eight next week.
2688620	2689660	Lady bird was great.
2689660	2691200	Is episode eight still playing anywhere?
2691200	2692200	It's gotta be somewhere.
2692200	2698260	Um, sunrise mall, sunrise doesn't have a really, I don't think, you know, I looked there.
2698260	2701780	I honestly looked at the movies playing there calling it by those numbers.
2701780	2702780	All right.
2702860	2706220	Well, anyway, uh, so, but I like star Trek a lot.
2706220	2708420	In fact, what am I going to do tonight?
2708420	2710020	There's no discovery to watch tonight.
2710020	2712820	I'm a little, what do I do with myself?
2712820	2715700	You can watch the new episodes of queer eye, which are all right.
2715700	2722860	But there's one that more, um, mortified is really good on, um, I forget that you and
2722860	2725660	the wife like super dig queer eye for the straight guy.
2725660	2727100	I don't like the new series.
2727100	2728100	Okay.
2728100	2729100	Really?
2729100	2730100	You're the first person I've heard say that they don't like the new one.
2730420	2737180	Well, yes, that that's one, but two it's, they're like in the original queer eye, it
2737180	2742260	was really kind of Carson was kind of the only one that was like annoying, I guess sometimes
2742260	2746420	like he was just kind of would play up stuff and it'd be ridiculous and all that.
2746420	2751980	But in the new series, all of them do it and it's, it's so irritating and annoying that
2751980	2757780	they just waste so much time and it's just like go on these tangent things in the show.
2757780	2761820	It's like, okay dude, tone it down as a smidge.
2761820	2763700	It's just a little much, man.
2763700	2769660	I hate it when my favorite shows go on tangents anyway.
2769660	2774340	Let's get next to go to our next, at least I'm not sitting, you know, here simulating
2774340	2776660	childbirth like they did in the show.
2776660	2781620	That was something that they did in the show while this guy's Lee next to them going, dude,
2781620	2783020	what the fuck did I sign up for?
2783020	2785220	Like seriously, what the fuck is going on here?
2788100	2792380	To register participation for this week's episode of orange laundry radio at vog network.com
2792380	2794060	use the pass phrase father.
2794060	2796020	All right, let's go to our next story.
2796020	2797820	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
2797820	2799460	Oh God.
2799460	2805180	So sorry people who got certain copies of Bayonetta two on switch because the download
2805180	2808380	codes were mis-parented.
2808380	2810740	Oopsies.
2810740	2817760	It was a download code to get Bayonetta one and some of these codes were printed incorrectly.
2817760	2824240	So if it happened to you and you're listening and you hear this, go to support.nintendo.com
2824240	2828040	and report it so that you can get your proper code.
2828040	2837240	Um, it also said that you can call the Nintendo contact center at 800-255-3700, which when
2837240	2842840	I was a kid, it was long distance and you had to talk to a game counselor, dude.
2842840	2843840	They were fun though.
2843840	2846680	I talked to all kinds of cool people who was some temp with a giant binder.
2846680	2852200	My grandma was like, why are you calling, uh, why are you, why are you calling Washington?
2852200	2858800	Um, reasons, but yeah, and it didn't have the internet back then and it's not particular
2858800	2859800	batches of it.
2859800	2862800	They went to certain retailers, they are multiple batches.
2862800	2864800	So it's just a odd misprint.
2864800	2868080	So if it happened to you, you're not alone.
2868080	2871860	Well I need to try my ice, my Bayonetta is still in the box cause I'm kind of waiting
2871860	2875920	on it until I have had my fill of secret of mana streaming and then I'm going to go over
2875920	2877000	to Bayonetta.
2877000	2880640	So I haven't, I should try to cash in my code.
2880640	2882520	I wouldn't want to get left out in the cold.
2882520	2884000	Thou shalt do such a thing.
2884000	2887720	I would be very sad if I got shut out of drinking my shot of wine now.
2887720	2888720	That's right.
2888720	2892820	If you're just joining us, uh, it is national wine day, uh, the 18th here.
2892820	2896960	So we're, if I seem a little out of it tonight, it's because I'm now two glasses in.
2896960	2899960	Cheers.
2899960	2903160	Three sheets to the wind, three sheets to the wind.
2903160	2905400	No, my wine does not come in a box.
2905400	2906920	No, it's, it's frivolous.
2906920	2907920	It's delicious.
2907920	2908920	No judgment.
2908920	2911480	If you change their bottles, Robin, that makes me sad in my heart.
2911480	2913480	Why did they change the bottles?
2913480	2915100	But I don't know.
2915100	2917340	This is delicious and I miss being able to drink.
2917340	2918340	We fear change.
2918340	2919340	All right.
2919340	2920340	Loki.
2920340	2921340	Next story.
2921340	2927440	So kind of the topic of Star Wars Battlefront and the whole loot box controversy, Senator
2927440	2932360	Maggie Hassan, the New Hampshire Democrat Senator.
2932360	2939160	She wrote an open letter to the ESRB, urging them to review the completeness of the board's
2939160	2944600	rating process and policies as they relate to loot boxes and then taking into account
2944600	2948500	the potential harm these microtransactions may have on children.
2948500	2955080	Of course, you know, the ESRB has made comment regarding, um, loot boxes in the past being
2955080	2959980	that they don't really see the harm in it, but then again, you know, this is funded by
2959980	2964300	the ESA, which is backing the games industry.
2964300	2969100	And of course, you know, the games industry is making several billions of dollars off
2969100	2971860	of these types of loot boxes and stuff.
2971860	2975860	And so they don't want to see that cash cow go away.
2975860	2976860	So it's going to be interesting.
2976860	2983640	I see this as more of like, Hey, maybe you should take a look at this and consider regulating
2983640	2988580	it because if you don't, yeah, we're going to, no, I, and that's really fascinating to
2988580	2993700	me that, you know, now we have a, uh, say Senator or, or representative Senator.
2993700	2994700	Okay.
2994700	2999900	So that you have this Senator basically going with the ESRB saying, you might want to read
2999900	3002820	about that thing you said about loot boxes not being a problem yet.
3002820	3005060	You might want to reevaluate that.
3005060	3009940	And that is definitely the equivalent of like a verbal warning.
3009940	3014300	So I mean, that, that really says to me that the ESRB is under a lot of pressure to self
3014300	3018260	regulate this because certainly she is not the first Senator to know.
3018260	3019260	She's not.
3019260	3022100	In fact, a lot of this has been on the state level.
3022100	3025940	Is this, is she a state Senator or is she a national Senator thinks she's a state Senator.
3025940	3026940	Okay.
3026940	3030420	So still a lot of it's only been on the state level, but it's really just a matter of time
3030420	3031420	before that buzz.
3031420	3034900	Of course that would require our Congress to actually do something, but that's a whole
3034900	3036140	nother tangent for another day.
3036140	3040420	You could be done on the state levels if they have regulations on the state levels and how
3040420	3044940	are you going to, I mean, that's still going to affect something if, if they go through.
3044940	3049620	Because remember California passed something and that ended up getting overturned by the
3049620	3050980	Supreme court in the end.
3050980	3055820	Although I would say the whole loot box thing is all violent video was about the violent
3055820	3056820	video game.
3056820	3062300	And the fact that the standard was very nebulous when there already is an ESRB, which I am
3062300	3066040	pretty sure was called out in the Supreme court decision that there was an ESRB, which
3066040	3070420	is even more of the reason why, you know, a lot of these, you know, political folks
3070420	3074980	look to the ESRB to regulate and fucking handle this stuff.
3074980	3077380	Like it's your job to fix this.
3077380	3078660	It's essentially what's being said.
3078660	3083860	Well, at the same time, you know, like aside from, you know, government stepping in all
3083860	3089060	this, it's just people that are consumers of these games have to consider that if you
3089060	3092960	don't want this kind of stuff in these games, you know, bite the bullet and just don't buy
3092960	3094020	the game.
3094020	3098380	Like I was interested in Star Wars Battlefront because I wanted to try the single player
3098380	3102300	campaign, which apparently was not very good.
3102300	3106060	And then the whole loot box thing on top of that, I was like, well shit, I'm just not
3106060	3107540	going to buy it.
3107540	3113220	So I spoke with my wallet, but you know, like if there's say Grand Theft Auto six comes
3113220	3120280	out and it's just loot box shit, like all it's just loot boxes, just integrated entirely
3120280	3121280	in the game.
3121280	3124940	It's just obstructive, just like it is with Battlefront.
3124940	3128340	Then maybe I'll have to pass.
3128340	3132700	Well hopefully something they don't throw into loot boxes in the future is better graphics,
3132700	3135740	but I think it's only a matter of time, right?
3135740	3137940	You unlocked HD textures!
3137940	3141860	They have textures, you unlocked skins, so.
3141860	3143420	There's a big difference though, Loki, with that.
3143420	3145100	The cosmetics are one thing.
3145100	3149380	But anyway, the whole reason I make a silly transition like that is because over on the
3149380	3155860	Xbox One X and the Xbox One S, 1440p support is coming in the near future.
3155860	3160780	This is from Kevin Gamill, who's the program manager for Microsoft's Xbox platform partner
3160780	3167240	group, and a tweet said, many questions recently around the timing of our 1440p support.
3167240	3171540	Those of you in our early preview ring should be pleasantly surprised very soon if you have
3171540	3176780	an Xbox One S or an Xbox One X, meaning that that support is coming very soon.
3176780	3181760	Now you might be thinking, well what's the big deal because the Xbox One X does 4K gaming,
3181760	3183580	so who gives a shit about 1440p?
3183580	3189300	Well, you may notice I included the Xbox One S in that, which right now doesn't really
3189300	3194580	support 1440p, but it sounds like it will, however, I do need to stress, and this is
3194580	3201700	a big however, the 1440p for gaming is not going to be something for Xbox One S. I'm
3201700	3206900	assuming that is the interface, so we'll look a little crisper, and maybe some of the, maybe
3206900	3211380	like video playback and things like that, if you have a video that supports it.
3211380	3214300	Are there TVs out there that support 1440p?
3214300	3215660	I thought it was like computer monitors.
3215660	3220580	Yeah, I think it's more computer monitors that support it, but the only 4K device in
3220580	3224700	my house is a computer monitor, so I'm sure there's some people out there that do have...
3224700	3229180	I just thought, like, you know, if it's a 4K TV, why would you want to output the 1440p?
3229180	3233740	Well, maybe you have a 4K TV, but you only have an Xbox One S.
3233740	3238340	I have a 4K TV and I don't have anything to utilize it other than the regular high def.
3238340	3242940	So if, hypothetically, you have an Xbox One S, which is weird that the older Xboxes won't
3242940	3243940	support it.
3243940	3248340	Well, I look forward to those online advertisements and extra clarity.
3248340	3254000	The only thing that I'm going to get 4K right now is when I get my 4K Apple TV, which, by
3254000	3257540	the way, you can play Sonic CD on it.
3257540	3260180	I keep forgetting there's games on Apple TV.
3260180	3261180	And they're fun.
3261180	3266220	I bought a controller, the SteelSeries controller to use on my Apple TV, and we freaking played
3266220	3268420	through Sonic CD together on the Apple TV.
3268420	3269660	Is there a lot of stuff on that?
3269660	3274380	I haven't looked lately, but I just cared because I already owned Sonic CD, so I just
3274380	3275380	installed it.
3275380	3278340	I know there was that random harmonics game that was, like, only on Apple TV.
3278340	3279340	Yeah.
3279340	3280340	I never saw it anywhere else.
3280340	3281340	That we immediately forgot about.
3281340	3285140	Yeah, well, I personally just don't have an Apple TV, but for me...
3285140	3286860	I'd sell you mine when I buy my new one.
3286860	3288940	Well, my game consoles do everything.
3288940	3290860	What's my Apple TV going to do?
3290860	3292300	Drag Race.
3292300	3294340	Actually, I may...
3294340	3295820	Is there a VH1 app or something?
3295820	3298140	No, I just have bought the season.
3298140	3299820	Oh, I use...
3299820	3303780	It's the one thing that I can actually use the Xfinity on demand for, is I can watch
3303780	3308860	All Stars 3 at five o'clock, because you can get it as soon as it hits the East Coast.
3308860	3312260	I just usually watch it the next day after everyone spoiled it for me.
3312260	3313260	Annoying.
3313260	3317140	All right, let's move on to another story.
3317140	3318940	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
3318940	3321460	Well, I was disappointed that I had no Bitcoin.
3321460	3322460	I thought I had one.
3322460	3324460	Yeah, I was going to ask whatever happened with that.
3324460	3325460	I thought I had it.
3325620	3329540	I thought you had like 25 Bitcoin, and I was like, bitch, you're a millionaire.
3329540	3330740	Well, I thought that I did.
3330740	3331740	That was an error.
3331740	3332740	Of course.
3332740	3333740	And it was...
3333740	3334740	You would have needed it.
3334740	3335740	Yeah.
3335740	3337740	If she didn't sell it that week, I told her, then now she'd be a thousandaire.
3337740	3341340	And then it was like, it ended up, I had like a Dogecoin.
3341340	3344260	Oh, you had the Dogecoin.
3344260	3345620	That's so worth something, isn't it?
3345620	3348100	They gave away a ton of Dogecoin at Gamers.
3348100	3351260	I think the value of Dogecoin went way up.
3351260	3353300	Like it was worth like next to nothing.
3353300	3355380	And now maybe it's a nickel.
3355380	3356380	No.
3356380	3357380	At any rate...
3357380	3358380	You have a fucking Litecoin.
3358380	3362940	Well, and it took me like an hour to get back into my old wallet because it was the old
3362940	3364500	style wallet.
3364500	3366780	Even I think I have Dogecoin too.
3366780	3369460	Well, I'm not worried.
3369460	3371340	Fuck if I know how to get in my wallet.
3371340	3374980	Well, I figured out how to get back into my Bitcoin wallet.
3374980	3375980	And that was interesting.
3375980	3376980	Oh, I don't have Bitcoin.
3376980	3377980	Because you had to...
3377980	3378980	Thankfully, I don't.
3379140	3382620	You had to do like these words and they had to be perfect.
3382620	3383620	Oh, wow.
3383620	3390060	But anyway, if anyone is regretting their lack of Bitcoin right now, there is a game
3390060	3397300	that is offering a shot at winning one Bitcoin, which is about 10 grand.
3397300	3399380	The game is on Steam for $1.99.
3399380	3402460	And actually it's on sale on the release date for 40% off.
3402460	3403460	You can get it for $1.19.
3403460	3407620	But it's called Monte Crypto, the Bitcoin Enigma.
3407620	3410980	It looks like it's first person and has 24 puzzles.
3410980	3416420	But the first person to beat it will win one Bitcoin.
3416420	3418300	So hey, you want 10 grand?
3418300	3421380	Play this game that they're trying to bribe you to play.
3421380	3423660	I don't think Bitcoin is still worth 10 grand.
3423660	3425500	I think Bitcoin came down a bit.
3425500	3426660	But maybe it'll go back up.
3426660	3427660	I don't know.
3427660	3432220	Like, it's so hard to fucking know these days what's going to happen with the cryptocurrency.
3432220	3433860	It's been pretty volatile.
3433860	3434860	Yeah.
3434860	3435860	Who cares?
3435900	3437460	It's more than the price of the game.
3437460	3438580	You still end up in positive.
3438580	3439580	Yeah, fair enough.
3439580	3443420	But they'd have to sell, even at that rate, because this is at the time the article was
3443420	3446820	printed, they'd have to sell 5,000 copies of the game.
3446820	3448540	So good luck.
3448540	3449820	It has a fun name.
3449820	3451260	I like Monte Cristo sandwiches.
3451260	3453420	Oh, Bobby tells me I'm wrong.
3453420	3454420	There's a big surprise.
3454420	3458140	And that Bitcoin is $10,566 right now.
3458140	3464220	I swear I saw just in the last week it had dropped to like $600 or something like that.
3464220	3466140	No, maybe $6,000 or something.
3466140	3467660	I thought it dropped a lot.
3467660	3468660	Yes, girl.
3468660	3469660	Okay.
3469660	3470660	It's that volatile.
3470660	3471660	Okay.
3471660	3472660	So I'm not crazy.
3472660	3473660	It has been going up and down like a lot.
3473660	3474660	Okay.
3474660	3475660	All right.
3475660	3476660	Okay.
3476660	3477660	Thank you.
3477660	3478660	Chatters.
3478660	3479660	Chatters are meeting me halfway.
3479660	3481220	Yes, it did go down, but it went back up.
3481220	3486460	You know, though, if I had had Bitcoin and I sold it when the whole thing was going down
3486460	3491100	and I had a million bucks, do you know that you can technically live off the interest
3491100	3494300	of a million dollars and not have to work?
3494300	3495300	You have to live frugal frugally.
3495300	3496300	Yeah.
3496300	3498580	I was gonna say, can you still do it in today's standards?
3498580	3503020	Like I know that's something you used to be able to do, but like it takes more to live
3503020	3507060	on in this day and age than it used to, but what I would do is I would actually pay off
3507060	3513460	my house and then I would find a part time job and write a book.
3513460	3515540	I don't know if I could ever not work.
3515540	3516540	Okay.
3516540	3517540	You ready?
3517540	3518540	You ready for another tangent train?
3519180	3522340	Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, slow news week tangent train, choo choo.
3522340	3525340	And this story literally involves trains.
3525340	3527380	Oh, that's cause you went to the train museum.
3527380	3528380	I did.
3528380	3529840	Again, I had friends from out of town.
3529840	3530840	Is PJ still listening?
3530840	3531840	Hello.
3531840	3532840	Hiya.
3532840	3533840	If Kevin's out there too.
3533840	3534840	Hi.
3534840	3535840	Hello.
3535840	3536840	Hello.
3536840	3537840	Uh, so they were visiting from out of town.
3537840	3539820	So we went to old town and we went to the train museum because PJ is a fan of trains.
3539820	3543260	You know, the train museum is the first time I ever saw a midnight person in person.
3543260	3544260	No.
3544260	3545260	True story.
3545260	3546260	Anyway.
3546340	3551860	So anyway, I went, I went to the train museum and one thing I forgot like about the train
3551860	3554820	museum is that, you know, you can actually like, well, I didn't forget that you could
3554820	3558500	walk into the trains, but as you do walk into the trains, there's actually people sitting
3558500	3562820	there that work for the museum in the trains just to make sure you're not horsing around
3562820	3566420	or trying to ruin anything, you know, protecting the integrity of the exhibits or like one
3566420	3572020	of the ladies that was policing the dining car, she would actually play the dining chimes
3572020	3573020	every few minutes.
3573020	3574020	Cool.
3574020	3576500	And she'd be like, and look what else you can play with the chimes.
3576500	3580820	And she'd go, she played the NBC theme with the chimes.
3580820	3581820	Funny.
3581820	3582820	So anyway.
3582820	3583820	Who remembers that?
3583820	3584820	Silly stuff.
3584820	3586780	But the reason why I say that and how it relates to what you were just saying is I was thinking,
3586780	3588660	you know what?
3588660	3591940	That's going to be me when I'm like 75, not that I'm literally going to work at the train
3591940	3598820	museum, but I would bet I'm going to end up at some museum, like part time, like teaching
3598820	3603160	people about that, doing like that volunteer stuff, because I don't ever see myself like
3603160	3605580	not working either.
3605580	3609580	Like not working is fun for probably a few weeks, maybe even a few months.
3609580	3612520	But then I would think like, oh my God, I'm going to go crazy.
3612520	3614160	You'll just add more podcasts.
3614160	3616760	That's still working in a way.
3616760	3625180	I actually super enjoyed my fun employment because at the time I was living rent free
3625180	3631160	and I went to Disneyland a bunch and I pretty much just still did kind of whatever I wanted
3631160	3632160	to.
3632160	3635800	But what I should have done was started my book and I'm going to write that book.
3635800	3637640	It's going to get started this year.
3637640	3638640	Okay.
3638640	3641680	I'm laughing hard over here because Tiger Claw may have got something wrong with you
3641680	3644680	a minute ago, but he just got this very, very right.
3644680	3648920	Tiger Claw says Rob will be at a podcast museum.
3648920	3651300	That's pretty, pretty true.
3651300	3656720	Back in my day, my friends and I sat around and we talked about video games.
3656720	3660220	You know what a video game is Timmy?
3660220	3661220	Get off my lawn.
3661220	3663660	Get off my God damn lawn.
3663660	3665380	Get off my hollow lawn.
3665380	3671180	You would have holographic lawns that simulate the feeling of grass.
3671180	3673340	What's a video grandpa?
3673340	3678860	Like it would just be, everything's implanted in the chip in our brain now.
3678860	3684700	I was talking about that with somebody today that we should have like our ability to use
3684700	3687300	our driver's license like Apple pay.
3687300	3692020	And then I was like, no, it's just going to be a little tattoo on our skin that has
3692020	3693580	a QR code that you scan.
3693580	3696620	In the words of Sasha Velour, don't joke about that.
3696620	3698460	But it's already happening.
3698460	3699460	They're already working on that technology.
3699460	3703740	Did I tell you about the one tattoo I was thinking about getting?
3703740	3705300	No.
3705300	3712460	So they have this type of tattoo where you actually get a tattoo of a sound wave, a sound
3712460	3714820	form tattooed on your body.
3714820	3719340	And then you have an app on the phone that you can scan the sound form and it plays it.
3719340	3724340	So I was thinking about, since I'm fortunate that I have a lot of audio of my mom from
3724340	3730660	her appearances on this program, when she was around, I have considered getting something
3730660	3731660	of hers tattooed.
3731660	3734980	Here's the trick though, just so you know, because somebody in chat will correct me on
3734980	3735980	it.
3735980	3739660	Because you might be wondering like, wait a minute, how do you get the sound to be that
3739660	3740660	crisp?
3740660	3746020	It's all kind of an illusion, because it's not really, you are getting an accurate representation
3746020	3747500	of the sound form.
3747500	3751580	But all the app is doing is it's reading the kind of like the close, what it looks like,
3751580	3754640	and then looking it up in the database and playing the sound.
3754640	3755640	So it is kind of...
3755640	3756940	It works kind of like a QR.
3756940	3758900	It's yeah, you got it.
3758900	3761360	It's what it is instead of a QR code.
3761360	3763660	But I still kind of like the idea.
3763660	3767740	I mean, even if it's not 100% accurate, I just love that idea.
3767740	3769980	Because I am into sound, I do do podcasting.
3769980	3774060	I think that's one of those things where I can't possibly see how I would regret that
3774060	3775060	decision.
3775060	3780500	See, I'm planning on having a medical QR code where, you know what I'm talking about?
3780500	3782060	Where it used, it scanned.
3782060	3783540	Oh, instead of life alert.
3783540	3784540	Exactly.
3784540	3785540	Yeah.
3785540	3788340	Because I mean, by all rights, due to...
3788340	3792500	So I'm sorry, life alert is I've fallen and I can't get up.
3792500	3793500	Medic alert.
3793500	3794500	Yeah, medic alert.
3794500	3795500	Is it working?
3795500	3796500	Like the bracelets.
3796500	3797500	It's not working.
3797500	3798500	Like the bracelets.
3798500	3802380	It would actually have a little label that says medical ID and a QR code on it that would
3802380	3807800	bring up a page that you can update that lists your allergies, your surgeries, all the things
3807800	3811860	like that without having them to invasively go into your phone for this information.
3811860	3816100	And I recommend to everyone right now, I know we're going way off topic, but if you have
3816100	3820500	a health app on your phone, keep it up the fuck to date because they do look at that
3820500	3821500	information.
3821500	3822500	Yeah.
3822500	3823500	Mine is actually up to date too.
3823500	3828700	So, um, that's a good advice if you ever are in an issue or what have you.
3828700	3829700	Yeah.
3829700	3832700	Yes, we are off topic tonight, but I warned them in the first five minutes it was national
3832700	3833700	wine day.
3833700	3834700	So you know what?
3834700	3839900	Hey, I had my ounce of wine and I'm already, I've already lost it now, but I was pretty
3839900	3841700	tipsy for about a good minute.
3841700	3843380	We do have two hours.
3843380	3844900	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio everybody.
3844900	3845900	Uh, I can't.
3845900	3846900	All right.
3846900	3848900	So how about another story, Loki?
3848900	3850000	All right.
3850000	3854440	So I don't know what Atari is doing nowadays.
3854440	3858400	I mean, it seems like that they're just trying to jump on all of the terrible bandwagons
3858400	3860000	at the same time.
3860000	3865000	So you may remember that they have their Atari console coming out that we have still no fucking
3865000	3866840	clue what the hell that is.
3866840	3872000	Then they have their Kickstarter theme that they did crowdfunding for the roller coaster
3872000	3875600	tycoon game that's probably going to suck for the switch.
3875600	3882520	And now, now they're announcing that the Atari token is going to be their new cryptocurrency
3882520	3887440	that they're going to offer people to buy cause that's the road to the future.
3887440	3891000	Well maybe my doge coin will be worth something more than this.
3891000	3892000	Yeah.
3892000	3893880	So the Atari tokens.
3893880	3899440	So you know, basically they announced, you know, share it was, they said, um, Oh my God,
3899440	3901760	can I play yards revenge with the token?
3901760	3903800	Is that, is that the joke?
3903800	3910420	That like you buy this fake currency and you can play games online with it?
3910420	3911600	I don't think so.
3911600	3915680	I think that they're hoping that they're going to become rich from this.
3915680	3918960	Why, why doesn't Atari just do the fucking obvious?
3918960	3923240	Like what I just said, like why not really give that cryptocurrency some value right
3923240	3924240	off the bat?
3924240	3927160	Like, look, I'm not, I'm not trying to shade on cryptocurrency.
3927160	3931400	I understand it's a, it's a thing that a lot of people are into and I even, even my, to
3931400	3935340	an extent I'm like, okay, Bitcoin is making more and more sense to me, especially when
3935340	3939800	you explained it a few weeks ago, Jamie, um, and made the whole analogy with like, uh,
3939800	3941360	X-Box points or whatever they were called.
3941360	3945600	Like, you know, I think that makes a lot of sense, but Bitcoin is only worth what Bitcoin's
3945600	3949120	worth because more and more places are accepting Bitcoin.
3949120	3955120	But like if Atari right off the bat said, you can use this Atari coin for our rich catalog
3955120	3958980	of Atari products, then it kind of has some inherent inherent value right off the bat.
3958980	3961820	Even if it's small, even some value.
3961820	3966760	Let's just assume that, you know, people are going to want to hold on to these Atari tokens
3966760	3971240	because they're not sure that it's going to become, remember there's ways you could pay
3971240	3973900	for pizzas and stuff with Bitcoin at one time.
3973900	3977560	I bet the person that paid for pizza with that Bitcoin's probably regretting that quite
3977560	3978560	a bit nowadays.
3978560	3987160	Like I just fucking use cash and said, I spent $30,000 on that pizza.
3987160	3992940	The same could be said that I didn't invest in my 401k enough money.
3992940	3995080	I went to Disneyland instead.
3995080	3998280	Um, and am I going to regret that when I'm 65?
3998280	4003700	I might, but at the same time I got to go to fucking Disneyland.
4003700	4009040	So Loki, what I'm trying to tell you is that that pizza was fucking good.
4009040	4010040	Hope it was.
4010040	4011040	Anyways.
4011040	4012040	Yeah.
4012040	4016880	So they're saying with that, um, you know, blocked blockchain technology is poised to
4016880	4022480	take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize the
4022480	4028160	current economic ecosystem, especially in areas of video game industry and online transactions.
4028160	4033920	So because I don't understand enough about blockchain and ship, how is it that we're
4033920	4035560	just creating money from nothing?
4035560	4036760	I mean, it's what I want to know.
4036760	4040320	Cause like if we can just create money from nothing, then I guess I should just come out
4040320	4042600	my coin and sell that and stuff.
4042600	4043600	I know.
4043600	4044600	Oh, a VoG coin.
4044600	4047920	Is that what you, you want a VoG coin?
4047920	4048920	I don't know.
4048920	4049920	I mean, what's Bobby.
4049920	4053400	Maybe if Atari VoG coin, can we get a book?
4053400	4058040	If Atari can do it and Atari is just like, I can already see it's just like, I can already
4058040	4061120	see the disapproving look on Bobby's face and the art style.
4061120	4065560	The thing is, is that I don't think that Bitcoin was created from nothing technically.
4065560	4071520	I think that it was created with a pool of real funds into creating this currency.
4071520	4072880	Cause I mean, think about it.
4072880	4080440	The origins of coinage anyway, were a result of having something for a barter system.
4080440	4087040	It was a unit of, instead of having physical goods to change, people would then use these
4087040	4089680	as a token to exchange for other goods.
4089680	4093640	So it's basically adding another layer into the barter system.
4093720	4100840	And then from there, now all society will, unless you are extremely, extremely communist,
4100840	4104600	you know, works on this now system of currency.
4104600	4109440	They've just taken that system of currency to work the way, almost like our credit cards
4109440	4110440	do.
4110440	4117700	Except our credit cards work on debt, whereas Bitcoin is, it's not, while it may not have
4117700	4122440	physical substance, it's as substantial in currency as having coinage.
4122440	4123440	Makes sense.
4123440	4124440	Yeah.
4124440	4129400	Akuma JP kind of adds to your thought saying money was just a paper, if not for banks.
4129400	4130400	So kind of a...
4130400	4131880	Well, what happened?
4131880	4137120	Jamie just did the actual Oprah gif that you may have seen where Oprah just kind of goes,
4137120	4138120	there you go.
4138120	4139120	There you go.
4139120	4144480	But the other thing too is, I mean, if you want to have another prime example of this,
4144480	4147080	let's just use American history here for a second.
4147080	4148800	Confederate money.
4148800	4152600	They created the money for the Confederacy when the Confederacy died, the money became
4152600	4162200	worthless except as, you know, to collectors or after World War One, the Deutschmark because
4162200	4168320	the company, the country was so impoverished, their money was nothing.
4168320	4173440	People were using Deutschmarks to actually use as kindling because they were worth nothing.
4173440	4174920	So I mean, there you go.
4174920	4180740	It only has the value ascribed to it by whatever financial institution is behind it and the
4180740	4182760	power of the country it's in.
4182760	4183760	So...
4183760	4185200	Or commemorative plates.
4185200	4189160	Bobby Blackwolf in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm trying to figure out if I really
4189160	4195860	want to take my old tokens from Electronica, the experience at Disney California venture,
4195860	4200080	and put the VOG logo on it and give them to you as a VOG coin.
4200080	4204840	You know, there's kind of a, there's a double meaning there though, because remember when
4204840	4209520	VOG was born, when the idea came out that this is a thing that should be happening.
4209520	4212640	It was at Disneyland at Electronica.
4212640	4213640	So...
4213640	4218020	Well, and I do agree with JD that's either collector's items or racist tokens as back
4218020	4222840	to the Confederate money, but there also are historians who collect.
4222840	4228200	There is historic value in it, even though that history is not a pleasant one to always
4228200	4229200	confront.
4229320	4237520	I also do know people who collect defunct coinage and you know, have like old Roman coins, old,
4237520	4242560	you know, even the, you know, little stone coins, you know, from other cultures.
4242560	4245160	One man's trash is another's treasure.
4245160	4246160	Right?
4246160	4247160	Yeah.
4247160	4254060	Anyway, let's move on to, it's not cryptocurrency, something completely different.
4254060	4255200	It's VR.
4255200	4257280	And this is the interesting headline out there.
4257320	4261880	Nintendo president is interested in VR, but says nothing interesting has been done yet
4261880	4262880	with the tech.
4262880	4266280	Well, that, that comment's just leading itself over to, what do you mean nothing interesting
4266280	4267280	has been done?
4267280	4268280	No, no, no, no, no.
4268280	4269860	Well, hold on.
4269860	4275400	So here's the quote from Tatsumi Kimishima, who of course is the president of Nintendo
4275400	4276900	right now.
4276900	4282680	He said in this tweet, I guess that came from Japanese Nintendo, was this in an interview
4282680	4283680	or something?
4283680	4285600	I'm not sure where the interview was or what have you.
4285600	4290800	But the quote was, I understand that VR is interesting as a technology, and I am very
4290800	4292040	interested in it.
4292040	4295720	I will use it if I can make interesting things with it.
4295720	4298720	We have not done anything interesting yet.
4298720	4303760	So I'll give them that with, with the technology.
4303760	4304760	Here's the thing.
4304760	4306320	And this is what it really boils down to.
4306320	4310760	And, and, you know, I'm going to take his words in another fashion and agree with it.
4310760	4315720	And that is that VR does not yet have its Wii Sports.
4315720	4318640	And that's what Nintendo, you know, really does.
4318640	4321320	Well, A, they didn't invent the VR technology.
4321320	4325360	They like to do this stuff with the new ways to game that they invent.
4325360	4330000	But if Nintendo can kind of find that must have way to incorporate VR, that must have
4330000	4334920	game or kind of see that must have game out there, then they're going to jump on board
4334920	4335920	with it.
4335920	4339520	Are you telling me that VR chat isn't the Wii Sports of VR?
4339520	4345840	Regretfully, Loki, I'm sorry to inform you, don't think it is.
4345840	4346840	I don't know.
4346840	4349880	I think there's been plenty done with VR, but yeah, there's not like been any really
4349880	4351720	killer apps have sold the platform.
4351720	4352720	I think.
4352720	4356880	I mean, there's been a lot of good games, but nothing like, you know, is the finding
4356880	4359840	is like Mario Odyssey or something like that for VR.
4359840	4364840	You don't, when you think of VR, you don't really think of like a particular game.
4364840	4367600	It's more of just kind of an experience or platform.
4367600	4371920	So I get it there, but also at the same time, it almost seems like that they're just defending
4371920	4376920	themselves of the fact that they're not entering that market as like, Oh, nothing, nothing
4376920	4378420	significant has been done yet.
4378420	4380360	That's why we're doing what we're doing, you know, kind of thing.
4380360	4384500	Cause they did the same thing or like other companies are the same thing with like motion
4384500	4389960	controls or rumble or like HD and all that stuff.
4389960	4394300	And they've made that argument like before where it's like, eh, here's the thing.
4394300	4399880	Nintendo is in this position now that they don't have to defend their fucking choices.
4399880	4404180	Four years ago, they needed to defend their fucking choices because the Wii U is not performing.
4404180	4407720	The switch on the other hand is exceeding expectations in many ways.
4407720	4412480	So whether we like it or not, Loki, and we've had this conversation a thousand times, even
4412480	4416420	though you and I go back and forth all the time on Nintendo and things, they ought to
4416420	4417520	be doing better.
4417520	4420940	The reality is they're selling shit, tons of switches.
4420940	4422140	They've got enough on it.
4422140	4423300	That's fun to play.
4423300	4426020	So VR be damned for them.
4426020	4430940	They'll incorporate VR when it suits their narrative.
4430940	4433260	That's what it boils down to.
4433260	4439140	In the meantime, cardboard folded into interesting shapes to do crazy things.
4439140	4442060	That is what Nintendo sees a market in instead.
4442060	4448340	And it's like, and I'm not shading that because like a lot of people are like, wow, that's
4448340	4449460	fucking neat.
4449460	4454100	And even I'm like, I don't know if that's for me, but that is kind of fucking neat.
4454100	4457220	And the more and more stuff I see them doing with it, like I did see that little like light
4457220	4458400	gun thing they were doing.
4458400	4462060	So I guess there's a new one they're doing with Labo is like a light gun.
4462060	4464020	And I'm like, okay, that is kind of neat.
4464020	4467740	It's just, I know it's a gimmick.
4467740	4468780	It's a gimmick.
4468780	4470900	It's a gimmick to sell a tech demo game.
4470900	4474900	And honestly, I hope the games are good because that's where it's going to come down to.
4474900	4479300	But it's like, no, it's an interesting concept, but no.
4479300	4482780	I think the whole thing with Labo though, is that it has to have been in development
4482780	4489180	for quite some time because, um, does anyone remember, um, when Nintendo for Wii U was
4489180	4491300	talking about Project Giant Robot?
4491300	4492300	Yeah.
4492300	4493300	Yeah.
4493300	4498500	And that game actually ended up, uh, looks like it's what got turned in to the Toy-Con
4498500	4499500	2, the robot kit.
4499500	4500500	Yeah.
4500500	4503580	But at the same time, I think Nintendo just didn't want to maybe waste those resources
4503580	4507360	when they saw the writing on the wall for the Wii U, it was just kind of like, well,
4507360	4509720	how do we not lose what we've done here so far?
4509720	4510720	And they, it was repurposed.
4510720	4514320	I don't think it was like designed with Labo in mind or anything like that.
4514320	4517640	And I think that kind of shit happens in the game industry all the time.
4517640	4519800	Well shit, Overwatch, right?
4519800	4523320	That game is fucking insane what that game's doing, right?
4523320	4529640	Overwatch came from Project Titan, which got axed, you know, and we'll never know really.
4529640	4534240	I mean, we, we've heard rumors and things of what Project Titan was, but all we know
4534240	4538520	is that a lot of this stuff for Overwatch, like some of these maps and things were supposed
4538520	4540080	to be like a part of Titan.
4540080	4545000	And I think the, the game in Overwatch was like one element of Titan, but they instead
4545000	4547200	put it into this like full flesh game.
4547200	4552920	So anyway, long story short, sometimes these games are born from canceled things, you know,
4552920	4555440	or they just, they, they evolve.
4555440	4561080	So anyhow, uh, let's, let's, let's travel to a simpler time, shall we?
4561080	4565540	There was, there was no virtual reality or anything like that.
4565540	4566540	You know what there was?
4566540	4567540	They tried.
4567540	4574400	There was a power glove, which is a great transition into the classic peripheral of
4574400	4575400	the month.
4575400	4580040	Because usually every week on this show, uh, Dark Soccer's Steps into the Gaming Vault
4580040	4583840	finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brat should be checking this game out.
4583840	4587300	But in a 2017 twist, no one should use this.
4587300	4589780	She did systems every month.
4589780	4593800	And this year, 2018, she's doing one peripheral a month.
4593800	4594800	So Dark Soccer.
4594800	4595800	No one should use this one though.
4595800	4596800	Okay.
4596800	4597800	This is a bad peripheral.
4597800	4598800	It is.
4598800	4599800	And what I'm gonna-
4599800	4600800	So wait, hold on.
4600800	4604120	Bobby, see, sometimes we pick bad things, but I didn't pick that game.
4604120	4605860	So that was a week you weren't here.
4605860	4606860	All right.
4606860	4610260	But, um, but I've decided that because it's kind of hard to find music to go with some
4610260	4616340	of these, that I'm trying to pick like, I guess, music from the system, like Bios music
4616380	4617380	or something.
4617380	4618380	Uh-huh.
4618380	4623340	So I picked the Sega CD Bios 2 because honestly it's awesome.
4623340	4624540	But that's not the peripheral.
4624540	4625540	The Sega CD is not the peripheral.
4625540	4626540	But it worked on it.
4626540	4627540	Okay.
4627540	4629580	Well, what is the classic peripheral of the month?
4629580	4634160	It is the Activator by Sega.
4634160	4643420	And when I moved out here, we bought an Activator with Eternal Champions for $10 at Virgin.
4643500	4647660	If you remember the old Virgin store that we had here.
4647660	4656380	It was released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993, also known in the U.S. as the Genesis.
4656380	4664140	And the technology was used in- similar technology was used in the Sega System 32 fighting game
4664140	4667780	Dragon Ball Z VR versus.
4667780	4674020	So it used your motion sensors to play the game.
4674020	4680060	But anyway, it was when a lot of companies were investing in virtual reality or I would
4680060	4685220	more put this as augmented reality, but not the type of AR that we're used to using our
4685220	4691820	phones, but as a way to immerse the movement of the player with the game, you know.
4691820	4697900	And so the Activator was developed by a company called Interactive Light for Sega.
4697900	4703300	And then it was- for those in Brazil, it was brought there by Tech Toy, but it was based
4703300	4709140	off of a musical interest called the Light Harp that was conceived of by a person named
4709140	4710140	Asaf Gerner.
4710140	4711140	Did we know that?
4711140	4713500	No, we did not.
4713500	4718820	It had eight segments that put it together, made an octagonal ring that you place on the
4718820	4723460	floor and then it fires beams of light upwards where-
4723460	4725300	Just like a Para Para machine.
4725300	4727140	Yes, I was getting to that.
4727140	4728140	Sorry.
4728140	4732860	It seems to me like also one of the influences for Para Para, at least the game versions.
4732860	4736540	Para Para is by itself special.
4736540	4742860	So you would break the light beams by kicking or punching to send signals to the Mega Drive
4742860	4746940	console and then it's supposed to, you know, repeat it in game.
4746940	4755980	It's basically a giant control pad with your left, up, right, down, A, B, C, and start
4755980	4759220	buttons mapped to those segments.
4759220	4765820	They were marketing it as a martial arts simulator that it was supposed to work specifically
4765820	4772300	with the fighting games, but a lot of games just did not work very well with it.
4772300	4776980	And you could also distort those light beams by not having a flat ceiling.
4776980	4781180	And we tried it in my house that had a vaulted ceiling at the time.
4781180	4786100	I mean, we've still got vaulted ceilings now, but it really didn't work very well.
4786100	4791940	And then, like I said, they revamped the activator for Dragon Ball Z VR versus and it had extra
4791940	4800940	sensors so that it could better, I guess, better read, you know, what was going on.
4800940	4803820	And it was really popular.
4803820	4807780	And it was also one of the first full body motion games because, you know, we've had
4807780	4814500	several since then, like, well, we have Police 9-1-1 and wasn't there like a firefighting
4814500	4816500	game or something?
4816500	4817500	Anyway.
4817500	4824500	But there were some games that were designed for the activator and they were called Activated
4824500	4830500	so there was best of the best championship karate, Eternal Champions, Greatest Heavyweights
4830540	4832820	and Streets of Rage 3.
4832820	4837500	It had support for Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter II, Special Champion Edition and Streets of
4837500	4839280	Rage 2.
4839280	4845180	And the Sega 32X versions of Mortal Kombat 2 also mentioned the activator by game but
4845180	4846760	it didn't work very well.
4846760	4851380	There were also a couple of unreleased games that were meant to be specifically used by
4851380	4856980	the activator but were canceled called Air Drums and Bounty Hunter.
4856980	4859480	And that's it.
4859480	4860660	That was the activator.
4860660	4869460	It came in this big red box that had all the, you know, 90s looking text that, you know,
4869460	4872380	it glowed and had, you know, drop shadows and shit.
4872380	4874580	So there you go.
4874580	4876540	The activator.
4876540	4877860	The flop of the week.
4877860	4884540	Yeah, it was kind of shitty but an important, you know, peripheral nonetheless.
4884540	4886220	Not all peripherals were great.
4886460	4888820	Well, it's only slightly better than the U-Force.
4888820	4891620	Hey, don't spoil what might be an upcoming.
4891620	4893220	I did the U-Force last month.
4893220	4894820	Oh, why did I...
4894820	4895820	Girl.
4896820	4899460	I thought for some reason you did the Power Glove the first month.
4899460	4900460	I don't remember why.
4900460	4902820	No, I haven't done the Power Glove yet because it's so bad.
4902820	4903980	We talk about it so often.
4903980	4906620	I'm trying not to do anything too terribly obvious.
4906620	4907620	That's fair.
4907620	4908620	But...
4908620	4909620	That's fair.
4909620	4910620	Because I can't...
4910620	4913580	Because Para Para Biscuits, yeah, they're a peripheral but they were part of the arcade
4913580	4914580	game.
4914580	4915580	Yeah.
4915940	4916940	I don't know.
4916940	4920420	I'd like to have some suggestions from people like what is so shitty it deserves to be mentioned.
4920420	4925140	I'm gonna say go to our Discord to shout those out.
4925140	4927020	I kind of pay attention to the Discord.
4927020	4928020	I pay close attention to it.
4928020	4930020	It took me, what, three months to join it?
4930020	4931020	Good job.
4931020	4932020	You're finally on board.
4932020	4933020	Yeah.
4933020	4934020	Vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4934020	4938740	I also, though, have my own channel in there too but I don't do anything with it.
4938740	4939940	JD has a great question.
4939940	4941540	Is it terrible peripherals only?
4941540	4942540	No.
4942540	4943540	No.
4943540	4946100	This is gonna probably be a two-year segment.
4946100	4948020	Oh, you're gonna stretch this into 2019.
4948020	4949020	Because there's so many things.
4949020	4950020	There are a lot.
4950020	4951020	And I've run out of ideas.
4951020	4952020	All right.
4952020	4954020	OLR confirmed through 2019.
4954020	4956020	We'll see.
4956020	4957020	All right.
4957020	4959380	Anyhow, we're gonna take a quick break, you guys.
4959380	4964340	In 2020, I'm probably gonna do like video game-related endorsement of the month.
4964340	4965580	Like Mario cereal or something.
4965580	4966580	Video game commercial.
4966580	4967580	Put them on.
4967580	4968580	Now I'm gonna do endorsement.
4968580	4972500	So that means I can also talk about Doki Doki Panic.
4972500	4973500	And Wrecka.
4973500	4974500	Sure.
4974500	4976380	And we can talk about Cool Spot on the NES.
4976380	4977380	I'd rather not.
4977380	4978380	All right.
4978380	4979380	We're gonna take a quick break, you guys.
4979380	4984220	When we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio coming up, including we'll
4984220	4988180	talk about some rapid-fire news, including some updates on Stardew Valley and Dragon
4988180	4990500	Ball FighterZ.
4990500	4992660	And then we'll talk a little bit about Overwatch.
4992660	4993660	Why not?
4993660	4996100	We already brought it up earlier in the show, so we'll talk about it a little more.
4996100	5001100	All this and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5003500	5011340	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.
5011340	5017260	Episode number 719 of our show for this February the 18th of 2018.
5017260	5019260	Already in progress.
5019260	5023760	Let's get into, before we get into rapid-fire news, actually, I gotta ask Loki about this
5023760	5026940	because I'm sure you've been following some of this news and it's been coming up on the
5026940	5027940	Discord.
5027940	5032580	We're talking about Discord before the break and definitely some folks talking about movies
5032580	5033580	coming up.
5033580	5036980	Ready Player One, of course, all those character posters are showing up and there's a lot more
5036980	5037980	news about that.
5037980	5038980	Yeah.
5038980	5042300	Darsakha and I even saw the Ready Player One poster today at the theater, so it was like,
5042300	5043780	that movie's getting closer.
5043780	5044780	Getting hype.
5044780	5045780	Excited for that?
5045780	5046780	Yes, I'm very excited for it.
5046780	5047780	So, here's another movie.
5047780	5051300	I didn't even know this was happening, but apparently they're doing another Kung Fury
5051300	5052300	movie?
5052300	5053300	Yeah.
5053300	5057100	So, is this just a remake of the short as a movie or is it a sequel?
5057100	5061020	I think they're doing a full-length movie, but as a sequel.
5061020	5062020	Okay.
5062660	5067300	And apparently, and what I'm reading online, Michael Fassbender is in it.
5067300	5068300	Is in it.
5068300	5069300	We don't know what he's...
5069300	5070300	Yes, he was in Shame.
5070300	5071300	Yes, we all know that movie.
5071300	5077980	I just want the soundtrack to still be done by Mitch Marder because it was, well, thanks
5077980	5084340	to my friend Nikki, I've, I guess, discovered Retro New Wave, which is all that 80s style
5084340	5085340	synth pop.
5085340	5087540	And I've listened to some of his other stuff and it's amazing.
5087540	5089100	Have you ever played Hotline Miami?
5089100	5090100	Yeah.
5090100	5091100	Okay, I was gonna say.
5091180	5097500	Because, I mean, they have him or Future Cop or Droid Bishop on that soundtrack, or even
5097500	5101300	pull Stan Bush out of retirement, you know.
5101300	5103500	Is Hasselhoff confirmed for this one?
5103500	5104500	Yes, he is.
5104500	5105500	Yes.
5105500	5111860	And then I saw a good old Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of this state that kind
5111860	5116780	of had a disgraceful exit, but he's back doing movies again, so he's gonna be doing Kung
5116780	5117780	Fury.
5117780	5118780	Yeah.
5118780	5122900	I'm gonna take Andrew Kossing's role, the Thor God.
5122900	5125420	I hope Schwarzenegger is not there to take that role.
5125420	5128180	No, I think he's supposed to play someone else.
5128180	5132860	I hear you might, I think he might even be the villain or something like that.
5132860	5133860	Oh shit, okay.
5133860	5134860	Maybe.
5134860	5135860	Nice.
5135860	5140980	So, I don't know, but yeah, he's not, no, he's not gonna take Thor's role or anything.
5140980	5143900	As long as that arcade machine comes back.
5143900	5148140	Well, he got killed in the first one, didn't he?
5148140	5152140	There's always a chance that more of them will come back, but yeah, it, it, I'm excited
5152140	5153140	about it.
5153140	5157460	Um, of course that's so far off, you know, um, we'll have to see when that comes out,
5157460	5162180	but I hope they don't replace the guy that plays Kung Fury because I understand Fastbenders
5162180	5166380	into, but like at what they didn't say, he is Kung Fury.
5166380	5167380	So I don't know.
5167380	5168780	No, I don't know.
5168780	5172380	I guess we still have some time to find out, but I just, I'm kind of shocked that they're
5172380	5175280	getting like all this big talent very suddenly.
5175280	5181040	So because it's a cheat, it, it's more of like, it's a fun project.
5181040	5184880	I think at this point when you've done so many big things, when you've made Assassin's
5184880	5188440	Creed, what else is left to like, look at like almost forcing your perfect example or
5188440	5192600	his words to nigger and Jackie Chan or in like some Chinese film or something when he
5192600	5195960	plays like this general guy in that as well.
5195960	5197520	It's just kind of like fun projects.
5197520	5200120	It's not necessarily like they've made their money.
5200120	5204040	I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger at this point kind of has to make fun of himself.
5204040	5206760	Like there's really nothing left for him.
5206760	5210520	I think, yeah, I mean, you take some roles for money and you take some roles because
5210520	5211520	they're just fun.
5211520	5213240	They're just stupid, weird or something.
5213240	5214240	I don't know.
5214240	5221240	So, um, but yes, I am incredibly excited about, um, Ready Player One.
5221240	5222240	All right.
5222240	5223840	So lots of stuff going on in gaming.
5223840	5227840	And then we saw also a poster for Tomb Raider cause that's just, I didn't realize how close
5227840	5228840	that movie.
5228840	5229840	I didn't even know it was coming out.
5229840	5230840	Yeah.
5230840	5233800	And if you saw, well, I don't know if you've seen the new trailer for Ready Player One.
5233800	5239240	They have that play in front of, um, Black Panther right now as well, Linzels online.
5239240	5243280	But uh, there is a cameo from Hello Kitty and Batsmaru in there.
5243280	5244280	Woo.
5244280	5245280	No, I haven't seen the new trailer.
5245280	5247480	No, there is a small cameo.
5247480	5253560	I saw every, we, every single trailer we saw today were the exact same trailer except for
5253560	5254560	one.
5254560	5255560	There was one, the one about the Quantum Leap.
5255560	5257040	It was Quantum Leap for teenagers.
5257040	5258040	That's what it was.
5258040	5259480	It was the, what was it called?
5259480	5260480	Everyday.
5260480	5261480	Was that the name of the movie?
5261480	5262480	With the pink song in the trailer.
5262480	5263480	What?
5264160	5267080	It was like, every day I'm waking up in a different body and I'm falling in love with
5267080	5268080	you.
5268080	5270940	It looked like some teenage movie, but like the main character was all these different
5270940	5275240	people that was, yeah, it actually was the most interesting out of all the trailers.
5275240	5279440	I liked the one about, but I also fucking love pink and I love that song.
5279440	5280440	Like the song is so good.
5280440	5281440	Yeah.
5281440	5282440	I want to see that one.
5282440	5283880	I kind of want to see the black comedy though.
5283880	5284880	The yeah.
5284880	5288320	And then we, we see all these other trailers and what's, what's the other one we saw twice
5288320	5292340	now with the, it's like Charlie and the horse or something.
5292340	5295220	And I leaned over and I was pick up Pete, pick up here.
5295220	5301340	I leaned over and I whispered in Jamie's ear, you know, he's going to fuck that horse because
5301340	5304740	the whole trailer is like, I'm going to take my horse.
5304740	5305740	I love you.
5305740	5306740	I'm going to take this horse.
5306740	5307740	I'm going to leave.
5307740	5308740	Yeah.
5308740	5309740	But you know what my reply was?
5309740	5311480	Steve Buscemi is randomly in it too.
5311480	5312480	Catherine the Great.
5312480	5313480	He ain't.
5313480	5314480	No.
5314480	5315820	Unfortunately it's not the horse.
5315820	5318060	The horse is not, it's not a Mr. Ed thing going on.
5318060	5322260	It's supposed to be like a legit movie that I suppose maybe we'll give some people feel
5322260	5328540	like, was it like I go on a Netflix now and the turn, the first two things that, um, greet
5328540	5334180	me as, as we enter into the kids section is two abominations to the cinema.
5334180	5340740	Number one, the emoji movie and number two, the who the fuck asked for this fucking remake.
5340740	5348740	But Woody Woodpecker, the CG animated CG live action, Woody Woodpecker movie.
5348740	5351780	I'm like, no, God, no, no.
5352300	5353300	Why?
5353300	5354300	No.
5354300	5356980	Thankfully my kids are smart and do not want to watch either one of those.
5356980	5357980	All right.
5357980	5361180	Anyway, it's, that's the second time we've become a movie podcast tonight.
5361180	5364980	We're starting to creep on critical myths turf here at the Lucy keeps network.
5364980	5365980	All right.
5365980	5368940	Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news back in these games.
5368940	5369940	Loki.
5369940	5372780	So, uh, this is kind of cool cause I've been playing a little bit of Stardew Valley, but
5372780	5377380	they are going to be adding multiplayer soon and they announced that they're going to be
5377380	5381460	doing a beta for said multiplayer in the spring.
5381500	5386340	So, um, basically it'll give us more details as it gets closer to that, but it is something
5386340	5387340	that's coming.
5387340	5393540	Uh, but he did post the picture of, you know, kind of some of the screenshots from that
5393540	5396340	multiplayer add on expansion or whatever.
5396340	5401540	And of course it shows two houses or as opposed to the one house.
5401540	5403220	Um, so that's kind of cool.
5403220	5408940	I'm be kind of interested to see how that plays out or if it's going to be like, you
5408940	5413140	have to play at the same time or is it like, you know, you can keep visiting like Animal
5413140	5416700	Crossing where you can keep visiting back to the same world type thing.
5416700	5418500	That'll do wonders for streaming too.
5418500	5420140	I think that's going to be a lot of fun to watch.
5420140	5421740	Like people kind of doing that together.
5421740	5426180	So yeah, I mean, I don't know how much that's going to really add to the game, but I'm hopefully
5426180	5430000	they're going to add more content to the game along with the multiplayer.
5430000	5431000	So we'll see.
5431000	5435620	Um, and then of course this is exciting news regarding dance rush.
5436540	5441060	Round one is basically said that they're going to be bringing it to the US in their locations.
5441060	5442860	So that's pretty awesome.
5442860	5443860	Starting this summer.
5443860	5446380	We'll have to drive all the way to Concord to play that.
5446380	5448380	Although soon, did you guys hear this?
5448380	5453420	They have announced the upcoming round one openings, uh, later this year, they're going
5453420	5456580	to be opening one in Hayward, uh, at the mall there.
5456580	5461200	And uh, I don't know if you guys have heard this in the fourth quarter of 2019, Roseville
5461200	5464520	is getting around one that was confirmed.
5464520	5465960	So pretty, pretty cool.
5465960	5467280	There'll be one in our neighborhood.
5467280	5468280	So where's the Concord one?
5468280	5469280	Is that the mall there?
5469280	5470480	The Concord one is at Sun Valley mall.
5470480	5471480	Oh yeah.
5471480	5474200	I don't know what store it used to be cause I don't, that's not my own.
5474200	5478160	And they say this new one is going into the Galleria, but the Galleria doesn't have any
5478160	5483280	open space that I know of in the mall, uh, unless some big store closed there that I
5483280	5484280	can't think of.
5484280	5487400	But I don't think the Galleria has like, like there's no like Sears there that went under
5487400	5488400	it.
5488400	5489400	Like the Sears there is still open.
5489400	5490400	Yeah, it's still open.
5490400	5491400	Yeah.
5491400	5495400	But across the street from the Galleria, there's that big open lot that used to be the furniture
5495400	5499000	store that they do the haunted houses in every October.
5499000	5500800	I bet that's it.
5500800	5505240	That's big enough to be around one, but that's kind of a long time for that to sit empty.
5505240	5509320	I mean, you know, that I would be surprised if they're going to have to do, if they're
5509320	5512940	going to have to do make makeovers on the building to make it work, put a bowling alley
5512940	5517280	in there and you know, maybe there's already an agreement for Halloween of this year that
5517280	5518600	they have to see through or something.
5518600	5519600	Who knows?
5519800	5523920	But yeah, so they'll be coming out, um, starting this summer.
5523920	5525840	So that's going to be pretty exciting.
5525840	5529420	And just real quick, I'm sorry, JD is put the list in chat.
5529420	5532080	There are more round ones opening besides just in our neighborhood.
5532080	5535740	Like I saw like there's a new one in Ohio somewhere and there's, there's, there's others
5535740	5536960	opening across the country.
5536960	5541120	So, um, you should check and see if you're on the list because you know, again, they're
5541120	5546160	not paying us to make this plug, but I mean, round one is bringing like old school arcades
5546160	5550800	back and especially with the types of games that flat out interest me, you know, the Japanese
5550800	5551800	imports.
5551800	5553160	So I support it.
5553160	5554160	Yeah.
5554160	5557400	And I'm just going to be excited because by the time it does get in our neighborhood,
5557400	5562720	I'll be actually in shape enough to be able to play them again.
5562720	5563720	Maybe I will be too.
5563720	5564720	We'll see.
5564720	5567680	Of course, as I say here, as I down my third glass of wine.
5567680	5573680	Um, but yeah, so like the final name of the game now is Dance Rush Stardom is the full
5573680	5575660	title that they have now.
5575660	5581800	And um, so there's some additional information regarding dangerous stardom, including talking
5581800	5582800	about that.
5582800	5584960	They have now language selection in there as well.
5584960	5590340	So they have Japanese, English, Korean, traditional Chinese, or simplified Chinese, um, or options
5590340	5595260	you can choose for the menu, which is kind of nice so that they can put it out, you know,
5595260	5596260	internationally.
5596260	5598900	And then they have, of course, the, uh, the different modes you can do.
5598900	5603220	So you have your basic mode and your premium mode, the premium mode, of course, if you've
5603220	5608060	seen it online, there's some YouTube videos out there will basically record you playing
5608060	5609220	the game.
5609220	5613900	So you can actually upload that as well to the internet for all to enjoy.
5613900	5614900	So there's that.
5614900	5619760	They show a little bit of the lesson mode that's available in the game as well.
5619760	5624040	And um, talking about songs that are in the game.
5624040	5626780	So there's quite a few songs.
5626780	5632500	They said there's gonna be 50 at the North American launch, but, um, you know, some of
5632500	5639340	the ones I've heard so far, they had Wicked, um, from, uh, from our Jew, I guess.
5639340	5641660	And let's see without you a press.
5641660	5644980	I know that there's, uh, give me a big beat by Korskay.
5644980	5650600	That's one I've been listening to my car, um, sacrosanorized by Rio star.
5650600	5653860	They also have a remix of butterfly in there as well.
5653860	5654860	I've heard that one.
5654860	5655860	That was pretty cool.
5655860	5661740	Um, I watched, uh, like a double, the group before the play in the butterfly remix.
5661740	5662740	That was pretty cool.
5662740	5663740	I saw that too.
5663740	5664740	Yeah.
5664740	5669500	A revolution by Broadio and, um, I dunno, it looks like just a really fun game.
5669500	5674060	Um, so they did once again, uh, 50 songs at launch, four songs added every month after
5674060	5675060	that.
5675060	5679260	And it's scheduled for at least in March in Japan.
5679260	5681940	So the U S will receive it in the summer.
5681940	5685880	I have to say, like, honestly, with all the like music games that come out, this one has
5685880	5690100	me kind of the most excited since like DDR, you know, like I really want to try it.
5690100	5691100	Looks like a lot of fun.
5691100	5692100	So yeah.
5692100	5698300	Um, I am very excited to see how this, how this looks when we come out because right
5698300	5702140	now I'm assuming, cause this isn't obviously 50 songs that they're listing on here.
5702140	5706740	So I'm wondering if between the now and then is where we're going to get the additional
5706740	5709660	songs because yeah, this is probably just the test test version list.
5709660	5711660	They'll probably be more, we'll see.
5711660	5713580	So maybe some old classics coming back.
5713580	5714580	Who knows?
5714580	5715580	Anyhow.
5715580	5721700	Well, if you are a user of GOG or good old games, uh, good news, uh, and you use steam,
5721700	5726980	I should say, if you use both, some good news is that some more games got added to GOG connect.
5726980	5731300	If you don't remember what that is, that is where as long as your steam profile is public
5731300	5736580	and you link the two together, you can import your steam owned games into your good old
5736580	5737900	games library.
5737900	5743240	So they just added 11 more games, including mountain blade or well, tropical for a Y
5743240	5750520	AI war collection, Hunie pop, Kim pirates, gold plus tempest, the sexy brutal, Hunie
5750520	5751520	pop.
5751520	5752520	I think is what it is.
5752520	5753520	A Hunie pop.
5753520	5754520	That was just one in.
5754520	5755520	Okay.
5755520	5756520	Sorry about that.
5756520	5760960	Then a Hunie pop, uh, tempest, uh, torchlight, which is the one that I had that I was able
5760960	5764760	to import and unreal tournament game of the year, which I know a lot of people own that
5764760	5765760	one.
5765760	5766760	So pretty cool.
5766760	5770200	So if you haven't checked out that feature, uh, and you use GOG, uh, you should get on
5770200	5771200	that.
5771600	5776800	Uh, in other news, how about mega man legacy collection for the Nintendo switch?
5776800	5780340	We knew it was coming because Capcom did announce they are going to make it happen when they
5780340	5784760	finally finally put out that trailer for mega man 11, right?
5784760	5789000	They announced that mega man legacy would come to the switch, but this is what's interesting.
5789000	5795940	Apparently the ESRB rated a game called mega man legacy collection one and two.
5795940	5800160	So it sounds like the games are simply being bundled together, which is great.
5800160	5802220	I hope they just did one cart with both games.
5802220	5803220	Why not?
5803220	5804220	Yeah.
5804220	5808680	And give the switch owners a little something for having to wait or what'll probably really
5808680	5809680	happen.
5809680	5814820	I think weren't these games like 20 bucks a pop when they were, uh, on the PS four marketplace
5814820	5815820	and the Xbox marketplace.
5815820	5816820	Yeah.
5816820	5818400	It'll probably just be a $40 cartridge.
5818400	5819400	Gotcha.
5819400	5820400	Yeah.
5820400	5821400	Maybe let's hope not.
5821400	5823360	Let's hope they maybe change that a little bit.
5823360	5824360	We'll see though.
5824360	5825360	Uh, dark soccer.
5825360	5826360	What do you have for us?
5826360	5830080	Oh, we have some stuff about dragon ball fighter Z, which I haven't gotten because I went ahead
5830080	5835720	and bought, you know, the battle for Azeroth for world of Warcraft and I'm being frugal,
5835720	5840360	but we do have the announcement of two DLC characters and one of them is Bardock and
5840360	5849200	Bururi, um, going in for a even more fighting, but you can get them through the season pass
5849200	5853840	that unlocks eight additional characters for $34.99.
5853840	5863800	Um, and then in other news, uh, there is a rumor about a, uh, a kart racing that's going
5863800	5869940	to be Sonic and friends, more, more Sonic karting from Sumo digital.
5869940	5873580	Somebody out there is playing a cruel joke on orange lounge radio where we have a long
5873580	5878060	running gag of saying Sonic and all of his shitty friends.
5878060	5882240	So somebody is actually making a karting title for Sonic and all of his shitty friends.
5882240	5883240	Yeah.
5883640	5884640	I don't know.
5884640	5885640	He's got some good friends.
5885640	5886640	Really just knuckles.
5886640	5887640	Hmm.
5887640	5888640	Yeah.
5888640	5891040	The ones that weren't starring in the game, they're all pretty shitty.
5891040	5897040	Now if Sonic's shitty friends include Ooh, la la and you know, other Sega characters
5897040	5901480	like the last Sonic racing game that was actually pretty decent, you know, considering how long
5901480	5905760	we had to wait for Mario kart eight, like was actually pretty decent that, that, uh,
5905760	5906760	what is it called?
5906760	5911960	Sonic and friend, no Sonic and Sega all-stars, Sonic and Sega all-stars racing.
5911960	5912960	That was rad.
5912960	5914800	Sonic's friends are the same.
5914800	5915800	And Danica Patrick.
5915800	5916800	Yeah.
5916800	5917800	And Danica.
5917800	5918800	Yes.
5918800	5921840	If, if Danica Patrick and Sonic are still tight, if they're still BFFs, then I'm okay
5921840	5922840	with that.
5922840	5923840	You know what I want them to do?
5923840	5924840	I forgot Danica Patrick.
5924840	5928200	You know what I want them to do with one of these games?
5928200	5932920	We haven't had the OPA OPA in one of the racing games and it should just be the OPA OPA in
5932920	5934500	all of those modes.
5934500	5938360	You know, instead of having little wheels, it's running around on its tiny little feet.
5938360	5942000	And then when it says aerial scenes, the little wings come out or it's the big wing.
5942040	5945560	OPA OPA should be a special unlock, just saying.
5945560	5950720	And when I was playing Phantasy Star Online, you better believe I had an OPA OPA mag.
5950720	5955900	Tiger Claw in chat says, Amy isn't one of Sonic's shitty friends since she was the part
5955900	5957600	of Sonic CD.
5957600	5962760	Well, in the words of Britney Spears, if you seek Amy.
5962760	5966880	And then they're also like, she's also Sonic Adventure and in the comics, so whatever.
5966880	5970060	And then I know, yeah, they keep adding new, new friends in the comics too.
5970060	5974340	Like I saw one today, it was like Rough and Tumble or something like that.
5974340	5975340	But yes.
5975340	5976340	All right.
5976340	5980880	We're going to travel around the world and check out some upcoming releases.
5980880	5983860	That's not rumor, that's fact until it gets delayed.
5983860	5986260	Loki, what's coming out this week, hopefully?
5986260	5993880	All right, so this week, let's see, we've got Age of Empires Definitive Edition.
5993880	5995060	That's on PC.
5995060	5998180	Armored Warfare on PlayStation 4.
5998180	6002480	We have Little Witch Academia Chamber of Time.
6002480	6005140	That's on PC and PlayStation 4.
6005140	6007340	Oh, goodie!
6007340	6012140	Mel Gear Survive, the non-Kojima Metal Gear game.
6012140	6014620	I thought that game came out a fucking long time ago.
6014620	6022620	No, Mel Gear Survive is coming out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6022620	6028860	Okuto Gotoku on PlayStation 4.
6028860	6034300	Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 Plus on Nintendo Switch.
6034300	6035300	This is awesome.
6035300	6037660	Them's Fighting Herds on PC.
6037660	6039940	Remember the game that was going to be in fighting?
6039940	6041540	Oh, yeah, didn't that come up last week on the show?
6041540	6042540	I thought it did.
6042540	6043540	I don't remember.
6043540	6046660	I've been hearing about it on Twitter or something this week, so that's cool.
6046660	6047660	Yep.
6047700	6055780	Then we've also got Pass Cure on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and Sword Art Online Fatal
6055780	6059340	Bullet on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6059340	6060340	That's it.
6060340	6066340	Alright, traveling over to Japan, the I'm sure incredible title of Metal Gear Survive
6066340	6069340	is also coming out in Japan on February 21st.
6069340	6073700	It's kind of a little bit earlier than the rest of the releases on the 22nd, including
6073700	6083460	Senran Kagura Burst, Girls und Panzer Dream Tank Match, Kimi no Hitomi ni Hitmi in regular
6083460	6093140	and limited edition, and then let's see, Azayaka na Irudori no Naka de Kimi Rashiku comes out
6093140	6094580	as well.
6094580	6099740	And then there's another game called Summer Lesson, which is like a three-in-one basic
6099740	6100740	game.
6100740	6102980	Yeah, that is all coming out as well.
6102980	6107780	All that in Japan on the PlayStation 4 this week, the Vita seeing some of those releases
6107780	6115340	too, including Vitamin X Destination, Tokimeki Restaurant, Project Tri-Stars in all sorts
6115340	6121220	of different configurations, including a fifth anniversary box, and Harukanaro Toki no Naka
6121220	6126500	de Ultimate in like three different configurations of limited editions and so forth.
6126500	6130860	I don't think the Switch, oh no, the Switch has one pretty big game this week, Rayman
6130860	6133780	Legends gets a Japanese Switch release this week.
6133780	6134780	That's pretty cool.
6134780	6138700	So you can check that out and let's see if the 3DS has anything.
6138700	6140900	No, I think things are slowing down over there.
6140900	6143980	So we'll go over to Europe with Dark Sakura.
6143980	6149480	On the 20th, we have The Station for Mac, PC, PS4, and Xbox One.
6149480	6157180	On the 21st, Rad Rogers for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Steam World Dig 2 for 3DS.
6157180	6164140	On the 22nd, Metal Gear Survive on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Past Cure for Xbox One.
6164140	6170660	All right, well, it's time to dive into the mailbag because every week you guys send us
6170660	6177140	emails or sometimes you don't, but you send them to participate at orangelauntradio.com
6177140	6178660	and Dark Sakura dives in the mailbag.
6178660	6180940	Who left the sticky stuff everywhere?
6180940	6185900	Finds an email, sorry, I spilled the wine, and finds an email worth reading on the air.
6185900	6187340	We have one email.
6187340	6188340	One email!
6188340	6189340	All right, let's do it.
6189340	6191500	Participate at orangelauntradio.com.
6191500	6194540	Sorry again about the double mailbag submission two weeks ago.
6194540	6198480	As I said in the second, I didn't see my first and my second items.
6198480	6203080	Just a quick thought here, I see the Nedroid toy line is adding mercy to their Overwatch
6203080	6206020	collection to go with Tracer and Mei.
6206020	6211700	I wonder if they'll do more of these and if so, what the hell would a Roadhog Nedroid
6211700	6212920	look like?
6212920	6218000	I sort of wish there were Animal Crossing figures in the line besides just Isabelle,
6218000	6225460	Robert M. I would actually pay for one if I had a crazy red, which by the way, I'm wearing
6225460	6227040	my crazy red shirt tonight.
6227040	6232360	It says, looks legit, or seems legit, sorry.
6232360	6233360	What's a Nedroid?
6233360	6236560	The little cute figures, the kind of chibi figures.
6236560	6237640	Not pop vinyls.
6237640	6238640	Not pops.
6238640	6239640	This is something new.
6239640	6242840	They're expensive, number one.
6242840	6245800	Where pops are like 12 bucks, these are like 60 bucks.
6245800	6249320	I'll find you one, because there's a Nedroid link that I kind of have on.
6249320	6253720	There's a Kirby as well, but I'll find you one and link it to you so you can see what
6253720	6254720	they are.
6254720	6259440	Y'all will be happy to know I bought two more pop vinyls over the weekend, by the way.
6259440	6264360	I already finished my Drag Race collection, that's been there for a while, but I found
6264360	6270840	in a store a Liam and a Sarah Ryder so that Allen could finish off his Mass Effect Andromeda
6270840	6271840	collection.
6271840	6273440	So now he has all of them.
6273440	6277920	So I did buy some pop vinyls, because y'all know I love pop vinyls.
6277920	6281160	I need to get a Vetra, because she's space waifu.
6281160	6286200	Seriously, the playthrough I'm doing now on Andromeda, if I ever get back to it, is a
6286200	6290700	Vetra romance, because Turians, meow.
6290700	6295640	Overwatch is huge, and if Blizzard license it, it doesn't matter what the toy company
6295640	6298320	is, as long as they're putting out quality products, you'll probably see every Overwatch
6298320	6299600	character at some point.
6299600	6305080	They're doing a Mr. Rogers pop vinyl.
6305080	6306080	Yeah.
6306080	6307080	Yeah.
6307080	6308080	I want it.
6308080	6311160	And they're also doing, and I thought I linked it to you, I don't remember.
6311160	6312480	The Coming to America dolls?
6312480	6313480	PeeWee's Playhouse.
6313480	6314480	Oh god.
6314480	6315480	They're doing everything.
6315480	6318280	I just, you know how I feel about it.
6318280	6321320	I think the pop dolls, it's too much.
6321320	6322320	We have too much.
6322320	6325080	There's too many of them.
6325080	6330760	I say that, and yet I have my Drag Race dolls and my Golden Girls dolls, so even I get sucked
6330760	6334240	into it once in a while.
6334240	6336720	JD says, are they not Funko Pops anymore?
6336720	6339880	Oh, I keep calling them Pops, because that's what it says on the box.
6339880	6340880	You're right.
6340880	6341880	They are Funko Pops.
6341880	6342880	I don't know.
6342880	6343880	I'm three glasses in, y'all.
6343880	6344880	Leave me alone.
6344880	6345880	All right.
6345880	6346880	Is that it for emails?
6346880	6347880	Yes.
6347880	6352280	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6352280	6355080	In the meantime, let's go into some more news.
6355080	6356080	Loki.
6356080	6360380	Everything old is new again, so guess what's coming back?
6360380	6361380	That's right.
6361380	6362380	Twitch plays Pokemon.
6362380	6363380	Pet rocks.
6363380	6364380	Oh.
6364380	6365380	What?
6365380	6366800	No pet rocks.
6366800	6368320	We said everything old is new again.
6368320	6370840	I guess maybe not everything.
6370840	6372160	Most things.
6372160	6375080	So Twitch playing Pokemon, that's right.
6375080	6377760	This time, there's a twist.
6377760	6381720	Not only are they playing one Pokemon game, but they're playing another Pokemon game at
6381720	6382720	the same time.
6382720	6386680	So Pokemon Red and Blue are going on at the same time.
6386680	6391680	On top of that, there is even a ... I don't even know what exactly this is, but there's
6391680	6397720	a game of Pokemon Pinball being played at the very bottom of the screen as well.
6397720	6402720	I guess somehow you bet on that, and you can earn tokens to do things.
6402720	6405880	So that's kind of neat.
6405880	6411680	Like the other games, this is mainly ... looks like they do incorporate a democracy mode
6411680	6417040	every once in a while, but for the most part, it's just whatever the other mode is, the
6417040	6421960	direct controlling of everything.
6421960	6429760	And I guess as of right now, looks like I think Pokemon Red is ahead a little bit.
6429760	6431080	But yeah, looks chaotic.
6431080	6435040	So meaning they've gotten a little further in Red than they have in Blue.
6435040	6445280	Yes, Red right now is stuck in the bushes, and Blue is in a fight right now with Slowbro.
6445280	6446280	Thank you for the play-by-play.
6446280	6447280	Good stuff.
6447280	6450520	Oh, they got out of the bushes, woo-hoo!
6450520	6454680	All right, so yes, exciting stuff.
6454680	6456120	I'll take your word for it.
6456120	6460280	All right, hey, this is a follow-up to something we talked about a couple weeks ago, and it
6460280	6462520	has to do with the Overwatch League.
6462520	6467120	The Overwatch League is kind of between ... I don't know, I call it seasons right now, but
6467120	6468400	it's not like a whole new year.
6468400	6469760	I don't know what you describe it.
6469760	6472680	I guess they're saying stage, so there's stage one and stage two.
6472680	6476460	So the Overwatch League is on a little break for a couple weeks, and then they're going
6476460	6477800	to come back with some more watches.
6477800	6484040	Well, during these breaks, the teams in the league have a chance to draft some new players,
6484040	6493440	and the Overwatch League did draft Kim Guiguri Se-yeon as part of a four-player edition,
6493440	6497300	and that's the Shanghai Dragons that drafted her to their team.
6497300	6503840	So it is official the Overwatch League now does have one out of its 100-plus players
6503840	6504840	is a woman.
6504840	6508800	So, okay, I mean, I know we talked about this a few weeks ago.
6508800	6509800	It's a start.
6509800	6510800	Thanks for the token.
6510800	6513120	Yeah, it's a start.
6513120	6515500	And I said when they do that, I would applaud it.
6515500	6519600	So I will applaud the Shanghai Dragons for taking this move.
6519600	6523980	I'm doing orchestra applause, snap, snap, snap.
6523980	6524980	It's a start.
6524980	6529480	But you know, and I actually got into a Twitter dialogue with somebody on this because I wrote
6529480	6534060	a tweet about it, which got picked up in the moments thing on Twitter.
6534060	6537340	So I started getting some random replies on this stuff.
6538260	6544420	And usually I try not to engage trolls, but I kind of felt like this response was mature
6544420	6546220	enough where I could engage in a dialogue.
6546220	6549100	So I went in a little bit of a back and forth with somebody.
6549100	6553460	And this person kind of got to a point where it's like, well, how many would make you happy?
6553460	6554460	Half?
6554460	6555460	30%?
6555460	6558520	I'm like, it's not about a target number.
6558520	6567920	But the reality is, is that when one out of hundreds is female, are you saying that 1%
6567920	6569920	of the people that play Overwatch is female?
6569920	6571920	Is that an accurate representation?
6571920	6573000	You know what I mean?
6573000	6577800	So just, I'm not saying they have to be like a target number, but as I said the first time
6577800	6582500	we did this, it should be at least like 10%.
6582500	6586040	Is that asking too much when half the population of the planet is female?
6586040	6587040	It should be 50%.
6587640	6592520	But at what level though are the female players?
6592520	6595000	And it goes with male players too.
6595000	6598880	What percentages of those are playing at that tournament level?
6598880	6599880	That's what I want to know.
6599880	6603640	Because you may have half the bases playing that, but maybe they're playing more casually
6603640	6604640	than other people.
6604640	6606120	And that could be male or female.
6606120	6608680	I don't even play competitively.
6608680	6610240	Here's my little point.
6610240	6615520	I understand that the first thing people come back with is that, well, I only want the people
6615680	6618680	that are the most talented and to do this and this.
6618680	6621880	Who's being given that opportunity though?
6621880	6626460	That's the question we really have to challenge ourselves with is, well, if we don't have
6626460	6632160	women playing at that entry level that leads into the Overwatch League, then I think the
6632160	6636320	real question we need to be asking ourselves is, why?
6636320	6641400	Why aren't there more women in the entry level when we know there's more women playing the
6641400	6642400	game?
6642400	6644160	Anyway, I don't want to repeat myself too much from a couple of weeks ago.
6644160	6649600	I do want to try to leave this on a net positive because, okay, yes, it's progress.
6649600	6654680	Sure, I'd like to see progress happen overnight, but you know what?
6654680	6657400	And Jamie, I think about something we saw today.
6657400	6662320	We were at the movie theater and there was a poster for some movie coming out and it
6662320	6666920	said something like, love isn't always a straight path or something like that.
6666920	6670480	I don't remember what the term on it was, but remember I turned to you and I said, look
6670480	6671480	at that.
6671480	6672480	I pointed at the poster.
6672480	6673480	I said, look at that.
6673480	6677200	A 17 year old me would have never thought something like that would ever be in a movie
6677200	6681120	theater in Sacramento and here we are.
6681120	6689160	So I can be critical, but at the same time be a bit of a realist and say, okay, this
6689160	6691920	is a good step in the right direction.
6691920	6695200	I hope we get there a little faster than 20 years, especially if we want esports to be
6695200	6697660	taken seriously by everybody.
6697660	6700480	But this is a good start and I do think that should be acknowledged.
6700480	6706100	I just hope, you know, we get there in a few years where you don't notice that there's
6706100	6710520	way less women than men because it accurately reflects who's playing the game.
6710520	6713560	Or we get to the same thing with other minority groups too.
6713560	6717760	I'm spotlighting the women and men thing, but you know, we're, we're challenged in all
6717760	6718760	these areas.
6718760	6725540	What I would like to get to a point is where the, where the heart and minds of people have
6725540	6731700	changed to the point that it won't matter if there's an inequality in something because
6731700	6737800	it is truly based on merit, if that makes sense, where it won't matter, but right now
6737800	6742980	we need the representation because it's not, I mean, that's where we're getting all these
6742980	6750660	angry, you know, straight white boys from, you know, is that the, and I'm going to use
6750660	6753860	the word patriarchy, is being threatened.
6753860	6759500	The status quo, their privilege is being threatened and it needs to get to the point where they
6759500	6762620	need to just accept this is the world.
6762620	6767020	And when we get to that point of acceptance, none of this representation is going to be
6767020	6771100	necessary because our hearts will already be in the right place.
6771100	6772100	That makes sense.
6772100	6773100	Yeah.
6773100	6777060	And throughout this whole dialogue, I've never said, fire the white dudes.
6777060	6780180	I want Overwatch League to be successful.
6780180	6782680	And if it's successful, guess what that means?
6782680	6788380	More teams, more space for diverse and more addition and more, you know, representation,
6788380	6789380	all that stuff.
6789380	6794340	So I didn't, you don't have to fire the dudes that are already there to make this happen
6794340	6800060	except maybe the dudes that talk a little mouthy on their Twitch, but those are exceptions
6800060	6801140	to the rule.
6801140	6804560	Many of the people in the Overwatch League are fabulous and you know, there's nothing,
6804560	6806680	you know, nothing negative to say.
6807320	6810960	But anyway, long story short, I am officially a Shanghai Dragons fan.
6810960	6811960	Woo hoo.
6811960	6812960	You know what?
6812960	6816120	I don't care that they didn't win a match because you know, their record is like zero.
6816120	6817800	It's like no wins and all losses.
6817800	6821160	And this is part of the reason why they're shifting their roster around a little bit.
6821160	6822480	But you know what?
6822480	6828860	If I live in the town of the Sacramento Kings, I'm used to cheering for the losing team.
6828860	6831560	So I am now officially a Shanghai Dragons fan.
6831560	6832560	Go dragons.
6832560	6834560	All right.
6834560	6838120	Jamie, any interest in watching a Shanghai Dragons match at some point?
6838120	6839120	Maybe.
6839120	6840120	Maybe.
6840120	6841120	Yeah, it might be fine.
6841120	6842120	I don't know.
6842120	6843120	Keep in mind how, how motion sick I get on Overwatch.
6843120	6846440	Well, the good news is when you're watching the league, they're changing things so fast
6846440	6849920	that you're looking at like overhead maps, you're looking at the arena, like you don't,
6849920	6854920	I don't think you have enough time to really be immersed in the first person stuff.
6854920	6856920	So anyhow.
6856920	6858840	I felt so sick playing Overwatch.
6858840	6859840	Yeah.
6859840	6860840	Oh my God.
6860840	6863840	DarkTetsuya with a great comment and I think we'll close on this and we'll move on to some
6863840	6865240	other Overwatch stuff.
6865240	6869560	DarkTetsuya says, I mean, look at the cast of characters in Overwatch anyway.
6869560	6872880	I'd hope that the pro leagues would reflect that as well.
6872880	6873880	Yeah.
6873880	6878960	Blizzard, Blizzard, like the best part of Overwatch is the characters.
6878960	6883960	And like, it's not, and the thing is, it's not just that they are diverse.
6883960	6888440	It's that they are diverse with awesome fucking stories.
6888440	6893640	Like there's like all the characters are awesome in Overwatch.
6893640	6897680	Everybody has written a fanfic of all of those characters having sex.
6897680	6908320	That's how beloved those characters are probably animated, drawn and performed in some circles.
6908320	6909760	I just, some anime convention.
6909760	6914320	I just wish that there were more punitive steps that could be taken against, you know,
6914320	6921380	these really toxic little boys because I can't think of them as men cause they're just toxic
6921380	6926460	little boys who have to shit on a girl who's playing better than them, right?
6926460	6930880	Or make it hard for women to go in because it's their little boys club.
6930880	6932000	Fuck your boys club.
6932000	6933000	Fuck you.
6933000	6934460	Your tongue should be cut out.
6934460	6939100	SS here, when her mat and chat says, I know plenty of women who play Overwatch to get
6939100	6942460	heckled in competitive mode by immature shits.
6942460	6948620	That that is the problem at the lowest level cause they're the lowest type of people.
6948620	6949620	No, no, it's not that.
6950100	6955740	That is the most entry level problem that has to be solved to fix what's happening here
6955740	6956920	at the top.
6956920	6961880	The answer to where are all the other women that are awesome at Overwatch?
6961880	6966340	The answer to that question starts with addressing that comment.
6966340	6969020	And that's what this all boils down to.
6969020	6970740	Anyway.
6970740	6974860	That's what, well that was actually what spawned my phrase about needing more punitive measures
6974860	6977460	just cause they're not going to learn on their own.
6977460	6981460	And clearly their parents didn't teach them how to respect women or else they wouldn't
6981460	6983960	be, you know, little shits like this.
6983960	6986000	They need to be held accountable.
6986000	6990620	There needs to be at least a way that you can block a channel from somebody or something
6990620	6991620	like that.
6991620	6995080	Cause I mean, that's half the reason why I don't play in group chats.
6995080	7001120	I play on my own and rely on, on text chat in, in game.
7001120	7003820	Because if it's not my friends, I don't trust what they're going to say.
7003820	7006940	And I honestly don't give a shit.
7006940	7011140	Backdeft in chat says, what if I want to beat that woman in the game, but because I want
7011140	7012580	to be better in the game?
7012580	7013580	Great.
7013580	7015260	You know, but there's, you'll have to talk down to her.
7015260	7016260	Yeah.
7016260	7017260	There's a difference between that.
7017260	7020020	That's the difference between sportsman like conduct and unsportsmanlike conduct.
7020020	7023860	Here's an example that I can think of to kind of relate this to things that I do on a regular
7023860	7024860	basis.
7024860	7025860	Ingress, right?
7025860	7026860	I play that a lot.
7026860	7031260	My frenemy here in the neighborhood is, you know, that plays on the other team is a woman,
7031260	7032260	you know?
7032300	7037540	I have no problem tearing down her fields and breaking her shit just before checkpoint
7037540	7041720	to, you know, make the score hurt or whatever, or make sure that, you know, her team's color
7041720	7046500	isn't over my house and stuff like that, because that at the end of the day is the game.
7046500	7051220	But I respect that she's playing the game and I don't send her nasty messages like,
7051220	7054620	you know, stupid lady, get back in the kitchen and all this.
7054620	7057180	I don't, I don't, I don't talk to her like that.
7057180	7060020	You know, that's, that's unsportsmanlike.
7060020	7064980	Whereas sportsmanlike is a little more like, you know, close but no cigar, you know, type
7064980	7070820	of things like, you know, or, you know, sometimes she gets a field off because I'm not paying
7070820	7075340	attention and, you know, oh, good job if you weren't in the kitchen, we're out here blocking
7075340	7076340	your.
7076340	7077340	Yeah.
7077340	7078340	Good job.
7078340	7079340	Wrong color.
7079340	7080340	LOL.
7080340	7084180	You know, it's, it's, well, it just makes me think of, and I had to go look up the name
7084180	7085180	of it again.
7085380	7091640	In the Olympics, you know, they have the Pierre de Colbertin medal, you know, that is right.
7091640	7094500	Like the, the Miss Congeniality medal.
7094500	7095500	Not quite.
7095500	7097860	It's for good sportsmanship.
7097860	7100500	So like, for one example,
7100500	7103260	Yay fan favorite.
7103260	7111060	Well, here's an example that like in 1964, there was a team whose bobsled missed a bolt.
7111060	7116060	So after they had their run, this other team loaned a bolt to their bobsled and the other
7116060	7117060	team won.
7117060	7121140	But, and he flat out said they didn't win because they gave them the bolt, they won
7121140	7125700	because they were faster, but that team still won, though that, that, the leader of that
7125700	7129380	team still won the, the de Colbertin award.
7129380	7131200	So you know, and it's the same thing.
7131200	7135180	We should be lifting each other up.
7135180	7140420	We should be encouraging each other and, and being a team and it makes the whole game more
7140420	7141420	fun.
7141420	7145420	And I'm not saying don't talk a little smack in the game, you know, like, Oh, I got you
7145420	7148380	now, you know, but don't be a shit.
7148380	7150020	Just don't be a shit.
7150020	7151420	Yeah.
7151420	7153620	And recognize when you're crossing the line.
7153620	7154620	You know what I mean?
7154620	7155620	Anyway.
7155620	7156620	Okay.
7156620	7157620	We've talked.
7157620	7158860	I ended this segment like three times already.
7158860	7163620	We are really moving on to the next story, but it is also about Overwatch kinda, right,
7163620	7164620	Jamie?
7164620	7165620	Yeah.
7165620	7171460	So this is about a fan project that has made some adjustments to Overwatch.
7171460	7181940	So basically, they've turned Overwatch into a fighting game and, I mean, complete with,
7181940	7185220	with finishers and all kinds of things like that.
7185220	7189980	It was, I'm trying to see who did it.
7189980	7190980	Hold on just a second.
7190980	7193700	It looks like it, TGN.
7193700	7199420	They looks like they made a video of Overwatch as a fighting game.
7199420	7201140	And so it's, it's pretty neat.
7201140	7205480	I mean, honestly, if Overwatch was a fighting game, I'd play it, but yeah, it's this Overwatch
7205480	7209180	fighter and I'll send the link into the chat.
7209180	7211220	It's on YouTube, but just look up.
7211220	7213320	What if Overwatch was a fighter?
7213320	7214320	It's pretty fun.
7214320	7216740	And that's it really.
7216740	7219020	All right.
7219020	7222300	Just a couple more stories for you guys that we're going to open up the Skype line at orange
7222300	7228180	lounge radio, all one word on Skype, but first Loki, you know what the Sims was missing
7228180	7229180	drugs.
7229180	7230180	No, it's not.
7230180	7235060	You can mod it in exactly my point.
7235060	7236060	You can mod it in.
7236060	7237060	Thank you.
7237060	7238060	I don't think I like Jamie's comment.
7238060	7239060	Got on the mic.
7239060	7240060	I don't know.
7240060	7242640	But I said, yeah, you can mod it in.
7242640	7244780	There's all sorts of stuff already modded into the Sims.
7244780	7245780	Yes.
7245780	7250300	And one of those mods is a mod by the name of base mental.
7250300	7252900	And it's a drug theme on for Sims four.
7252900	7259120	You can do different drugs, including cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines, and weed.
7259120	7263020	And you can also buy and sell and use different drugs.
7263020	7268020	And they have like even a drug dealer that's in your neighborhood that's at ABC.
7268020	7273020	And then of course, if you also are using another mod by a modern name, wicked whims,
7273020	7280220	which is a comprehensive sex mod for Sims four, you can exchange sex for drugs.
7280220	7285820	Suddenly the Sims became a lot more interesting suddenly, but this guy, the guy that actually
7285820	7291940	makes this, um, he has a Patreon and he's actually being funded almost a $6,000 a month
7291940	7293720	to work on this.
7293720	7298580	So people are interested in maybe I need to reconsider my thoughts on Patreon because
7298580	7301300	clearly I'm missing it.
7301300	7306700	I clearly, um, they had mods like this even in the first Sims, I actually still have some
7306700	7308260	mods and Sims do.
7308260	7309820	They came with their own animations.
7309820	7312860	Remember the Sims online, everybody?
7312860	7317700	I have to say based on the screenshots that I'm seeing here, that sex mod is quite comprehensive
7317700	7320940	in an almost disturbing faction.
7320940	7324500	Um, yeah, I think physic, what?
7324500	7326300	I don't even know what I'm seeing here.
7326300	7327300	This is just weird.
7327300	7328300	Okay.
7328300	7331260	Anyways, I don't know for that, but yes, the Sims four, it's a silly place.
7331260	7333140	It is a silly place.
7333140	7334140	It is a silly place.
7334140	7335140	Let's not go back there.
7335140	7336140	All right.
7336140	7337140	It's only a model.
7337460	7338460	All right.
7338460	7344220	Uh, and lastly, but certainly not leastly tonight, uh, valve has actually banned a developer
7344220	7345220	off of steam.
7345220	7346660	And why did they do it?
7346660	7350660	Because of, uh, essentially forced reviews that were, you know, you could view this as
7350660	7353900	fake, uh, in cell games was the name of the developer.
7353900	7357340	They are from Malta, uh, developing various online multiplayer titles.
7357340	7359380	Uh, they had been banned from steam.
7359380	7365060	This story comes from a Redditor, uh, who posted a leaked email, uh, from in cell game
7365060	7370500	CEO, encouraging employees to buy copies of the reimbursed wild Buster.
7370500	7374020	I think it was the game, uh, to leave a steam review.
7374020	7378180	And the email said in part quote, of course I cannot force you to write a review, let
7378180	7382720	alone tell you what to write, but I should not have to neglecting the importance of reviews
7382720	7385400	will ultimately cost jobs.
7385400	7390980	If this game fails in cell fails, and then we will all have no jobs next year.
7390980	7392660	Get what you reap what you sow.
7392660	7399660	So, well, I feel bad for all the other employees who aren't the CEO because now they're fucked
7399660	7402740	and it's their CEO, you know, was a dumb fuck.
7402740	7408720	But anyway, um, valve said it investigated the claims that were put on Reddit and identified
7408720	7412780	unacceptable behavior involving multiple steam accounts controlled by the publisher of the
7412780	7413780	game.
7413780	7417500	The publisher appears to have used multiple steam accounts to post positive reviews to
7417500	7418500	their own games.
7418500	7424580	This is a clear violation of our review policy and something we take very seriously, obviously
7424580	7431220	in cell games is not like this huge, you know, developer, but, uh, you know, it still is
7431220	7435540	certainly a precedent of sorts and hopefully other companies won't make the same mistake
7435540	7440440	in cell games did release a statement, uh, talking about this, uh, saying at the day
7440440	7444600	of launch in December, an email was sent to everyone in the company telling staff about
7444600	7449220	20 people, including freelancers, how important reviews are in the steam ecosystem.
7449220	7451360	It was meant to rally support.
7451360	7455120	It was never intended to threaten anyone, but just state the importance of reviews for
7455120	7456360	the whole company.
7456360	7459440	No staff has received penalties for not buying the game.
7459440	7463160	We apologize for the misleading wording, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7463160	7464640	I'm skipping ahead here.
7464640	7469200	Um, we hope to regain the trust of players and are in further discussion with steam about
7469200	7473480	the incident until then current steam owners or those in possession of a steam key can
7473480	7478460	continue to play normally, but it's just no longer available on the store.
7478460	7479640	What do you guys think about that?
7479640	7483740	Is that a good thing that valve smack that down or is just kind of one of those, it really
7483740	7484740	doesn't matter anyway.
7484740	7485740	Yes.
7485740	7487080	It is a good thing that they smacked it down.
7487080	7493560	I don't care what their excuses so, and it's, it is one of those things where it's like,
7493560	7497120	if it's obvious how important the reviews are, then you don't really need to say anything
7497120	7498120	at all.
7498120	7499120	Right.
7499120	7506440	Or, you know, don't go leaving all these fakie fake reviews.
7506440	7509680	So I said you reap what you sow.
7509680	7510680	All right.
7510680	7515120	Anyhow, uh, we're going to open up the Skype line, orange lounge radio, all one word on
7515120	7516120	Skype.
7516120	7518720	If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe
7518720	7523120	something else is on your mind, the Skype line is open now while we wait for a call.
7523120	7525360	I'm going to check in to see if there's any last minute stories.
7525400	7527640	Um, I don't really have anything too much.
7527640	7531920	I mean, I've, there's a new Barbie doll that's based off tomb Raider.
7531920	7532920	Okay.
7532920	7533920	That's kind of interesting.
7533920	7534920	Probably for the movie.
7534920	7535920	Yeah.
7535920	7537680	So tomb Raider Barbie is going to be 30 bucks.
7537680	7544600	Um, actually you can preorder now and yeah, she's not having a terrible day just yet,
7544600	7548320	but if in the wrong hands, she might, she could.
7548320	7549320	Yeah.
7549320	7550320	Right.
7550320	7551320	We got a call coming in, so let's get to it.
7551320	7552320	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
7552320	7553320	Who's this?
7553320	7556400	I want everyone gather around, gather around, have a drink, have a shot.
7556400	7557400	Cause it's Ron, man.
7557400	7558400	You know it.
7558400	7560480	I've already had a few drinks, but it's always a pleasure to talk to you.
7560480	7561480	Rama.
7561480	7562480	How are you?
7562480	7563480	I'm doing good.
7563480	7566160	I just finished making dinner in my amazing instant pie.
7566160	7569720	I love that little thing.
7569720	7570720	Sounds delish.
7570720	7574760	I can't wait for dinner around here, but we got to get through this show first.
7574760	7575760	What's on your mind tonight?
7575760	7576760	All right.
7576760	7582160	I want to talk about crowd funding, Patreon, all of that.
7582160	7586520	Now I've already called in about this a couple of months ago.
7586520	7590120	Y'all know how I feel about this.
7590120	7597600	And lately people have been coming to me for advice on podcasting, streaming, and so forth.
7597600	7604520	And the main piece of advice I tell people is unless you have major financial backing
7604520	7608440	behind you, just do it for the fun of it.
7608440	7609440	Just roll with it.
7609440	7611160	You'll have one listener, one streamer.
7611160	7614640	You can have tens, hundreds of streamers.
7614640	7616060	It's going to fluctuate up and down.
7616060	7622480	As long as you get out there, roll with it, have fun with it, it's going to be okay.
7622480	7626440	And then it goes to what about all the equipment that you get?
7626440	7632040	And I say, I pay out of pocket for it because this is something I want to do.
7632040	7634240	This is something that's fun.
7634240	7638680	And then it goes to what about putting yourself out there for sponsorship and stuff.
7638680	7644620	And I'm like, truthfully, most people are not going to pay to hear me foam at the mouth
7644620	7652520	about what's wrong with the cosplay and anime communities and the fandom in a whole.
7652520	7653520	You're right.
7653520	7654800	You have to have an angle.
7654800	7659000	You got to think about, and I say this a lot to people that are, I don't want to discourage
7659000	7665840	anyone from podcasting, but people that want to be successful with a podcast, think of
7665840	7670040	what is that quick 30-second elevator pitch about your show?
7670040	7673520	Can you condense that into one tagline like they do with a movie?
7673520	7676080	What's the tagline to kind of sell your show?
7676080	7680160	That's one big thing I really stress people to do with their show.
7680160	7688160	And don't, and here's my, the truth hurts, but a real friend's going to tell you this.
7688160	7694360	If your podcast tagline is, just some friends sitting around talking shit about games, cancel
7694360	7696640	your podcast immediately.
7696640	7701520	Well, I will say that there are probably a couple of people who are running with that
7701520	7705960	tagline and probably because how they're doing their show, they can get away with it.
7705960	7709420	But just because they're doing it, that doesn't mean you have to.
7709420	7713960	And also just because there are a bunch of people talking about this particular fandom
7713960	7716600	or this or that, that's not stopping you.
7716600	7718200	You can go ahead and talk about it.
7718200	7722200	Yes, there are multiple podcasts out there about anime, cosplay, whatever, but we talk
7722200	7724160	about it from a different point of view.
7724160	7728520	We're local to a particular area, so how we talk and discuss how things are could be
7728520	7731280	different from a bunch of fans doing it from California.
7731280	7735720	We have sort of like a sister podcast called Zero Hour, similar to us, but they're based
7735720	7736720	out of California.
7736720	7739960	Their experiences are different from ours and we're out of New York.
7739960	7743640	And they don't do the Patreon, they pay out of pocket like we do.
7743640	7749040	Now they have this thing called Ko-Fi, you know, if you like us, buy us a cup of coffee.
7749040	7750280	That I can get with.
7750280	7753120	You don't have to make promises or anything like that.
7753400	7754400	It's a tip jar.
7754400	7756240	You like us, buy us a cup of coffee.
7756240	7759400	I kind of like that, you know, because that's similar to the Twitch model.
7759400	7760540	Show me your biddies.
7760540	7763720	If you like, you know, me playing the game, show me, show me your biddies.
7763720	7764720	Exactly.
7764720	7765720	Yeah.
7765720	7768040	Oh, and the only thing and the thing I want to, you know, make sure I'm clarified with
7768040	7771320	my statement, because I would never tell anyone not to podcast.
7771320	7775320	But the reason why I say if your tagline is four people talking shit about video games
7775320	7779320	or whatever it is and why just don't fucking do that show is because in part of what you
7779320	7782520	said is that there's already a bunch of shows that are doing that angle.
7782520	7787960	But at the same time, like if your podcast is a fan podcast, then sitting around talking
7787960	7791480	shit is does not make you that great of a fan.
7791480	7797000	There's a difference between being critical and talking shit.
7797000	7803080	That's why I don't give the podcast critical myth any blowback, because there's nothing
7803080	7805960	wrong with taking a critical eye to fan them.
7805960	7808760	But that's very, very different than talking shit.
7808760	7810000	Does that make sense?
7810000	7811000	Exactly.
7811000	7812000	Yeah.
7812000	7816760	So if that's I mean, that that's why I think a tagline like sitting around talking shit
7816760	7819960	is kind of a lazy tagline.
7819960	7824540	And then the other one that I'm just again, honest truth.
7824540	7832960	It's like the view, but with gay guys don't don't be only because that one isn't so bad
7832960	7838360	in the fact of like, wait, but it's just that that that's like every show with several gay
7838360	7840800	co if it's the view with gay guy.
7840800	7842240	No, I'm going to need some.
7842240	7845480	I'm going to need a more specific answer.
7845480	7846480	See that.
7846480	7847480	I'm sorry.
7847480	7848480	What was that wrong?
7848480	7849840	You got cut out there?
7849840	7850840	Sorry.
7850840	7852840	That reminds me of a question.
7852840	7854400	Yeah.
7854400	7860560	I need to know is shaking and crying the spiritual successor to guys on the show?
7860560	7861560	No it is not.
7861560	7862560	OK.
7862560	7863840	It is not that.
7863840	7866580	No, because guys on the show is on hiatus.
7866580	7868960	It is not over.
7868960	7872840	And you know, just Extfer and Victoria are two different people.
7872840	7876080	And I've just really tried to kind of give the show sort of a different flow to it.
7876080	7882600	I think it kind of feels like a successor because, oh, it's Rob's non gaming show.
7882600	7887040	But there's room for both in the world if it ever works out that Extfer and I can do
7887040	7888040	a show again.
7888040	7894200	Fair enough, because I'm looking forward to that, too.
7894200	7898720	And then Bobby, Bobby's disagreeing with me in chat saying, no, Rob, I was told that negativity
7898720	7900000	is funny.
7900000	7901680	People who are positive are boring.
7901680	7904400	You have to be negative to be entertaining and funny.
7904400	7907080	I got this lecture last year.
7907080	7910100	And then and why everyone loves Loki rants.
7910100	7911100	They're funny.
7911100	7912100	OK.
7912100	7915440	But and I'm almost positive I said this to you then.
7915440	7921380	The thing with the Loki rants is, again, I go back to my Tyra Banks top model things.
7921380	7923600	Do you like Nintendo games, Loki?
7923600	7924600	Sure.
7924600	7928680	See, that's the difference there is that, you know, at the end of the day, Loki gets
7928680	7933200	frustrated because he sees Nintendo is like should be kind of grabbing on all the latest
7933200	7934200	and greatest technologies.
7934200	7935800	And I see all these other companies do these things.
7935800	7936800	And why not?
7936800	7940800	And that's kind of different than like I fucking hate Nintendo and Nintendo.
7940800	7944480	Everybody there is, you know, sucking 20 dicks and like all this stupid stuff.
7944480	7947480	Well, that would explain why they're too busy to get networking working.
7947480	7949320	Some people do like sucking that much dick.
7949320	7950320	I'm just saying.
7950320	7951760	But anyway, that's that's the difference.
7951760	7955420	And I, I realize there's other people out there saying something different.
7955420	7957300	I disagree.
7957300	7960620	And those negative shows are things I don't want to watch.
7960620	7964540	And I don't watch that YouTube channel you cited.
7964540	7966540	But you know, what do I know?
7966540	7970680	I've had this podcast for 15 years and we don't have squatty potty advertisements.
7970680	7972860	So maybe I've got it all wrong.
7972860	7975180	But I like to think at the end of the day, I'm doing a good thing.
7975180	7978300	Well, I think you do because it was for your show.
7978300	7982740	I wouldn't have my podcast and I wouldn't have like two other spin off shows I've been
7982740	7983740	working on.
7983740	7989180	One of the podcasts we do, we talk about, yeah, we kind of go into a negative aspect
7989180	7993940	because we feel our opinions or whatever it is, no one hears it.
7993940	7999980	So we just go out there is like, well, if 85 percent of people say this is great and
7999980	8004580	we're at 50 percent says, no, this is trash, we're going to tell you why.
8004580	8009020	It's like, OK, now you're going to kind of listen and be like, OK, here you go.
8009020	8010020	Yeah.
8010020	8012980	And to be fair, Bobby points out in chat.
8012980	8014260	I was setting you up.
8014260	8015260	This is the set up.
8015260	8016680	And then Rob hits it over the net.
8016680	8020740	You did tell me this in person that, Bobby, I'm three drinks in.
8020740	8024300	I'm a little slow tonight, sorry.
8024300	8028840	But thank you for the set up anyway.
8028840	8032700	And I agree with that Akuma JP is saying, I think you say it very succinctly here.
8032700	8035780	If you do it just because negative, then no.
8035780	8036900	And that and that's the difference.
8036900	8041980	If you're doing a show to be negative, no, don't do it.
8041980	8044660	Or do a show about something you do like.
8044660	8045660	That's all.
8045660	8046660	Anyway.
8046660	8049300	Good times with soap boxes, Rama.
8049300	8050580	Well, I try.
8050580	8051580	All right.
8051580	8053900	I'm going to let you go so we try to squeeze in some more calls.
8053900	8054900	But take care.
8054900	8059940	And of course, support indie radio such as anime jam session Tuesday nights here at Vogue.
8059940	8060940	That's right.
8060940	8061940	All right.
8061940	8062940	Take care.
8062940	8063940	Remember, pre shows 915.
8063940	8064940	We go live at 930.
8064940	8065940	OK.
8065940	8066940	Fair enough.
8066940	8067940	Take care, my friend.
8067940	8068940	Take care, bro.
8068940	8070940	Bye bye.
8070940	8071940	Phones are lighting up tonight.
8071940	8072940	Let's get to it.
8072940	8073940	Hi.
8073940	8074940	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8074940	8075940	Who's this?
8075940	8076940	Hey, what's up, guys?
8076940	8077940	It's Kajuno.
8077940	8078940	You can hear me?
8078940	8079940	Yeah.
8079940	8080940	We can hear you.
8080940	8081940	Long time.
8081940	8082940	What's up, Kajuno?
8082940	8083940	Thank you.
8083940	8084940	Thank you so much.
8084940	8085940	I'm using this little microphone, so I'm sure you can hear me.
8085940	8086940	Yeah.
8086940	8087940	I just wanted to point something out real quickly, and then I'll let you guys get to
8087940	8088940	some more calls.
8088940	8094460	You mentioned that Nintendo is looking for a Wii Sports for VR.
8094460	8097940	And I just want to tell you, Wreck Room is like the Wii Sports for VR.
8097940	8099620	That thing is so much fun.
8099620	8100620	It's a free game.
8100620	8104740	So maybe that's why people aren't really taking that much notice to it.
8104740	8106900	But I mean, this thing is fun.
8106900	8111900	You're playing laser tag in there, you're playing paintball, they have a room for charades,
8111900	8113740	which is freaking hilarious.
8113740	8117460	When you play charades, you're actually using, I don't know what you would call this, this
8117460	8121020	type of gun that you have that squirts out this foam.
8121020	8126580	So you're drawing things in the third dimension, which is really hilarious.
8126580	8130620	And the only game I would say that doesn't work in it is that they have some type of
8130620	8136060	soccer game that, I don't know what the hell I'm doing in that game, but they have dodgeball.
8136060	8139700	They also have some little RPG stuff you can go through in there, where they have a thing
8139700	8147700	where it's like a four-man RP group, and you're going through this room, and somebody has
8147700	8151460	a sword, somebody has a bow and arrow, and you're fighting these monsters.
8151460	8155700	They have a pirate ship thing coming up, where it's going to have a pirate theme.
8155700	8159380	I mean, they're just knocking out the park with this game, I mean, there's so much in
8159380	8160380	this game.
8160380	8161380	A lot.
8161380	8165780	It's a community game, so it's social, everyone's talking, everyone's having fun.
8165780	8170140	I appreciate what you're doing here with the recommendation, and it does sound like it's
8170140	8174740	an awesome game, but to go back with the whole thing about why I brought up Wii Sports in
8174740	8181820	particular, it's not quite that literal, where it's the collection of mini games and so forth.
8181820	8189060	It's more that the Wii Sports was the app, it was the thing that really showed off why
8189060	8195060	you would swing around and flail in your own home, and why you needed specifically the
8195060	8199180	Wii, and not PlayStation 3 and not Xbox 360.
8199180	8202940	You needed a Wii, because that was the only way you were going to actually swing that
8202940	8209020	tennis racket into your hand, and so many people who bought the Wii, they weren't buying
8209020	8212620	the Wii as much as they were buying Wii Sports.
8212620	8218340	In a very similar way, in some ways, that many people who bought the Switch weren't
8218340	8221580	just buying the Switch, they were buying Breath of the Wild.
8221580	8231660	And I completely understand that Breath of the Wild was also on Wii U, but for so many
8231660	8236500	people that skipped the Wii U and kind of never really understood that it was separate
8236500	8242900	from the Wii and all that stuff, Breath of the Wild was really a breath of fresh air
8242900	8247460	in many ways for Zelda fans, and the fact that you could do it portable and everything,
8247460	8249160	that's what people were buying.
8249160	8252820	So what VR needs, is it needs whatever it is.
8252820	8259380	Yeah, I didn't mean to cut you off, but I do have another point to make there.
8259380	8264580	But yeah, I totally get what you're saying about why it's not necessarily the sports
8264580	8268420	aspect of the game that brought people into it, it's just that it kind of demonstrated
8268420	8272460	like all the things you can do on the Wii, and that's exactly what Rec Room does.
8272460	8277900	Like it's not so much that it's comparison with the Wii Sports because they have sports
8277900	8284580	games in it, it's just that it kind of demos all the possibilities you can have in VR,
8284580	8288100	the social, being in a room where like, I guess I think it's like maybe 10 people can
8288100	8289100	fit in a room.
8289100	8293100	So it's like 10 of you inside of Rec Room, they also have like a private room that you
8293100	8296620	can create your own room, they have some type of new logic system that they just created
8296620	8303140	where it's kind of like a take on the Labo thing from Nintendo, where you can make things
8303140	8306860	within the world now and just kind of make your own little mini games and little robots
8306860	8307860	and crap.
8307860	8313540	And I mean, it's just so much, like I said, it kind of just demonstrates every possible
8313540	8318980	thing you can do in VR and you just have a good old time with it, so I still think it
8318980	8323500	is that app that everyone's looking for to make them buy VR.
8323500	8327100	Only thing is, you know, if somebody's like a graphic junkie, you know, they may run away
8327100	8331660	from it because it's not the prettiest game in the world, but if you can overlook that,
8331660	8335020	I mean, you're in for a treat because this one is the best game I ever played.
8335020	8339460	Alright, so fair enough, maybe it's not the mascot game now, but maybe people should give
8339460	8340820	it another look and it should be.
8340820	8342460	I can respect that angle.
8342460	8343460	Yeah, definitely good.
8343460	8344460	Alright.
8344460	8347580	So I'll let you get to some calls, and great show as always.
8347580	8348580	Thank you.
8349180	8353820	Alright, I'm trying to cut myself off for the evening just in case I need to go out
8353820	8354820	later.
8354820	8355820	I'm cut off for now.
8355820	8356820	So thank you, my friend.
8356820	8357820	Take care.
8357820	8358820	Alright.
8358820	8359820	Bye.
8359820	8360820	Alright.
8360820	8362940	Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
8362940	8367700	I saw some other calls trying to get in, so go ahead and try to give us a call.
8367700	8369860	There it is, lighting up again.
8369860	8372740	Some weeks I'm begging for phone calls, some weeks it's ringing off the hook.
8372740	8373740	Excuse me.
8373740	8374740	Hello.
8374740	8375740	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8375740	8376740	Who's this?
8376740	8377740	Hey, this is Akdeft.
8377900	8378900	Hey, Akdeft.
8378900	8379900	What's up, buddy?
8379900	8386420	Well, I wanted to call last week, but I couldn't, it was kind of late.
8386420	8392860	And I forgot to make an email about this, but about the evil lineup that was announced
8392860	8393860	last week.
8393860	8398820	Oh yeah, we got to that in rapid fire news, and there was a lot of people, well I don't
8398820	8404500	know about a lot, but certainly people noticed that Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite was not there.
8405260	8411140	Yeah, but that was kind of expected, because the game isn't doing that great, even the
8411140	8417540	community isn't playing that much, and the competition for that is kind of dead.
8417540	8423140	But I don't want to talk about, necessarily, Marvel, but the Smash Bros. in L.A.
8423140	8424140	Oh, okay.
8424140	8425740	What's on your mind?
8425740	8430540	That game needs to die.
8430540	8433440	Like seriously, needs to die.
8433440	8440060	So you're not a fan of the game still showing up, even though we're now on what Smash Bros.
8440060	8446520	for 3DS and Wii U, and probably, honestly, there's a real good chance at E3 this year,
8446520	8449800	we're going to see something about Smash Bros. on the Switch, and they'll still be playing
8449800	8451240	it on the GameCube.
8451240	8458360	Yeah, I don't know, I moved on from L.A. like really, really long time ago, especially because
8458360	8465400	the Smash for Wii U and 3DS, it's like really good, it's like the best Smash up to date.
8465400	8471960	But the thing with Smash Melee is, I don't know how the competitive scenes managed to
8471960	8480480	keep even growing, because it has grown in the last few years, and managed to get that
8480480	8488560	tons of views, even despite the game getting really boring, really stale, because you see
8488560	8500560	the same characters, basically, aside from someone like Hungrybox, or other people like,
8500560	8506840	I'm trying to remember someone, but someone that uses Ice Climbers, or even Armada that
8506840	8511000	switches from Fox to Peach.
8511000	8515880	I think the fact that Twitch is around now, and it wasn't around when the GameCube was
8515880	8521960	first out, like maybe that is kind of lending itself to why what's old is new again, in
8521960	8525680	a way, but who knows how long that wave's going to last.
8525680	8529080	But you know, at Def, there's many people that just suspect that whatever we're going
8529080	8533560	to get on the Switch is just going to be the Wii U Smash Bros. with some tweaks, but what
8533560	8539560	if the joke is, at Def, that it's Super Smash Bros. Melee for Switch?
8539560	8540560	Shut up.
8540560	8547900	That's okay, they'll never do backwards compatibility.
8547900	8550040	Thank god for that.
8550040	8552360	I love when the listeners tell me to shut up.
8552360	8553760	Oh, Rob.
8553760	8556400	Well then what's the point of me talking?
8556400	8561000	No, but that would be, I'm sorry, I can't help myself, I can't help myself.
8561000	8567440	But seriously, even with Twitch, or without it, you see in the local competitive scenes
8567440	8575800	in many places that Melee is the one that pretty much has the people.
8575800	8582640	And again, despite the game getting really boring, seriously, if you have paid attention
8582640	8591960	to the latest or the last few tournaments, like really big tournaments, for that game,
8591960	8597240	it's like almost every single people uses the same character, which is Fox, because
8597240	8601620	it is obviously the best character because it's really broken.
8601620	8608680	But that makes the game really boring to see through Watch, which is kind of what happened
8608680	8615080	to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, because the game was also getting really boring.
8615080	8621120	And last year even, the game wasn't even supposed to be on Evo, but because of donations
8621120	8633160	and something, they did the donations thing for like nine games, and the one who, or the
8633160	8641040	community who donated the most, had their game on Evo.
8641040	8647040	And only because of that, because even like, it was close to losing to Pokken last year,
8647040	8650160	like $1,000 short.
8650160	8656440	But with Melee, the only thing that justifies it is because it gets the views.
8656440	8664000	Even more than Street Fighter V, which is the main tournament at Evo, it gets more viewers.
8664000	8669440	And again, I don't know why, I even pretty much promised myself that I wouldn't watch
8669440	8674480	the Melee tournament, even the top eight, because I really don't want to support that
8674480	8676000	game anymore.
8676000	8682760	I want to, for the community as a whole, the Smash Bros. community, not Melee, not Smash
8682760	8687960	War, Brawl, whatever, I want the community as a whole to grow.
8687960	8695200	And that's the thing, Smash War is getting stale too, because many people are dropping
8695200	8699480	it or are moving to other stuff.
8699480	8705640	So I would rather for the people to, for the community to, okay, let's move to this game,
8705640	8710680	which is the most recent, and just wait for Nintendo to announce the Switch one.
8710680	8716040	So that's probably going to come, at least an announcement this year, like you said.
8716040	8726560	But again, I really want this year to be the last one I see Melee on Evo's roster, because
8726560	8728360	it really, really needs to die.
8728360	8733320	At the end of the day, Akdeft, at the end of the day, honestly, some things just can't
8733320	8739120	be explained, and it may also be part of that same phenomenon as to, why did we bring back
8739120	8745600	Will and Grace, and The X-Files, and Roseanne, and all these shows of the 90s are all of
8745600	8747120	a sudden coming back.
8747120	8751880	And some are just as good as they were, like Twin Peaks I thought was just as good as it
8751880	8753040	ever was.
8753040	8757400	Some are not quite as good as they were, you know what I mean?
8757400	8762180	Maybe it's something to do when it comes to Melee about, this is the game I grew up on,
8762180	8766440	this is my comfort zone, and I don't like new, I don't like change.
8766440	8773620	And so maybe some people just have a hard time letting that go.
8773620	8784800	And I know that, because it's Nintendo, and they also pretty much use nostalgia for it.
8784800	8793920	And again, while I get mad at a Melee HD remake, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo does something
8793920	8795180	like that.
8795180	8802720	I wouldn't mind it either, if they actually balanced it, and make it actually better.
8802720	8807600	But if they make the same game, if it stays the same, why bother?
8807600	8809560	Like really, why bother?
8809560	8814000	Well maybe there's some, and S2100Matt in chat says, let's see if ACT gets hate mail
8814000	8815640	in the mailbag.
8815640	8817480	Let's see, let's see.
8817480	8821780	If you are still a fond fan of Melee, tell us about why this game still deserves its
8821780	8823560	time in the spotlight.
8823560	8825620	Send us an email, we'd love to read it on air.
8825620	8830500	So we'll act deaf for now, I'm gonna let you go, but I appreciate your passionate opinions.
8830500	8832940	Hey, thanks for having me, like always.
8832940	8836820	Thank you, take care buddy.
8836820	8840580	Kaijuto in chat says, it's not official 90s until they bring back Martin.
8840580	8842220	I heard they were.
8842220	8844680	I heard Martin was coming back.
8844680	8845980	Wasn't that supposed to be like a thing?
8845980	8847020	I haven't heard that.
8847020	8848980	I thought for sure I heard somewhere that Martin-
8848980	8851140	I know, I'm sure as hell not watching Roseanne.
8851140	8853320	Yeah, Roseanne kind of-
8853320	8854320	Unfortunately-
8854320	8856460	Although God and Jackie was so good in that movie.
8856460	8860580	I'm gonna have to watch it because my wife adores Roseanne and so, you know.
8860580	8865780	Yeah, but she knows Roseanne's gone a little, you know, cuckoo in the past few years, right?
8865780	8866780	No.
8866780	8869260	Having her as a dump supporter.
8869260	8871740	So it's just, yeah, anyway.
8871740	8874300	Yeah, Ramas in chat says it is coming back.
8874300	8877220	That's when I thought I heard that Martin was coming back, can you believe that?
8877220	8880620	Now I say it isn't the 90s until In Living Color comes back.
8880620	8883600	I was just gonna say, why don't we bring back In Living Color?
8883600	8886720	If you want to talk about the definitive Fox television program-
8886720	8887720	That shit was awesome.
8887720	8889240	From the 90s, it was In Living Color.
8889240	8893120	But then would it be all this, oh my God, can you imagine if they could get like Jim
8893120	8898120	Carrey and all the Wayans family and like all of them back?
8898120	8900920	Not so much Jim Carrey, but like what the hell are the Wayans doing?
8900920	8902320	Why not get Jim Carrey?
8902320	8909120	Like if it is a super limited like four episode, six episode thing, why the fuck not get Jim
8909120	8910120	Carrey?
8910120	8913340	He's like, he's eccentric now and just like, I don't think, yeah.
8913340	8915220	He could do like, he could do like one sketch.
8915220	8917100	I would love to see that, but-
8917100	8918660	We just need him to bring back Vera.
8918660	8923560	Have him do Fire Marshal, Bill, or Vera like one time and that's all you need.
8923560	8925580	Like and then they put his name on it and at least he's a part of it.
8925580	8929620	But like they couldn't do like half the sketches that they did before because they're so like
8929620	8932060	quote unquote offensive nowadays, like handy man.
8932060	8934060	I would still laugh at men on film.
8934060	8935060	That shit was funny.
8935060	8936060	I'm sorry.
8936060	8937220	I would still laugh.
8937220	8939940	But you're right, like humor has changed a bit.
8939940	8943600	So they might have to write the show a different way, but I bet it would still be funny.
8943600	8944600	I don't know.
8944600	8945600	Maybe not.
8945600	8947360	Maybe some things are best left in the past.
8947360	8950440	Bring back mad TV while we're at it, I guess.
8950440	8953640	Oh, Kaishudo in chat says Wayans brothers were pushed out.
8953640	8956600	I'm sure they can't bring it back cause someone else owns it.
8956600	8957600	That's right.
8957600	8960620	Cause what wasn't like the last season of In Living Color was like kind of a shadow
8960620	8962000	of its former self.
8962000	8963600	Like didn't it kind of, I don't know.
8963600	8964600	Yeah.
8964600	8968540	I think there were some problems towards the end, but most of us don't remember that cause
8968540	8973000	we stopped watching In Living Color after like four, four years or so.
8973000	8977800	So uh, Tiger Claw in chat says Jamie Foxx as Wanda.
8977800	8978800	Remember those skits?
8978800	8979800	Oh yeah.
8979800	8980800	I'm gonna rock your world.
8980800	8986040	Uh, and Homie the Clown, Hamon, God, that was some classic television.
8986040	8987040	Of course.
8987040	8992040	I also have a lot of love for Saturday Night Live, you know, especially in those same years
8992040	8996840	were like, like, you know, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, like all those, you know, 1994 era.
8996840	8997840	Oh yeah.
8997840	8999660	Phil Hartman, rest in peace.
8999660	9003060	Like, you know, just some of the most amazing performers.
9003060	9008940	So the nineties were a great time for comedy, but, but who knows, maybe there's a caller
9008940	9012660	into some comedy podcasts out there that's like, get over the nineties comedy.
9012660	9014020	It wasn't that funny.
9014020	9015500	Who knows?
9015500	9016500	I don't know.
9016500	9017500	I don't know.
9017500	9021180	Uh, I'll put out one more shout out for the call in line, Orange Lounge Radio, all one
9021180	9022780	word on Skype.
9022780	9025140	If you want to call in and say hello to us.
9025320	9029520	Uh, JD in chat says, I remember Full House, but that's already come back.
9029520	9030520	Yeah.
9030520	9033880	God, they're on like fourth or fifth season of that Fuller House.
9033880	9036920	Netflix sure changed the game, didn't it?
9036920	9039740	Still don't know if I want to watch it.
9039740	9042180	It's Fuller House.
9042180	9044800	Just cause Candace Cameron.
9044800	9049200	If you could just kind of like, you know, like realize she's already been paid for it
9049200	9051480	and it's, it's not going to change anything.
9051500	9056180	It's one of those things where it's like, if you know exactly what you're signing up
9056180	9064140	to watch and that is a cheesy fucking TGIF comedy, cause those shows were so stupid.
9064140	9065140	They were.
9065140	9067300	But like they were so stupid, they were funny.
9067300	9071020	And that's exactly what like Fuller House is, is it kind of maintains that same level
9071020	9072460	of comedy.
9072460	9079220	So um, now the, the one Netflix show I hear is really good that I had no interest in watching
9079400	9081920	because I was like, why do you reboot this show?
9081920	9085840	But apparently one day at a time, everybody tells me is amazing on Netflix.
9085840	9086840	Oh, huh.
9086840	9087840	I didn't even know they did.
9087840	9088840	They were doing that one.
9088840	9089840	Yeah, they did.
9089840	9093120	Except they reimagined it as a, I believe it's an all Latino family this time.
9093120	9094120	Huh?
9094120	9098920	So, um, but yeah, and that was a show that was on like, I remember it on like Nickelodeon
9098920	9104000	at night because, or, or one of those like maybe syndicated on channel 58 or one of those
9104000	9108320	networks before they were the WB and that stuff like during the day because like those
9108340	9109860	shows were on like the early seventies.
9109860	9110860	Right.
9110860	9111860	One day at a time.
9111860	9112860	Huh.
9112860	9113860	Interesting.
9113860	9114860	Yeah.
9114860	9115860	Yeah.
9115860	9120300	Now that original one was like on in 1975 and it had, um, Valerie Bertinelli in it.
9120300	9121300	That's right.
9121300	9122300	It was a Valerie Bertinelli show.
9122300	9123300	Yeah.
9123300	9127860	Cause then Valerie Bertinelli went on to do Valerie's family, right?
9127860	9130060	She got her own show with Valerie's family.
9130060	9133740	And then there was like a fight between her and the producers and they fucking killed
9133740	9134740	her character.
9134740	9135740	Mackenzie Phillips.
9135740	9137900	And renamed the show, the Hogan family.
9137900	9138900	I remember.
9138900	9139900	Yeah.
9139900	9140900	It was Sandy Duncan.
9140900	9141900	And then the show kind of really took off.
9141900	9145440	Most people remember that show as the Hogan family, not as Valerie's family.
9145440	9148640	But I had forgotten that Mackenzie Phillips was also in it too.
9148640	9149640	Yeah.
9149640	9150640	Oh yeah.
9150640	9151640	Oh yeah.
9151640	9152640	One day at a time.
9152640	9153640	Wasn't that a, uh, what's his name?
9153640	9154920	Bonnie Franklin was the mom and she's dead.
9154920	9162280	That ultra famous producer of all those fucking shows like, uh, uh, uh, oh my God.
9162280	9163280	Those were the days.
9163280	9164280	All in the family.
9164280	9165280	All in the family.
9165280	9168540	Done by, uh, crap.
9168540	9169740	I just had Norman Lear.
9169740	9170740	Norman Lear.
9170740	9171740	Thank God.
9171740	9172740	I'm like, you're killing me Smalls.
9172740	9173740	No, I couldn't remember either.
9173740	9175540	Norman Lear did one day at a time, right?
9175540	9176540	Yeah.
9176540	9178300	I think he's doing this new one too.
9178300	9179500	Oh, interesting.
9179500	9183500	Because I think he was on another podcast promoting it and that's how I heard that it
9183500	9184500	was happening.
9184500	9185500	Yeah.
9185500	9188740	But one thing I've always liked about Norman Lear shows is that he tackled massive social
9188740	9191940	issues and was really progressive.
9191940	9196240	But you want to talk about something, Loki, that would be really offensive by today's
9196240	9197240	terms.
9197240	9198240	Go back and look at all in the family.
9198240	9199240	Yes.
9199240	9200240	Holy shit.
9200240	9201240	Like, but that-
9201240	9206840	But a lot of the show was challenging Archie's, you know, uh, prejudices.
9206840	9207840	Yeah.
9207840	9208840	Yeah.
9208840	9210800	With, without all in the family, we wouldn't have had Maude.
9210800	9211800	Yeah.
9211800	9219120	Well, Bea Arthur is a, well, I know she's literally a goddess now ascended to the heavens.
9219120	9221280	I hope Bea Arthur is watching over us now.
9221280	9224820	And I'm sorry, I'm on my wine break.
9224820	9226840	All right.
9226840	9230660	We know what movie that's from, right?
9230660	9231660	History of the World.
9231660	9232660	Oh, of course.
9232660	9233660	Of course.
9233660	9236460	Cause she played the unemployment lady.
9236460	9242020	I'm trying to remember if it was that or one of the other Mel Brooks movies.
9242020	9243020	I'm three glasses in.
9243020	9244020	It's all a blur.
9244020	9245020	All right.
9245020	9247860	Anyway, nobody else is calling in on Skype, so I think that's going to wrap it up for
9247860	9253520	all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, uh, tonight.
9253520	9256880	But we, of course, we can't end the show until we get everybody's final thoughts.
9256880	9259000	So we're going to go around the room and get the final thoughts.
9259000	9262000	Of course, I'm going to say to you guys, as I do every week, thank you so much for tuning
9262000	9267520	in and getting through this episode of Orange Lounge Radio, which was full of wine and tangents.
9267520	9268520	And uh-
9268520	9269520	I didn't have a lot of wine myself.
9269520	9270520	Well, I sure did.
9270520	9274080	Uh, but I want to thank you guys, of course, for tuning in and listening and supporting
9274080	9275080	the show.
9275080	9277680	You know, as we ask here at Orange Lounge Radio every week, if you enjoyed the show,
9277700	9279560	please tell a friend or two about the show.
9279560	9282860	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only
9282860	9284860	if the voices are here to air.
9284860	9288140	So please tell the friend about the show.
9288140	9293260	You can also leave a five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play Podcast.
9293260	9299460	Those reviews help a lot, let me tell you, so podcasts really value that stuff.
9299460	9303300	I think that's all I can think of, so let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9303300	9304820	I'll start tonight.
9304820	9309500	My final thought is, I didn't mention during my gaming week that I was still playing Pokemon
9309500	9313160	Red or no, I'm sorry, Pokemon Yellow.
9313160	9318700	And I'm going to play some more Pokemon Yellow, I think, because I'm going to get those Pokemon
9318700	9325320	in the Pokemon bank for hopefully Gen 8 so I can play Gen 8 with Gen 1 Pokemon because
9325320	9326320	that's me.
9326320	9328840	Uh, Dark Soccer, your final thought?
9328840	9335620	If I'm not super exhausted after work, I plan on streaming, so, um, it's, uh, I think my
9335620	9341560	channel is DarkSakura underscore O-L-R, so I think you're right.
9341560	9345280	So just hang out or something and subscribe, please.
9345280	9346280	Awesome.
9346280	9347840	Because I said so.
9347840	9350320	And last but certainly not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9350320	9352040	I should probably stream something someday.
9352040	9354840	I have so many things I could stream.
9354840	9357600	Why don't you point a camera at your cabinet?
9357600	9362200	Um, because I don't really have a camera that I can point at the cabinet.
9362200	9363720	I have my old USB.
9363720	9370520	I have like, I have like an old like, um, Sony Handycam that does HD, but like, I don't
9370520	9374960	know about getting that to like actual video and who would want to watch me play?
9374960	9379600	It's the lighting's not good because I only have one light, one fluorescent light in there
9379600	9389720	and no one wants to see me out of shape trying to play, you know, standard difficulty songs.
9389720	9390960	No one wants to watch that.
9390960	9391960	Bobby Blackwolf in chat.
9391960	9393600	I'm hearing excuses.
9393600	9394600	Me too.
9394600	9401520	No, I meant like a non like DDR, you know, like I, like I could play like you could stream
9401520	9406100	yourself programming a game.
9406100	9409300	That's also not real fun to watch right now, but yes.
9409300	9411020	I could do that.
9411020	9415500	Like if I was actually talented, I could do that.
9415500	9416500	Yes.
9416500	9417500	You are talented.
9417500	9418940	Everybody's talented in their own way.
9418940	9419940	All right.
9419940	9423020	Uh, that's going to do it for another night here at orange lounge radio.
