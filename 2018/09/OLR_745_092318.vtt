Live tonight September the 23rd, 2018

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Episode number 745 of our show

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
My name's Rob Roberts joining you live here from our headquarters in Sacramento, California

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
with my co-host as he's been every week here lately

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm good

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
So no food tonight, this diet thing you've been on is like a serious thing

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
It's not that, I mean

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Well I see you have like a protein shake, you're doing the same thing my husband does

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
No, it's just I ate lunch late, I cooked, I had some chicken I bought last week so I had to cook it before it went bad

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
And so I ate that for lunch at like 2.33 so I mean

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
It's kind of too early to eat again and I thought well I can have like a taco or something like that

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
But it was a chicken taco, I'm like I just ate chicken, I don't really want to eat that again

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
So I don't know

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
The last few days I've been trying to come in under a thousand calories under my already 500 calorie

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Under my limit of what I'm supposed to eat

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Well just don't overdo it with some of those cutting corners

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
Well like yesterday I ate a whole pizza so then I had to play DDR for 90 minutes straight

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
So maybe it's like a weekly budget, I see how it goes

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
No no no, that was just a slip but no

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
Lately it's been, because I got a Fitbit for my birthday so I've been doing a lot more walking

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
So I walk 3 miles a day, well during the week, not necessarily on the weekends because I don't have time for that

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
The 3 miles during the day, I fast for 16 hours up until about 1pm

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
So I don't eat until 1pm and then I go for a 3 mile walk and then I pick up lunch

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
And I come back and then I come home after all that and then I play DDR for another 30 minutes or so

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
So for those that, you know, I don't think we've talked about this in quite a while but

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Loki's really like slimmed down, I know it's a radio show at least for now

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I mean we talked about how we're going to move to Twitch eventually but

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Because I bought new pants is why, because these pants actually fit and not the other ones

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
The other ones are really baggy and like were too big

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You've really slimmed down though, you've really slimmed down

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
I really haven't, I mean thank you but the scale says otherwise

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Well since you started this whole thing, I don't mean like in the past week or two

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I mean since you started this whole thing, anyway

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
We're keeping somebody waiting over there, unfortunately we've missed her these past few weeks

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
But she's back to terrorize us once again, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm overwhelmed by being back

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And all of the stuff that Ikuma sent us

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh yes, so right before the show, one of our pals from overseas, Akuma JP, shout out

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Sent a little care package

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
A little?

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
It ended up being a big care package, so a big thank you to Akuma JP and all these little

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
You can send him all the pumpkin spice things

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
I don't know if pumpkin spice is as big as a thing, but you can get kapocha

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
That's what I could send him in return, I could say here's a little taste of America

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
And just do like all the pumpkin spice garbage

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Send him the ultimate white girl fantasy?

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Yes, ultimate like now Akuma JP I know it's your fantasy to be a basic bitch, so here you go

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
That was like that Cinderella meme, it was like at midnight your character turns back into a pumpkin

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yes bitch

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
That is me, here's the thing

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Here's the thing, it's not that like I'm obsessed with pumpkin spice

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
I think I'm just the only one in the group of friends that's like willing to admit it

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Like fuck yes I'm excited pumpkin spice is in season

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Hell yes I'm gonna order a pumpkin spice latte

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
You know why? Because pumpkin spice lattes are fucking good

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm gonna be making pumpkin bread

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And so I get teased for being that bitch

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I'm not making it sweet

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I like a lot of different food

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Anyway it's not the food podcast Dark Sakura

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Yes it is

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I actually

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I just ate filet mignon and it was great

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Want me to talk about meat and potatoes? The meat and potato show

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Have sweet potato, eat it

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I need to go to our social media because over on Twitter

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
At twitter.com slash olr

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I actually asked the listeners

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I gave Twitter a little love and I said

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
She's in the studio tonight on a brief reprieve from her work schedule

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Which of these recent headlines from the shows she's missed

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Should Rob ask her about right at the top of the show

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
So you ready for what the listeners picked

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
For the video game topic that you've missed that we need to get into

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
With 87% of the vote

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
What are your thoughts on the new Animal Crossing game for Nintendo Switch being announced

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
It must happen, I need it

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
And it has to be as great as New Leaf was

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And I have to be able to have

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Going to all the villages and changing their shit

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And planting stuff

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I want more black tulips

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And I want to be able to murder Tom Nook in his sleep

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
How about bug net violence

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I want to be able to kick people out of my village

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Banish people from the village

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I want to banish people from my village

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Do you want witch trials

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
No not that bad I just want to kick Ed out when he shows up

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
You know I create backstories for all the characters in the game

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
It's not the Animal Crossing game that I want

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
It's Animal Crossing after dark that I really want

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I do want more villagers to be like night owls

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah I always hated when the villagers would go to bed

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Like at the time that I want to play the game

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I want there to be like 24 hour shopping

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
That isn't just like the club

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Like club lol

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
So did you watch that whole little thing with the Isabelle reveal

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
And the new Animal Crossing

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Like that whole little thing on Nintendo Direct

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Did you watch the actual teaser

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I just cared that they said Animal Crossing

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And that apparently Isabelle is in Smash Brothers

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Yes Isabelle is in Smash Brothers

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
So the whole thing

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
What are you going to do

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Beat people up with you know bills and park projects

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yes

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Well the villagers are in the game

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
And the villagers are in the game

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
So why not Isabelle

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
It made a lot of sense

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
But the whole set up was that it started with

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And people are supposed to be misled to think

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Oh it's an Animal Crossing reveal

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
But in fact it was Isabelle is in Smash

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
And that's how it started

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
But then it fades to black

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
And it fades back up

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And it's Tom Nook sitting at the computer

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Which has lent itself to so many wonderful memes

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
By the way those images of Tom Nook sitting at the computer

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And then he talks to the camera

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And reveals that Animal Crossing is under development

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
For next year for the Switch

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
And that's where that came from

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
So it's kind of like a back to back

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Better not be more fucking happy home designer

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Even though I love that game too

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
It got old though

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Alright so there you go

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Jamie's thoughts on Animal Crossing

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
In a word, yes

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Where's my NES games

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
What if we get SNES games that'd be rad

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Oh like in the

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Free stuff for Nintendo

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Those days are long gone

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I know

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
It would be nice

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
You have to pay a monthly or yearly fee

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
To be able to play those classic NES games

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
That were free in the original Animal Crossing

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
What if they had an arcade like in there

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
And you like pay like a certain amount of like Nintendo points

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
To go into the arcade and play stuff

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I've always been about like how

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Don't they have a big enough development team at Nintendo

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
That a couple people could just be assigned to making little mini games

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
And they don't have to make it

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Just make NES style mini games

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
And those would be what you would unlock

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
And it would just be like

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Flappy Bird ripoffs

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
And you know like

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Those types of things

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
But like with the little villagers

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And you could like have high score competitions

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
With the villagers

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Or your friends that you invited to the village

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
There's the fishing competition

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And the tortomers island crap

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Okay alright that's true

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
They have some of those silly little things

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
That's true

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
So alright we'll see

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Going to our chat

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
We do tape live of course every Sunday night

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
At the voice of geeks network

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Of vognetwork.com

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
And if you are in our

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Or if you are listening live

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
You should be in our chat room

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
It's over at live.vognetwork.com

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
All the info how to join our chat room

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Is right there

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Starting off SHG100 Matt saying

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I would watch Jamie stream Animal Crossing

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You gonna be doing any live streaming of

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh shit yeah

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Okay sounds good

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
You know something else just occurred to me

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Because they let you do that in like

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
In the camp game

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Pocket camp

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
You should be able to choose your skin tone

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
For your character

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Instead of like

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I mean you should still be able to like

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Tan if you go to the beach and everything

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Right

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
But you should be able to like

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Choose your skin tone

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Instead of it being like

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Because I know that the intent is for

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Everyone to be Japanese

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I mean because

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
But when it comes out in a diverse place

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
In a more diverse location

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
It looks like default white

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
You know

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Right right

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
And I think that they should definitely

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Put in more

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Choices of skin tone that you can pick

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
From the start of the game

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Well I think Nintendo's been hearing

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Some of that feedback

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Because of what we're seeing

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
In the mobile game and stuff

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
So I would anticipate that's gonna continue

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Into whatever you know

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
New Animal Crossing game comes out

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
And all that

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
So we'll see though

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Let's see

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Fifth Dream in chat says

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
It better have big text

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So I can play it at work

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
That's a good call out

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Is that since it is going to be something

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
That's designed to be portable

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
And docked

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
We will want to make sure

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
That the text is readable

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
When we're sitting there

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Playing it in portable mode

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I want my amiibos to work

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm sure the

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Oh come on

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I want the villager amiibo

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
For Smash Brothers to work

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Amiibo support is probably like

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
The first thing they thought about

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
In one of those meetings

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
How can we get more cash from our fans

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Did you see how many are still left over

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
At target in those places

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Because I think the bubble's bursting

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
A little bit on that

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
I kind of think the amiibo pool

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Got too dilated

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Like they did not need to make

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
I know you're not going to like this Jamie

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
But they did not need to make figures

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
For like every character in Animal Crossing

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
They did not need to make figures

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
For all of Kirby's friends

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I need five different KK's

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
So like that's the problem

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Is I think it just got too saturated

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Like the Smash Brothers series

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
That was good

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
But that should have been like

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
That should have been the amiibo

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
You know maybe a couple others

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Here and there like

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
But I have my Mr. Resetti

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
I know I know

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
But it's just I just think it's

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It's too much

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
It's too much

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
And act up I agree

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
There's never enough Kirby amiibos

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
There's always going to be someone

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
That disagrees with me

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Let's get to our kickoff topic

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Tonight officially

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Even though the losers here

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Twitch Prime changes 13% of the vote

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Steam TV 0% of the vote

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Jamie nobody cares about your opinion

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
On Steam TV apparently

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I don't care about Steam TV either

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Apparently Animal Crossing

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Is just too dominating there

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
People want to know

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
People associate you with that game

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I can't imagine why

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Alright anyway

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's talk about our official kickoff

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Topic tonight

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Let's get into

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Actually unfortunately

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
This is kind of like shitty news

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
And it's

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
This is something that is inevitable

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
In the games industry

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And something we hear far too often about

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
But I think in this particular stance

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Actually both

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
We're going to hear about two tonight

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Kind of a surprise I think

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Jamie why don't you start us off

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
So we had a studio closure right

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
And this was

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Kind of I don't know

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Feels like a surprise

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
To me

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
It's kind of a surprise

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
But I also think it's karma

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Telltale is closing

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
They are starting by laying off

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Most of the employees

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Are leaving 25 there

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
To finish their obligations

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
But they said that more information

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Is coming out in coming weeks

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
They also though apparently

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Haven't been paying severance packages

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
To their employees

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Not in this most recent round

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Well I'm sure that the management

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Is going to be paying themselves

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
A nice you know

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Chunk of money

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
So fuck them

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Allegedly

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
No likely

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Because that's all

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
It's capital

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
We don't know

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I have to say allegedly

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Because we don't know

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
I just want to say

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
When you say

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Because

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
She's unhinged

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
She's back and she's unhinged

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Which is fine

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
But when you say

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Karma

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I have hinges

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I think it's important to state

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
You are targeting the management

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
In that

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
And certainly

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
None of the hard working

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Story writers

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Programmers

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
People doing their jobs

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
My ire goes to the management

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Because it's their fucking fault

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Their decisions

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
All I'll say

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Is it's a small world

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
And

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
This comes from

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Things that we've heard

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
And that's all we can say

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
So to the management

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Of Telltale Games

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I want you to take

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
A wrought iron dildo

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Stop

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Just stop

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
They can also be used

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
As a metal file

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
For blacksmithing

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
They can be used

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
As a metal file

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
For blacksmithing

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
And they like for you to sit on it

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
And spin

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
In the opposite direction

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I just

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
The anger comes from a place

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Of not only did they

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Kind of do their associates dirty

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
With this whole lack of severance

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
And all this stuff

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
But

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
We've heard some accounts

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
On Twitter where

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
New employees left

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Their long careers

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
To start

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
On Monday

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
And they were laid off

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
On Friday

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Like

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
What kind of planning

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Is that?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Like

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
What kind of planning

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Is that?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
That's

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
It's

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
It's just a real

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It's a real crappy way

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
To treat somebody too

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
That would have left

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Like a long career

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
To come work

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
At this company

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Who's

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
You know

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Making some good

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Good stuff

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
You know

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Tons of people love

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
The Walking Dead

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
And again

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I want to stress

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
The anger does not come

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
From a place

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Whatsoever

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
To the hardworking

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Frontline programmers

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Talented artists

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Story writers

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
The management there

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Is garbage

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
You can fertilize

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
The shit

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
This is landfill

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
The views and opinions

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Expressed by Jamie

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Are true

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
I have to say

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
That dildo smithing

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Is one skill tree

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
That I didn't put

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
A lot of points in

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
In Skyrim

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
But

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I may have to change

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
My mind on that

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Maybe next time

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah next time

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Next playthrough

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Let's see

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Go into chat

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
At live.vognetwork.com

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Points out

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Those employees

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Live in the San Francisco

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Bay Area

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
The highest cost

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Bay Area

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
The North Bay Area

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Was where specifically

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
This office was located

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
They were right near

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
I used to work

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
I keep wanting to say

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Martinez

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
That's not it

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
What's on the

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Just out of Marin

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
San

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh San

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
God damn it

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Why can't I think of the name

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
San Rafael

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
San Rafael

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
That's it

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
San Rafael

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
San Quentin

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
No

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
across there

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
San Rafael

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
That's where they were located

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
If I remember right

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
When I was arrested

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I was dressed in black

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
I was there too

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
But um

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah Telltale

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Was right in that area

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
And I'm telling you

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
North Bay Area

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Expensive

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Real estate

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Very expensive

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
And Loki

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Fifth Dream says

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
This is a Skyrim mod

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Waiting to happen

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
I'm sure it's a Skyrim mod

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Already happened

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
But you know

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I haven't delved into all of those

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
And Bones 006

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I said shit has uses

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
You can fertilize with shit

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Garbage

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
That's BS planning

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Management had to know

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
That things were going south

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
And yet they let those

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Newcomers come in

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
There's no way their finance people

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Could not have already known

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Well before the hires were made

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And that's an example of

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Why there's anger about this

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
And where that's coming from

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
You know you want a concrete example

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Of how was the planning garbage

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
There's your answer

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
But for what it's worth

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I know the studio did make some

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Pretty amazing games

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
You know all things considered

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Certainly the Walking Dead series

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Known and appreciated by a lot of people

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
They made games based on Jurassic Park

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
They had the Sam and Max

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Was kind of the big comeback series games

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
They had those strong bad games

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
That were on the Wii

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Back to the Future

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Back to the Future

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
They had the Batman

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
The Marvel stuff

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Wolf Among Us

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
So I mean there was all

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And I honestly thought

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
You know they were in good financial places

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Because the types of games

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
They were putting out

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Were in my view

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Like long shelf life type of games

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Like you know in a lot of games

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Games have to sell

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Like all of their business

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
It's like right up front

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Like that's why pre-orders are so important

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
That's why launch day

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Stuff is so important

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Because so many games

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Make their sales

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Large percent of their sales

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
The first week

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
And I was always struck with

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
That Telltale games didn't necessarily

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Have those same goals

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Because they would

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
You know they had a long lifespan

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Something like the Walking Dead

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
People are just now

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Even getting into those games

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I know and I still have

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Like in my back catalog

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
In my PlayStation library

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I think on PlayStation 3

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I have like a ton of those series

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
But now again

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
If you want to believe

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Everything you see on Twitter

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
And social media

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
So take it with a grain of salt

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
But apparently

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Not all their games sold very well

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Apparently the Minecraft

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Story mode was doing very well

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
That game was doing well

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
But the Batman game

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Was one of their worst performing games period

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And that's kind of a stunning one

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
In a way

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I don't know though

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
But in some way

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Like the DC movies

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Have not been very strong

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
We all know that

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
That's because they're garbage

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
With garbage writing

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
You're on a roll tonight

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
The DC movies are not very strong

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I also kind of think

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Batman was saturated

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I'm not sure there was a place

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
For Telltale's very specific sort of

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Batman game in the mass market

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
You know what there was a place for?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Lego Batman

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
And I think that's

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
People kind of associate

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
The console gaming with like

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Lego Batman and that stuff

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
I think the Batman Telltale thing

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Proved to be maybe too niche

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I don't know

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Apparently Tales from the Borderlands

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Also did not do well

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
But like I hate to say it

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
I kind of

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
I mean that's a

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
That was

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't even remember thinking this

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
When I first saw the game

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Like the game looked really good

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
But I was like

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
This is a really niche thing

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Like I'm not going to want to play this

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
If I don't already have some familiarity

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
With Borderlands

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
But I think the thinking that went into it

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Was the reverse

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Maybe we can bring more people

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Into Borderlands through this game

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But I'm not sure that's how it really worked

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Whether the game was good or not

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
I'm not saying it was a bad game

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Actually

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Considering I knew very little about Borderlands

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I actually enjoyed

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
What Tales from the Borderlands I saw

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
But I just think that

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
You know kind of

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Limited the potential audience

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
But hindsight's

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
2020 right?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
So anyway

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
It probably leads to why

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
The games did not end up

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Performing as well as expected

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And why we're where we're at today

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Let's see

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Going to chat at

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Live.vognetware.com

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah Dungeon Buster says

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I thought the Batman games were doing really well

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
So to read that rumor was eyebrow raising right?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
But we don't

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
We don't really get game sales

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
In the same way we get box office

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I mean sure we get MPD rankings

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
But there's only so much that tells us

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
You know there's so many games out there

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
And plus with digital distribution

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
And all these different platforms

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
PC isn't accounted for in MPD

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
So it's just you know

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
A little different

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Brad from Pod Culture

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Pushing back on the DC movies thing a little bit

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Does want to point out Wonder Woman was great

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
So

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
So

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
There is at least maybe a diamond in the rough

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Well you know a broken clock is right twice

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Alright anyway

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
It used to be good

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It's just up until recent

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
When they tried the

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
You know Marvel Cinematic Universe the thing

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
And then actually brought in somebody from Marvel Cinematic Universe

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
But anyway this is not a

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
This is not a DC Marvel show

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
It's a video game show

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Unfortunately

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
I will say

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Actually to end this on a positive note

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
To see how the industry has been reaching out

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
To the affected folks at Telltale

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Is really awesome

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Like there's a tweet out there

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Where Ubisoft San Francisco

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Is like

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Hey if you work there

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Come to BJ's Brewhouse

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
On such and such day

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
We're meeting and greeting people

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Our treat

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
You know to try to fill positions

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And I think there's a lot of people out there

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Who want to help

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Because many people recognize

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
This sucks

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Because there's many people in the industry

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Who have been through this

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Far too many times

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Because of

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Bad decisions

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
By people that were

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
A little higher up on the food chain

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Unfortunately

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
This is not the only example

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Of this that's happened this week

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Right Logie?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yes unfortunately not

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
So

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Capcom's

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Vancouver studio

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Has shut down as well

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
So

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
This isn't kind of

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Unexpected I guess

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Because they did

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Lay off

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
30% of the studio

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Back in February

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
But

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Now they have

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I guess

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
The remaining

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
158 people

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Will lose their jobs

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Due to the shutdown

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
They're going to keep

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
A skeleton crew remaining

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Until January 2019

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
To finalize the closure

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Operations and logistics

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
But

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
For those who may not know

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Capcom Vancouver

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Was best known for the

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Dead Rising series

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
But unfortunately

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
They said as a result

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Of reviewing titles and development

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
At Capcom Vancouver

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Capcom has decided to

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Cancel the development

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Of projects at the studio

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
And will concentrate development

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
On major titles in Japan

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
So

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
No more Dead Rising

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
At least

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I guess not

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Not from this studio

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah and they were doing

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Dead Rising and I guess also

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
They had a

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Puzzle Fighter

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Was the other thing that they

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Worked on

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Oh and that game kind of

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
They already announced that

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
That game was going to close

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Not that long ago

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah that game

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't think did that

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Well

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Well

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
I think they went

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
The wrong model with it

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Unfortunately

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Yeah

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
But I thought the Puzzle Fighter

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Was going to get a release

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
In kind of the

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
The more appropriate

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
You know pay

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
20 bucks up front

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
And get all the characters

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Type of thing

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
I thought it was going to get

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
A release on Switch

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
PlayStation

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I guess maybe not now

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I don't know

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I don't know

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I don't know where that stands

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
It's also kind of nebulous

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
With the Telltale stuff

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I think it's kind of a given

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
That

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Well they have like

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
The stranger things

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
The Netflix stuff

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Is not going to be happening

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah that's unfortunate

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I mean

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
And ironically enough

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I want to say

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Let's see

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
There's a game actually

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Coming out

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
In just a couple weeks

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
You know that's from Telltale

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Batman the enemy within

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
On the Switch

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Oops

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Maybe

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
In the sequel to the

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Other Batman series

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Which is weird though

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Because if like it did so terribly

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
You'd think that they wouldn't

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Make a sequel to it

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Or well

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
You know but also

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
It's one of those

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
You have to weigh the cost

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Of how much to port it

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Versus you know

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
What's the likely return

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
On you know

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Going to another console

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Like the Switch

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
And we've seen so many titles

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Kind of end up getting ported

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Over to the Switch

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
That they must think

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
There's you know

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Money to be made there

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
I mean

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
And in the case of Telltale

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Not to you know

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Take the spotlight off

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Which is important too

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
But

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Telltale does still have a

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Skeleton crew

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
We just don't know how

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
For how much longer

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
So assumably

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
This crew that's left

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Is dealing with these

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Commitments that are already

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
There such as the Batman thing

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And whatever else is left

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
But

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
For the most part

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
The studio's done

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
And so for Capcom Vancouver

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
It's done done

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Right

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
They'll shift all that to

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Japan and what have you

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yep

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Well

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
That is unfortunate

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Fifth Dream in chat

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
It says

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Man I was looking forward to

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Puzzle Fighter

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
The mobile one literally had

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
A bug in the tutorial

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
That prevented me from

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Ever playing

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Then again

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Maybe that's a sign of

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Why it went poof

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Um

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
When yeah

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
When bugs are reported

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
You definitely need to act

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
On those bugs

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
It's very fascinating

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I just feel like

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
It seems like nowadays

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Testing is so sloppy

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Like with just this stuff

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Or that they just push

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Not necessarily maybe

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
That the testing's like

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
They're just like

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Eh it's fine

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Let's just put it out

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I think it's definitely

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
I think the testing

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Isn't sloppy at all

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
I think the testing

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Picks up a lot of stuff

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I think sometimes

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
It's a question of

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
What are we willing to

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Push the game back

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
To do

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Um

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
To fix and so forth

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
And so uh

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
That is uh

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
That is

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Had a very interesting

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Effect here in the year

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
2018

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Cause I think a lot of games

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Have bugs that

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Well and no

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Get

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
They're identified in testing

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
But the game comes out anyway

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
I would bet

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
You know Bethesda's infamous

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
For all the bug stuff

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
I would bet so much of

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
That stuff gets called out

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
And they say

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Um

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
We're gonna do it anyway

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Because you know

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Again it's

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Cost to fix

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
And the time table

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
And are we gonna be able to

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Meet the shipping day

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
And all that stuff

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Because so many games

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Have to be out in November

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
You gotta

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
That's why they don't

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Bug fix

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
You know

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Skyrim anymore

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Oh but they'll fucking make

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
You know

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
More DLC that they can

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Charge for

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
I mean

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Mods

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
They can charge for

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Well I'm hoping

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
You know

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
We've seen this happen

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
With movies

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Over the past few years

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
That you get

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Now not just in summer

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
And the winter

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Holiday season

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
You're seeing

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Big movies

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Basically year round

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
You're seeing

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Big big movies

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Almost all times

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Throughout the year

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Except maybe early January

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Is the one time

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
You don't really see

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Big big movies

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Anymore

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
But that's spreading

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
More year round

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
And I kind of hope

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
We're getting to a similar

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Place with games

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
It sure feels like it

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Especially amongst the years

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
We've done

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
OLR here

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Is that I remember

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
It was like

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
All the games

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Were in October

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
January

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
March

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Fiscal year

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Type of things

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
April

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
And so forth

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
We're getting stuff

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Even in the summer

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
And so forth

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
We're getting like

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
A big release

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
At least every month

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
It's feeling a little bit

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
More year round

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
And maybe that's gonna

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Help alleviate

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Some of the pressures

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
From investors

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
To deliver a product

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
At a certain time

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
At the sake of

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Keep the bugs in

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
You know what I mean

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
So

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
It'll be interesting

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Anyway

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Let's see

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Going to chat

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Nope

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
It's just weird

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
When it happens

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
We can afford weird

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Ship it

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Let's see

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Tigerclaw says

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
That's true

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
But even last year

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Proved

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
You don't have

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
You don't have to

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Release in the fall

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
To be remembered

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
For the Oscars

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Get Out

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I believe it had been

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Released in like

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
February or March

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
It was earlier

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
In the year

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
And people remembered

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
How good it was

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
When awards season

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Came around

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
So it doesn't

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Always happen

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
But

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
You know

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
There's ways to

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Remind voters too

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
You know what I mean

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
That's why you have

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Those four year

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Consideration campaigns

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Around the Oscar season

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Go to a website

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Like deadline.com

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Or variety.com

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
These are like

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Industry

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
News wires

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
And they're

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Targeted at people

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
In the industry

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
And look at the

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Type of ads

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
That show up there

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
It's all this

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Four year

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Consideration stuff

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Like all

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
All around awards season

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Also don't ever

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Ever ever ever

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Look at TMZ

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
TMZ is where you go

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
When you want like

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Gutter trash rumors

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Well yeah

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
What's Lindsay Lohan

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Doing these days

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
I'm saying now

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
That actually they're

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
On my shit list

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
For how they

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Make money off

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Of people's grief

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Well that's

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
That's not a new thing

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Yeah but they're

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Absolutely on my

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Shit list now so

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm not trying to

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Sound like a jerk

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
But they should have

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Been on your shit list

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Years ago for that reason

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Well they were

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
But I'm calling on

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Anyone who posts

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Anything from them

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Right now

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
But here's the

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Interesting thing

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
About that

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Their techniques

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Are shitty

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
They do find things out

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
First unfortunately

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Through that method

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
And there is this

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Inherent human need

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
To want to be

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
First

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
At something

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Or first

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
I knew about that

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Firsties first first

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Those people

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Need a life

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
That's

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
I'll tie this back

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
To gaming

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
That's why that

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Thing they did

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
In Pokemon Go

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
This weekend

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Was so brilliant

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
It was really brilliant

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
And if you don't

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Try it

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
When community day

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Finished

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
There was this

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
New Pokemon

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
No one had ever

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Seen before

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Unless maybe

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
The nut thing

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
The little nut thing

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
The little nut

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Ghost thing

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
That showed up

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
In the game

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
And because

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Nobody had seen it

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
It wasn't teased

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Every forum

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Every website

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Every chat I'm on

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
That's even tangentially

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
About Pokemon Go

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
You've got people

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
That are posting

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Look what I found

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Look what I got

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
The gag is

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
That thing was

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Everywhere

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Like who didn't see

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
That thing

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
If they had

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Their game open

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
But people

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Want to be first

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
And so Pokemon Go

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Got all this free

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Shout out on

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Social media everywhere

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Because of little

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Nut monster mon

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Which is probably

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
The bonus Pokemon

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
That's going to be

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
In Pokemon Let's Go

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Because they teased

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
That even though

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
It's the 151

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
From Kanto

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
There will be an

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Additional mon

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
That shows up

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
It's going to be

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
That little dude

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Yeah but when you

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Catch it

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
It turns into a ditto

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
That was their

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Little clever way

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Of not letting you

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Really catch it

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Until

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Gen 8 is announced

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Or whatever

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Dippy little thing

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
They're going to do

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
I think they're just

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Trolling people

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
I think it's awesome

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
It is

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
It is in a way

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Let's see

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
SDG100 Matt

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
In chat says

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
That was such a good troll

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
He says

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
It was everywhere

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Ten fold

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
For the first 30 minutes

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
It's still around now

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
But the first 30 minutes

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
After community day

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Was over

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah it was everywhere

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Well let's talk

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
A little bit about

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Community day

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Or whatever

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
You were doing

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
With your gaming week

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
And a little adventure

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
We do called

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
How was your gaming week

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
So Dark Sakura

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
You can really do

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
The whole month if you want

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
But what kind of games

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
You've been playing lately

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Well it starts

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
With a purchase

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
And I might have brought

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
This up in one of my

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Radio Magic things

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
But on September 1st

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Was mine and Dan's anniversary

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
You did talk about

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
The pinball table

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
If this is where we're going

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Well I'm bringing it up

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Again because it's

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Fucking gorgeous

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
I have a theater

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Finally and it's in

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Perfect condition

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Dan was like

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I don't know what to do

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
With the table

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
I don't have to work on

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
We just play the shit out of it

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
And it's great

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
It's beautiful

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
So we have theater of magic

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
We've also gotten

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
The Shadow

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
And

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Last Action Hero

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Which actually more has

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Sentimental value for us

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
And

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I don't know some other one

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
That I don't remember

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
What we got

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
But whatever

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Then

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
I've been playing

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
A lot of Pokemon Go

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
I've played some Ingress

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Just not a whole lot

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm back to playing

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Bejeweled for some reason

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Which is actually

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Kind of crazily addictive

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
And I'm still playing

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Idolpouring

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
But

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
That's really about it

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I've been very busy

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Work is weird

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
And then all my volunteer

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Stuff is taking up my time

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Oh no I did play something else

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Oh yeah

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
We have the Nintendo out

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
So I did actually play

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
The Guardian Legend

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Without it slowing me down

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
I love The Guardian Legend

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
That's just

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Let's just take a moment

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Gaming perfection

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
No Rob needs a moment of silence

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
I do

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
For reasons

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Other than that

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
I've just been looking at stuff

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
And going

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh that'd be cute

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Oh that'd be cute

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Like gaming accessories

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Like

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Girlie shit

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Like my Triforce necklace

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
That I wore last night

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
And I was like

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Oh you're wearing a Triforce

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
And I was like

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Yeah it's a Triforce necklace

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
It's cool

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
You know just

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Little stuff and

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Oh and Dan and I

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Watched a playthrough

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
That was done like

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
We weren't actually playing it

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
But it was funny

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Because we were watching

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
A playthrough of like

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Transformers Devastation

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
And it was done like a movie

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
With the soundtrack for

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Transformers the movie in it

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
As in the real movie

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Not these live action

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Pieces of shit

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Which by the way

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm gonna see

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Transformers the movie

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
On the 27th

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
In the theater

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Bam

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
I know you're seeing it

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
The week before

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
I'm seeing Gaga in

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
A Star is Born

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Because that came up

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
On Facebook this week

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm going to see

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
The better movie

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
No you're not

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Years won't win an Oscar

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
We've had people who

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Were in that movie

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
On this show

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
No I know

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I know

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
I'm not hating on

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
The Transformers thing

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
I've also still decided

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
That if anyone was gonna

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Narrate my life

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Maybe Morgan Freeman

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Or Sammy L

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Wanda Sykes for me

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
It'd be Greg Berger

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
As Grimlock

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I'm sure he's very

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Happy to hear that

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Well he seemed to be

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Alright

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
So no other games

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
To share for now

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Alright let's move over to

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
I'm sorry she didn't

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Talk about World of Warcraft

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Because I was gonna

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Talk about World of

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Oh yeah I did play

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
World of Warcraft

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Shit

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
This bitch right here

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Yeah no because

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
I've been kind of playing

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Eradically

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Because she keeps yelling

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
At me that I'm not

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Playing my Alliance

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Character

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
If you hop on Alliance

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
And then do the

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Argus stuff with me

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
So I can actually go through

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Some of those dungeons

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
I haven't done yet

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
You need to bring back

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Sassy Pants

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
She's still there

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I didn't kill her

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
You can remake her

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
As a dark iron

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Alright

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Speaking of Pokemon Go

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
So this is like some

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Late breaking news

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Do do do do

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
So a friend of mine

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Is said he needs

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Three new friends

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
To finish his Mew quest

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
And so I'm like

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
But the thing is

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
All these people are

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Replying to his post

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Going

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
People are still playing

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Pokemon Go

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Whatever

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
This so last summer

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
You know type

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
That sort of thing

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
So I said

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
You know what buddy

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
His name's Curtis

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Curtis I'm gonna try to

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Actually help you here

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Do you want me to give out

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Your code on the radio show

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
And see what kind of

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Strangers add you

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
And he said yes

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
So I would love it

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
If you would all add

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
My pal Curtis

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
As your friend in Pokemon Go

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
His code is

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
So get out your phones

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Everybody

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
2 8 1 4

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
6 3 0 8

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
2 3 4 1

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
He said I could do it

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
So

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I can't add him yet

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Because I also

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Need to add friends

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
For that quest too

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
At some point

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Well then you both

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Would get it

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
But yeah

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
But I have to wait

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Until I actually have to

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Do that so you know

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Okay

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
This is completely real

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
As you know

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
This is completely real

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Add him

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Add him as your friend

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
This is my pal Curtis

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
I'll be there before

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Too long so

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
My code will go out

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
I did the reality game

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
On Facebook

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
He was in it too

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
And he did a YouTube

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
He's on a YouTube show

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
That's a reality show

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Called sequester

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
So

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
If you watch that

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Type of garbage

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
You might have seen

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
This whole adding

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Three friends thing

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Makes me feel a lot like

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
The whole ingress thing

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Where they want you to

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Recruit people

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
And it's like

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
I can't recruit people

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Because no one wants

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
To play this

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Ingress

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Ingress

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
That badge doesn't do shit

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
It's like a vanity thing

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Whereas in Pokemon

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Like if you want to have Mew

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
The problem is

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
He really wants to have Mew

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
You

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
You have to actually

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Add people

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
On Pokemon Go

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
So you have to add people

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
But I already added people

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Why do I have to add more people?

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
I am actually in a Sacramento area

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Pokemon Go player group

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
That all you have to do

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Is post in there

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
And people will add you

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
If you want

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
All right

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Well we got

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
I see act deaf says

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
I'll add him

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
And so there's some people

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Saying they're gonna add

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
So I appreciate that

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Do that

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Add him

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
All right

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Loki

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
I played Pokemon Go a little bit

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
And

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I don't know

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
What else

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I loaded up an emulator

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
On my computer

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
To play

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Ridge Racer R4

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Because I saw the announcement

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
That came out

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
I was like

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Oh yeah I like that game

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Let me try playing that again

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
I did not age well

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
I don't know

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
It's all right

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I like Ridge Racer R4

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
I mean it's one of the best

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Ridge Racer games

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
But it does not look good

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
On that emulator

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It just

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
I don't know

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
What magic they're gonna be able

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
To do on the TV

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
To make it look fantastic

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Like I remember it

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
But that was not it

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
But it's still fun

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
And then

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
What else did I play

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
I tried a little bit

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I was gonna download

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
The Forza Horizon 4 demo

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
But I'm like

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Do I really need to download

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
A demo

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
I'll just buy the game

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
When it comes out

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
When you know

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
You're already gonna buy the game

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah it's like

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
I'll just buy the game

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
When it comes out

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
For what it's worth

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
It gives you a little bit

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Of a jump start

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
On the game

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
And there's like

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
A clothing item

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
You unlock

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Whoopty shit

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
But you get a little shirt

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
For doing the first part

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Of the demo

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
A shirt for a driver

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
That's in a car

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
That I never see

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Well actually no

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
You see the driver

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Because they change

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
The little recaps

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
So you see the little driver

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Standing next to the car

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Going fuck yeah

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
I won

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
So you do see the drivers

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
In like the recap screens

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Oh yeah

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Well

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
It's very much a vanity thing though

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
It's very very much a vanity thing

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
You can't run over the sheep

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
The sheep will always avoid the car

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
That sounds like a challenge

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Uh yeah

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
That was posted in our Discord

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
There was a little video

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Where the sheep are programmed

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
So that they consistently

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
Run away from the car

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
So

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Get enough cars

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Lined up

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
Anything's possible

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Loki wants to kill the sheep

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
It's just because they tell me

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
I can't kill the sheep

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I mean come on

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
We're the classic days of

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
You know cruising

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
USA and stuff like that

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Carmageddon

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
We're eating like

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Smashing the deer

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
And it just

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Gives everywhere

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Gross

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Alright anything else for your gaming week?

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Um

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
No I think that was it

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Okay my gaming week

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Let me start with some of the stuff

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
That's been discussed already

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
So World of Warcraft

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
I am continuing my adventures

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
In World of Warcraft

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
So unlike Jamie

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I've been playing Horde

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Simply because my druid

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Is on Horde

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
And I really wanted to play my druid

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Um

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
And

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Yeah

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Although I was really kind of bored

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Because my guild had like

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Nobody playing in it

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
So I moved to a different guild

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I'm in a guild with Dr. Ken

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
From Starboard Power Coupling

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
And so there's a few more chatty people there

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
So it's nice

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
It's nice to like

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Not be playing an MMO by myself

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Um

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I think that helps World of Warcraft

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Be a little better

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
And yeah I'm kind of into it

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Like I'm

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
I'm into this expansion

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
I don't know how long I will be

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Because I tend to like

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Go through the leveling up thing

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
And then once I hit max level

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
I'm like

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Eh fuck rating

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
And I kind of fizzle out

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
But we'll see

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
We'll see how long this keeps my interest

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
I like that they have

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
You know

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
It seems like there's more of a variety

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Of things to do

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
As you level up

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I like that they have like

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
This whole island expedition thing

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
It's kind of neat

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
I just did one of those today

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
And so it was like

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Kind of like a

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
PvP

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
But it wasn't actually other players

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
It was computer controlled

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
AI

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
And it was like

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You have to mine as much Azerite

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
As you can on the island

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Faster than the other team

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Um

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
And I thought it was kind of a neat

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Little like minigame

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
So yeah

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
That was cool

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Um

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
I played that

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
And uh

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Yeah

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
It's kind of what I've been doing

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
In World of Warcraft

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
I also started Diablo 3

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Again

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Because season 15 just started on Friday

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
So

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Gotta start another new character

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
And get all the cosmetic rewards

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
From getting to level 70

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
And all that stuff

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
So

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
I started doing that

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Uh

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Playing Diablo 3

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Uh

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Pokemon Go

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Community day

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Was this past weekend

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Had a lot of fun

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Just walking around the capital

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
I feel like with Chikorita

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Man

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Those were crazy

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Like

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
I'm just talking like

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
The number of Chikorita

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
That were around

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Like were more than any other

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Community day

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Yeah

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
And the shinies too

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Because I got like three or four shinies

38:14.000 --> 38:16.080
And I was able to evolve like two whole

38:16.080 --> 38:17.600
Chikorita sets

38:17.600 --> 38:18.600
And

38:18.600 --> 38:20.960
Everybody in my group got five or six shinies

38:20.960 --> 38:22.160
And we also

38:22.160 --> 38:23.560
And we never do this

38:23.560 --> 38:25.160
We took time out of Community day

38:25.160 --> 38:26.160
To raid

38:26.160 --> 38:27.440
So we went and re-rated

38:27.440 --> 38:28.440
Over at um

38:28.440 --> 38:30.800
The theater at the convention center

38:30.800 --> 38:32.000
Had a Mewtwo that popped

38:32.000 --> 38:33.400
You have to see my picture on Twitter

38:33.400 --> 38:35.560
There were like 300 people

38:35.560 --> 38:37.480
Swarming around this building

38:37.480 --> 38:38.480
Where there was a Mewtwo

38:38.480 --> 38:39.480
And just you know

38:39.480 --> 38:40.480
Obviously you would go in

38:40.480 --> 38:41.480
And the lobby would be full

38:41.480 --> 38:42.480
Although we did

38:42.480 --> 38:43.480
We ended up doing a private group

38:43.480 --> 38:44.480
So that we could just

38:44.480 --> 38:45.480
All increase our friendship levels

38:45.480 --> 38:46.480
And all that

38:46.480 --> 38:47.480
Um

38:47.480 --> 38:48.480
So

38:48.480 --> 38:49.480
And we took out Mewtwo there

38:49.480 --> 38:50.480
And then we went to the church

38:50.480 --> 38:51.480
You know at the capital park

38:51.480 --> 38:52.480
Here in SAC

38:52.480 --> 38:53.480
You know there's that church

38:53.480 --> 38:54.480
That's right across the street

38:54.480 --> 38:55.480
That's a gym as well

38:55.480 --> 38:56.680
So Mewtwo popped there too

38:56.680 --> 38:57.960
And so you had all these people

38:57.960 --> 38:58.960
Lining the street

38:58.960 --> 38:59.960
On one side

38:59.960 --> 39:00.960
And all these people lining the street

39:00.960 --> 39:01.960
On the other

39:01.960 --> 39:02.960
Doing the same thing

39:02.960 --> 39:03.960
And there was a Mewtwo that was there

39:03.960 --> 39:04.960
So it was just

39:04.960 --> 39:05.960
It was crazy

39:05.960 --> 39:06.960
But it was cool

39:06.960 --> 39:07.960
Um

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
But yeah it was

39:08.960 --> 39:09.960
It was interesting

39:09.960 --> 39:10.960
By 1.30

39:10.960 --> 39:11.960
Which um

39:11.960 --> 39:12.960
You know Pacific time

39:12.960 --> 39:13.960
Community day goes

39:13.960 --> 39:14.960
11 am to 2 pm

39:14.960 --> 39:15.960
So by 1.30

39:15.960 --> 39:16.960
We were like

39:16.960 --> 39:17.960
It's getting hot

39:17.960 --> 39:18.960
Supposed to be like 94 today

39:18.960 --> 39:19.960
Um

39:19.960 --> 39:20.960
Are we kind of done?

39:20.960 --> 39:21.960
And everyone was like

39:21.960 --> 39:22.960
Yeah we're done

39:22.960 --> 39:23.960
We've got like five

39:23.960 --> 39:24.960
Six shinies

39:24.960 --> 39:25.960
We're good

39:25.960 --> 39:26.960
So we called it a day

39:26.960 --> 39:27.960
Like 30 minutes early

39:27.960 --> 39:28.960
Which we never do

39:28.960 --> 39:29.960
Yeah

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
Because like

39:30.960 --> 39:31.960
With EV community day

39:31.960 --> 39:32.960
There's like 10 shinies

39:32.960 --> 39:33.960
Into each of the set

39:33.960 --> 39:34.960
You know

39:34.960 --> 39:35.960
Of EVs

39:35.960 --> 39:36.960
So you could have like

39:36.960 --> 39:37.960
A ton of different shiny EVs

39:37.960 --> 39:38.960
Basically

39:38.960 --> 39:39.960
But

39:39.960 --> 39:40.960
I don't know

39:40.960 --> 39:41.960
Chikorita is like

39:41.960 --> 39:42.960
Eh

39:42.960 --> 39:43.960
Eh

39:43.960 --> 39:44.960
I don't really want this

39:44.960 --> 39:45.960
Yeah

39:45.960 --> 39:46.960
Well no

39:46.960 --> 39:47.960
Chikorita is cool

39:47.960 --> 39:48.960
It's actually

39:48.960 --> 39:49.960
Ironically it's pumpkin spice

39:49.960 --> 39:50.960
Chikorita

39:50.960 --> 39:51.960
Is what it looks like to me

39:51.960 --> 39:52.960
So

39:52.960 --> 39:53.960
An appropriate fall flavor

39:53.960 --> 39:54.960
I got a shiny Charmander

39:54.960 --> 39:55.960
The other day

39:55.960 --> 39:56.960
Oh just randomly?

39:56.960 --> 39:57.960
Just randomly

39:57.960 --> 39:58.960
Yeah it's nice that once you have

39:58.960 --> 39:59.960
Like the community day

39:59.960 --> 40:00.960
Then the shinies are kind of like

40:00.960 --> 40:01.960
Good

40:01.960 --> 40:02.960
They're just like

40:02.960 --> 40:03.960
Less of a spawn

40:03.960 --> 40:04.960
But you'll find them

40:04.960 --> 40:05.960
Like the

40:05.960 --> 40:06.960
Well they didn't get a community day

40:06.960 --> 40:07.960
But those swabloos

40:07.960 --> 40:08.960
Like I've

40:08.960 --> 40:09.960
I just randomly have picked up

40:09.960 --> 40:10.960
Two of them

40:10.960 --> 40:11.960
Just catching like

40:11.960 --> 40:12.960
Regular Pokemon

40:12.960 --> 40:13.960
It's kind of

40:13.960 --> 40:14.960
Kind of cool

40:14.960 --> 40:15.960
Other games that I've played

40:15.960 --> 40:16.960
Doesn't stop there

40:16.960 --> 40:17.960
So I've also been playing

40:17.960 --> 40:18.960
Forza Horizon 4

40:18.960 --> 40:19.960
I downloaded the demo for that

40:19.960 --> 40:20.960
So the

40:20.960 --> 40:21.960
I did download the demo

40:21.960 --> 40:22.960
Because I wanted to get in there

40:22.960 --> 40:23.960
And

40:23.960 --> 40:24.960
So it starts with

40:24.960 --> 40:25.960
You rate

40:25.960 --> 40:26.960
It's very much like

40:26.960 --> 40:27.960
Shoving down your throat

40:27.960 --> 40:28.960
Did you know that this game

40:28.960 --> 40:29.960
Has seasons?

40:29.960 --> 40:30.960
And so it's like

40:30.960 --> 40:32.960
Race through the autumn season

40:32.960 --> 40:34.960
Now race through the winter season

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
Now it's the summer

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
So you go

40:36.960 --> 40:37.960
Does it change as you go

40:37.960 --> 40:38.960
Throughout the year

40:38.960 --> 40:39.960
Or is it just

40:39.960 --> 40:40.960
Not in this demo

40:40.960 --> 40:41.960
In the demo

40:41.960 --> 40:42.960
I know the demo doesn't

40:42.960 --> 40:44.960
The demo just kind of like

40:44.960 --> 40:45.960
Like because it was four

40:45.960 --> 40:46.960
Different type of races

40:46.960 --> 40:47.960
Like it started with like

40:47.960 --> 40:49.960
A very generic type of race

40:49.960 --> 40:50.960
In the autumn

40:50.960 --> 40:51.960
And then the winner was like

40:51.960 --> 40:52.960
You were in this big dune buggy

40:52.960 --> 40:53.960
Going through the snow

40:53.960 --> 40:54.960
And you did like this big ramp

40:54.960 --> 40:55.960
And then summer

40:55.960 --> 40:56.960
I remember you're racing

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
Motorcycles

40:57.960 --> 40:58.960
And the motorcycles all had

40:59.960 --> 41:00.960
And it was a really cool effect

41:00.960 --> 41:01.960
Like one thing I just love

41:01.960 --> 41:02.960
About Forza

41:02.960 --> 41:04.960
Is that it's extra as fuck

41:04.960 --> 41:06.960
Like it's so extra

41:06.960 --> 41:07.960
Like you'll be driving down

41:07.960 --> 41:08.960
Like confetti cannons

41:08.960 --> 41:09.960
Going off everywhere

41:09.960 --> 41:10.960
And like the sheep

41:10.960 --> 41:11.960
Chasing the sheep

41:11.960 --> 41:12.960
I consider as like

41:12.960 --> 41:13.960
An extra thing too

41:13.960 --> 41:14.960
And it's just like

41:14.960 --> 41:15.960
Extra extra extra

41:15.960 --> 41:16.960
And since you know what

41:16.960 --> 41:18.960
Since this week Mario Kart

41:18.960 --> 41:20.960
Got ruined for a lot of us

41:20.960 --> 41:21.960
I'll just leave it at that

41:21.960 --> 41:22.960
Mario Kart

41:22.960 --> 41:23.960
And one particular character

41:23.960 --> 41:24.960
In Mario Kart

41:24.960 --> 41:26.960
Got ruined for a lot of people

41:26.960 --> 41:27.960
So people are gonna be funny

41:27.960 --> 41:28.960
A break maybe

41:28.960 --> 41:29.960
I think Forza

41:29.960 --> 41:30.960
You know it's a very different

41:30.960 --> 41:31.960
type of game

41:31.960 --> 41:32.960
But I just love how

41:32.960 --> 41:33.960
Over the top it is

41:33.960 --> 41:34.960
It's why I prefer

41:34.960 --> 41:35.960
The Horizon series

41:35.960 --> 41:37.960
Way much more than the mainline

41:37.960 --> 41:38.960
Forza Motorsport games

41:38.960 --> 41:39.960
It's just

41:39.960 --> 41:40.960
It's arcadey

41:40.960 --> 41:41.960
And it's so extra

41:41.960 --> 41:42.960
Like flying

41:42.960 --> 41:44.960
So you do the season thing

41:44.960 --> 41:45.960
And I honestly thought

41:45.960 --> 41:46.960
That was gonna be it

41:46.960 --> 41:47.960
I was like

41:47.960 --> 41:48.960
Oh is that

41:48.960 --> 41:49.960
I downloaded 25 gigs for that

41:49.960 --> 41:50.960
That's gonna be it

41:50.960 --> 41:51.960
But then no

41:51.960 --> 41:52.960
The game starts up

41:52.960 --> 41:53.960
It's like

41:53.960 --> 41:54.960
So what do you want

41:54.960 --> 41:55.960
Your name to be

41:55.960 --> 41:56.960
And what's awesome

41:56.960 --> 41:57.960
Like they've recorded

41:57.960 --> 41:58.960
Like 500 names

41:58.960 --> 41:59.960
So you can like

41:59.960 --> 42:00.960
Have the announcer

42:00.960 --> 42:01.960
Call you my name right

42:01.960 --> 42:02.960
But one of the nicknames

42:02.960 --> 42:03.960
You can be

42:03.960 --> 42:04.960
Roberts

42:04.960 --> 42:06.960
So they call me Roberts

42:06.960 --> 42:07.960
So

42:07.960 --> 42:08.960
Which is kind of funny

42:08.960 --> 42:10.960
So I play the game as that

42:10.960 --> 42:11.960
And it lets you start the game

42:11.960 --> 42:12.960
So you do this race

42:12.960 --> 42:13.960
You do another race

42:13.960 --> 42:15.960
And then you do like a stunt

42:15.960 --> 42:16.960
They're like

42:16.960 --> 42:17.960
We want you to be a stunt double

42:17.960 --> 42:18.960
In this new movie

42:18.960 --> 42:19.960
And you do a stunt race

42:19.960 --> 42:20.960
Where you go like

42:20.960 --> 42:21.960
Flying through a windmill

42:21.960 --> 42:22.960
And you fly off the cliff

42:22.960 --> 42:23.960
Into a field

42:23.960 --> 42:24.960
And it looks

42:24.960 --> 42:25.960
Like I was playing

42:25.960 --> 42:26.960
My PC

42:26.960 --> 42:27.960
And my PC can only run

42:27.960 --> 42:28.960
On like medium settings

42:28.960 --> 42:29.960
Because you know

42:29.960 --> 42:30.960
Even though my computer

42:30.960 --> 42:31.960
Is like two years old

42:31.960 --> 42:32.960
At this point

42:32.960 --> 42:33.960
It was top of the line

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
When I got it

42:34.960 --> 42:35.960
Well it's only two years old

42:35.960 --> 42:36.960
Now you know

42:36.960 --> 42:37.960
It's like

42:37.960 --> 42:38.960
Might as well bought it

42:38.960 --> 42:39.960
A decade ago

42:39.960 --> 42:40.960
Um

42:40.960 --> 42:41.960
But it looked beautiful

42:41.960 --> 42:42.960
Even in the medium mode

42:42.960 --> 42:43.960
So um

42:43.960 --> 42:44.960
Yeah I was

42:44.960 --> 42:45.960
Enjoying Forza

42:45.960 --> 42:46.960
So cool

42:46.960 --> 42:47.960
Cool

42:47.960 --> 42:48.960
Um

42:48.960 --> 42:49.960
I think that's probably it

42:49.960 --> 42:50.960
Finally for my gaming week

42:50.960 --> 42:51.960
I think that's most of the stuff

42:51.960 --> 42:52.960
I've been playing this week

42:52.960 --> 42:53.960
Bobby says the seasons

42:53.960 --> 42:54.960
Change every week

42:54.960 --> 42:55.960
Like real week

42:55.960 --> 42:56.960
Yeah

42:56.960 --> 42:57.960
Or

42:57.960 --> 42:58.960
Because

42:58.960 --> 42:59.960
I know it keeps telling me

42:59.960 --> 43:00.960
It says um

43:00.960 --> 43:01.960
Um

43:01.960 --> 43:03.960
Progress towards autumn

43:03.960 --> 43:05.960
And then autumn unlocked

43:05.960 --> 43:06.960
But I haven't unlocked it yet

43:06.960 --> 43:07.960
Because I had to stop the demo

43:07.960 --> 43:08.960
Because I was just doing it today

43:08.960 --> 43:09.960
So I had to stop the demo

43:09.960 --> 43:10.960
To prep for OLR

43:10.960 --> 43:11.960
I did the stunt race thing

43:11.960 --> 43:12.960
And that's where I stopped the demo

43:12.960 --> 43:14.960
But I saw a hella

43:14.960 --> 43:15.960
Like other people

43:15.960 --> 43:16.960
On my Xbox friends list

43:16.960 --> 43:17.960
Like every race I did

43:17.960 --> 43:18.960
Was completely full

43:18.960 --> 43:19.960
With gamer tags

43:19.960 --> 43:21.960
From my Xbox

43:21.960 --> 43:22.960
Like I raced against

43:22.960 --> 43:23.960
Black Wolf

43:24.960 --> 43:25.960
I mean I know it's not really them

43:25.960 --> 43:26.960
Because I whooped them all

43:26.960 --> 43:27.960
And that would not have happened

43:27.960 --> 43:29.960
If they had been the real drivers

43:29.960 --> 43:31.960
But it's still kind of fun to see

43:31.960 --> 43:32.960
You know

43:32.960 --> 43:33.960
Stuff based off your friends

43:33.960 --> 43:34.960
Or whatever so

43:34.960 --> 43:35.960
That's pretty cool

43:35.960 --> 43:36.960
Um

43:36.960 --> 43:37.960
Bobby Black Wolf says

43:37.960 --> 43:38.960
Yes every real week

43:38.960 --> 43:39.960
The season changes

43:39.960 --> 43:40.960
Interesting

43:40.960 --> 43:41.960
Bobby also points out

43:41.960 --> 43:42.960
That's just the Drivatar system

43:42.960 --> 43:43.960
Yeah

43:43.960 --> 43:44.960
Well the nice thing is

43:44.960 --> 43:45.960
You'll all see my license plate

43:45.960 --> 43:46.960
So my license plate was

43:46.960 --> 43:47.960
Hi

43:47.960 --> 43:49.960
That's my license plate

43:49.960 --> 43:50.960
H-I-E

43:50.960 --> 43:51.960
Hi

43:51.960 --> 43:52.960
So enjoy that

43:52.960 --> 43:53.960
Alright

43:53.960 --> 43:54.960
S2100 Matt says

43:54.960 --> 43:55.960
I need this game to come out already

43:55.960 --> 43:56.960
I also wish I had an Xbox One X

43:56.960 --> 43:58.960
And a 4K TV to fully enjoy it

43:58.960 --> 43:59.960
Uh

43:59.960 --> 44:00.960
What early access

44:00.960 --> 44:01.960
On September 28th

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
I don't believe in the early

44:02.960 --> 44:03.960
Like they want you to buy

44:03.960 --> 44:04.960
The Ultra

44:04.960 --> 44:05.960
Edition

44:05.960 --> 44:06.960
You know

44:06.960 --> 44:07.960
The like hundred dollar

44:07.960 --> 44:08.960
Forza

44:08.960 --> 44:09.960
Comes with early

44:09.960 --> 44:10.960
You don't need the game that quick

44:10.960 --> 44:11.960
Like give it a

44:11.960 --> 44:12.960
I think it comes out

44:12.960 --> 44:13.960
Like a week later

44:13.960 --> 44:14.960
For everybody else

44:14.960 --> 44:15.960
So

44:15.960 --> 44:16.960
Oh

44:16.960 --> 44:17.960
Yeah

44:17.960 --> 44:18.960
Maybe you do need the game that quick

44:18.960 --> 44:19.960
I don't know

44:19.960 --> 44:20.960
It's your money

44:20.960 --> 44:21.960
Spend it how you want

44:21.960 --> 44:22.960
It's only on the second

44:22.960 --> 44:23.960
I think

44:23.960 --> 44:24.960
Yeah

44:24.960 --> 44:25.960
You don't have to wait that long for it

44:25.960 --> 44:26.960
It's coming out soon

44:26.960 --> 44:27.960
Alright so that was my gaming week

44:27.960 --> 44:28.960
Let's move on

44:28.960 --> 44:29.960
Announcements

44:29.960 --> 44:30.960
I don't really have a lot of

44:30.960 --> 44:31.960
A ton of things to say

44:31.960 --> 44:32.960
Um

44:32.960 --> 44:33.960
Since we had the unexpected week off

44:33.960 --> 44:34.960
Earlier in the month

44:34.960 --> 44:35.960
We don't really have anything planned

44:35.960 --> 44:36.960
Until probably

44:36.960 --> 44:37.960
Um

44:37.960 --> 44:38.960
I don't even know if we'll be off the week

44:38.960 --> 44:39.960
Thanks

44:39.960 --> 44:40.960
Probably not until the holidays

44:40.960 --> 44:41.960
We'll be looking at any shows off

44:41.960 --> 44:42.960
At least planned ones

44:42.960 --> 44:43.960
Knock on wood

44:43.960 --> 44:45.960
Hopefully nothing unexpected happens

44:45.960 --> 44:46.960
Follow us on Twitter

44:46.960 --> 44:47.960

And we also have

44:51.960 --> 44:52.960
The Orange Lounge Radio

44:52.960 --> 44:54.960
Let's get into some longer news tonight

44:54.960 --> 44:55.960
And some other things that are happening

44:55.960 --> 44:56.960
In the gaming world

44:56.960 --> 44:57.960
Loki we'll start with you

44:57.960 --> 44:58.960
Yes

44:58.960 --> 45:01.960
It's the PlayStation Classic

45:01.960 --> 45:02.960
You might think

45:02.960 --> 45:03.960
Hey wait a second

45:03.960 --> 45:05.960
Isn't Nintendo the one that releases

45:05.960 --> 45:07.960
These consoles that are smaller

45:07.960 --> 45:08.960
That are a hundred bucks

45:08.960 --> 45:09.960
That have games in them

45:09.960 --> 45:10.960
But no

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
Sony wants to jump in on that

45:11.960 --> 45:14.960
Like they did on motion control

45:14.960 --> 45:16.960
And they want a piece of that action

45:16.960 --> 45:17.960
So

45:17.960 --> 45:18.960
Coming out December 3rd

45:18.960 --> 45:19.960
In US Canada

45:19.960 --> 45:20.960
Europe

45:20.960 --> 45:21.960
Japan and Australia

45:21.960 --> 45:22.960
You're gonna get

45:22.960 --> 45:24.960
A PlayStation Classic for

45:24.960 --> 45:25.960
99.99

45:25.960 --> 45:27.960
Or you know

45:27.960 --> 45:29.960
The equivalent in your territory

45:29.960 --> 45:32.960
And they will include 20 games

45:32.960 --> 45:35.960
As well as two controllers

45:35.960 --> 45:39.960
It won't include an AC adapter though

45:39.960 --> 45:41.960
But it will be bundled with USB cable

45:41.960 --> 45:43.960
That you can power it by

45:43.960 --> 45:44.960
I think that's dumb

45:44.960 --> 45:47.960
But whatever

45:47.960 --> 45:48.960
Games that they've announced so far

45:48.960 --> 45:49.960
They're gonna be in there

45:49.960 --> 45:50.960
Final Fantasy 7

45:50.960 --> 45:51.960
Jumping Flash

45:51.960 --> 45:52.960
Ridge Racer

45:52.960 --> 45:53.960
Type 4

45:53.960 --> 45:54.960
Tekken 3

45:54.960 --> 45:55.960
And Wild Arms

45:55.960 --> 45:58.960
It's not a bad lineup so far

45:58.960 --> 46:01.960
I'd be interested to see

46:01.960 --> 46:02.960
How we can hack this thing

46:02.960 --> 46:04.960
Cause you know it's gonna happen day one

46:04.960 --> 46:06.960
It always does

46:06.960 --> 46:08.960
I would even be more surprised

46:08.960 --> 46:10.960
If it isn't running the same hardware

46:10.960 --> 46:12.960
As the SNES Classic and stuff

46:12.960 --> 46:14.960
Cause I think those you can actually run

46:14.960 --> 46:16.960
PlayStation Emulators in as well

46:17.960 --> 46:18.960
But yeah

46:18.960 --> 46:20.960
This thing will be running Nintendo games

46:20.960 --> 46:21.960
In no time

46:21.960 --> 46:22.960
You know

46:22.960 --> 46:23.960
Okay speaking of all that

46:23.960 --> 46:24.960
Something I completely forgot

46:24.960 --> 46:25.960
And left out of my gaming week

46:25.960 --> 46:28.960
Was that I did play those NES Classics

46:28.960 --> 46:29.960
On Tuesday night

46:29.960 --> 46:30.960
Oh yeah

46:30.960 --> 46:31.960
I got the whole online thing

46:31.960 --> 46:32.960
And I purchased that

46:32.960 --> 46:33.960
And I looked at that

46:33.960 --> 46:34.960
I'm like

46:34.960 --> 46:35.960
No I played

46:35.960 --> 46:36.960
Bobby was streaming

46:36.960 --> 46:37.960
So I'm still having the cable issues at home

46:37.960 --> 46:38.960
So I can't stream to Twitch

46:38.960 --> 46:39.960
I mean I can do the radio show

46:39.960 --> 46:40.960
Cause it's low bandwidth

46:40.960 --> 46:42.960
But I can't do Twitch

46:42.960 --> 46:43.960
But I was like

46:43.960 --> 46:44.960
Well if I can't do my own stream

46:44.960 --> 46:45.960
I'll crash someone else's

46:45.960 --> 46:46.960
So I went on to Bobby

46:46.960 --> 46:47.960
You didn't fix your cable

46:47.960 --> 46:48.960
When they came out here

46:48.960 --> 46:50.960
Okay so long story short

46:50.960 --> 46:51.960
The guy that was here

46:51.960 --> 46:53.960
Like he definitely tried

46:53.960 --> 46:54.960
And he was definitely like

46:54.960 --> 46:55.960
Okay I do see a problem

46:55.960 --> 46:56.960
And he showed me

46:56.960 --> 46:57.960
And he listened to what I was saying

46:57.960 --> 46:58.960
And he like

46:58.960 --> 46:59.960
Okay yeah I get it

46:59.960 --> 47:00.960
I see what your problem is

47:00.960 --> 47:01.960
Cool

47:01.960 --> 47:02.960
And he actually went up the pole

47:02.960 --> 47:03.960
And looked and he's like

47:03.960 --> 47:04.960
Look at what I'm seeing

47:04.960 --> 47:05.960
He showed me

47:05.960 --> 47:06.960
He's like

47:06.960 --> 47:07.960
See all this noise here

47:07.960 --> 47:08.960
This is a problem

47:08.960 --> 47:09.960
I want to see which outlet

47:09.960 --> 47:10.960
Is coming from

47:10.960 --> 47:11.960
He looked at the outlets

47:11.960 --> 47:12.960
He said

47:12.960 --> 47:13.960
Okay your living room outlet

47:13.960 --> 47:14.960
Is a problem

47:14.960 --> 47:15.960
And he said

47:15.960 --> 47:16.960
Okay so see

47:16.960 --> 47:17.960
Now all the noise is gone

47:17.960 --> 47:18.960
So give it 24 hours

47:18.960 --> 47:19.960
And see where it's gonna be at from here

47:19.960 --> 47:20.960
So I was like

47:20.960 --> 47:21.960
Okay

47:21.960 --> 47:22.960
At least this guy listened to me

47:22.960 --> 47:23.960
He showed me something tangible

47:23.960 --> 47:24.960
He was working on

47:24.960 --> 47:25.960
I'm like totally like

47:25.960 --> 47:26.960
Happy

47:26.960 --> 47:27.960
But the problem is

47:27.960 --> 47:28.960
He didn't fix it

47:28.960 --> 47:29.960
I mean

47:29.960 --> 47:30.960
He tried

47:30.960 --> 47:31.960
You tried

47:31.960 --> 47:32.960
But unfortunately he didn't fix the issue

47:32.960 --> 47:33.960
So I gotta

47:33.960 --> 47:34.960
In all fairness

47:34.960 --> 47:36.960
Comcast was supposed to follow up with me

47:36.960 --> 47:37.960
They haven't

47:37.960 --> 47:39.960
So I'll have to run that up the flagpole again

47:39.960 --> 47:40.960
I've just been kinda

47:40.960 --> 47:42.960
On other things this week

47:42.960 --> 47:43.960
Where I'm just kinda getting used to this life

47:43.960 --> 47:44.960
Where it's like

47:44.960 --> 47:45.960
I guess I'm not gonna be able to stream to Twitch

47:45.960 --> 47:47.960
Although that's gonna be a problem

47:47.960 --> 47:49.960
When this show wants to move to Twitch

47:49.960 --> 47:50.960
But uh

47:50.960 --> 47:51.960
We'll just have to cross that bridge

47:51.960 --> 47:52.960
And we get to it

47:52.960 --> 47:54.960
We may have to move the place we do this show

47:54.960 --> 47:55.960
We'll see

47:55.960 --> 47:57.960
Well I hear that Verizon's got

47:57.960 --> 47:59.960
Their 5G or whatever that they're offering now

47:59.960 --> 48:00.960
With their service

48:00.960 --> 48:01.960
For 50 bucks a month

48:01.960 --> 48:02.960
Gigabit down

48:02.960 --> 48:03.960
And apparently

48:03.960 --> 48:04.960
Um

48:04.960 --> 48:06.960
It's in Sacramento

48:06.960 --> 48:07.960
Sure

48:07.960 --> 48:08.960
Not where I live

48:08.960 --> 48:09.960
Yeah

48:09.960 --> 48:11.960
Slightly outside of Sacramento

48:11.960 --> 48:12.960
But in Sacramento proper

48:12.960 --> 48:13.960
They get all the fucking nice shit

48:13.960 --> 48:15.960
Does that count Sacramento County

48:15.960 --> 48:16.960
Because I'm not in Sacramento proper

48:16.960 --> 48:17.960
I'm in Sacramento County

48:17.960 --> 48:18.960
Yeah

48:18.960 --> 48:19.960
Yeah

48:19.960 --> 48:20.960
Exactly

48:20.960 --> 48:21.960
So anyway

48:21.960 --> 48:22.960
But you're closer

48:22.960 --> 48:23.960
Than I am so

48:23.960 --> 48:24.960
So anyway

48:24.960 --> 48:25.960
No resolution to that yet

48:25.960 --> 48:27.960
So I was crashing Bobby's stream

48:27.960 --> 48:28.960
And we were playing

48:28.960 --> 48:30.960
Now we tried to play the online multiplayer

48:30.960 --> 48:32.960
It did lag a little bit

48:32.960 --> 48:34.960
Like I could feel

48:34.960 --> 48:35.960
A little sluggishness

48:35.960 --> 48:36.960
Like playing

48:36.960 --> 48:37.960
Muddy waters type of thing

48:37.960 --> 48:38.960
Like when I was playing

48:38.960 --> 48:39.960
Super Mario Brothers

48:39.960 --> 48:40.960
Like this doesn't

48:40.960 --> 48:41.960
This doesn't snap

48:41.960 --> 48:42.960
The way it should

48:42.960 --> 48:43.960
When I play it usually

48:43.960 --> 48:44.960
Like it wasn't horrific

48:44.960 --> 48:46.960
But it was definitely noticeable

48:46.960 --> 48:48.960
But what we did

48:48.960 --> 48:49.960
And we don't know what that could

48:49.960 --> 48:51.960
Could that be my cable problems at home

48:51.960 --> 48:52.960
Could that be the fact

48:52.960 --> 48:53.960
He's streaming

48:53.960 --> 48:54.960
And doing the NES

48:54.960 --> 48:55.960
Who knows

48:55.960 --> 48:57.960
So we put it into low latency mode

48:57.960 --> 48:58.960
And it was fine

48:58.960 --> 49:00.960
So if you have problems playing

49:00.960 --> 49:01.960
Online with your friends

49:01.960 --> 49:03.960
Go look for that low latency mode

49:03.960 --> 49:04.960
And turn it on

49:04.960 --> 49:05.960
Because I don't know why

49:05.960 --> 49:08.960
Low latency isn't on by default

49:08.960 --> 49:10.960
But for whatever reason it's not

49:10.960 --> 49:12.960
Why is there even a mode to turn that on

49:12.960 --> 49:14.960
If that makes it run good

49:14.960 --> 49:15.960
I don't understand

49:15.960 --> 49:16.960
Like what

49:16.960 --> 49:17.960
I'm not sure

49:17.960 --> 49:18.960
Maybe somebody in chat knows

49:18.960 --> 49:19.960
Maybe Bobby or something

49:19.960 --> 49:20.960
What are you sacrificing

49:20.960 --> 49:21.960
To get low latency

49:21.960 --> 49:22.960
Because that's where my mind is

49:22.960 --> 49:24.960
Like why would that not be the norm

49:24.960 --> 49:26.960
Is it that I can't stream the whole game

49:26.960 --> 49:28.960
I mean literally the game downloads

49:28.960 --> 49:29.960
Faster than a

49:29.960 --> 49:30.960
You know

49:30.960 --> 49:31.960
Than a web page

49:31.960 --> 49:32.960
I don't understand what

49:32.960 --> 49:34.960
What you would be

49:34.960 --> 49:35.960
Sacrificing in low latency

49:35.960 --> 49:37.960
Yeah I didn't understand that either

49:37.960 --> 49:38.960
But anyway

49:39.960 --> 49:41.960
To register participation

49:41.960 --> 49:42.960
For this week's episode

49:42.960 --> 49:43.960
Of Orange Lounge Radio

49:43.960 --> 49:44.960
At vognetwork.com

49:44.960 --> 49:45.960
Use the passphrase

49:45.960 --> 49:46.960
COAST

49:46.960 --> 49:48.960
It worked fine in low latency mode

49:48.960 --> 49:49.960
And we had a good time

49:49.960 --> 49:50.960
It's just that

49:50.960 --> 49:51.960
There's not a lot of like

49:51.960 --> 49:52.960
Riveting two player games

49:52.960 --> 49:53.960
We played Dr. Mario

49:53.960 --> 49:54.960
We tried to play Double Dragon

49:54.960 --> 49:55.960
And then realized

49:55.960 --> 49:56.960
Oh yeah

49:56.960 --> 49:57.960
NES Double Dragon

49:57.960 --> 49:59.960
They had that shitty little versus mode

49:59.960 --> 50:00.960
For two player

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
But the game itself

50:01.960 --> 50:03.960
Was not two player simultaneous

50:03.960 --> 50:04.960
Like it was in the arcade

50:04.960 --> 50:05.960
I think Double Dragon 2 had that

50:05.960 --> 50:07.960
But not the first Double Dragon

50:07.960 --> 50:08.960
So

50:08.960 --> 50:09.960
It didn't

50:09.960 --> 50:10.960
I know right

50:10.960 --> 50:11.960
It didn't

50:11.960 --> 50:12.960
No it didn't

50:12.960 --> 50:13.960
And so

50:13.960 --> 50:14.960
I don't know

50:14.960 --> 50:15.960
We were going to play

50:15.960 --> 50:16.960
River City Ransom

50:16.960 --> 50:17.960
But then by that time

50:17.960 --> 50:18.960
Dinner was done

50:18.960 --> 50:19.960
So we never

50:19.960 --> 50:20.960
Got around to playing

50:20.960 --> 50:21.960
That stuff

50:21.960 --> 50:22.960
So maybe a stream

50:22.960 --> 50:23.960
Later in the week

50:23.960 --> 50:24.960
I don't know

50:24.960 --> 50:25.960
But anyway

50:25.960 --> 50:26.960
The reason why I brought all that up

50:26.960 --> 50:27.960
It does tie into the Sony thing

50:27.960 --> 50:28.960
I'm not trying to take the spotlight off this

50:28.960 --> 50:29.960
But you were talking about

50:29.960 --> 50:30.960
When does that thing get hacked

50:30.960 --> 50:31.960
Well the Nintendo thing

50:31.960 --> 50:33.960
Got hacked within 24 hours

50:33.960 --> 50:35.960
They were running Kirby on that thing

50:35.960 --> 50:36.960
By loading the ROM

50:36.960 --> 50:37.960
So

50:37.960 --> 50:38.960
And that's

50:38.960 --> 50:39.960
Was kind of

50:39.960 --> 50:40.960
A shocking

50:40.960 --> 50:41.960
Well I don't want to say shocked

50:41.960 --> 50:42.960
You probably weren't shocked Loki

50:42.960 --> 50:43.960
But in some ways I think

50:43.960 --> 50:44.960
I was so surprised

50:44.960 --> 50:45.960
Some of us were really

50:45.960 --> 50:47.960
Having to deal with the reality of

50:47.960 --> 50:49.960
Nintendo was not doing anything

50:49.960 --> 50:50.960
To tweak these games

50:50.960 --> 50:51.960
To run online

50:51.960 --> 50:52.960
They were not in there

50:52.960 --> 50:53.960
Doing with the code or anything

50:53.960 --> 50:57.960
Nintendo is artificially holding back

50:57.960 --> 50:59.960
Releasing games on this thing

50:59.960 --> 51:01.960
Because there is nothing

51:01.960 --> 51:02.960
To prevent

51:02.960 --> 51:04.960
Nintendo first party titles anyway

51:04.960 --> 51:06.960
From being on Netflix today

51:06.960 --> 51:08.960
Like Super Mario Brothers 2

51:08.960 --> 51:10.960
No reason that should be missing right now

51:10.960 --> 51:12.960
Kirby

51:12.960 --> 51:14.960
No reason that should be missing right now

51:14.960 --> 51:15.960
Things that are first party

51:15.960 --> 51:17.960
Now I completely understand

51:17.960 --> 51:19.960
You may have licensing things with Konami

51:19.960 --> 51:21.960
Although they have Gradius today

51:21.960 --> 51:22.960
You may still have things with Capcom

51:22.960 --> 51:23.960
You know I understand

51:23.960 --> 51:25.960
Not everything could be there

51:25.960 --> 51:26.960
Especially third party stuff

51:26.960 --> 51:28.960
But as far as Nintendo first party stuff

51:28.960 --> 51:31.960
It is artificially being held back

51:31.960 --> 51:32.960
And so

51:32.960 --> 51:34.960
I think a lot of us are kind of having to

51:34.960 --> 51:35.960
Swallow that pill this week

51:35.960 --> 51:36.960
That you know

51:36.960 --> 51:37.960
Alright

51:37.960 --> 51:39.960
This is how Nintendo is going to do it

51:39.960 --> 51:40.960
I mean

51:40.960 --> 51:42.960
Is it still the better alternative

51:42.960 --> 51:43.960
To charging five dollars a game

51:43.960 --> 51:44.960
Probably

51:44.960 --> 51:46.960
But it is a little bit frustrating

51:46.960 --> 51:48.960
That this could have been a big thing

51:48.960 --> 51:50.960
This thing could have landed with a thud

51:50.960 --> 51:52.960
And now it's kind of landing with a

51:52.960 --> 51:53.960
Okay

51:53.960 --> 51:54.960
Neat

51:54.960 --> 51:55.960
Yeah they could have said

51:55.960 --> 51:56.960
Hey Virtual Console 2.0

51:56.960 --> 51:58.960
Now they have multiplayer

51:58.960 --> 51:59.960
Here's a ton of games

51:59.960 --> 52:00.960
We're going to sell to you

52:00.960 --> 52:01.960
For like five bucks each

52:01.960 --> 52:02.960
Or whatever

52:02.960 --> 52:03.960
And people are like

52:03.960 --> 52:04.960
Oh yeah

52:04.960 --> 52:05.960
And they could have made so much money

52:05.960 --> 52:06.960
And kept

52:06.960 --> 52:07.960
And

52:07.960 --> 52:09.960
Kept multiplayer free

52:09.960 --> 52:10.960
So they would have

52:10.960 --> 52:11.960
You know

52:11.960 --> 52:12.960
The advantage of showing

52:12.960 --> 52:13.960
Oh hey

52:13.960 --> 52:14.960
We don't

52:14.960 --> 52:15.960
Because you know

52:15.960 --> 52:16.960
They could probably make up that

52:16.960 --> 52:17.960
Twenty bucks in Virtual Console sales

52:17.960 --> 52:18.960
Easy

52:18.960 --> 52:19.960
You know

52:19.960 --> 52:20.960
Because some people are going to purchase

52:20.960 --> 52:21.960
More some less

52:21.960 --> 52:22.960
And they could have

52:22.960 --> 52:23.960
Hey look

52:23.960 --> 52:25.960
We don't charge for our multiplayer

52:25.960 --> 52:26.960
But no

52:26.960 --> 52:27.960
No

52:27.960 --> 52:28.960
They didn't do that

52:28.960 --> 52:29.960
Instead

52:29.960 --> 52:30.960
Nintendo fans

52:30.960 --> 52:31.960
Are going to stop them

52:31.960 --> 52:32.960
Hackers proved

52:32.960 --> 52:33.960
That

52:33.960 --> 52:34.960
This hold back is artificial

52:34.960 --> 52:35.960
This week

52:35.960 --> 52:36.960
So

52:36.960 --> 52:37.960
Take

52:37.960 --> 52:38.960
Take what it is

52:38.960 --> 52:39.960
Uh

52:39.960 --> 52:40.960
Let's see

52:40.960 --> 52:41.960
Act Efton Chat says

52:41.960 --> 52:42.960
I can play Kirby's Adventure

52:42.960 --> 52:43.960
And I have it on the Wii

52:43.960 --> 52:44.960
And 3DS on the 3D Classic

52:44.960 --> 52:45.960
So I can wait

52:45.960 --> 52:46.960
Uh

52:46.960 --> 52:47.960
Dark Tetsuya says

52:47.960 --> 52:48.960
My only explanation is

52:48.960 --> 52:49.960
Perhaps they didn't want people

52:49.960 --> 52:50.960
To be overwhelmed

52:50.960 --> 52:52.960
With a hundred games at launch

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
Why not though?

52:53.960 --> 52:55.960
Imagine what a bombshell that would have been

52:55.960 --> 52:56.960
If it's like

52:56.960 --> 52:57.960
Dude we just opened the fucking floodgates

52:57.960 --> 52:59.960
I can think of one reason

52:59.960 --> 53:00.960
Their eShop

53:00.960 --> 53:01.960
Is

53:01.960 --> 53:02.960
Fucking

53:02.960 --> 53:03.960
Terrible

53:03.960 --> 53:04.960
Is why

53:04.960 --> 53:05.960
And discoverability on that

53:05.960 --> 53:06.960
Would be fucking terrible

53:06.960 --> 53:08.960
It's all in one package

53:08.960 --> 53:09.960
Oh yeah

53:09.960 --> 53:10.960
You're not downloading game

53:10.960 --> 53:11.960
By game by game

53:11.960 --> 53:12.960
It's one

53:12.960 --> 53:13.960
NES

53:13.960 --> 53:14.960
And then once you get in there

53:14.960 --> 53:15.960
You have all the different box arts

53:15.960 --> 53:16.960
And things

53:16.960 --> 53:17.960
But I believe

53:17.960 --> 53:18.960
I didn't play a lot with this

53:18.960 --> 53:19.960
I believe you can rearrange them

53:19.960 --> 53:21.960
And pin your favorites to the top

53:21.960 --> 53:22.960
You can kind of play with it

53:22.960 --> 53:24.960
It's no worse than

53:24.960 --> 53:27.960
Actually using Netflix

53:27.960 --> 53:28.960
And I'm sure when the library

53:28.960 --> 53:29.960
Does get bigger

53:29.960 --> 53:30.960
You'll probably see similar

53:30.960 --> 53:31.960
Stuff

53:31.960 --> 53:32.960
Is it to not devalue the

53:32.960 --> 53:33.960
NES Classic

53:33.960 --> 53:34.960
Maybe?

53:34.960 --> 53:35.960
I mean

53:35.960 --> 53:36.960
Maybe

53:36.960 --> 53:37.960
Because like

53:37.960 --> 53:38.960
Isn't there a lot of overlap

53:38.960 --> 53:39.960
In the NES Classic

53:39.960 --> 53:40.960
In what this offers

53:40.960 --> 53:41.960
I mean as far as like games

53:41.960 --> 53:42.960
Uh

53:42.960 --> 53:43.960
There

53:43.960 --> 53:44.960
It's not a hundred percent

53:44.960 --> 53:45.960
But certainly

53:45.960 --> 53:46.960
Things like Mario Brothers

53:46.960 --> 53:47.960
Mario 3

53:47.960 --> 53:48.960
Zelda

53:48.960 --> 53:49.960
Absolutely there's overlap

53:49.960 --> 53:50.960
But there are things

53:50.960 --> 53:51.960
Like Simon's Quest

53:51.960 --> 53:52.960
Is on the NES Classic

53:52.960 --> 53:53.960
It is not on

53:53.960 --> 53:54.960
The Nintendo Switch thing

53:54.960 --> 53:55.960
The Nintendo Switch thing

53:55.960 --> 53:56.960
Has

53:56.960 --> 53:57.960
Um

53:57.960 --> 53:58.960
I don't believe

53:58.960 --> 53:59.960
Is on the NES Classic

53:59.960 --> 54:00.960
No I don't think so

54:00.960 --> 54:01.960
So

54:01.960 --> 54:02.960
You know

54:02.960 --> 54:03.960
There are games on the

54:03.960 --> 54:04.960
Swi-

54:04.960 --> 54:05.960
So it's not a hundred percent

54:05.960 --> 54:06.960
Overlap

54:06.960 --> 54:07.960
But the

54:07.960 --> 54:08.960
The first party stuff

54:08.960 --> 54:09.960
Is mostly overlap

54:09.960 --> 54:10.960
I think

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
I don't think Ice Hockey

54:11.960 --> 54:12.960
Is on the

54:12.960 --> 54:13.960
NES Classic

54:13.960 --> 54:14.960
It is

54:14.960 --> 54:15.960
I only

54:15.960 --> 54:16.960
Impartial of that

54:16.960 --> 54:17.960
Because I actually

54:17.960 --> 54:18.960
Some of those black box games

54:18.960 --> 54:19.960
Man I could just do without

54:19.960 --> 54:20.960
Yeah

54:20.960 --> 54:21.960
I mean

54:21.960 --> 54:22.960
Sports ones

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
Nah I know

54:23.960 --> 54:24.960
Forget that

54:24.960 --> 54:25.960
Alright

54:25.960 --> 54:26.960
You need Blades of Steel now

54:26.960 --> 54:27.960
I'm sorry

54:27.960 --> 54:28.960
To deviate the conversation

54:28.960 --> 54:29.960
But I thought that

54:29.960 --> 54:30.960
That hacking point

54:30.960 --> 54:31.960
Kind of opened the door

54:31.960 --> 54:32.960
To this other thing

54:32.960 --> 54:33.960
That was really important

54:33.960 --> 54:34.960
So talking about

54:34.960 --> 54:35.960
The Sony thing for a minute

54:35.960 --> 54:36.960
Where's your head at

54:36.960 --> 54:37.960
With this Loki

54:37.960 --> 54:38.960
Because for me

54:38.960 --> 54:39.960
I'm

54:39.960 --> 54:40.960
I'm kind of burned out

54:40.960 --> 54:41.960
On these classic things

54:41.960 --> 54:42.960
And this Sony thing

54:42.960 --> 54:43.960
I'm sorry

54:43.960 --> 54:44.960
This Sony thing

54:44.960 --> 54:45.960
Does not sound like

54:45.960 --> 54:46.960
It's worth

54:46.960 --> 54:47.960
The premium price

54:47.960 --> 54:48.960
They're charging for it

54:48.960 --> 54:49.960
Um

54:49.960 --> 54:50.960
I have to see

54:50.960 --> 54:51.960
What other games are in there

54:51.960 --> 54:52.960
I like

54:52.960 --> 54:53.960
The idea

54:53.960 --> 54:54.960
Of it

54:54.960 --> 54:55.960
Um

54:55.960 --> 54:56.960
I like

54:56.960 --> 54:57.960
The better idea

54:57.960 --> 54:58.960
Of hacking it apart

54:58.960 --> 54:59.960
Because

54:59.960 --> 55:00.960
You know the storage on that sucker

55:00.960 --> 55:01.960
Is going to be pretty big

55:01.960 --> 55:02.960
If it's got

55:02.960 --> 55:03.960
You know

55:03.960 --> 55:04.960
20 CD-ROM games in there

55:04.960 --> 55:05.960
I mean

55:05.960 --> 55:06.960
Especially when you're talking

55:06.960 --> 55:07.960
Final Fantasy 7

55:07.960 --> 55:08.960
Is three CD-ROMs

55:08.960 --> 55:09.960
Right

55:09.960 --> 55:10.960
Um

55:10.960 --> 55:11.960
And I think Wild Arms

55:11.960 --> 55:12.960
Is multiple as well

55:12.960 --> 55:13.960
So

55:13.960 --> 55:14.960
It'd be interesting to see

55:14.960 --> 55:15.960
How that works

55:15.960 --> 55:16.960
But

55:16.960 --> 55:17.960
See especially

55:17.960 --> 55:18.960
Like Final Fantasy 7

55:18.960 --> 55:19.960
There's a great title

55:19.960 --> 55:20.960
That I'm just

55:20.960 --> 55:21.960
I'm burned out on it now

55:21.960 --> 55:22.960
Yeah

55:22.960 --> 55:23.960
I don't really care about 7

55:23.960 --> 55:24.960
So much being on there

55:24.960 --> 55:25.960
I mean like

55:25.960 --> 55:27.120
It would be better though

55:27.120 --> 55:28.120
If it was just on the

55:28.120 --> 55:29.640
Goddamn PlayStation 4

55:29.640 --> 55:30.640
Thank you

55:30.640 --> 55:31.640
Is what it is

55:31.640 --> 55:32.640
Thank you

55:32.640 --> 55:33.640
And they sell them

55:33.640 --> 55:34.640
On the PlayStation 4

55:34.640 --> 55:35.640
It's like these remasters

55:35.640 --> 55:36.640
But

55:36.640 --> 55:37.640
So but

55:37.640 --> 55:38.640
By the way guys

55:38.640 --> 55:39.640
This thing

55:39.640 --> 55:40.640
With the classes

55:40.640 --> 55:41.640
This answers the question

55:41.640 --> 55:42.720
When will PlayStation 1 games

55:42.720 --> 55:44.280
Be playable on PlayStation 4

55:44.280 --> 55:45.280
Here's your answer

55:45.280 --> 55:46.280
Never

55:46.280 --> 55:47.280
This proves it

55:47.280 --> 55:48.280
Never

55:48.280 --> 55:49.280
This is not in Sony's plan

55:49.280 --> 55:50.280
To ever make those

55:50.280 --> 55:51.280
PlayStation 1 games

55:51.280 --> 55:52.280
That you just pop in your disc

55:52.280 --> 55:53.280
And play them on the PlayStation 4

55:53.280 --> 55:54.280
Nope

55:54.280 --> 55:55.280
So guys now showing them

55:55.280 --> 55:56.280
Hey you could charge them for it

55:56.280 --> 55:57.280
All over again

55:57.280 --> 55:58.280
And get away with it

55:58.280 --> 55:59.280
And now they're gonna do it

55:59.280 --> 56:00.280
And

56:00.280 --> 56:01.280
But for me honestly

56:01.280 --> 56:02.280
Again

56:02.280 --> 56:03.280
They're charging a premium price

56:03.280 --> 56:04.280
For this compared to Nintendo

56:04.280 --> 56:05.960
I realize it's a more advanced console

56:05.960 --> 56:06.960
But it's

56:06.960 --> 56:08.080
It's over 20 years old

56:08.080 --> 56:10.280
None of it is that advanced anymore

56:10.280 --> 56:11.880
They're charging a hundred bucks for it

56:11.880 --> 56:12.960
And they are shorting you

56:12.960 --> 56:14.840
With the power cord

56:14.840 --> 56:15.840
Which I understand

56:15.840 --> 56:17.440
Like 3DS's don't come with chargers

56:17.440 --> 56:18.440
But this is

56:18.440 --> 56:19.520
This is a different conversation

56:19.520 --> 56:20.520
With these classics

56:20.520 --> 56:21.520
Because what

56:21.520 --> 56:22.520
It's USB power

56:22.520 --> 56:23.520
So they

56:23.760 --> 56:24.760
They plug it into your TV

56:24.760 --> 56:25.760
That's USB powered or something

56:25.760 --> 56:26.760
I don't know

56:26.760 --> 56:27.760
Eh

56:27.760 --> 56:28.760
So or you have a charger

56:28.760 --> 56:29.760
Or buy a Sony charger

56:29.760 --> 56:30.760
Uh

56:30.760 --> 56:31.760
So for whatever reason

56:31.760 --> 56:32.760
They're skimming on that

56:32.760 --> 56:34.040
My biggest thing that surprises me

56:34.040 --> 56:35.680
Is the lack of DualShock

56:35.680 --> 56:36.680
That

56:36.680 --> 56:38.040
When Sony got the DualShock

56:38.040 --> 56:39.080
Was when the PlayStation

56:39.080 --> 56:40.080
Really start to

56:40.080 --> 56:41.080
Took off

56:41.080 --> 56:42.080
Take off

56:42.080 --> 56:43.080
Because I don't know

56:43.080 --> 56:44.080
If you guys remember

56:44.080 --> 56:45.080
The PlayStation at first

56:45.080 --> 56:46.360
Did not take off

56:46.360 --> 56:47.360
The way that it did

56:47.360 --> 56:48.360
A couple

56:48.360 --> 56:49.360
Like remember when the PlayStation games

56:49.360 --> 56:51.520
Were in those big ol' boxes

56:51.520 --> 56:52.520
That's when they

56:52.520 --> 56:53.520
The first came out

56:53.520 --> 56:54.520
The PlayStation games

56:54.520 --> 56:55.520
Were in those big ol' boxes

56:55.520 --> 56:56.520
It wasn't until like

56:56.520 --> 56:57.520
A year or two later

56:57.520 --> 56:58.520
When DualShock came out

56:58.520 --> 56:59.520
They kind of soft relaunched

56:59.520 --> 57:00.520
The system

57:00.520 --> 57:01.520
With some of the games

57:01.520 --> 57:02.520
That they had then

57:02.520 --> 57:03.520
And then they started

57:03.520 --> 57:04.520
They scaled it down

57:04.520 --> 57:05.520
To the CD size stuff

57:05.520 --> 57:06.520
And you know

57:06.520 --> 57:07.520
It started selling a lot better

57:07.520 --> 57:08.520
So it's really weird to me

57:08.520 --> 57:09.520
That this mini system

57:09.520 --> 57:11.520
Represents that earlier era

57:11.520 --> 57:12.520
Of PlayStation

57:12.520 --> 57:15.520
Even though it's in the mini form

57:15.520 --> 57:16.520
Uh

57:16.520 --> 57:17.520
And not the later era

57:17.520 --> 57:18.520
Of PlayStation

57:18.520 --> 57:19.520
It's just kind of weird to me

57:19.520 --> 57:20.520
So

57:20.520 --> 57:21.520
Yeah

57:21.520 --> 57:22.520
I don't know

57:22.520 --> 57:23.520
I'm curious

57:23.520 --> 57:24.520
I don't know

57:24.520 --> 57:25.520
I

57:25.520 --> 57:26.520
Kaijuto says

57:26.520 --> 57:27.520
No I don't want that shit

57:27.520 --> 57:28.520
On my PlayStation 4

57:28.520 --> 57:29.520
Well

57:29.520 --> 57:30.520
Okay

57:30.520 --> 57:31.520
But some of us do

57:31.520 --> 57:33.520
I still enjoy playing retro classics

57:33.520 --> 57:34.520
They have like PlayStation

57:34.520 --> 57:36.520
I have a copy of Tekken 3

57:36.520 --> 57:37.520
Like

57:37.520 --> 57:38.520
I have some of the old

57:38.520 --> 57:39.520
Like PlayStation 2 games

57:39.520 --> 57:40.520
That they've remastered

57:40.520 --> 57:41.520
Or whatever

57:41.520 --> 57:42.520
Like they have

57:42.520 --> 57:43.520
Uh

57:43.520 --> 57:45.520
Like the Warriors for example

57:45.520 --> 57:46.520
Or

57:46.520 --> 57:47.520
But at least they remastered those

57:47.520 --> 57:48.520
At least they remastered those

57:48.520 --> 57:49.520
Well

57:49.520 --> 57:50.520
I mean

57:51.520 --> 57:52.520
I still have my Blamecast

57:52.520 --> 57:53.520
It would be nice

57:53.520 --> 57:55.520
To be able to just pop in the PS1 disc

57:55.520 --> 57:56.520
Like I did on the PlayStation 3

57:56.520 --> 57:58.520
That kind of set that expectation

57:58.520 --> 57:59.520
If you're wondering like

57:59.520 --> 58:02.520
Why am I holding Sony accountable to this

58:02.520 --> 58:04.520
Because you could do it on the PlayStation 3

58:04.520 --> 58:06.520
And so it feels like it's a little bit of a step backwards

58:06.520 --> 58:07.520
And

58:07.520 --> 58:08.520
Let's not forget

58:08.520 --> 58:09.520
Microsoft is sitting over here

58:09.520 --> 58:10.520
Trying to work

58:10.520 --> 58:12.520
To make original Xbox games playable

58:12.520 --> 58:13.520
On Xbox One

58:13.520 --> 58:14.520
Well here's the other funnier thing too

58:14.520 --> 58:15.520
When you think about this too

58:15.520 --> 58:16.520
Like

58:16.520 --> 58:18.520
And I saw the comparisons almost immediately

58:18.520 --> 58:19.520
When the PlayStation Classic came out

58:19.520 --> 58:20.520
They're like

58:20.520 --> 58:21.520
PlayStation Classic

58:21.520 --> 58:25.520
Can play all these PlayStation 1 games

58:25.520 --> 58:27.520
Or you could get a PlayStation TV

58:27.520 --> 58:29.520
For like 30 bucks

58:29.520 --> 58:31.520
Have DualShock support

58:31.520 --> 58:33.520
And it could also play PlayStation 1 games

58:33.520 --> 58:35.520
And Vita games

58:35.520 --> 58:37.520
And whatever else that you want to throw on there

58:37.520 --> 58:38.520
I mean

58:38.520 --> 58:39.520
That's the other rub too

58:39.520 --> 58:40.520
Is like

58:40.520 --> 58:42.520
Well you could have supported that system

58:42.520 --> 58:44.520
And it could have done all this shit as well

58:44.520 --> 58:46.520
And it didn't cost as much

58:46.520 --> 58:47.520
Bobby Blackwolf in chat is asking

58:47.520 --> 58:50.520
So in 20 years what will be on the PlayStation 4 Classic?

58:50.520 --> 58:51.520
Uh

58:51.520 --> 58:52.520
Horizon Zero Dawn

58:52.520 --> 58:53.520
Last Guardian

58:53.520 --> 58:54.520
Um

58:54.520 --> 58:56.520
Probably like a lot of the first party Sony stuff

58:56.520 --> 58:57.520
Spider-Man

58:57.520 --> 58:58.520
Oh sure

58:58.520 --> 58:59.520
Oh yeah the Spider-Man game

58:59.520 --> 59:00.520
Infamous

59:00.520 --> 59:01.520
Uh

59:01.520 --> 59:02.520
The Last of Us remastered

59:02.520 --> 59:03.520
Definitive Edition

59:03.520 --> 59:04.520
Whatever it is

59:04.520 --> 59:06.520
Last of Us 2 inevitably will be something that would probably be on there too

59:06.520 --> 59:08.520
Or the PlayStation 3 Classic

59:08.520 --> 59:10.520
Which will not have Rumble either

59:10.520 --> 59:12.520
Because it's gonna just be 6X's

59:12.520 --> 59:14.520
It's not gonna be before they have the DualShock 3

59:14.520 --> 59:15.520
You know back when they were like

59:15.520 --> 59:16.520
You don't need Rumble

59:16.520 --> 59:19.520
We didn't pay the license ad again

59:19.520 --> 59:20.520
But you don't need it

59:20.520 --> 59:22.520
Alright well speaking of classics

59:22.520 --> 59:25.520
I know this is one that folks here at Orange Lounge Radio can get behind

59:25.520 --> 59:27.520
Did you know

59:27.520 --> 59:32.520
Dance Dance Revolution's 20th anniversary is this week

59:32.520 --> 59:34.520
In fact in two days

59:34.520 --> 59:37.520
Konami is scheduled to make some sort of announcement

59:37.520 --> 59:38.520
Uh

59:38.520 --> 59:39.520
To celebrate

59:39.520 --> 59:40.520
Please don't suck

59:40.520 --> 59:41.520
20th anniversary

59:41.520 --> 59:43.520
Could that be a new home version?

59:43.520 --> 59:46.520
Or is it more likely a new release in arcades

59:46.520 --> 59:49.520
I think maybe a new release in arcades

59:49.520 --> 59:50.520
Maybe

59:50.520 --> 59:51.520
Hopefully not a mobile game

59:51.520 --> 59:52.520
But like you know

59:52.520 --> 59:53.520
Oh god

59:53.520 --> 59:55.520
Not a mobile game

59:55.520 --> 59:56.520
Shake out

59:56.520 --> 59:59.520
I hope it's a new game

59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.520
It's been a couple years since Ace

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.520
Yeah it's been a couple years since Ace

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.520
Although I thought Ace was supposed to be the game that's like forever expandable

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.520
But maybe you know maybe they'll

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.520
Yeah well so are like all the other like

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.520
Beatmania games

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520
I know

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.520
So what would DDR be

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.520
Will be the big 20th anniversary

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.520
No they'll go with some stupid naming convention like they have with 2DX

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.520
Like it's just

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520
Call whatever they want

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.520
Whatever the fuck they want to call it

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.520
20

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.520
DDR20

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.520
Yeah pumpkin spice

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.520
Pumpkin spice mix

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520
I like that

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520
You know I'd be down for that

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520
Dark Tetsuya thinks

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.520
I'm thinking DDRXX

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.520
No too many people

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.520
Especially

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.520
They are gonna be thinking about America at least a little bit

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.520
And they know that DDRXX

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.520
Is too close to DDRXX

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.520
Which is gonna have a very different type of connotation

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.520
No I would

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.520
I would hope something that

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520
I don't know

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.520
I just hope it's not lame

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.520
Maybe DDRXX or something

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.520
I don't know

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520
But I thought about

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520
Well and X is too confusing too

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.520
Cause X is it's own series so

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.520
True

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.520
And so they can't really

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.520
And they already have an X2

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.520
That's true

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.520
So they can't really do that

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.520
I mean

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.520
Let's just go max 3

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.520
That's just extreme

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.520
They already extreme too

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.520
DDR20th mix

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.520
Just call it that

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.520
20th anniversary yeah

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.520
Well I mean

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.520
It's

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.520
Isn't it weird to think though

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.520
DDR is 20 years old

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.520
And we were kind of there at the beginning-ish

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.520
I mean

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520
What this show

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.520
OLR started

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.520
4 years into that right

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.520
Cause we started 2002

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.520
And I think most of us were playing DDR first in 2001

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520
If not sooner

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.520
Like Jamie was probably there in 99

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.520
I remember seeing it in 2000

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.520
Well I had my

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.520
My birthday

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.520
I got my second mix

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520
For Dreamcast

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.520
But yeah I think I was playing

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.520
I wanna say around 2000

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.520
Cause we had found

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.520
Where did we find that machine?

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.520
It wasn't at Golfland

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520
It was

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.520
We all met in 2000

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520
You were playing before then

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520
Cause we all met in 2000

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.520
Cause that was

01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520
I played at Anime Expo

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520
Yeah

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.520
That was the year I lived at Melrose Place

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520
It was 2000

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.520
January 2000

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.520
Yeah

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.520
At Anime Expo Disneyland

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.520
And they had a third mix there

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.520
And they told me how to do Vivid

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.520
And I was singing along with Xanadu

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520
You know

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.520
And like

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.520
I thought you never played before

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.520
People would say

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.520
And be like

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.520
But I've seen Xanadu 57 million times

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.520
It's Olivia Newton-John

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.520
Olivia Newton-John people

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.520
Is that why it's called the Olivia Pro-

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520
No shit

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.520
As the same Anime Expo where

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.520
The Chair

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.520
The Chair was a character of that Anime Expo

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.520
I wasn't

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.520
I wasn't around for this

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.520
The Chair

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520
The Chair

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520
I've never been to Anime Expo

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.520
And I plan to keep it that way

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.520
I have a picture of Chair

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.520
On the DDR machine

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520
Okay

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520
This was yeah

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520
This was the one time it was the Disneyland hotel

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520
And the cosplayers kept getting kicked out of the park

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.520
Oh I heard about all that fuckery

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.520
It's the reason why they didn't do it there again since

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.520
Alright anyway

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.520
SD200Matt talking about DDR20 in our chat saying

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.520
So a few months ago

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.520
The top DDR players took to Twitter

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.520
To ask Konami

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.520
Make things better with DDR with a number

01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.520
I don't remember what it was

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.520
Konami actually responded to them

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.520
And said

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.520
We hear you and we have big things in the works

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.520
And then we got

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.520
Dancing Sta-

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520
Or what was the

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.520
Dance Fl-

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520
What the fuck's that new one

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.520
That everybody's losing their shit about

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.520
Dance Rush

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.520
Which I still haven't played

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520
No me neither

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520
Wah

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.520
That's what I should have done this weekend

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.520
Taken an impromptu trip to round one to play that

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520
Cause I still haven't played it

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520
Well

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.520
I can't wait for my fat old ass to get on that machine

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.520
Wait so long enough it'll be down here

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520
Yeah it's true

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.520
It's true if I wait long enough

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.520
Alright

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520
Anyway

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.520
Alright

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.520
Let's move on

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.520
To our Sakura

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.520
I mean god we've had all this news but

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.520
There was like a pretty big event going on

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.520
Across the ocean right

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520
Yeah there was

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.520
And so I thought I would just go with

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.520
Some of the best

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.520
Ranked stuff that came out of Tokyo Game Show

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.520
And if any of this is

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.520
Comes up later on in the show

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.520
I'm not trying to step on any toes

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.520
I'm not gonna go into any

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.520
Type of detail about this

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.520
But I will just make the announcements

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520
If that's cool with everybody

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.520
So Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520
Is on the list

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.520
And it looks like it's got VR support

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.520
There also is going to be

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.520
Another Catherine game

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.520
Catherine Full Body

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.520
For PS4 and Vita

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.520
You know it's funny

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.520
I actually read the Catherine novels

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.520
Very interesting

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.520
I'll just leave it there

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.520
Also coming out is

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.520
Days Gone for PS4

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520
But there was

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.520
A motorcycle to advertise it

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.520
Also

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.520
Looks like we have

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.520
Dead or Alive 6

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.520
And it looks very pretty with

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.520
Blood splatter for every punch

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.520
We also have

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.520
I'm waiting for some of these to load

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.520
Of course there's Death Stranding

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.520
So hopefully we'll know

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.520
More about this

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.520
Maybe

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.520
So you know what we saw

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520
There was a trailer

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.520
With a dude in a golden mask

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.520
And it was revealed that

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.520
That guy was Troy Baker

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520
And again

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.520
This game is very like

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.520
That's all I need to know

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.520
What is it?

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.520
What is this game?

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.520
There is a guy in like

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.520
Diving gear

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520
Under water

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.520
But his gear is off

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.520
His face is

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.520
His mask is off

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520
So whatever that is

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.520
So

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.520
God why is it taking so long to load

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.520
I'm sorry about this guys

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520
There we go

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520
So

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520
Devil May Cry 5

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520
Which

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520
Yay

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.520
There'll be a little bit more about that

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520
Coming up I know for sure

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.520
At least coming from the director

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520
Of Devil May Cry 5

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520
And then

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520
Next up

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.520
Gosh I'm so sorry this is taking so long

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.520
Man Dead or Alive 6 looks awesome

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.520
Dragon Quest Builders 2

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.520
We knew that was coming

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.520
But we just haven't really

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520
Seen the game itself yet

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.520
I don't believe

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520
So

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520
Or did

01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.520
Did 1 and 2 never

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520
I thought they were gonna get

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.520
A combo package on the Switch

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520
Did that never happen?

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.520
I don't think so

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520
Oh alright

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.520
I guess I thought that would've

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.520
Happened a long time ago

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.520
There's another game

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.520
Um

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.520
Coming up by Inti Creates

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.520
Um

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.520
But they did a game

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.520
Um

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.520
Called Dragon March for Death

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.520
This is the same studio that did

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.520
Mega Man Zero

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.520
Um

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520
The art style looks really nice

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.520
There's also everybody's golf VR

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520
Whatever it's golf

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520
Uh

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.520
Fortnite was at Tokyo Game Show

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.520
That's interesting

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.520
Yeah

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.520
But it looks like people were

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.520
Playing the shit off of it

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520
Is it though? Because

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520
If it was

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.520
Was it

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520
At Sony's booth because

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520
You know that is the best console

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.520
To play it on according to Sony

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.520
Well no I'm more saying the fact that like

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.520
It feels like everywhere you go here

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520
People are playing Fortnite

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.520
And people know of Fortnite

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.520
So it's interesting that Japan

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.520
I don't know if it's

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.520
That big

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.520
But it's still

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.520
Big enough

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.520
There's a

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.520
Yakuza game called

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.520
Judge Eyes coming out

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.520
Um

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.520
It looks interesting

01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.520
There's also

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.520
Kingdom Hearts 3

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.520
Um

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.520
Mega Man 11

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.520
For PS4

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.520
Xbox One

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.520
We're getting a new

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.520
Kingdom Hearts game?

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.520
Eventually

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.520
Well they showed off

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.520
It was a trailer with

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.520
Big Hero 6

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.520
So that's kind of cool

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.520
Yeah no the new footage was cool

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.520
There's another game called

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.520
Ninjala

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.520
That's um

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.520
Kind of

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.520
Splatoon-ish

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.520
From what it looks like

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520
But definitely different

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520
Mechanics for PVP

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.520
Um

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.520
I'm almost to the list

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.520
Let's see

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.520
That looks like arms

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.520
Uh

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.520
Persona Q2 Full Cinema Labyrinth

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.520
Um

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.520
It looks

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.520
Interesting for its style

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.520
But definitely has the same

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.520
Dungeon crawling elements in it

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.520
Um

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.520
There's also

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520
Resident Evil 2 remake

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.520
Which I am super excited about

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520
Because

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.520
Hello they should have

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.520
Remade this a long time ago

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.520
Um

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.520
There's Tetris Effect for PS4 and PSVR

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.520
So it looks like it's Tetris with

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.520
A musical element

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.520
It's amazing

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.520
It's fucking

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.520
They showed this at E3

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.520
It's the rez guy

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.520
It's Mizuguchi doing Tetris

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.520
It looks fucking amazing

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.520
And then there's Warriors Orochi 4

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.520
Um

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.520
You know which is

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.520
Just those usual

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520
Warriors game

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.520
Um

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.520
But it's actually

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.520
Um

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.520
Over there

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.520
It's actually Orochi Musou 3 in Japan

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520
But we got it

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.520
As Warriors Orochi 4

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.520
Here in the US

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.520
Um

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.520
And then that's it

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.520
So those are things coming

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.520
The biggest hype coming out of Tokyo Game Show

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.520
I'd still like to go to Tokyo Game Show

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.520
One day

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.520
One day

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.520
One day

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.520
I know

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520
My check will come

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.520
I know

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.520
One day I'll have money

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.520
Alright

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520
Let's move on

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.520
Loki

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.520
Maybe some not so great news

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.520
Coming out of Tokyo Game Show

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.520
Right

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.520
Yeah

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520
So

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520
Um

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.520
Unfortunately

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.520
The uh

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.520
Lack of Sony being into the Vita

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.520
Is finally caught up with the Vita

01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.520
In Japan

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.520
Because remember

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520
Japan is doing pretty good over there

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.520
But now

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.520
The Vita's dead

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.520
And

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.520
Unfortunately

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.520
Sony doesn't have

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.520
Anything coming out

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.520
That's been announced

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.520
As a successor for the Vita

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.520
Um

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.520
But yeah

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.520
Basically

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520
As for portable gaming machine

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.520
There are no plans for anything

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.520
After the Vita

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.520
Um

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.520
And right now

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520
That there's no

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.520
Yeah

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520
Hardware successor

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520
That they're working on

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520
So

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520
That's unfortunate

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520
Too bad

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520
I'm surprised with the Switch being so

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520
Powerful and everything

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.520
That

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.520
They might reconsider

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.520
Since you know

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.520
They like copying Nintendo obviously

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.520
With

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.520
Everything that they do

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.520
Yeah

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.520
I um

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.520
I mean I don't know

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.520
I am and I'm not surprised

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.520
To hear this

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.520
About the Vita

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.520
Like I still thought the Vita

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.520
Had anything to do

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520
With the Vita

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520
But

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.520
Yeah

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.520
I still thought the Vita

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520
Had

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.520
A lot of life span

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.520
Going for it

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.520
In Japan

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.520
You know

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520
I feel like when we do the Japanese releases

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.520
We're still having quite frequently

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.520
Japanese releases on the Vita

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.520
So

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.520
I thought for that

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.520
You know

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.520
Purpose

01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520
There would still be

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520
You know

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.520
Some sort of official support

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520
From Sony

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.520
Because Sony

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.520
Those games don't have to stop coming out

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.520
This is the Vita

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520
I'm not quite dead

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.520
I think I'll go for

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.520
Well just because

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.520
Yes

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520
But Sony's like

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.520
No you're dead

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.520
You know

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520
Just because Sony

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520
They might as well

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520
You know

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520
It's kind of

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.520
Once the company's kind of

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520
Officially stopped

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.520
I mean

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520
I get it

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520
There's still people making games

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520
To the Dreamcast

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520
But

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520
A lot of the

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.520
You know

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.520
You realize these are different things

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.520
I feel happy

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.520
Those sorts of pet projects

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520
Are very different from

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.520
You know

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520
The

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.520
Weekly releases

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.520
And all that stuff

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.520
So

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.520
I mean

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.520
As far as the US is concerned

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.520
I'm not surprised at all

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.520
To hear this

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.520
The Vita's been effectively dead here

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.520
For some time

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.520
Yeah

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.520
But it's

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.520
But I

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.520
To be honest

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.520
I don't want Sony

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.520
Doing another portable system

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.520
If they're gonna treat it

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.520
Like they did that one

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.520
Why should Sony do

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520
Another portable system

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.520
If they're just gonna turn

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.520
Their back on it

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.520
So quickly

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.520
Like they did the last one

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.520
Like

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.520
I think it's for the best

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.520
They don't

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.520
Do another system

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.520
Anyway

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520
Uh

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520
Kaijuto says

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.520
No no

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.520
This is different

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.520
This is not talk about

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.520
How it feels

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.520
Dead in the US

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.520
This is Sony saying

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.520
We are pulling the plug

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520
In 2019

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520
So

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.520
This is much different

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520
Than what usually comes up

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.520
Deft says

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.520
Vita means life

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.520
Well

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.520
Now your Vita

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.520
Is a

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.520
Huerta?

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.520
I don't know what to

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.520
Say

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.520
Alright

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.520
Uh

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.520
Let's move on

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.520
And talk about

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.520
I kind of referred to this

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.520
Already earlier

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.520
So I kind of repeating myself

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.520
A little bit

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.520
Sorry

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.520
But I just couldn't help

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.520
The servers did indeed

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.520
Already breach Nintendo's

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.520
Online system

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.520
So what happened is

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.520
That they were uploading

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.520
New NES ROMs

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520
Into the library

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520
Essentially

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
Uh

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520
What they

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.520
I don't understand

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520
All the inner workings

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520
Of how this works

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.520
Maybe Loki you know more

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.520
About this stuff than I do

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.520
All I know is I saw the receipts

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.520
Somebody posted a video

01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520
Yeah

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520
And they fired up a game

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520
And it was not the game

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.520
That was

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520
It was not River City Ransom

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.520
It was Kirby

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.520
So they

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.520
They were able to

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520
Like swap out

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.520
One NES file for another

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520
Yeah basically

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520
They were stored as plain

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520
NES ROMs

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520
So it's just

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.520
The normal

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.520
ROM file for

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.520
Um

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.520
For an NES cartridge

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520
So like they have

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.520
Battletoads

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.520
Is one that

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.520
They had a video of

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.520
That they took

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.520
Oh yeah I saw the

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.520
Battletoads one too

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.520
So you know

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.520
And as we got into

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.520
A little bit earlier

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.520
So not to repeat

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.520
Ourselves too bad

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.520
But basically you know

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.520
This does prove that

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520
Nintendo

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.520
Has done all this work

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.520
On the emulator

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.520
To be able to do

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.520
The online games

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.520
And all that

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520
And release all of their

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.520
Games right now

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.520
If they wanted to

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.520
They have chosen not to

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.520
For whatever

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.520
Yeah but I don't know

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.520
Like obviously we haven't seen

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.520
This like play

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520
In online or something

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520
Like that

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520
Like with other people

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520
I would assume that

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.520
It's all emulator based

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.520
So but

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.520
Um

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.520
You know

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.520
They could use that

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.520
As the excuse of

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.520
Well these games

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520
Need to be changed

01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.520
For

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.520
I don't think so though

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.520
It's just

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.520
It's just they're not

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.520
Well also with the

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.520
Nintendo online

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.520
You know there's

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520
Different filters

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.520
And different modes

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.520
And filters you can use

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.520
As CRT

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.520
Where you can kind of

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520
Purposely make your screen

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520
Look dirty

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520
Like an old television

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520
Would have looked

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.520
Which you know

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.520
Or if you have kids

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.520
You don't have to do that

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.520
At all

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520
It's naturally dirty

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.520
If you want the authentic

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520
Look or whatever

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.520
I guess you could go for that

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.520
Filters can be fun

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.520
But some people saying

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.520
Taking to social media

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.520
Saying

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.520
The CRT TV

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:28.520
Is causing

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.520
Burn in

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.520
On my

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:31.520
Or at least something

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.520
That kind of looks like it

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.520
This went up to Reddit

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.520
And basically said

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.520
Some NES games

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.520
There's discoloration

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.520
On the Switch screen

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.520
After this

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.520
So

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.520
They did

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.520
They posted all this stuff

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.520
But

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.520
Apparently

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.520
It's a rendering issue

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.520
And not actually

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.520
Any type of burn in

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.520
It's not

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.520
It's just a rendering thing

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.520
It's displaying

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.520
The

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.520
The

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.520
Stuff on the menu

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520
Kind of like it's

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.520
Bleeding through

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.520
From the rendering

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.520
Of the NES game

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.520
Or something like that

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.520
Nintendo did not officially

01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.520
Comment on all this stuff

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.520
But it doesn't sound like

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520
It's as bad

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520
As the internet

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520
Was making it out to be

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.520
Because that's never

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.520
Happened before

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.520
But also

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.520
Eh

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.520
Don't use that CRT filter

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.520
Well that

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.520
And also like

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.520
I just

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520
Eh

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.520
I would

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:15.520
Oh

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520
Minimal viable product

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.520
Is a phrase I like to use

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520
You know

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.520
At work

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.520
And with a lot of things

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.520
And

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.520
So for as long as this

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.520
Took to happen

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.520
There's still weird shit

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.520
Like this out there

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.520
Yeah it's just like that

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.520
You know

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.520
They used the same damn

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.520
Emulator that they made for

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.520
The NES Classic and stuff

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.520
I'm not gonna complain

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.520
That they were giving us

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520
Online play for free

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.520
All this extra time

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.520
Since Nintendo Online

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.520
Real

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.520
Really the NES classes

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.520
Is really the only new thing

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.520
At least it feels like anyway

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.520
That we're getting with them

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.520
But it does feel pathetic

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.520
Though that they can't even

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.520
Get that to run correctly

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.520
I mean they shouldn't even

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.520
Have a mode that

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.520
Toggle low latency

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.520
You should just

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.520
Be on

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.520
If that's what it takes

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.520
To run

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.520
Like I don't even understand

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.520
The problem is

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.520
And not just a knock

01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.520
Um

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.520
I do

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.520
I do want to stress though

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.520
Our situation with him

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520
Streaming in my

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520
But not even necessarily

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.520
Just this

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.520
Like the Capcom

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520
Arcade collection

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520
That just came out

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.520
That beat him up one

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.520
Is fucked

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.520
When it comes to

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.520
Online mode

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.520
And the Switch as well

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520
And they have like

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.520
Lag issues like

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.520
It's just like

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.520
It's stuttery

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.520
It's so bad

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520
But that's just

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.520
Another issue

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:22.520
It's like

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.520
Come on you guys

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.520
You know that this

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.520
Probably exists

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.520
Why

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.520
Why not

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.520
Hold it off

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.520
A little bit longer

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.520
Alright

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.520
Let's move on

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:33.520
We have a few more

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.520
Stories to get to

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:35.520
Uh

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.520
Darcyra

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.520
Well

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520
As I might have teased

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.520
Earlier

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.520
There was

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:41.520
Uh

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.520
Something from

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.520
The Devil May Cry director

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.520
And this is not

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.520
Quite what people

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.520
Think it is

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.520
Um

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.520
Uh

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.520
There was

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:50.520
Um

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.520
An interview

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.520
With him

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.520
Very recently

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.520
Um

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.520
Uh

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.520
It's no

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.520
Hideaki

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.520
And he was asked

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.520
The question

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.520
If he would like

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.520
To

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520
And I'm just gonna

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.520
Read his whole

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.520
Response here

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.520
If I was allowed

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.520
I'd love to remake

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.520
Love to make

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.520
Rival Schools 3

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.520
I'd love to make

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.520
Dragon's Dogma 2

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.520
Capcom vs. SNK 3

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:13.520
Street Fighter Alpha 4

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.520
Power Stone 3

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.520
And if I could

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.520
Even Street Fighter 6

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.520
Would be amazing

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.520
But the big one

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.520
The one that we'd need

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520
To get resolution on

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.520
Is Rival Schools

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:22.520
Because in Japan

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.520
There are three years

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.520
Of high school

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.520
We've seen the first

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.520
Two years for these kids

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.520
So the third one

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.520
Would be their last year

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.520
In high school

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.520
Wouldn't that be cool

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.520
Yes

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.520
Please make this happen

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.520
I'm going to find his Twitter

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.520
And I'm going to post

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.520
Every day Rival Schools 3

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.520
Rival Schools 3

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.520
Hashtag

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.520
Hashtag

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.520
Hashtag

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.520
Um

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520
So

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.520
We need to get on this people

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.520
We made President Kat happen

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.520
Ha ha ha ha

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.520
Or we didn't make it happen

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.520
It never did come out in the US

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.520
Still

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.520
We encouraged them

01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.520
And

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.520
If some sites are to be believed

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.520
It was like the worst selling Wii game

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.520
Of all time

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.520
So I'm not sure we actually

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.520
Made anything happen there

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.520
Dr. Sakura

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.520
Ha ha ha

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.520
It was just too

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.520
Too early

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:10.520
I know

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.520
It was ahead of its time

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.520
Yeah we were just extremely hipster

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.520
That's all

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.520
Because now we have

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.520
You know other

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.520
Cat centered games

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.520
Like cat lateral damage

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.520
And stuff like that

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.520
Yeah

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.520
Can't tell me something

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.520
Cat based

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.520
Won't sell well

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.520
In this type of internet

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520
Ha ha

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520
See if we brought it out

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520
Over here

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520
It would be

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520
Asshole CEO

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.520
All right

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.520
Let's move on

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.520
Loki

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.520
So YouTube is closing

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.520
YouTube gaming

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.520
Because

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.520
Nobody likes to use the app

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.520
And

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.520
That's unfortunate

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.520
But

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.520
It's not

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.520
Entirely bad

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.520
So basically what they're doing

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.520
Is they're getting rid of

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.520
The dedicated app

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.520
For YouTube gaming

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.520
Because once again

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.520
A lot of people are just using

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.520
The main YouTube app

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.520
To watch YouTube gaming content

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.520
Instead

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.520
If you still want to

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520
You know

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520
Interested in just

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.520
The gaming content

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.520
For one

01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520
It kind of

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.520
Focused like that

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.520
You can go to

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.520
YouTube slash gaming

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.520
And it will show you

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.520
The same damn shit

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.520
So

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.520
And they kind of

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.520
Kind of set up

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520
A little bit like

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520
Twitch as well

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.520
When you look at it

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.520
That way

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520
With all your

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.520
You know

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.520
Top live games

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.520
Live streamers

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.520
Gaming videos

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520
From your subscriptions

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.520
That type of stuff

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520
You know

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.520
I don't know

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.520
Like I think

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.520
With YouTube gaming

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.520
Like it was hard

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.520
Most people didn't

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.520
But there was a

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.520
Separate thing

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520
Like if you want to

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.520
Look up gaming videos

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.520
Just go to YouTube

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.520
Exactly

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.520
I'm not going to fucking

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.520
Go to a separate app

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.520
For gaming

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.520
And like

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.520
I'll just watch it

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.520
On YouTube

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.520
Yeah I think that

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.520
Kind of like

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.520
Never like

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.520
Truly caught on

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.520
I really think

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.520
The YouTube gaming thing

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.520
Was really primarily

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.520
For the app

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.520
But when anything

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.520
You link online

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.520
And stuff

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:50.520
Is going to open

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.520
In the default

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.520
YouTube app

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.520
Like if I

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.520
If I tweet

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.520
My YouTube or something

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.520
YouTube gaming

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.520
Was always just kind of like

01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.520
This different shell

01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.520
This different set of clothes

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.520
That nobody went for

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.520
A YouTube feature

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.520
That's not coming

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.520
Together correctly

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520
No

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.520
Not my YouTube

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.520
Well

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.520
I'm pretty sure

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520
YouTube has already

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.520
Been blocked in China

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.520
But now

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.520
Twitch can join them

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.520
In that circle

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.520
Twitch has been

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.520
Banned in China

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520
That was some big news

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520
That hit around the

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520
Internet this week

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.520
This is because

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.520
I guess

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.520
Let's see

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.520
China took home

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.520
Two gold medals

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.520
In the Jakarta

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.520
Palembang 2018

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.520
Asian games

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.520
It's a pan Asian

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.520
Multisport tournament basically

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.520
So there's

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.520
There's many different

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.520
Games that are played

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.520
Amongst all these different countries

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.520
Think of it like the Olympics

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.520
But like eSports

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.520
Over in Asia

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.520
So China

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.520
You know made its mark

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.520
But unfortunately

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.520
CCTV did not broadcast

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.520
The event

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.520
So Chinese fans

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.520
Went to Twitch

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520
So a huge spike

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520
In downloads

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520
For the streaming site

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520
Now this pings it

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.520
On Twitch's radar

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.520
And now

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.520
Twitch's website

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.520
Is inaccessible

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.520
It's inaccessible

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.520
In China

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.520
You can't get it

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.520
On the iOS app store

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.520
And you know this

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.520
Many observers

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.520
And analysts saying

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.520
That this is kind of a regular thing

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.520
Western media platforms

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.520
That get very popular

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.520
End up getting blocked

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.520
Twitch has confirmed

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.520
They've been blocked

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.520
In China

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.520
But they don't have any other details

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.520
At this time

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.520
So in some ways

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.520
It's kind of a

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.520
You made it kid

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.520
And in other ways

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.520
It's a

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.520
Well that's a bummer

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.520
Because there were probably

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.520
Folks in China

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.520
That wanted to watch

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.520
But they can't

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.520
Because they were being streamed

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.520
On Twitch

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.520
And what

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.520
How does this affect

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.520
Overwatch League

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.520
I'm kind of curious

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.520
Because don't we have

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.520
An expansion team in China

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.520
And all those games

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.520
Were being broadcast on Twitch

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520
Or do they go

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.520
Are they on a

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.520
Different platform in China

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.520
Maybe they are

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.520
I just may not be aware

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.520
That there may be a

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.520
China centric

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:46.520
Live streaming platform

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:47.520
That they use over there

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.520
So I'm kind of curious about that

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.520
So there you go

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.520
So there you go

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.520
So unfortunately

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.520
When we

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.520
Just finally make our move

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.520
To Twitch

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.520
Which is you know

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.520
Still on the radar

01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.520
If these cable issues

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.520
Get fixed

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.520
We should be

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.520
Making our own move

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.520
To Twitch

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.520
Folks in China

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:05.520
Won't be able to see it

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.520
Live unfortunately

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.520
But I don't think

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.520
Anybody in China

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:09.520
Is listening live today

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.520
If you are

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.520
You should let us know

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.520
Because I would love

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.520
To hear from you

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.520
But remember

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.520
The podcast is not

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.520
Going to be changing at all

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:17.520
So if we have Chinese

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.520
Folks that listen

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:19.520
On the podcast

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.520
Well that will still

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.520
Be the same

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.520
Similar sort of set up

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.520
That you get it today

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520
So

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.520
Act F says

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.520
I think Overwatch League games

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.520
Are also on

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.520
Major League gaming's website

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.520
Gotcha

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:31.520
I was going to say

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.520
There's got to be

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.520
Another option

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.520
Because that would be a bummer

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.520
To have this whole expansion team

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.520
For Overwatch League

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520
And then

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.520
People in that city

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520
Can't even watch it

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520
Even though everybody

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.520
Is living in LA anyway

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520
But oh well

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.520
Alright

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520
Let's go back to

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.520
When things were simpler

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.520
Let's go back to a time

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.520
When we couldn't

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.520
Live stream games

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:50.520
You wanted to watch

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.520
We play a game

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.520
And you'd come over

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520
And sit on the couch

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.520
Or we had to put

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.520
Our video camera

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.520
In front of our TV

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.520
To videotape

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.520
The high sports

01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:59.520
And the VHS tape

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.520
That's right

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.520
Or when I was playing

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.520
Ultima Exodus

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520
I would use

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.520
The sight spell

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.520
To get the map

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.520
For the dungeon

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.520
And I would record it

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.520
So I could refer

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.520
To it later

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.520
I used to draw my maps

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.520
My Zelda maps

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.520
Nice

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.520
Alright

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.520
On old food foods

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.520
So I had them

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.520
On denim

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.520
And rolled up this fold

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.520
It is the classic

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.520
Needed this week

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.520
Dark soccer is gonna

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.520
Climb into the gaming vault

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.520
And find a game or two

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.520
Which she thinks

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.520
Hey

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.520
You kids

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520
Play this game

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.520
You don't need

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.520
No hundred dollar

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.520
Stinkin' PlayStation

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.520
Classic to play this

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:31.520
This is pre-rumble pack

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.520
N64 shit here

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.520
That's right

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.520
Here it is

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:35.520
Your classic game of the week

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.520
Dark soccer

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.520
What did you pick

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.520
For the classic game

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.520
Of the week this week?

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.520
I picked Chameleon Twist

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.520
Yay

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.520
Um

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520
It is a pretty difficult game

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520
It has a weird

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.520
Continue system

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.520
But it's treasure

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.520
Wait

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.520
No it's not

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.520
It's done soft

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.520
It's pre-treasure

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.520
Stuff

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:53.520
Anyway

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.520
Um

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.520
Chameleon Twist

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.520
Um

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.520
Is

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.520
We play as one of four

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.520
Chameleons

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.520
And you go over

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.520
Different worlds

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.520
Um

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520
It has a very long

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.520
Tongue

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520
To use as a weapon

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520
And you can also use it

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.520
Kind of as a grappling hook

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520
And you can use

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520
The tongue

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:11.520
You basically

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.520
Move the tongue

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.520
On its own

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.520
With the analog stick

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.520
And you also have

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520
Like a training area

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520
That you can learn

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520
How to master

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520
The tongue

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520
Um

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.520
So you have to go through

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.520
Different indoor environments

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.520
You have a boss battle

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520
And then you have to keep

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.520
Collecting hearts to

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.520
Replenish your

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.520
Uh

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.520
Your health

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.520
And you play as

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.520
A chameleon

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.520
Called

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:36.520
Davy

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.520
And he follows

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.520
A white rabbit

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520
Into a magical ground

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520
In the hole

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:41.520
And he becomes

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:42.520
A humanoid

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.520
In Wonderland

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.520
His friends are

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520
Jack, Fred, and Linda

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520
White people names

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.520
I don't

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.520
Like seriously

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.520
Um

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.520
No

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.520
I would say

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.520
Probably like

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:53.520
Caitlin's

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.520
But spelled differently

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.520
Anyway

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.520
Um

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.520
So with the

01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.520
B button

01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.520
You stick out

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.520
Your tongue

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.520
By the way

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.520
This was on

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.520
Nintendo 64

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520
And then you move

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.520
The tongue around

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.520
With the analog stick

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.520
Which controls

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.520
You know

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.520
The movement there

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.520
So you can use that

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.520
To get power ups

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.520
At a distance

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.520
Or just swallow

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.520
Enemies

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.520
And it will retract

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.520
Back

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.520
Or until it bumps

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520
A wall

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.520
Which will also

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.520
Make it back

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.520
Uh

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520
Go back

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520
So it is just

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.520
A standard

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520
You know

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520
Tongue thing

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520
When they swallow

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520
The enemies

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.520
But you have the option

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.520
Of spitting the

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520
Enemy back out

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.520
Um

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.520
At the other enemies

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.520
Kind of

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.520
You know

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.520
Uh

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.520
Roshi

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.520
Or Kirby style

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.520
I mean

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.520
Except Kirby

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.520
Actually spits out

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.520
All your cute stars

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520
Um

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.520
You know

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520
You can launch

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520
Into the air

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520
By using your tongue

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520
Um

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520
You get

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.520
Like

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.520
Pretty much

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.520
Tongue vaulting

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.520
Tongue pull vaulting

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.520
Um

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.520
So you actually

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.520
Can use a pull

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:57.520
Um

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.520
With the tongue

01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.520
As a grapple

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.520
And swing yourself

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:01.520
Across

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.520
You also have

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.520
Multi player mode

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.520
Which is two to four players

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.520
That has a battle royale

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520
Or a time trial

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.520
Where um

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:08.520
You have to be

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.520
The last chameleon

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.520
Standing on the platform

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.520
For battle royale

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.520
Um

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.520
For the time trial

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.520
Um

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.520
You have to stay

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.520
On the platform

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.520
The longest

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.520
And that's

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520
Really

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.520
It

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520
Came out in 1997

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.520
That was a while ago

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.520
God damn these fucking ads

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.520
Ad block Rob

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.520
Ad block

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.520
I thought I had it

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.520
On this computer

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.520
It's just time to upgrade

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.520
YouTube

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520
Uh

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.520
It's time to upgrade

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.520
A lot

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.520
But that's it

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.520
It's Chameleon Twist

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.520
I don't know why I had it

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.520
In my brain

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520
This was a treasure game

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.520
Well

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520
It is a treasure

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.520
Of a different sort

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.520
There it is

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520
Poopy treasure

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.520
Your classic game of the week

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.520
Chameleon Twist

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.520
Sunsoft

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.520
Alright

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.520
Uh

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.520
We're gonna take a break

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.520
Uh

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.520
We haven't done that

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.520
In a little while

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.520
Cause we've had magic

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.520
To hold us over

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.520
We're gonna take a break

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520
Rob Cluffy

01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.520
When we come back

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520
There'll be plenty more

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520
Orange Lounge Radio

And some other

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.520
Rapid fire news

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:09.520
We'll talk a little bit

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.520
About pinball

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.520
And Fortnite news

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.520
But maybe

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.520
Yay

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.520
Maybe for some people

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.520
It's actually a positive

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.520
I'll tell you what we mean

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520
After we come back

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.520
From the break

In studio

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.520
Who has um

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.520
Not been able to be here

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.520
At the show live

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.520
For about a month

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.520
And unfortunately

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.520
Probably for a couple

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.520
More months

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520
But able to visit

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.520
Like once a month

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.520
Yeah and I'm

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.520
Because of work

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.520
Yeah because of work

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.520
I'm trying to

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.520
Get things together

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.520
You know

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.520
But I will say

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.520
Speaking of work

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.520
I know I don't

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.520
Want to get into

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.520
Too many details

01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.520
Cause isn't anyone's business

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.520
What you do during the day

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.520
But I did hear

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.520
You got like a promotion

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:03.520
You were going for at work

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.520
So

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.520
I'll put it this way

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.520
Big ups on that

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.520
Congrats

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.520
It was actually

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.520
It was the first job

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.520
I applied and interviewed for

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.520
Was in this position

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.520
And it wasn't the one I got

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.520
Because I think they were

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.520
Opening it for other temps

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.520
At the time

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.520
But I have

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520
Gone up through the ranks

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.520
As high as I could go

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.520
In one direction

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.520
And I finally am in the

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.520
Department I wanted to be in

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.520
So

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.520
So as much as it sucks

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520
That you can't always be here

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.520
On Sundays

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.520
This is a good thing for your

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.520
You know

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.520
And I got a raise out of it

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.520
So

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:33.520
Yeah so for your

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.520
So as much as it sucks

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.520
For you not being here

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.520
The reality is

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.520
You know

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.520
You're part of what you got to

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.520
Do to make that happen

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.520
So

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.520
I just want to give you

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.520
Congratulations

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.520
I'm sure all the listeners are

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.520
Going to say the same type of

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.520
Thing in chat

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.520
Because y'all rock here at

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.520
Orange Lawn Radio

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520
It's appreciated

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520
And I'm happy to do my radio

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.520
Magic you know

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.520
Yeah

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.520
Come over and visit

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.520
And do what I can to make

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520
Make sure y'all don't forget

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520
About me

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520
We would

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.520
We could never

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.520
We would never

01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520
You could

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520
You need to do more streaming

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.520
And that type of stuff

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.520
To keep us remembering

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.520
Who you are

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.520
Actually

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.520
To get me back to doing

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.520
More World of Warcraft

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.520
And you know

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.520
Cussing at people

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.520
I cuss at the characters

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.520
In the game Rob

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.520
I tell them that they're

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:13.520
Shitholes

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.520
You kind of should

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.520
Like Sylvanas is totally a bitch

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.520
Now

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.520
Like what happened

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.520
Like

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.520
And I'm not just saying

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.520
I'm not saying that because

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.520
It's the cheap shot

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.520
Because she's a woman

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.520
And anything

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.520
She is a bitch

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:25.520
She has turned into full on

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.520
Cunt monster

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.520
Okay you said it

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.520
I didn't

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.520
No I'm like

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520
They're ruining her

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.520
They're ruining her

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.520
They are

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.520
I used to like her

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.520
And now she's like

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.520
Why are you such a bitch

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.520
Like what crawled up your mall

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.520
And died

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.520
You know

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520
Oh yeah

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.520
She's already dead inside

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.520
You know what I still think

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520
That it would serve her right

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.520
If they made her alive again

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.520
Like for the final thing

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.520
I've

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.520
I've heard fan wank theories

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520
Nothing official obviously

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520
Blizzard's keeping that under wraps

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.520
But fan wank theory

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.520
Seems to think that's how this ends

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.520
Like it would be a much fitting

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.520
End for her

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.520
As opposed to what happened to Garrosh

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.520
Yeah

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.520
So it'd be interesting

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.520
To get in that direction

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.520
So

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:09.520
And they've done all these books

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.520
Like with her and her sisters

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:11.520
Getting back together

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.520
In different books

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.520
And everything

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:14.520
So

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.520
But I'm still doing the Argus content

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.520
Because I want to make a void elf

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.520
Although I will probably still play

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.520
My demon hunty

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.520
Because demon hunters fun

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.520
Yeah

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:26.520
I kind of miss my

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.520
My monk

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.520
My tauren monk

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.520
But my monk

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:30.520
I have a pandaren

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.520
My one bitch about

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.520
Well I'll say this

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.520
Then we'll get back into some

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.520
My one bitch about

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:35.520
Wow

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.520
I do not like how they

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:37.520
Locked those races

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:38.520
Behind these dumb achievements

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.520
In the last expansion

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:41.520
That you have to

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.520
That's stupid

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:43.520
I'm sorry

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.520
I'm glad I got my

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.520
My

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.520
What the fuck elf

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.520
Nightfallen

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.520
Uh huh

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:49.520
When I did

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:50.520
Before they put it behind

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.520
Well actually no

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:52.520
I was already

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.520
I already had

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.520
Elevated?

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.520
Exalted

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:56.520
With

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.520
With the

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.520
With that faction anyway

01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.520
So maybe that's why I got it

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.520
I don't know

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.520
I just don't like it

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.520
It's dumb

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.520
It's stupid

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.520
Alright

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.520
How dare they

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.520
You know what's awesome

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:07.520
Some more gaming news

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.520
Rapid fire news

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.520
Starting off with Loki

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.520
Yes let's talk about

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.520
One of my favorite franchises

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520
Earth Defense Force

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.520
Right around the corner

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.520
Earth Defense Force 5

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.520
Another game where you'll be

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.520
Shooting giant bugs

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.520
And they don't really change

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.520
A whole lot each game

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:24.520
But

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:25.520
It's a new one

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.520
And it's coming out

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.520
December 11th

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.520
Right around the corner

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.520
On Playstation 4

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.520
Hopefully PC at some point soon

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.520
I'll have to pick it up

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.520
Because I do

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.520
Because it's Earth Defense Force

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:36.520
And it's you

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.520
Of course you're gonna pick it up

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.520
It's Earth Defense Force

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:39.520
And it's like the same

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.520
Like when I talk about

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.520
Roster update man

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.520
That game is just like

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.520
It's the same shit

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.520
All the time

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.520
But I'm down

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.520
I'll bite you

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.520
You're gonna eat that shit up

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.520
With a spoon

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:51.520
And there's nothing wrong with that

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.520
Yes I will

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.520
I will do that

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.520
There is a rumor

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:55.520
That there is a possible

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.520
Leaked

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.520
Character from Smash Brothers Ultimate

01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.520
Of course

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.520
Oh it must be a day

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.520
Ending in Y

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:02.520
On some web forum

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:03.520
Of course

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:04.520
Remember that

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.520
There are a lot of

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:06.520
Faked screenshots

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.520
So take this

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.520
With a grain of salt

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:11.520
But the picture shows Ken

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.520
Of Street Fighter 2

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:14.520
It could see that

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.520
Being like an echo fighter

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.520
For Ryu or something like that

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:17.520
But

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.520
That is a very obvious

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.520
Sort of echo character

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520
But

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.520
It could also be

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.520
Incredibly bullshit

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.520
Fakes

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.520
So

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.520
Keep that in mind as well

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520
But it is something that

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.520
I can see

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.520
Where they pad the roster

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.520
With that

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.520
So

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.520
Yeah

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.520
Don't be surprised

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.520
If that's an announcement

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.520
But don't be not surprised

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.520
If it's completely fake

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.520
Because

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.520
You know

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.520
A perfect

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.520
Perfect way to say that there

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:40.520
Don't be surprised

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.520
If it happens

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.520
But you know what

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:43.520
Don't be surprised

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:44.520
If it doesn't happen

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.520
Just don't be surprised

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.520
It's the internet y'all

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.520
Darktotu in chat

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.520
Over at Live.com

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.520
And I'll see you

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.520
In the next one

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.520
Bye

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.520
Bye

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.520
Darktotu in chat

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.520
Over at Live.vognetwork.com

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.520
Says

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:57.520
I want to believe Ken

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:58.520
Is really in the game

01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:59.520
But yeah

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.520
I'm trying hard

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.520
Not to fall for this

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.520
I mean

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:03.520
It's

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:04.520
It does make a lot of sense

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.520
They just

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.520
They don't really have to give

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.520
Him anything special

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.520
It would just be a different look

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.520
Just an echo fighter

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.520
Yeah

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.520
Just an echo fighter

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.520
Alright

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.520
We'll see

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:14.520
Anyway

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.520
Moving on with some more

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.520
Rapid fire news

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.520
This is certainly deserving

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.520
Of a

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.520
Of a longer story slot

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.520
But there isn't a lot

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.520
To say on this

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.520
Nobuo Imatsu

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.520
He did every Final Fantasy

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.520
Soundtrack pre-11

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:25.520
He's done a lot of this stuff

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:26.520
Since then too

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.520
He did music for Chrono Trigger

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:29.520
You know

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.520
Lots of great RPGs

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.520
He can probably think of

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.520
He is ceasing his current work

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:35.520
Due to health problems

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:36.520
He hasn't said what the health problem was

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.520
But he did say on his blog

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.520
In a post that he made

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.520
He's been affected by

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.520
A unnamed disease

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.520
For a few years

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.520
And it's now at a point

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.520
Where he is unable to act

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:47.520
At full capacity

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.520
So he's taking time to rest

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.520
And considering if he's

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:51.520
Gonna be able to do

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.520
Any future projects at all

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.520
Again we don't know

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.520
What the illness is

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:56.520
I'm not going to speculate here

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.520
Certainly many people are

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.520
You know

01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.520
Inventing the scenarios

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.520
In their head

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.520
I'm just gonna hope

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.520
That he gets better

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.520
This

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520
This is a decision

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:05.520
He's come to with his doctors

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.520
That if he's

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.520
It takes a break from work

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.520
And the stress

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.520
That comes with it

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.520
For a little while

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:11.520
It's gonna help him get better

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.520
I'm really really gonna hope

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.520
That that is the case

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.520
Cause Nobuo Imatsu

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.520
He's not

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.520
He's in his 50's

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.520
His late 50's

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.520
Not an old guy

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.520
So it's just

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.520
Yeah

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.520
You know

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.520
Sending well wishes

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.520
And thoughts

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.520
And you know

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.520
Healing vibes

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.520
His way

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.520
And you know

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.520
Obviously his impact

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:29.520
To games

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.520
Has been extraordinary

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.520
But if he needs to take a break

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:32.520
He's fucking earned it

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.520
So let's give him his privacy

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.520
Moving on to Tetris Effect

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.520
Which Dark Soccer brought up

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.520
A little bit earlier

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:40.520
But I'll kind of

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.520
Finish the thought here

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.520
Because not only did

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:43.520
We get to see that

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.520
At the Tokyo Game Show

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.520
We got a date

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.520
For that game

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.520
November 9th

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.520
Is when you can all start

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.520
Feeling Tetris Effect

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:50.520
So I'll finally be in my

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.520
PlayStation VR

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.520
By November 9th

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:53.520
Go play Rez

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.520
Come on

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:55.520
And I need to play this

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.520
I understand that you have

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.520
Like space issues in your room

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.520
But here's the best part

01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:59.520
About it

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.520
The camera

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.520
Doesn't have to be on top

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.520
Of the TV

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520
You can face it and complete

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.520
Oh that's good

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.520
I played VR in my kitchen

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.520
Without a TV even hooked up

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.520
Alright that's good to know

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.520
It's good to know

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.520
But anyway of course

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.520
You know

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.520
Everything else we've heard

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:13.520
About Tetris

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.520
Nothing else has changed

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.520
That zone mechanic

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.520
Where you can freeze time

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.520
And kind of build up

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.520
Your Tetris clears and stuff

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.520
And all that

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.520
So PlayStation 4

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.520
On November 9th

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.520
That is the big day for that

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.520
DarkSakura

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.520
You've got a couple of things

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.520
For us

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.520
I do

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.520
There has been something

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.520
Sent to the Game Rating

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.520
And Admission

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:32.520
Administration Committee

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:33.520
Of Korea

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.520
They have a rating out

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:35.520
For Castlevania Requiem

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.520
Symphony of the Night

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.520
And Rondo of Blood

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.520
For PlayStation 4

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.520
For a Japanese

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:41.520
Language release

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.520
We don't have any announcements

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.520
From Konami out here

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.520
But I mean that would simply be

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.520
Not turn in the moonlight

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.520
And Rondo of Blood

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.520
So yay

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.520
I hope

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.520
Could use another copy

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.520
Of that game

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.520
And then also

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:56.520
Sega announced a release

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.520
Of Sega Genesis Classics

01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.520
For Nintendo Switch

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.520
Will be a 50 plus game bundle

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.520
That includes Golden Axe

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:03.520
Fantasy Star

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.520
Sonic the Hedgehog

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.520
And the Streets of Rage series

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.520
Also including a few

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.520
Like Kid Chameleon

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.520
And Toejam and Earl

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.520
So there you go

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.520
Alright

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.520
Let's travel around the world

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.520
And check out some release

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.520
Dates of things you get

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:19.520
To play a little sooner

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.520
Than that collection

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.520
On the Switch

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:23.520
Loki starting us off

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:24.520
In the US

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.520
Okay

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.520
So we've got

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.520
Galmetal World Tour

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.520
Edition on the Switch

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.520
Giana Sisters

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.520

But then again

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:09.520
not surprised

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:11.520
Alright

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.520
Welcome to Japan

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.520
and looking at some of the releases there

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.520
on the PlayStation 4

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.520

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.520
comes out

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:24.520
on again

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.520
September the 27th

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:27.520
is when that is out

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.520
and this game looks like

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:30.520
I'm trying to think if it's something that's

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.520
localized here

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.520
but I don't think it is

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:33.520
Legend Heroes?

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.520
Maybe?

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.520
Something like that?

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.520
I don't know

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:37.520
This game

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.520
What's it called?

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.520
Iyudensetsu Senokisuke 4

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.520
The End of Saga

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:43.520
I don't know

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.520
Legend Heroes?

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.520
Might be?

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:46.520
Anyway

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:47.520
That is coming out

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:48.520
That seems to be kind of the big

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.520
Legend of Heroes is what

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:51.520
Dr. Tetsuya thinks it is

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.520
Utaware Urumono Zan

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.520
comes out also as well this week in Japan

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.520

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:58.520

01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.520
and that same

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.520
Utaware Urumono Zan

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.520
has a premium edition with that as well

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.520
So Super Neptunia RPG

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:08.520

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.520

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.520

as well as MotoGP 18

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.520
Kind of a busy week there in Japan

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.520
Taking a look at the Nintendo Switch real fast

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.520
to see if we're getting anything there

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.520
Oh yes

The World Ends With You Final Remix

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:38.520
I think some folks looking forward to that

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.520
That is out in Japan this week on the Switch

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.520
Senju no Valkyria 4

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.520
which I imagine is Valkyria Chronicles 4

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.520
also out this week on the Switch in Japan

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.520
That's Super Neptunia RPG

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.520

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.520

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.520

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.520

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.520
Let's go to the UK to our Sakura

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.520

head off to the mailbag

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.520
Every week you guys email us

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.520
participate at

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.520
and we read your emails here live on air

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.520
as long as you keep them classy

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.520
appropriate and all that

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.520
and we're gonna get into the mailbag this week

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.520
so let's do it

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:15.520
Dark Sakura's here

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.520
So she should read the emails again

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.520
I've been doing it lately

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.520
but I think Dark Sakura should get back to reading emails

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:20.520
What do you think Dark Sakura?

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.520
Sure

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.520
So this comes from Ryan

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.520
Hey O.L.R. while hanging out in the VOG Network Discord

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.520
which you can also participate in at

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.520
vognetwork.com slash discord

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.520
Brilliant plug

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.520
Thank Ryan

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.520
I noticed that Alan plays a bit of Dark Souls

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.520
whether a newbie or a seasoned player

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.520
I'm curious to hear about his experiences with the game

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.520
or if he had any cool stories to share

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.520
Love the show, Ryan

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.520
Alan was not in here to hear this message

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:50.520
No, Alan was not in here to hear this message

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.520
I will fix that here shortly

01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.520
I'll get him in here, see if he's available

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.520
if he's not in the middle of an Overwatch match

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.520
Do we have another email?

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.520
Why don't you read that one while I work on Alan

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.520
Okay

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:04.520
Last episode you were discussing the face

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.520
of each company and couldn't come with

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.520
one for Sony other than Kazurai

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.520
who left Playstation inside of the company

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.520
in 2012

01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.520
Here are a few guys you couldn't think of

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.520
Andrew House, Adam Boyz, and Shuhei Yoshida

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.520
The former two were no longer with the company

01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:20.520
but were arguably the faces for a while

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.520
as they were the ones who show up at PSX

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.520
or E3 every stage

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.520
up until they left last year

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:28.520
Shuhei is the current president

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.520
of Sony Worldwide Studios, i.e. the person

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.520
who oversees each of their first-party studios

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.520
and also gets a share of stage appearances

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.520
Perhaps the fact you couldn't think of them

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.520
lends credence to the idea that Sony

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:40.520
doesn't have a strong face

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.520
as Iwata or Miyamoto or Reggie

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.520
but when you think of someone of the well-known

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.520
Playstation clips, it's usually those people

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:48.520
Like, here's how you share games with a friend

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.520
on a PS4 dig at Microsoft

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.520
with Shuhei and Adam in the video

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:54.520
Shu does get mobbed at E3 and PSX

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.520
for pictures, so he's certainly well-known

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:58.520
among some groups, and much like Stan Lee

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.520
who was the kickoff for the topic

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.520
Shu has had cameos

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.520
in a bunch of other video games

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.520
Oddly enough, not usually first-party

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.520
but indie games like Super Time

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.520
Force Ultra, Everything, and Velocity

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.520
have used him or his likeness

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.520
and this comes from

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.520
Andrew, that's all I'm gonna say

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:18.520
I don't have a nickname on it

01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.520
Probably the closest thing

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:22.520
to a mascot or whatever

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.520
Shu is mentioned in that

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.520
but I

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.520
still don't know if even that is

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.520
on that same level as something like Miyamoto

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.520
or Reggie Fils-May

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.520
or has that social media presence

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.520
that Major Nelson has on Twitter for Microsoft

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.520
or some of that. I still don't feel

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:40.520
like it's quite at the same level

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:42.520
You know what I mean? I don't know

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.520
I appreciate their perspective

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.520
I kind of get where you're going

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.520
some of these guys are really recognized in some circles

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.520
but I don't know if they're

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.520
the face on that same level

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.520
but I should have thought of at least

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.520
one of those last week. Anyway

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.520
I want to go back to the previous email

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.520
I actually made him die on a boss

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:02.520
so he could answer this question

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.520
Hi Alan!

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:06.520
Dark Souls

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.520
because they're on the Discord servers

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:10.520
they can see that you're playing Dark Souls

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.520
all the time. So tell us a little bit about

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.520
playing Dark Souls and your experience with that

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.520
or if you have cool stories

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.520
Just the remastered is out

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.520
and I've moved on to Dark Souls 2

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.520
because I finally got burned out on the remaster

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.520
just these last couple of days

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.520
just the versatility of creating a build

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.520
like having a strength character that wields

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.520
like a giant

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:32.520
basically like a tree

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.520
like an uprooted tree that's just like wham

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:36.520
like bam bam from the Flintstones

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.520
or like a Dex character

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.520
or like a caster

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.520
all the different types of weapons

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.520
it's a really

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.520
there's a lot of stuff under the surface

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.520
aside from jest, it's really hard

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.520
and then of course a lot of it's

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.520
muscle memory so when you

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.520
beat it

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.520
the incentive is there to do

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.520
the new game plus stuff because

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.520
you're going to have a way more

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.520
fun time your second and third time through

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.520
because you know how to

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.520
get through everything

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.520
Now you're

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.520
playing so much Dark Souls

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.520
you've actually accomplished the rare accomplishment

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.520
of getting what is essential

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.520
I mean you're playing it on PC not Playstation 4

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.520
but you're getting basically the equivalent of the platinum trophy

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.520
you've gotten every single achievement in Dark Souls right?

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.520
Yeah the remaster yes

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.520
Wow that's pretty crazy

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:26.520
Why do you think this is the game that you want to

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:28.520
and you guys don't live with him

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:30.520
but I do, he plays this game, it's like this and Overwatch

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.520
if he's playing something that's not this or Overwatch

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.520
I'm like what the hell's going on, you okay?

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.520
What is it

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.520
Why this game is what you're into right now?

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.520
And I'm not asking that in an accusing way I'm just curious

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.520
what is driving the passion for that?

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.520
I sort of just have a really addictive

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.520
personality so when a game catches my attention

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:50.520
I play to the exclusion of all else for three

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.520
or four months and then I move on

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.520
to something else I'll probably end up

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.520
playing Mass Effect again or Skyrim

01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:58.520
at some point and you'll be like if you see Skyrim

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.520
you're going to see nothing but Skyrim for about three or four months

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.520
and then I'll move on to something else

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.520
so it's just whatever

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:06.520
You play a game, you play a game

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.520
Yes, until I am absolutely sick of it

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:10.520
so it's kind of like

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:12.520
you know

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.520
my Steam library

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.520
has 300 games that I have only beaten

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.520
like 20 of them and I just play those same 20 games

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.520
over and over and over again

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:22.520
like Dragon Age Origins and I can't

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.520
speedrun that game, if I do another

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.520
Origins career it's probably about a 60 or 70

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.520
hour commitment

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.520
Now you've played Dark Souls 2 as well right?

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.520
Yes. But not really 3? Correct.

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.520
Why? Just

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.520
it's

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.520
it's the one I know the least

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.520
and I have fear of the unknown

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:42.520
because I can play the other two

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.520
inside and out so I'm like okay here's how I get

01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.520
this really

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.520
incredible weapon that makes me overpowered

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.520
at a really early level. You weren't always that way right?

01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:52.520
True, but you just

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.520
I don't know, I just watch

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.520
Let's Plays of YouTubes of like here's how to

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.520
become a hex caster

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.520
by level 10 and it's like

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.520
alright so I just need to do that

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:04.520
for Dark Souls 3. Alright so maybe

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:06.520
maybe in the next 3 or 4 months we'll see

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.520
Dark Souls 3. Yes. Alright.

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:10.520
I think you've satisfactorily answered the email

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.520
Thank you Alan, round of applause for Alan

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:14.520
Thank you. It says something that

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.520
he's quite the spouse

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.520
that I can pull him from whatever he's doing to make him

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.520
answer a listener email so there you go

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.520
Alright were there any more emails?

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.520
Yeah there was one more. Okay. Kind of a long one.

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.520
Okay. Hey all, thanks for

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:28.520
promoting, this is from Placo Jones by the way

01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.520
Thanks for promoting my Twitch channel

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.520
on the show last week. I was wondering what your

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:34.520
thoughts were about the issues of Nintendo cloud saves

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:36.520
not working for all games. They're really

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.520
plugging this feature in the build up to the reveal

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:40.520
of their paid online service. But

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.520
just before launch they announced that it won't work

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.520
for some games including arguably their best online

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.520
title Splatoon 2

01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:48.520
There's still no way to back up your saves for

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:50.520
Splatoon 2 and whichever other

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.520
online titles they won't allow cloud saves

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:54.520
for. So if your Switch breaks or

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.520
gets stolen you lose all that data which for me is

01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.520
nearly 99 levels in Splatoon 2

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.520
as well as my gear gold snail

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:02.520
etc.

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.520
They claim to be doing this because people

01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:06.520
could use cloud saves to cheat. For example

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.520
lose a ranked match that you

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.520
that would rank you down. Just reload an old save

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:12.520
from the cloud before that match.

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.520
That type of cheating or save

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.520
scumming did run rampant in Splatoon

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.520
1 but in my opinion isn't really a game

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.520
breaking cheat since it only affects that players

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.520
rank or some minor gear

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.520
update, upgrade rules or whatever else

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.520
save scumming could be used for. Usually pretty

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:28.520
minor stuff. Meanwhile

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.520
cheaters are everywhere in Splatoon 2 because

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:32.520
if you hack your Switch it's very easy

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.520
to tweak anything from your rank to your

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:36.520
weapons abilities to even the maps you

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:38.520
can load onto. So why would cheaters bother

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.520
save scumming when they can already

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.520
cheat in far more effective and game breaking

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:44.520
ways by hacking. And Nintendo

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.520
has no anti-cheat installed to stop these players.

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.520
They only go off reports from other players

01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.520
so a smart cheater would just tweak themselves

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.520
to be powerful enough to

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:54.520
dominate matches but not so much that it raises

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.520
other players suspicions. Ironically

01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:58.520
enough I'm considering hacking my Switch

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.520
since only then would I be able to

01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.520
create a backup save because Nintendo

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.520
won't put a little extra work

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.520
to do what online games like Overwatch

01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:08.520
already do which is just save your account data

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:10.520
on their own server instead of pulling it from

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.520
your console. Anyway

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:14.520
that's my rant on the subject. I'm overall very

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.520
unimpressed with the implementation of

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.520
Nintendo's paid online service

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.520
but that's a whole other topic. Thanks for the

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.520
great show. Can't wait for your move to

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.520
Twitch. Falco Jones. Yeah I just

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.520
you know because I remembered oh yeah I downloaded

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.520
the Nintendo app. Their online

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.520
app. Let's see what I'm paying for here.

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.520
Voice chat. Game specific

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.520
services. Splatoon 2.

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.520
I don't own Splatoon 2.

01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.520
That's no fucking

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.520
use to me.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.520
Some comments in chat over at

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:44.520
live.vognetwork.com. Bobby Blackwolf

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.520
our pal also on the network here says

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.520
they designed their online system terribly

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.520
and are trying to cover it up. They shouldn't

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.520
store your online data on your local system

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.520
they should store it 100% on their servers.

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.520
Exactly. There's a couple people jumping

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.520
in going yes this.

01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.520
And that wouldn't be that hard to fix either

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.520
patch the shit. You can

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.520
patch your games now Nintendo.

01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:06.520
Start storing it on the server

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.520
and then just

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.520
don't store it locally anymore and then you can do

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.520
the backups. This online thing really

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.520
has some of the you know I consider

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520
Falco to have always been somebody who's you know been pretty

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.520
pretty quick to defend Nintendo and appreciate

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.520
Nintendo and you know

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:22.520
it's not just him but I'm picking on him because

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.520
of the email at the moment but I feel like a lot of

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.520
Nintendo fans out there like this online

01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:28.520
thing even the most

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.520
heavy Nintendo fans

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:32.520
are having a hard time like sticking up for it

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.520
and even saying Nintendo has been making some

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.520
pretty shitty decisions with this thing. Like I get

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.520
the fence with them like oh we're not

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.520
paying a lot of money for it.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.520
Oh it's Nintendo and Nintendo makes good games.

01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.520
You know what though? Sony makes good

01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.520
games. Microsoft makes good

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.520
games. Lots of companies make good games.

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.520
Sony and Microsoft as we have seen

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:52.520
and discussed on the show are also not infallible

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.520
to making bad decisions. They're just

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.520
bad decisions of a different sort usually.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.520
It's not usually the online thing that's

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:00.520
well no I take that back because

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.520
it's interesting because Microsoft kind of

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.520
had Microsoft's big screw

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.520
up was really in how they delivered

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.520
the message of their online.

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.520
I think if they had delivered that message in a

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:12.520
different way we'd be looking at a

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.520
completely different like ecosystem of gaming

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:16.520
right now with Xbox One.

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.520
If they had delivered the message in the appropriate way

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.520
and they could have maybe done that by not firing

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.520
their community outreach team but that's another story

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.520
that you know is again part of the problem.

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.520
But if Microsoft

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.520
had maybe delivered that message in a different way

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.520
I mean gaming would be so

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.520
I think different right now and I don't think Microsoft would have been

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.520
the bad guy this last generation as they

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.520
kind of ended up being for a time.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.520
Yeah. It's just

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.520
at this point like

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.520
like how many times are we going to excuse

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.520
them. I'm sorry I'm jumping

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.520
because you don't chat says you mean if they lied. No that's

01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.520
not what I mean. What I said was

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.520
if they delivered the message in a different way

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.520
I'll repeat that for you so you can hear that because I didn't

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.520
mean anything different. Thank you. It's just

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.520
at this point like it's kind of

01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.520
like I get it like oh well we didn't

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.520
expect much from Nintendo but

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.520
why don't we like like look

01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.520
at it look at look at their quality of their games

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:06.520
the effort that they put into the software

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.520
that runs on their stuff but they don't put

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.520
that same quality into

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.520
their networking. I mean like

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.520
that's kind of got to be a scar

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:16.520
on their brand because like Nintendo

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.520
is Nintendo not Nintendo is only

01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:20.520
the games that run on it and only the hardware

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:22.520
but the the networking that's

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.520
absolute shit. Well that's

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.520
not Nintendo. You know bullshit

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:28.520
that's your fucking company. You got

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.520
to you got to put the same effort

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.520
into it. And this is ridiculous to not think

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.520
of designing your games while we're storing

01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.520
all the player data locally.

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:38.520
You don't see anything wrong with

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.520
that. How

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:42.520
long has networking been a thing

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:44.520
like you know that's like basic shit

01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.520
that you know that's not what you're supposed

01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:48.520
to do. You store it in the cloud so

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.520
that they can't be manipulated.

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:52.520
I don't understand how this is

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.520
new information to them. It's like they've never

01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.520
played another console

01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.520
or never experienced

01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:00.520
the world. I mean I don't get it.

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.520
Here's the unfortunate thing that's going to happen.

01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.520
Nintendo is not going to change anything

01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:06.520
why because Nintendo Online is going to

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.520
is going to sell just fine.

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.520
Plenty of people are going to sign up for Nintendo Online

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.520
because they want to play Smash Online

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:14.520
they want to play Splatoon Online they want to play Mario Kart Online

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:16.520
they want to play NES Classics even though

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:18.520
we all know it's not as optimal. And that's fine.

01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:20.520
People are going to pay the money and to be

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.520
to be fair it's cheaper than the others

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.520
so they're going to pay the money to do all that

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.520
online and

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.520
Nintendo is not going to be motivated

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.520
to change it. And then that's fine. And you know

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.520
what it may not be a thing where it

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:34.520
affects them right now. It will

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:36.520
eventually eventually someone they're going to

01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:38.520
hit everybody's breaking point to

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:40.520
where it's just going to they're either going to

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:42.520
fix it and it's going to get better

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:44.520
or they're just going to keep

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.520
doing this shit and eventually it's not going to be acceptable

01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.520
anymore. It's like kind of like with

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.520
new phones that come out where

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.520
they hardly change anything you know

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.520
add a little bit of spit polish

01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.520
to it and then they charge another two hundred dollars

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.520
on top of what they charged for the phone last year.

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:00.520
I mean it's

01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:02.520
eventually some people

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.520
will keep upgrading and stuff like that but

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.520
eventually it's like OK really

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.520
what am I paying for. This isn't that different you know

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.520
it's going to end up like that.

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.520
Well it's like you know this isn't

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:14.520
really acceptable at this time like I can

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:16.520
get much better. Yeah I'm paying a little bit more

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.520
for the service on this

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:20.520
console but I'm getting a lot more

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.520
free games. No. Yeah.

01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.520
Free games and just features

01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.520
like I'm not even taught like free games aside

01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.520
let's just pretend we don't even get those stupid NES

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.520
games. OK. Share play

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:32.520
is I think is a huge thing that yeah

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.520
Sony has no sharing share plays a huge share

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.520
plays a huge thing. People don't talk enough

01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.520
about that. That's a huge deal. But like

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.520
even just like voice chat

01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.520
on the console to be clear. I've said a lot

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:44.520
of negative stuff about Sony tonight with

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.520
the classic and everything but I give

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.520
credit where credit is due like that share play

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.520
is is truly an amazing

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.520
and under talked about feature. It really

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:54.520
does like it allows you to try games

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.520
that you don't fucking own.

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.520
It's pretty great. I mean just

01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.520
just like even

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:02.520
basics left like voice chat

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.520
using the system not a phone

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.520
app. Why the hell do I have to have a phone

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.520
app to voice. That's stupid.

01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:10.520
That's stupid. Any console

01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:12.520
like you don't as Fortnite has demonstrated

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.520
you don't exactly

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.520
why Nintendo on their own

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.520
platform their own product

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.520
like they're supposed to be the best at

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.520
making games like they're just like fantastic

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:24.520
but yet it's

01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:26.520
stupid. It's like who designed

01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:28.520
this shit.

01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:30.520
Like seriously what

01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:32.520
programmer out there said hey

01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:34.520
this is a good fucking idea.

01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:38.520
Who did this.

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.520
I don't get it. It just doesn't

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:44.520
make any sense. But you

01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:46.520
know what. Whatever.

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.520
It's just it's gonna be what it is.

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.520
It's just gonna be the hassle that we're gonna

01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:52.520
have to deal with.

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:54.520
All right.

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:56.520
Bobby Black Wolf in chat

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:58.520
was point out no programmer said that it

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.520
was management. Exactly.

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.520
But who let them say that was a good who

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.520
ran with that idea though. Like

01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.520
someone has to say you know what

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.520
you see in the modern age that

01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:10.520
we're living in that's stupid and no one

01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.520
does it that way.

01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:14.520
And management said I don't

01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:16.520
care that's what we're doing says Bobby.

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:18.520
Well

01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.520
we've we've seen what bad

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:22.520
management can do. But but Nintendo

01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:24.520
like the thing is like it's just

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:26.520
it's just not going to stop because for

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.520
the reasons I pointed out this

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.520
Nintendo online thing is going to do just fine.

01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:32.520
They have to fall from their graces in order

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.520
for this shit to happen. It's

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:36.520
what has to happen is that

01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.520
a kid has to get hurt

01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:40.520
somehow due to this. And I

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:42.520
would never advocate for violence against children.

01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:44.520
That's not what I'm saying. But I'm just saying you'll notice

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.520
Nintendo doesn't do like crazy things and like change

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:48.520
things up until kids could possibly

01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.520
be in danger. Where are my paper cut stories

01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.520
from Labo?

01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:54.520
That's when things

01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:56.520
will change. That's when like

01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.520
they're not just going to change it they'll

01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:00.520
full on delete it like they did with SwapNote

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.520
because kids may be in

01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:04.520
danger. So that's

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:06.520
storing files on the

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:08.520
server. What has to happen is that there has to be

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.520
like threatening messages to children in

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:12.520
those files for that to stop.

01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:14.520
Like we have the friend codes in there.

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.520
I hope you know I'm being ridiculous. Like why we have

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.520
friend codes in there if voice chat's

01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.520
going to be turned off. Oh

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.520
well it could be a rapist that's

01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.520
going to try to you know contact them. Then why

01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:26.520
have the friend codes in the first place if it's not

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.520
going to stop anything. It doesn't

01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:30.520
make it stupid. It's just so

01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:32.520
many levels of stupid. Okay on

01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:34.520
a different note we had a story

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:36.520
that got cut for tonight because in

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.520
my mind it wasn't really a story. It was something you posted.

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.520
It wasn't really a story. It was somebody sharing

01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:42.520
their experiences and they said that they were playing

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:44.520
Mario Kart online

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:46.520
and using the voice chat app when

01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:48.520
you would expect that playing online with

01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:50.520
strangers is going to be a shit house

01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:52.520
as it usually is on Xbox Live

01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:54.520
on PlayStation Network is that you hear

01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:56.520
all sorts of racial slurs

01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:58.520
things against you know

01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:00.520
gay slurs things like that

01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:02.520
is the type of stuff you hear online. But apparently

01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.520
some people's

01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:06.520
experience on Nintendo's online service

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.520
has been very pleasant.

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:10.520
Apparently getting online playing Mario Kart it's like

01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:12.520
oh well you know that's

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:14.520
quite the race wasn't it.

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:16.520
Yeah well

01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:18.520
we're having a jolly time aren't we.

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:20.520
It's like I just

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.520
just have the option where you speak to only

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:24.520
your friends.

01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:26.520
But you have friend codes. Apparently talking

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.520
to strangers on Nintendo online is not all

01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:30.520
bad. Well so is it. You're not there.

01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:32.520
As it is as it is on

01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:34.520
like Xbox and PlayStation

01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.520
it's the same everywhere. There's going to be assholes

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:38.520
everywhere. But there's also

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.520
not everybody is an asshole

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.520
out there like that. That's the thing. Don't just

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.520
assume it's going to be shit. If it was

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:46.520
all shit then they wouldn't offer it as a service.

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:50.520
Dark Sakura have you missed your weekly

01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:52.520
Nintendo rants by Loki.

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:54.520
It's not that Nintendo rants

01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:56.520
stupid if Sony did the same

01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.520
thing I'd be just as mad at them. It's

01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:00.520
dumb. All right

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:02.520
let's move on. Breathe in

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.520
breathe out Loki. We still have some news to cover

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:06.520
before we get to phone calls. Orange launch

01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.520
radio on Skype. I believe we're done with

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:10.520
emails right. That was the last email. Yeah that was it.

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.520
All right. Thank you Flaco for the email.

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.520
Look at what you did. All right. Anyway

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.520
everybody follow Flaco on

01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.520
Twitch especially because I can't broadcast right now.

01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.520
So you should watch Flaco instead. You know

01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:22.520
obviously there's many people I recommend on Twitch.

01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:24.520
What I'd really recommend. Look at our

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:26.520
Discord server if you go to vognetwork.com

01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:28.520
Discord because we have a Twitch channel

01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:30.520
where people alert when they're live. And so

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.520
I would say watch all those people.

01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.520
This is fantastic. All right. Let's get back into

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:36.520
some news before we get to some calls. Orange launch

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:38.520
radio on Skype. Loki. So

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:40.520
this week was the big old

01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:42.520
Red Dead Redemption 2

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:44.520
media blitz where

01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:46.520
they had allowed a lot of the

01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:48.520
different outlets out there

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.520
to check out the game for a few hours.

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:52.520
Also they talked a little bit about Red Dead

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.520
Online which is going to be launching

01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:56.520
after the game launches

01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.520
the following month in November.

01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:00.520
They're going to start a public beta.

01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:02.520
They basically said as with most online experiences

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:04.520
of this size and scale there will inevitably

01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:06.520
be some turbulence at launch.

01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:08.520
So they're hoping

01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:10.520
that with this beta test that they're

01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:12.520
going to help iron those out.

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:14.520
You know

01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:16.520
same with

01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:18.520
I think Grand Theft Auto 5 had a big

01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:20.520
shit show when it came to

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.520
Grand Theft Auto Online. Also

01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:24.520
what we've learned from the experience when launching online

01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:26.520
games at this scale there are bound to be a few

01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:28.520
issues and we want to ensure that we have time

01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:30.520
to gradually roll out the game and make sure

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:32.520
the experience is as smooth as possible for

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:34.520
everyone that we can. And we believe

01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:36.520
this way of rolling out

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:38.520
will give people the best overall experience

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:40.520
both single player and multiplayer.

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:42.520
And from what I hear the game

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.520
the online portion is supposed to be pretty similar to Red Dead

01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:46.520
Redemption

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:48.520
the multiplayer in that game

01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:50.520
which is actually pretty fun. I did play

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:52.520
quite a bit of that. It was one

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:54.520
of the games that did support System

01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:56.520
Link at the time so we ended up

01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:58.520
playing that quite a bit but it was fun

01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:00.520
there's the kind of free roam and do all that.

02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:02.520
I'm

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:04.520
I can't wait to check it out though.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:06.520
It sounds pretty cool.

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:08.520
It looks pretty.

02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:10.520
And because

02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:12.520
of all these media outlets and talking about the

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:14.520
detail because I remember the one thing with Grand Theft Auto 5

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:16.520
was the level of detail and

02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:18.520
the one thing that stood out with me of course

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:20.520
because someone's going to ask that

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:22.520
they asked about the horse testicle

02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:24.520
physics. Oh good god.

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.520
And apparently yes there are

02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:28.520
horse testicle physics and not only

02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:30.520
are there horse testicle physics

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:32.520
but they even went so far as

02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:34.520
when your horse is walking through

02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:36.520
wintery environment the testicles actually

02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:38.520
shrink and expand and compare

02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:40.520
depending on the heat.

02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:42.520
That is some level of detail right there.

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:44.520
I appreciate

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:46.520
attention to detail.

02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:48.520
OK. But I want to know

02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.520
because look here's my

02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:52.520
thing with horses. Whenever you

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:54.520
watch horses like you'll see the horses at

02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.520
Disneyland you'll see the horses in a parade.

02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:58.520
Everybody sees the horses in a parade. You know what

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:00.520
I associate those horses with? The fact

02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:02.520
that right when they get in front of where you're watching they take

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.520
a gigantic fucking dump.

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:06.520
They probably will do that.

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:08.520
Well the horses in Red Dead

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:10.520
Redemption just like is it that thing

02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:12.520
if you go too long without moving the controller

02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:14.520
like you know how like idle animation

02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:16.520
they might tap the screen like you know the whole thing

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.520
does the horse like if you just stand there for too long does the horse

02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:20.520
just take a massive shit on the ground?

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:22.520
I don't know. Because it's bored.

02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:24.520
But it just

02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:26.520
that I can only imagine the level

02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:28.520
of detail in the game is going to be incredible

02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:30.520
just because in Grand Theft Auto 5

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:32.520
is incredible and it's been so many years after that

02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.520
so I

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.520
can't wait. Bobby Blackwolf

02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:38.520
in chat says imagine marching behind them in a band.

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:40.520
I have. I was a marching band in high school

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.520
and they used to tell us like well if

02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:44.520
that happens you just got to march right through

02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:46.520
it and no we marched around

02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:48.520
it. No. Sorry.

02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:50.520
Like you know oh the team's going to lose points.

02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:52.520
I'm not going to step in that. No I won't be

02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:54.520
doing that today. Let's see.

02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:56.520
And Brad from Pod Culture confirms

02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:58.520
there is horse crapping in Red Dead Redemption 2.

02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:00.520
Oh. Oh happy day.

02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:02.520
Hooray.

02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:04.520
It's so realistic.

02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:06.520
Mmhmm.

02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:08.520
I just. I'm just

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:10.520
waiting for somebody to ask. I'm watching

02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:12.520
chat like a hawk. I'm waiting for somebody

02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:14.520
to ask.

02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:16.520
Can you

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.520
fuck the horse?

02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:20.520
Can you

02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:22.520
Can you

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.520
be a horse fucker?

02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.520
No.

02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:28.520
Can you eat the horse?

02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:30.520
Apparently horse is supposed to be

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.520
pretty delicious.

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:34.520
Alright moving on.

02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.520
Hey let's talk.

02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:38.520
Dartitsia said they'll probably be a PC mod for that.

02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.520
You're right. No it'll never come out on PC

02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:42.520
apparently they said. So it's never

02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.520
come out. Sure. Red Dead Redemption 1 never

02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:46.520
came out on PC. Oh I guess that's

02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:48.520
true. So they said it's never coming out on

02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:50.520
PC. Alright.

02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.520
Anyhow let's talk about something that will be

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.520
coming out on PC and something very different from

02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.520
horse shitting and fucking dicks.

02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.520
There is no

02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.520
way that you can make pinball

02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.520
nasty. That's right pinball

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:04.520
is a wholesome family fucking. Until now with

02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:06.520
horse fucker the table.

02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:08.520
There have been some adult themed

02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.520
pinball tables. Alright alright. Let's go

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.520
from one balls to another.

02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:14.520
Talking about pinball. We've

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.520
talked in the past few weeks on the show about how

02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:18.520
Zen Studios got the

02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:20.520
Williams table. That should have been one of the

02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.520
stories I put in the poll to ask you about

02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:24.520
Dartitsia. But Zen Studios is getting that

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.520
license from pinball

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.520
excuse me from

02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:30.520
Farsight excuse me who had the

02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.520
Williams

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:34.520
and Bally license before.

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:36.520
We know Zen Studios got that.

02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:38.520
And they've been testing. I actually

02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:40.520
did the beta test in

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.520
Steam. You can turn it on and you can play

02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:44.520
a demo

02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:46.520
demo table and they're gonna make this table

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:48.520
free for everybody. The

02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:50.520
Fish Tales is the table that

02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:52.520
will be like the free for

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:54.520
everybody to get you to download the game and

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.520
check it out. And then if you wanna get

02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:58.520
more tables you'll be able to get

02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:00.520
the very first pack volume 1

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:02.520
on October 9th will

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.520
include Medieval Madness

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:06.520
Junkyard and the Getaway

02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:08.520
High Speed 2. It will set you back

02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.520
9.99. That's 9.99

02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:12.520
US dollars. 9.99

02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:14.520
euros. It will

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:16.520
be free. Fish Tales

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:18.520
will be free and the other games will

02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:20.520
cost you. It's going to be out on Nintendo Switch,

02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:22.520
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows 10

02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.520
Steam and Zen Pinball

02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:26.520
2 on the Mac.

02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:28.520
So even though Pinball FX3 never came out on

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.520
the Mac, Zen Pinball 2 on the

02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:32.520
Mac will support these. That's kinda interesting how they

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:34.520
did that. So there you go.

02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.520
I don't know if any of you are gonna

02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:38.520
check that out. I

02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:40.520
you know those tables are okay. I mean

02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:42.520
Medieval Madness is kind of a classic. I'm not a fan. I've got

02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:44.520
Medieval Madness in my house. I know.

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:46.520
You're not a fan of the emulated because you're so

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:48.520
attached to the real thing. Yeah.

02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:50.520
But Fish Tales also isn't very fun to me.

02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:52.520
For those of us that can't afford the real thing though.

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:54.520
This is

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.520
an okay substitute. But I really

02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:58.520
Pinball is the one I really want. That's my favorite.

02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:00.520
You may be selling Getaway.

02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:02.520
Oh really? Wow.

02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:04.520
If you're interested. Nah, I don't know.

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.520
This house has enough shit in it.

02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:08.520
I'll say if I can get rid of three Pinball

02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.520
machine size things worth of shit then

02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:12.520
I'll allow a Pinball machine in here.

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:14.520
We'll see.

02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:16.520
Alright. Let's move on.

02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.520
Darcyra. Well

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:20.520
there is a new cause

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:22.520
of divorce in this

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.520
country and it's called Fortnite.

02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:26.520
More than 200

02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.520
UK couples filed for divorce

02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.520
in 2018.

02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:32.520
And they cited addiction to Fortnite

02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:34.520
as their reason for divorce.

02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:36.520
If that's all it took to cause

02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:38.520
a divorce then somebody in that family

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.520
was boring the shit out of the other

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.520
person in that family.

02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:44.520
But that's

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:46.520
actually about 5% of

02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:48.520
the 4,665

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:50.520
petitions that

02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:52.520
Divorce Online has

02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.520
handled. It's actually

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.520
a UK company that offers divorce

02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:58.520
services.

02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:00.520
And that seems to be the

02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:02.520
biggest one that came up.

02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:04.520
And this is also

02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:06.520
going hand in hand with the World Health Organization

02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:08.520
saying compulsive video game playing now

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:10.520
constitutes a mental

02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:12.520
health condition.

02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:14.520
Um.

02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:16.520
Yeah.

02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:18.520
I don't know. I mean

02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:20.520
if you want to pick an excuse I guess

02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:22.520
that's as good as any. You could just say

02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:24.520
we don't do anything

02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:26.520
together. We don't communicate. We don't

02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:28.520
leave the house.

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:30.520
So. That's kind of what Kaijuto is

02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:32.520
referencing in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.520
says I'm sure they had problems

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.520
before Fortnite.

02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.520
So maybe Fortnite is just kind of like the

02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:40.520
objectification

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.520
of all those things into one

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:44.520
sort of tangible thing.

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.520
I don't know. Fifth Dream in chat says

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:48.520
I'd divorce anyone who likes Fortnite too.

02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:50.520
Now now Fifth Dream. It's a very very

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.520
popular game. There's many people to play it.

02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:54.520
Alright.

02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:56.520
Well it's

02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:58.520
always interesting when video games

02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.520
get into other parts

02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:02.520
of life like that. So.

02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:04.520
I wonder what we'll be seeing on the divorce

02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:06.520
court. The TV show

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:08.520
Divorce of My Man because he plays too much

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:10.520
Fortnite. S.S.J. remembers

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:12.520
S2100 Matt in our chat says

02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:14.520
remember when World of Warcraft was the cause

02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:16.520
of divorces back in the day.

02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:18.520
Remember the good old days Dark Sakura when it was

02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:20.520
my husband.

02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:22.520
My husband plays a horde

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.520
and I just can't marry a man because I'm

02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:26.520
I'm an alliance character.

02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:28.520
They had like wow widows.

02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:30.520
Oh yeah. That's what Victoria always

02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:32.520
claimed to be herself was a wow widow.

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:34.520
When she had dated

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:36.520
that guy who was too busy as she

02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:38.520
said storming the castle. That's what she called

02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:40.520
raiding. He was too busy to go out because he was always

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:42.520
storming the castle with his friends. I just think of

02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:44.520
the princess bride like that. Me too

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:46.520
but that's kind of what it is. Bye bye boys.

02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:48.520
Have fun storming the castle.

02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.520
That's what raiding is. You're storming the castle

02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:52.520
with your friends. Alright

02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:54.520
anyway. Let's move on. A few more

02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:56.520
stories for you guys before the Skype line.

02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:58.520
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype.

02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:00.520
Loki pretty big story here towards the end.

02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:02.520
Yes so we kind of

02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:04.520
alluded to it a couple weeks ago

02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:06.520
talking about that there was a rumor that you're

02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:08.520
going to be able to start downloading titles

02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.520
as part of PlayStation Now which has always

02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:12.520
been my gripe because PlayStation Now I think

02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:14.520
is a terrible service

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.520
as far as having to stream all the time

02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:18.520
and I wish they would let you download it like

02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:20.520
you know you can with games pass

02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.520
but now apparently you can with

02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:24.520
most of the titles on there

02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.520
and they're going to be starting I guess with

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:28.520
almost all of the PlayStation 4 games

02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:30.520
in the service including Bloodborne,

02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:32.520
God of War 3 remastered, NBA 2K16

02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:34.520
and Until Dawn will be available for

02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:36.520
download in addition

02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.520
to the PlayStation Now lineup

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:40.520
of classic PlayStation 2 games

02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:42.520
that they remastered for PlayStation 4

02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:44.520
and then they said they've

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.520
they'll be rolling out that feature to

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:48.520
PlayStation Now subscribers over the next few days

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.520
so if you don't see it

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:52.520
just check back later.

02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:54.520
A lot of people very happy about this change

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.520
that Sony was kind of pressured to do so

02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.520
in response to Microsoft's system allowing you to

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:00.520
do this. Yeah and

02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:02.520
like you know you still have to phone in

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.520
every once in a while to you know so you can't

02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:06.520
play offline for a long time but it's

02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:08.520
still nice to have

02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:10.520
that option. Still don't want to

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:12.520
play the service though because

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:14.520
a lot of the games that are in there I already

02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:16.520
own and

02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:18.520
yeah. Fifth Dream says

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.520
and they will take advantage of PS4 Pro

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:22.520
hardware. That's good.

02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:24.520
Is PS4 Pro

02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:26.520
kind of the default now? Do you still get

02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:28.520
regular PlayStations that aren't Pro anymore?

02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:30.520
I guess you probably still do. Yeah they do.

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:32.520
I would imagine at some point PlayStation 4 Pro

02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:34.520
would just be the default. Someday

02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:36.520
but it has to come down in price

02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:38.520
I think. Yeah that's true. And

02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:40.520
they still do that with the Xbox too. The Xbox

02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:42.520
One and S and X.

02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:44.520
Alright

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.520
well finally here tonight before we

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.520
go to our Skype line at Orange Launch Radio

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.520
all one word on Skype although I'll ask if there's any

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:52.520
last minute stories as well. We do have a couple

02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:54.520
stories here about game companies who have

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.520
helped to fulfill some final wishes

02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:58.520
of younger folks

02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:00.520
that are suffering with

02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:02.520
some different diseases and it's kind of one of those things

02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:04.520
where it's like ah man these are real like

02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:06.520
you know just bad situations

02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:08.520
and unfortunate but it's really cool

02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:10.520
that these gaming companies are helping

02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:12.520
these gaming fans

02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.520
in their last days to be able to

02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:16.520
play the games that they really want to play.

02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.520
The first story I have here has to do with Bethesda

02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.520
who showed up when

02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.520
a 12 year old boy who had a rare form

02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:24.520
of cancer wanted to play Fallout

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:26.520
76. The kid was from

02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:28.520
Hampton Roads, Virginia. He was battling

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:30.520
stage 4 neuroblastoma

02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:32.520
for half his life. He was diagnosed at 5 years old.

02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.520
Doctors have

02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.520
stopped his treatment but

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:38.520
then he realized he probably would not get to play Fallout

02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:40.520
76 which is due in November.

02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.520
And I realize you could probably say some

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:44.520
stuff here because I think Fallout is an M rated

02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:46.520
series and he's a 12 year old kid but you know

02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:48.520
what? That

02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:50.520
that's the family's decision to make not yours.

02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:52.520
So he wanted to play Fallout 76

02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:54.520
and apparently

02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:56.520
the assistant director at Bethesda actually

02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:58.520
drove 4 hours from the company's

02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:00.520
headquarters in Maryland to the family

02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:02.520
home with a copy of the game and

02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:04.520
a prototype of the power

02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:06.520
armor helmet that's going to come with that

02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:08.520
super special edition of the game

02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:10.520
signed by the chief of Bethesda

02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:12.520
game studios Todd Howard.

02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:14.520
So unfortunately he didn't get to keep

02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:16.520
the game because it's just too early

02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:18.520
and to be fair in

02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:20.520
these situations if it is

02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:22.520
out there in the media that somebody has

02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:24.520
something super special like this it makes

02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:26.520
you a target for thieves

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:28.520
and so it's not that Bethesda's trying to

02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.520
be dicks by just not letting the kid keep

02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:32.520
the game but it's actually risky

02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:34.520
to let him keep it if you really

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:36.520
kind of critically think about it. It's

02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:38.520
it's an unfortunate thing but that's

02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:40.520
what it is.

02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:42.520
So anyway even though he didn't get to keep

02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.520
the game still the hours of playtime

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:46.520
made him happy and they were all very

02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:48.520
very very happy to

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:50.520
make the wish come true and all that stuff and

02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:52.520
the kid got to play the game so

02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.520
that's really cool. There is a GoFundMe out there

02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.520
for Wes trying to raise money to pay

02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:58.520
living expenses and trying to get the

02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:00.520
doctors in New York City and all this.

02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:02.520
So our thoughts with

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:04.520
him and

02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:06.520
kind of a similar story here. This time

02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:08.520
Nintendo allowing a fan

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:10.520
to play Super Smash Brothers

02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.520
Ultimate. This guy is a little

02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:14.520
older. He's in his early 20s so he's

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:16.520
not a kid per se but he's got his own

02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:18.520
Twitter account and everything. Chris Taylor

02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:20.520
a big fan of Smash Brothers and he

02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:22.520
also kind of you know he's battling

02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:24.520
cancer as well and even though

02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:26.520
he's beat cancer twice before he's being

02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:28.520
told that it's terminal and he recently wanted

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:30.520
recently made the tough decision

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:32.520
to stop treatment for that

02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:34.520
but kind of realized that oh I

02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:36.520
I may not get to play Super Smash

02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:38.520
Brothers Ultimate. So there was a

02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:40.520
big you know push online like

02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:42.520
gaming subreddits and you know people

02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:44.520
trying to amplify this his wish

02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:46.520
to be able to play this and

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:48.520
what happened? Nintendo flew

02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:50.520
out an E3 demo of the

02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:52.520
game to him

02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:54.520
earlier this week and

02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:56.520
he got to play the game for three hours. They

02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:58.520
took some pictures and you can see some of

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:00.520
this on Twitter on his

02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:02.520
Twitter. He's a spooky wubler on Twitter

02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:04.520
and you can see some of the pictures and

02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:06.520
you know again some people are like well why didn't they

02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:08.520
why did he only get to play the E3 demo?

02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:10.520
Why didn't he get to play the full game? Game's not done

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.520
yet. Well yeah for one the game's not

02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.520
done yet for two

02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:16.520
you know again same things I mentioned before is

02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.520
that when those types of things are in the hands

02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.520
you know and people know about it because

02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:22.520
of social media in fact

02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:24.520
he couldn't announce that this was happening

02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:26.520
until they already left

02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:28.520
and again it's because you

02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:30.520
know it would make you potentially a

02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:32.520
target for thievery and all this other stuff

02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:34.520
which really it's unfortunate but anyway

02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:36.520
very cool that these gaming companies

02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:38.520
are helping to make some

02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:40.520
wishes come true and lots of

02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:42.520
people in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:44.520
giving a hearty

02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:46.520
hashtag fuck cancer in our chat

02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:48.520
and I agree but

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:50.520
I'm you know despite

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.520
the situation

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:54.520
I'm glad these gaming companies are

02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:56.520
able to you know

02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:58.520
help these folks out and let them play

02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:00.520
what they want to play. Okay

02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.520
let's on a different note head over to our

02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.520

Loki do we have any last minute stories you want to get

02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:24.520
into?

02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:26.520
No. No?

02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.520
Yeah. Alright

02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:30.520
not a lot going on

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:32.520
well dark sakura when do we get to see you

02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:34.520
here again are you going to be here the last weekend of october

02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:36.520
I'm going to try

02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:38.520
yeah how are things going with

02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:40.520
you know we didn't get asked

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:42.520
to ask a lot about this but I know sundays are also

02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:44.520
a big thing for your sisters

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.520
our general meeting is every

02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:48.520
fourth sunday

02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:50.520
so I was up

02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:52.520
way early this morning to go to the

02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:54.520
sisters meeting had to leave that

02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:56.520
fifteen minutes early to get

02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:58.520
to work where

02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:00.520
my

02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:02.520
provisioning at my job had been

02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:04.520
messed up so I didn't take any

02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:06.520
calls today I did nothing but training

02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.520
I was bored then I

02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:10.520
left and now you're here

02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:12.520
yes so you had a very busy day

02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:14.520
hopefully I'll be able to make

02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:16.520
I'll be able to perfect my pumpkin

02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:18.520
bread not like a sweet bread

02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:20.520
I'm planning on making a savory pumpkin

02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:22.520
and that'll be the time where nobody can bitch about

02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.520
the pumpkin stuff too because that'll be right around

02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:26.520
Halloween when you're here next that'll be Halloween

02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:28.520
weekend right October 28th will be that show

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.520
I think well I like savory

02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:32.520
gourd stuff you know

02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:34.520
like pumpkins and butternut squashes and stuff

02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:36.520
like that I like it savory and buttery

02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:38.520
and I've got my bread recipe

02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:40.520
down like I can't bake cookies

02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.520
and all that for shit but I can bake

02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:44.520
bread some of the savory pumpkin

02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:46.520
stuff's really good like we get this pumpkin

02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:48.520
ravioli this time of year at Trader Joe's

02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:50.520
it's really good so I think what I

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.520
do is just get like the pumpkin pulp

02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:54.520
and spiral it in

02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.520
in my dough and then

02:15:56.520 --> 02:15:58.520
just let it bake from inside the dough

02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:00.520
I think that would be good

02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:02.520
and then just make it buttery and savory

02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:04.520
again the Skype line is open hopefully somebody

02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:06.520
will call but if not then not

02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:08.520
Orange Tons Radio all one word on

02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:10.520
Skype if you want to get through on the Skype line tonight

02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:12.520
I'm not that intimidating boys

02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:14.520
I will not be doing a live feed after the show tonight

02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:16.520
because again I'm still limited with my

02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:18.520
upload I do hope to get that fixed

02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:20.520
I have my gears turning in my

02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:22.520
head about some projects that I

02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:24.520
might work on so stay tuned to my Twitch channel

02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:26.520
at Rob Roberts I may

02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:28.520
try some experiments with video

02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:30.520
premieres this week and see what you guys like

02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:32.520
what gets attention and what nobody

02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:34.520
seems to care about also apparently today

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:36.520
is the 129th

02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:38.520
anniversary of Nintendo

02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:40.520
oh right because they started as a playing card

02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:42.520
company way way way back in the day they were not always

02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:44.520
about what's that

02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:46.520
oh right the specific type

02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:48.520
of not like Jack of Clubs

02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:50.520
King of Hearts those type of playing

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:52.520
cards but a very specific type of

02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:54.520
card so Nintendo was not

02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:56.520
always about electronics that's just kind of

02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:58.520
what it turned into and what they're most known

02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:00.520
for now we do have a call coming in

02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:02.520
let's get to it hi you're on Orange Tons Radio who's

02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:04.520
this hey this is Akdeft

02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:06.520
hey Akdeft it's good to hear from you buddy

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:08.520
what's up

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:10.520
well I do want to talk about

02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:12.520
the PlayStation Classic

02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:14.520
okay what are your thoughts on it

02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:16.520
it's kind of stupid

02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:18.520
why you say that

02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:20.520
you know there's a lot of people that would be very excited

02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:22.520
about this why do you say it's crap

02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:24.520
well

02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:26.520
mostly I thought it was a good

02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:28.520
idea it is

02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:30.520
a good idea but

02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:32.520
at the same time Sony's doing

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:34.520
a lot of stuff that

02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:36.520
makes my head baffle like

02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:38.520
like really aside

02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:40.520
the fact it

02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:42.520
doesn't have like an AC adapter

02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:44.520
because yeah it's

02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:46.520
probably it's gonna be like a

02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:48.520
phone adapter and mostly like

02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:50.520
the SNES or

02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:52.520
NES Mini

02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:54.520
but the fact that the controllers

02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:56.520
aren't DualShock it's like

02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:58.520
one of the first things that

02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:00.520
I really don't know what

02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:02.520
Sony is thinking

02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:06.520
is it like

02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:08.520
the game selection or is it just the price

02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:10.520
what is it that's like turning you off

02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:12.520
to this

02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:14.520
so again the first thing is

02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:16.520
the controllers like

02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:18.520
they should be DualShocks

02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.520
like really I don't know why

02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:22.520
Sony is making those

02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:24.520
yeah I don't disagree with that

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:26.520
that's for sure I sure don't disagree with that

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:28.520
but yeah the price point

02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:30.520
I would agree with it

02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:32.520
if it had like at least

02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:34.520
five more games

02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:36.520
if it had a DualShock if it had the AC

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:38.520
adapter

02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:40.520
but I really don't know

02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:42.520
in the game selection

02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:44.520
for 20 games for a classic

02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:46.520
system like this

02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:48.520
seems like really

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:50.520
really low and I understand

02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:52.520
that the SNES

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:54.520
Mini also has only

02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:56.520
20 or 21 games

02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:58.520
but those are all

02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:00.520
classics like in this case

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.520
of the five they have announced

02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:04.520
only

02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:06.520
like well a side

02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:08.520
Final Fantasy and maybe

02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:10.520
Tekken 3

02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:12.520
the other the rest aren't

02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:14.520
that like

02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:16.520
popular even something

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:18.520
like Ridge Racer

02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:20.520
I don't think many people are

02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:22.520
excited about it and something like

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:24.520
Jumping Flash that personally I

02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:26.520
like it isn't

02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:28.520
that great of a game and not many

02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.520
people like even like it so

02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:32.520
I really don't know

02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:34.520
what Sony is thinking about this

02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:36.520
console or what's the idea

02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:38.520
Well they're thinking

02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:40.520
how can we make money? How did our

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:42.520
competition make money? Oh we can do that

02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:44.520
so I just

02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:46.520
I still sort of think that they could have

02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:48.520
you know really shown the value

02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:50.520
of making people

02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:52.520
or enticing people to buy a PlayStation

02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:54.520
4 because oh you already

02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:56.520
have this old library of games that will

02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:58.520
automatically work on this new system

02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:00.520
so feel free to get rid of your old

02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:02.520
system by buying this new system that will play

02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:04.520
all of your old games and I get

02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:06.520
like again I get that the chipset

02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:08.520
changes and those changes that happen

02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:10.520
within the system especially make this very

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:12.520
hard with the PlayStation 3

02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:14.520
although I still think they could have got around it with

02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:16.520
PlayStation now but whatever

02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:18.520
they didn't want to allocate that type of server

02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:20.520
bandwidth and all that stuff but you know

02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:22.520
at least the PlayStation 1 and 2 stuff you

02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:24.520
would think would still be able to work but

02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:26.520
Sony just doesn't see the value

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.520
in that and so this is

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.520
what they're deciding to do instead so

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:32.520
it is what it is so you have to

02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:34.520
make a choice if you want to support it

02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:36.520
and to be fair

02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:38.520
you know it is a cute little thing

02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:40.520
just like the little NES classic

02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:42.520
NES it's cute it's something

02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.520
that I like for the look of it and not just

02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:46.520
what's inside of it but I do have to

02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:48.520
admit in retrospect you know now

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:50.520
that I've played the Switch Online one it's like

02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:52.520
eh was it $60

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.520
cute I don't know so I think

02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:56.520
I think in some ways some of that is almost making me

02:20:56.520 --> 02:20:58.520
hesitate when it comes to wanting

02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:00.520
to get like a classic Sony system

02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:02.520
I don't know

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:04.520
and that's the thing

02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:06.520
like I really like want

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.520
to get this

02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:10.520
because again it sounds like a great idea

02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:12.520
it's I wouldn't mind

02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:14.520
a classic Sony

02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:16.520
console and just

02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:18.520
plug and play like the SNES

02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:20.520
and the NES Mini

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:22.520
but again

02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:24.520
there are many things that

02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:26.520
I don't know what Sony is thinking about

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:28.520
that really

02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:30.520
I have one pre-ordered

02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:32.520
on Amazon but I'm probably

02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:34.520
gonna cancel it the only thing

02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:36.520
and many people probably

02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:38.520
are gonna yell at me because of this

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:40.520
is that probably

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:42.520
those consoles are

02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:44.520
Playstation TV or Vita TVs

02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:46.520
that they didn't

02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:48.520
sell so it's probably

02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:50.520
gonna be hackable like really

02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:52.520
easily hackable

02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:54.520
and you're probably

02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:56.520
gonna insert

02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:58.520
many like roms or homebrew

02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:00.520
and so that's

02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:02.520
the only appeal I see right now

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:04.520
for the console unless it has like

02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:06.520
a really

02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.520
cool game that hasn't

02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:10.520
gotten a real release like

02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:12.520
I was talking in chat earlier like

02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:14.520
InHander it hasn't

02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:16.520
gotten a real release ever

02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:18.520
so like oh the console

02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:20.520
has it okay I'm gonna get it

02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:22.520
but aside from that I really

02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:24.520
don't know why I would

02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:26.520
buy one of these you know you

02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:28.520
kind of reference something there I think is a huge

02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:30.520
missed opportunity from Sony like if you're

02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:32.520
gonna charge a hundred bucks for one of these and get

02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:34.520
them in people's homes why not

02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:36.520
make them capable of doing

02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:38.520
the Vita TV stuff like a Playstation

02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:40.520
or the Playstation Now thing

02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:42.520
or a lot of that similar functionality

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:44.520
the Playstation TV which if I

02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:46.520
recall correctly also cost a hundred bucks right

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:48.520
so yeah the Playstation

02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:50.520
TVs nowadays are so cheap

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:52.520
well that's right so the technology the price

02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:54.520
of those things should have come way down in technology

02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:56.520
I can't imagine that you wouldn't

02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:58.520
be able to get a Playstation emulator

02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:00.520
on one of those Playstation Vita things

02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:02.520
and play you know the PS1

02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:04.520
classics and charge you a hundred bucks for that

02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:06.520
you don't even need to get a Playstation 1 emulator they

02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:08.520
have Playstation 1 natively

02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:10.520
so why not sweeten the pot

02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:12.520
and don't just make it about being able to play 20

02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:14.520
Playstation classics but holy

02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:16.520
shit this thing will play newer stuff too

02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:18.520
and then maybe Sony wouldn't have had to

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:20.520
been so quick to abandon the Vita

02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:22.520
but I just they weren't thinking far enough ahead I guess

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:24.520
I think it's more about wanting to

02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:26.520
just you know strike while the iron

02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:28.520
is hot so to speak on these classics

02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:30.520
and as soon as Nintendo had their runaway

02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:32.520
success a couple years ago the

02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:34.520
gears were probably turning on this

02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:36.520
well it's

02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:38.520
a little too late for

02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:40.520
that I think but it will still

02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:42.520
sell people will

02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:44.520
buy it at least but

02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:46.520
I don't know if

02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:48.520
Sony is gonna like

02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:50.520
see like a really really

02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:52.520
great success from this I

02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:54.520
really don't but

02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:56.520
I don't know hopefully they

02:23:56.520 --> 02:23:58.520
they change some of this

02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:00.520
or again if

02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:02.520
it's hackable I think that

02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:04.520
that's gonna be the appeal for this because

02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:06.520
for at least for my part

02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:08.520
it's like no

02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:10.520
no Sony

02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:12.520
alright my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can

02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:14.520
see if anybody else wants to call but thanks for your

02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:16.520
thoughts

02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:18.520
alright bye bye

02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:48.520
they've got the whole lineup

02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:50.520
too there's like a musical lineup

02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:52.520
and everything while DJ's playing stuff so

02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:54.520
check it out if you got some time

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:56.520
um

02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:58.520
you know there's a Minecraft convention

02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:00.520
going on this weekend I don't know if that's just here locally

02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:02.520
it's just here locally MineCon

02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:04.520
Earth is next week

02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:06.520
um yeah the local one here

02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:08.520
I see a lot of tweets about

02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:10.520
it it's so expensive and it's just like

02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:12.520
what is it really there they have like

02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:14.520
some streamers that are there they do

02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:16.520
like a Lego thing they do like some other Minecraft

02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:18.520
stuff but it's like it's so god

02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:20.520
damn it it's like 40 bucks a ticket

02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:22.520
oh yeah that's a little pricey

02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:24.520
MineCon world is next week and it's online

02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:26.520
it's streaming so

02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:28.520
interesting okay

02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:30.520

02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:34.520

02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:58.520

what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio please tell

a friend or two about the show help us spread the word

02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:06.520
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but

02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:08.520
if the voices aren't here to air live

02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:10.520
then we can't

02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:12.520

02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:16.520
of grievances last week or the week before on the

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.520
show I just seem to remember why YR sent us an

02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:20.520
email outlining all these things we got wrong

02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:22.520

02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:54.520
at a weird time so alright

02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:56.520

02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:06.520
I'm just happy I had filet mignon for

02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:08.520
dinner tonight cause it was

02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:10.520
fucking amazing and

02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:12.520
thank you again Ikuma JP

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:14.520
for also helping with obtaining

02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:16.520
Dan's birthday present so

02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:18.520
which I will not announce on air

02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:20.520
yet I will also use my

02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:22.520
final thought to pay tribute to Ikuma JP

02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:24.520
this is very thoughtful what you did in sending

02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.520
us the gifts I'm always tickled

02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:28.520
when OLR people send us gifts

02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:30.520
and it's not something you have to

02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:32.520
do and it's very nice

02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:34.520
but these are things that I would

02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:36.520
these little wafer things what are these called

02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:38.520
these are really good the wafer

02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:40.520
those are pretty good

02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:42.520
alright Loki your final thought tonight

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:44.520
my final thought

02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:46.520
is

02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:48.520
I don't know hopefully we'll play more games this week

02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:50.520
yes play more games that's a good idea

02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:52.520
everybody out there play more games

02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:54.520
